1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,515
All right, Cadets, listen up.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,468
What I am cradling
lovingly in my arms

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,807
is an M203 40-millimeter
canister launcher.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,392
What's it for?

5
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,353
- Cadet Williams.
- Tear gas.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,022
That's right. That...

7
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:21,385
is a meth lab,
our boys took it three days ago.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,360
- How do you think they did that?
- Tear gas.

9
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:24,486
Wrong!

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,151
And that is why we are here.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,444
I'm gonna demonstrate for you
why we don't

12
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:34,622
fire tear gas into a meth lab.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,266
We're gonna need a...
a fire extinguisher.

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,337
Then... maybe some sort of

15
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:07,723
trauma counselor.

16
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,869
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,870
Well, according to Sweets, chronic
lateness is a way of asserting control.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,958
- That's right.
- So, you believe that?

19
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,712
No, I figured there was traffic
or something kept you at work.

20
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,629
Exactly: work... work, Bones.

21
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:27,879
Okay, I was putting
the final touches on a case

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,145
that's about to propel me
into FBI legendary status.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,817
Ah, the big RICO case that...

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,425
I'm not supposed
to know anything about.

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,975
- Why don't I know about this case?
- Bones, it's top secret.

26
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,555
But you told Dr. Brennan.

27
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:42,907
She's my partner, OK?

28
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:45,483
Indictments any minute,
followed by a pay raise,

29
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:48,737
possible parade and most
definitely my face on a coin.

30
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:52,555
- Just in time for your birthday.
- Which I will be spending in...

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,412
Hawaii. Look at that.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,913
- Shark adventures.
- Sharks.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,855
Oh, I really wish that
you wouldn't... answer your phone.

34
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,295
Jared? Oh, God, give me that.

35
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:07,505
- That's his brother.
- Booth has a brother?

36
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,423
Sounds good. I'll see you then.

37
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,419
Don't feel bad.
I've never met him, either.

38
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:12,969
At least you knew he existed.

39
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,340
Okay, that's enough for today,

40
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:20,852
because obviously you have to go
look at some horribly dismembered...

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,480
human remains.

42
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,573
Any idea how the body got in there?

43
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,159
I guess anyone could have done
it anytime in the last three days.

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,536
Male, 45 to 50 years old.

45
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,280
Where the rest of the remains are?

46
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:43,500
One leg is over there, the other's
over there, and the arm is over there.

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,002
- Did I kill this man?
- No.

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,256
Okay.

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,007
This man was shot in the chest.

50
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,177
Would you be at all upset
if I had a little cry?

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,094
Yeah, take your time.

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,307
What's that there on
the inside of his pocket?

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,032
This man was obviously some kind of

54
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,193
technical designer or engineer.

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,071
Squint? One of your own.

60
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,011
So,these are from the notebook
found in our victim's windbreaker?

61
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,743
Blueprints, schematics, sketches.

62
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,117
Automatic toilet scrubber.

63
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,625
It's like those little vacuum
cleaners that move around on their own.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,387
Things in a toilet bowl
should not move.

65
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:10,830
Look at this. This is a...

66
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,280
a snow shovel with an
attached heating device.

67
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,087
Our victim was an inventor.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,095
Clark, hey.

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,925
Oh, God,here we go.

70
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,557
Really, you came back?

71
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,740
You said you didn't want
to work with us anymore.

72
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,245
No, I said my preferred working
style tends towards the professional.

73
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,600
See my tie?

74
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,024
That's an indicator.

75
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,833
So why'd you come back then?

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,206
Because this is the finest
forensics facility in the world.

77
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,298
You want to fight MiGs,
you fly MiG Alley, right?

78
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,599
A Korean War reference?

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,969
You do know that we have
a brand-new war, right?

80
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,825
It's... been in the news.

81
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,955
Hey, I got a form letter
here from the patent office.

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,975
Good work.

83
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,130
Aren't you the least bit curious about
Hodgins and I are back together or not?

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,918
And... not work.

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,321
Am I the only one that can
tell the difference here?

86
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:02,521
- Is there a name on that letter?
- No.

87
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,892
There's a patent application number.
We can find out who filed it.

88
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,160
Coleoptera just started feeding
on the Diptera larva,

89
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,555
meaning our victim died
about three days ago.

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,821
Thank you.

91
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,514
Aren't you impressed that Angela and
I can still work together so well?

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,287
There's no obvious exit wound.

93
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:29,405
That suggests a.22- or.25-caliber.

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,729
I'll keep my eyes open.

95
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:34,873
Multiple points of possible antemortem
in-bending with concomitant fracture.

96
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:40,592
These abrasions are patterned.

97
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,472
Repeated blows with
a perforated surface?

98
00:05:45,298 --> 00:05:46,159
Camille?

99
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,226
Jarhead.

100
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,505
It's really you.

101
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,105
Jarheads are Marines. I'm a
lieutenant commander in the Navy.

102
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,693
Not an acceptable mistake.

103
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:57,986
He's getting so big.

104
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,447
Soon he'll be wanting a later
curfew and a car of his own.

105
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,731
Jared, this here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

106
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,410
That back there is a squint.

107
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,995
This is my little brother.

108
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,807
- Bones.
- Dr. Brennan.

109
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:11,124
Oh, it is nice to meet you, Jarhead.

110
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:13,251
I can see the family resemblance.

111
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,744
Your facial structure is

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,508
even more symmetrical than Booth's.

113
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:21,740
- Is she coming on to me?
- No, that's just the way she talks.

114
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:22,969
Right.

115
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,429
So, the Pentagon?

116
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,882
You're looking at the new head
of Strategic Plans and Policy.

117
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,755
Basically, he runs the place.

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,352
So, Cam, Jared has a
favor he'd like to ask.

119
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,604
- I can ask my own favors, Seeley.
- Okay, go ahead.

120
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,796
There's a cocktail party tonight.

121
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,278
I'm in need of a beautiful woman on
my arm, preferably a very smart one.

122
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,697
- I'm quite intelligent.
- No.

123
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:45,815
Not that you're not intelligent.
I mean, you are intelligent.

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,160
I would be delighted.

125
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,579
I got a hit
on the patent application.

126
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,669
It was filed by somebody
named Paul Stegman.

127
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,686
I've got an address there...

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,131
There's more than one Booth?

129
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,922
I'm Angela. Montenegro.

130
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,723
Jared Booth.

131
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,053
Okay, Jared, Bones and
I have to work on a case, so...

132
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:08,118
Yeah, no problem, I will grab a
cab and get settled into my new place.

133
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,099
Okay.
It was very nice to meet you all.

134
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,353
And Cam, I will pick you
up at your place, say, 7:00.

135
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,688
Sounds good.

136
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,027
Are you thinking of
leaving lesbianism behind?

137
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,434
I prefer not to be labeled, okay?

138
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,085
Well, since you were last here,
Angela ran into her ex-girlfriend,

139
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,744
who is now her ex-ex-girlfriend.

140
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,559
Well, the only "ex" I care about are

141
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,001
X-rays.

142
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,921
- Right.
- Apologize for the pun.

143
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,005
Yeah...
don't give up your day job, kid.

144
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,260
Okay, Bones, what do you say we
go solve a murder? Come on.

145
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,505
The remains are those of
a man in his 50s. Bearded.

146
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:57,688
5'10", approximately 195 pounds.

147
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:00,715
That matches the
description of my father.

148
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,195
Was the victim wearing a blue
windbreaker with yellow piping?

149
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,575
Yeah, that...
that's my windbreaker.

150
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,523
He borrowed it, Paul.

151
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,663
One of your notebooks must
have been in the pocket.

152
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:17,375
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Three days ago.

153
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:18,746
Was he drunk?

154
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,003
- He used to go on binges.
- Honey.

155
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,467
How often did your father
go on these drinking binges?

156
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:29,345
- We don't really know.
- Jim had just come back into our lives.

157
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,721
He said he quit drinking.

158
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,516
He walked out on me and
my mom when I was a kid.

159
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:35,935
His father wrapped his car
around a tree drunk driving.

160
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,895
- Paul was injured, and so was his mom.
- He broke both his legs.

161
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,023
As soon as he got crutches,
he was gone.

162
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,400
How did he find you?

163
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,902
There was an article
about me in this magazine.

164
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:46,472
Dad read it,

165
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,795
called me, said he had cleaned up
his act, wanted to reconnect,

166
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,451
so we invited him to stay with us.

167
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,925
Did your father have
any run-ins recently?

168
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,663
Was my father murdered?

169
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,708
We think it may be foul play, yes.

170
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,752
Mrs. Stegman?

171
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,095
The day before your father
disappeared, I came home from school...

172
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,801
I teach fifth grade.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

173
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:11,304
I saw Mike leaving the
house. He looked upset.

174
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:12,985
- Who's Mike?
- Mike Campbell.

175
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,892
We used to be business
partners. We're still friends.

176
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:19,425
Your dad said he caught Mike
taking something from your workshop.

177
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,647
Yeah, we loan each other
tools all the time.

178
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,900
I mean, I bet Dad just
didn't understand that.

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,235
Well, I'm gonna need Mike's number.

180
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,824
So is it true that
you borrowed his tools?

181
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,525
What? I didn't borrow anything.

182
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,827
Well, then, Mr. Campbell, what were
you doing at the Stegman house?

183
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,955
- I went to confront his dad.
- About what?

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,832
When I get stuck on
one of my projects,

185
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:42,642
I like to do
a little off-track betting.

186
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,214
Making predictions based on
statistical models clears my head.

187
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,205
- Makes complete sense.
- Yeah...

188
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,091
So, that day, I go
in, and there's Paul's dad.

189
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:55,264
He's placing bets and
taking hits off of a flask.

190
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,725
Indicating that hadn't
really stopped drinking.

191
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,987
I confronted him, then the old geezer
slammed me against a walland

192
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:02,605
told me to mind my own business.

193
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,564
- So, then, you left?
- That's right.

194
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,031
Look, then he disappeared,
so I figured,

195
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,865
why should I spoil
Paul's last memories of his old man?

196
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,045
Your inventions are much more
industrial than Paul Stegman's.

197
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,100
Yeah, that's why we
stopped being partners.

198
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,703
Paul's more into toys and gadgets.

199
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:25,391
Oh, that is part of a
pressurized industrial sieve.

200
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,775
Its application's in
the sewage industry.

201
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,092
This grating could have caused
the damage to Jim's face.

202
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:43,536
- Did you catch the murderer?
- We subpoenaed

203
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:44,885
a possible murder weapon.

204
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,232
Not a bad day's work.

205
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,901
More important than catching a
murderer, I'm dateless tonight.

206
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,290
What happened to Cam?

207
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,345
Oddly, I think it's more
important to catch this murderer.

208
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,727
I'm working.

209
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,077
- So, who else you got for me, Seeley?
- What am I? Your pimp?

210
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,459
- Don't think I'm not appreciative.
- Clark has everything

211
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,248
- under control so I could go.
- What?

212
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,500
Really? Thank you.

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,627
- No.
- Wha... what... what, wait.

214
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,609
This... is Bones, right?

215
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,631
Not some ugly FBI
woman with a moustache.

216
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,085
- I don't have a moustache, Jared.
- Seeley, would you mind?

217
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,012
No. Why would I mind?
It's all right.

218
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:19,181
Which means this is a
great time to hang up.

219
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,879
What did you find?

220
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,432
It's what I didn't
find that's interesting.

221
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,906
- You have got to be kidding me.
- What?

222
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,885
Oh, nothing.
Nothing, nothing, Dr. Brennan.

223
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,435
I just, didn't know
that you were so...

224
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:46,417
The murder victim was supposed
to be a long-term heavy drinker, yet,

225
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,712
his bones show no signs
of alcoholic osteoporosis.

226
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:52,805
There's no damage to the cancellous
structure of the long bones either.

227
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,338
Furthermore, he was supposed
to have broken his legs

228
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,470
in a car accident
approximately 25 years ago.

229
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,099
There's no signs of remodeling.

230
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:01,057
No. These legs were never broken.

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,380
We misidentified the victim.

232
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,562
He is not Paul Stegman's father.

233
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,680
Thank you, General. Appreciate it.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,196
Will you gentlemen
excuse me for one second?

235
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,282
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,640
Don't tell me you're sorry you came.

237
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,266
No, not at all.

238
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,923
It is not often that
I get to observe people

239
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,315
this powerful
in a relaxed situation.

240
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:52,693
Don't be fooled.

241
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,403
It's a school of piranhas in here.

242
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,935
You're good at this.

243
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,782
They listen to you when you speak.

244
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,159
You want to know the secret?

245
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,873
You have an incredibly beautiful,

246
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,167
incredibly intelligent scientist,

247
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:11,755
slash-novelist

248
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,464
sitting alone waiting for you
to bring her a drink.

249
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:19,505
That is too corny.

250
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,997
Definitely.

251
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:27,143
I was thinking how Booth would
be bored at a function like this.

252
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,813
This kind of event would
make Seeley very nervous.

253
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,233
I don't mean he's incapable.
My brother's very, very capable.

254
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,243
It's just... it's like
Seeley's afraid of success.

255
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,935
He stays in his comfort zone.

256
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,991
It drove our dad nuts.

257
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,244
- Really?
- That's what made him a good sniper.

258
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:48,803
He doesn't like to be visible above the
ridge line, so he keeps his head low.

259
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:50,465
Instinct.

260
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,003
Me, on the other hand, well,

261
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,754
I cannot help but run that ridge.

262
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,506
Can you give me an example?

263
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,709
I bet you
Seeley never took that risk.

264
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,312
Nope.

265
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,311
- To a good night?
- Yes. So far.

266
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:27,585
I found a match for our victim's
DNA on the felony database.

267
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,549
Have you seen
Bones yet this morning?

268
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,280
No, I think she and
Jared had a late night.

269
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,168
Open the attachment I just sent you.

270
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,905
Okay, Anthony Pongetti.

271
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,459
Multiple fraud convictions.

272
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,970
That's our victim.

273
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:46,680
Right, so...

274
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,501
Pongetti pretends to be Stegman.

275
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:51,835
Why?

276
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,064
Reads that article on the inventor and
figures there's something to cash in on?

277
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,765
You know,
Bones never gets in this late.

278
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,915
You're the one who said you didn't
mind them going out together.

279
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,869
Bye.

280
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,075
Special Agent Booth.

281
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,729
Wow, look at that: a full
colonel from State Police.

282
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,294
Ryan Wolchuck. Mind if I sit?

283
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:20,036
No, please, have a seat. If this is
about the RICO investigations,

284
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:23,342
I've been keeping you guys in
the loop, just like I promised.

285
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,128
I'm here about the meth lab body.

286
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,582
Okay.

287
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,755
It's extremely embarrassing
for the state police

288
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,104
that this homicide victim was
blown up during a training exercise.

289
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,082
And the superintendent, the governor,
various movers and shakers

290
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,725
would look kindly on it if you...

291
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,574
Well, if you simply neglected to
give that small detail to the press.

292
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,704
And if the press digs up
that the bodies

293
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,516
were burned and blown
into several pieces,

294
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,748
that makes the FBI look sneaky.

295
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,943
Well, the FBI is sneaky.

296
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,234
Right.

297
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,565
Not today, sir.

298
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,970
Careers are made when men of
good intent help each other.

299
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,310
I'll tell you what:
why don't we just tell the truth

300
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,224
and take our lumps when we have to.

301
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,753
No signs of remodeling.

302
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,608
Did you just get in?

303
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,318
I haven't been to sleep.

304
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,281
Can I offer you a little insight
into Booth's little brother?

305
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:30,295
Oh, God, why am I always standing
precisely in the wrong place?

306
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,411
I didn't have sex with him, Cam.

307
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,104
- Didn't have sex with who?
- Jared Booth.

308
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,165
Good!

309
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,530
- Why good?
- Because... because...

310
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,248
Because he's Booth's little brother
and it would just be a creepy

311
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:45,225
way to have sex with a Booth
without having sex with the real Booth.

312
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,095
Kudos, Angela. I would not have
had the guts to say that out loud.

313
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,535
No, Jared is a real Booth.

314
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,146
Jared's Booth Lite.

315
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:53,635
Booth is the real Booth.

316
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,392
Well, what if Booth is Booth Lite?

317
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,269
Angela found the real Jim Stegman.

318
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,410
Where?

319
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:00,725
Here.
In the Jeffersonian cold storage.

320
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,818
Only,

321
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:06,182
he's known as John Doe 100803.

322
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,738
Looks like a drowning victim.

323
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:10,074
Only if he drowned after
being shot in the heart.

324
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,607
- How did you find him?
- The real Jim Stegman has DNA on file

325
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,185
stemming from an assault charge
12 years ago.

326
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,290
I ran a search, and this popped up.

327
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,552
He's been a John Doe right here in
the Jeffersonian since last week.

328
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,464
Washed up
at Anacostia Naval Station.

329
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,165
Last known address: Bowie, Maryland.

330
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,061
Well, this is Jim Stegman's place.

331
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:33,222
Landlord says nobody's been
in here since he went missing.

332
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:35,935
This guy has gone missing
twice and nobody reports it.

333
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,352
You say Jim ended up shot
and dumped in the river?

334
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:39,937
That's right. Shot and dumped.

335
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,765
Old Jim did not deserve that ending.

336
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,857
What, with quit drinking
and quit betting.

337
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:47,413
Well, it looks like he fell
off the, gambling bandwagon.

338
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,574
No sign of booze anywhere. Here.

339
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,219
- Booth.
- Yeah?

340
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,786
One of these is made
out to Anthony Pongetti.

341
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:56,912
Pongetti?

342
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:59,164
That old boy is another
whole other earful of wax.

343
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,975
- Bad egg?
- Black-hearted son of a bitch, yeah.

344
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,355
Had him in custody, two months ago.

345
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:07,281
- For what?
- Running a bogus roof repair company.

346
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:10,342
He'd give an estimate, and
take a deposit, then skedaddle.

347
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:12,895
Mind I ask what's going
on here in my own town?

348
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,068
Yeah, the real Jim Stegman,
he was shot,

349
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,195
killed and dumped
in the river a week ago.

350
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,555
Pongetti shot and killed
four days ago.

351
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,687
After pretending to be Jim Stegman.

352
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,074
Sounds like maybe Pongetti killed Jim
and then committed,

353
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:28,110
whatch a macallit, identity theft.

354
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,988
I'm in trouble. Jared

355
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:34,445
Yeah, thanks. Bones, you know what?
I gotta get you back to the lab, okay?

356
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,403
Thanks, Sheriff.

357
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:42,243
Paul Stegman had 66 inventions
in his notebook

358
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,168
and this one was marked with a star.

359
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,925
All it needed
was a little more torque.

360
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,487
Yeah, well,
if the gears can handle it.

361
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,552
Clark, I was wondering if you
had a chance to look at the...

362
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,965
Is this one of Stegman's inventions?

363
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,406
Yeah. It's a garbage sorter.

364
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,326
And thanks to Clark, it works.

365
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:22,285
I only indulged in this,
diversion after he asked for help.

366
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,084
I wasn't wasting time.
I came in for the...

367
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,170
The grating you got
from Mike Campbell

368
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,465
was not the weapon used to strike
Anthony Pongetti in the face.

369
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,965
The zygomatic bones were fractured.

370
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,165
This screen,
while it resembles stainless steel,

371
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,229
is actually a rather
malleable magnesium alloy.

372
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,045
So, for it to cause
that much damage...

373
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,142
Yes, it would have been
bent from the impact.

374
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,392
Yes.

375
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,771
So, what we're looking
for is something heavier.

376
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,061
Jared Booth, US Navy,
Lieutenant Commander, over.

377
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:02,718
Copy, notify.
We'll stand by for transport.

378
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,285
You all right?

379
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,454
I fell asleep at the wheel,
but I'm okay.

380
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,815
Yeah, fell asleep.

381
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,585
Local trooper here
says he knows you.

382
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,427
Agent Booth.

383
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:17,423
Colonel Wolchuck.

384
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,802
Is that what we're going with here?
He fell asleep at the wheel?

385
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,475
I'm sure you'll agree it's best
just to tell the truth,

386
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,644
take our lumps when we have to.

387
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:33,390
They get me for DUI,
I lose my job, Seeley.

388
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,994
- I mean, I lose my whole career.
- Shut up.

389
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,735
Shut up. Please.

390
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,998
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

391
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:48,455
The first body you found wasn't
my father, but the second was?

392
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,603
So, the man we actually met,

393
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:52,542
the one who said
he was Paul's father...

394
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,222
Was not. That's correct.

395
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,671
This Pongetti guy,
did he kill my father?

396
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,982
- We don't know that yet.
- Were we in danger?

397
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,454
- Well, Anthony Pongetti was...
- He was harmless.

398
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,344
He was a con man. That's all.

399
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:07,255
Did Pongetti leave anything behind?

400
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,214
Luggage or papers?

401
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,785
He left a duffle bag in
the coat closet over there.

402
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,633
Let's check it out.

403
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,444
What did this man want from us?

404
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,405
We think it's possible
that he wanted to...

405
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,988
profit off of your inventions.

406
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,107
He'd be the first one
that ever did then.

407
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,533
Don't do that to yourself.

408
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,345
Look at this thing.
Man, what is this thing, a robot?

409
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,375
That's a battery-operated
electrostatic dust trap.

410
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:33,208
I gave up on it months ago.

411
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:35,668
Uh, it's... hold on.

412
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,757
That's not supposed to be in there.

413
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,891
Oh, what is that?

414
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,553
Oh, my God.

415
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,805
20 grand, give or take.

416
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,165
Do we get to keep that?

417
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,559
- He wasn't even really your father.
- So what?

418
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,312
That is the best motive
we've seen yet for murder yet.

419
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,642
Right there.

420
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,898
My name is Colonel Ryan Wolchuck

421
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,982
of the State Police Bureau
of Criminal Investigations.

422
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:12,072
I have the great pleasure of
announcing today that

423
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,665
the grand jury has handed down 62
indictments following the State Police

424
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,806
crackdown on organized crime.

425
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,648
This victory

426
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,081
is the result of a six-month RICO
investigation by our department.

427
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:27,420
The State Police would like to
acknowledge the

428
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:31,800
very fine support work
of several FBI field officers...

429
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,496
Yeah, support.

430
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:01,754
Hey, Cam, what's up?
What's so urgent?

431
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,298
Your people found a
fingerprint on the bag of money.

432
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,745
I know. W-We don't have an ID.
What... why is that so urgent?

433
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,100
What's going on?

434
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,305
What happened?

435
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:16,269
I watch TV. State Police getting
all the glory for that big RICO case?

436
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,801
- What the hell?
- Relax

437
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:19,684
Okay, it's political.

438
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:23,234
It came down way far
above my head. Right?

439
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,361
Don't you lie to me, big
man. I'm your friend.

440
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,076
I know where this came from,
and it wasn't from on high.

441
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:35,663
Cam, let this one slip by.

442
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:52,805
You must be Agent Booth's brother.

443
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,932
Yeah, I'm Jared. You FBI?

444
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,155
FBI. Uh, yeah, yeah. Lance Sweets.

445
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,172
Nice to meet you.

446
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:02,348
Capitals?

447
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:06,599
Yeah, I know Seeley's a Flyers
man, but, hey, when in Rome, right?

448
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,877
Please.

449
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,928
Yeah, I still haven't gotten
him anything for his birthday.

450
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:15,224
Oh, my brother doesn't
like birthday presents.

451
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,405
Anyways, these are more
like a "thank you."

452
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,918
Or an apology.

453
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,564
You know what it's like
with brothers, right?

454
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,044
No. Only child.

455
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:26,130
Well, having a big brother is like
having an extra dad,

456
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:29,011
only a dad who protects you
from your real dad.

457
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,678
And always thinks of you as a kid.

458
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,374
I have the same problem with Booth.

459
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:37,192
There is nothing worse than somebody
who always thinks they're right

460
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,731
and then they're right.

461
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:39,977
- Right?
- Yeah.

462
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:43,774
It's a pleasure, Agent Sweets.

463
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,463
Doctor, not Agent.

464
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,611
Jim Stegman was shot four times.

465
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,724
I postulate that each gunshot
was both precise and deliberate

466
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,224
and did not occur in a
rapid-fire succession.

467
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,244
There's no way to tell
that from the bones.

468
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,314
Not from the bones.

469
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,124
Close-range injuries.

470
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,564
Middle of the foot,
middle of the knee,

471
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,922
middle of the shoulder,
dead center on the heart.

472
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,495
Small-caliber weapon.

473
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,264
You believe this
was done on purpose.

474
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:12,660
Yes. Torture.

475
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:15,435
Someone was trying to get
information from this man.

476
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,140
Pure conjecture, Dr. Edison.

477
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,018
But it has logical integrity.

478
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:30,365
So, three years ago, Stegman and
Pongetti, they were arrested.

479
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,347
- They were working some scam together.
- We already knew they were accomplices.

480
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:35,678
There was a third guy involved.
They ratted him out.

481
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,923
- He went to jail for five years.
- Five-year sentence,

482
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,787
three years with parole.
Is the stool out?

483
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,225
Is the stool out?

484
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,405
No, you mean "stoolie," and the
third guy wasn't the stoolie.

485
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,325
Stegman and Pongetti were, okay?

486
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,261
You go in there, I'll be in here.

487
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,688
Steve Jackson.

488
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,263
What the hell are you wearing?

489
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,224
I'm on parole. They won't
let me work on Wall Street.

490
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,893
Of course, I'd make less there.

491
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,312
- What's this about?
- Stegman and Pongetti.

492
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,689
Parole officer already told
me to stay away from 'em.

493
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,567
But you didn't stay away
from them. Did you, Steve?

494
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:14,739
- Fine. I met with Stegman.
- Why?

495
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,784
He was making amends,
apologizing, in the program.

496
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:22,163
One small parole violation
and the FBI gets involved?

497
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,665
Stegman and Pongetti are both dead.

498
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,085
- You got to be kidding.
- Shot.

499
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,972
It's okay, you can take a moment
to rejoice

500
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,823
in the death of your enemies.
Go ahead.

501
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:34,519
Pongetti's dead, good.

502
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,776
I'm glad.

503
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:40,515
Stegman... he was okay.

504
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,715
He ratted you out.

505
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,181
Pongetti ratted me out.
Stegman backed him is all.

506
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:47,730
I don't begrudge.

507
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,191
I got an alibi anyway.

508
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,184
I didn't tell you when they died.

509
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,171
Tracking device.

510
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:57,865
Somebody somewhere knows where I am

511
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,160
24 hours a day since
I got out for the next two years.

512
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:10,545
- Do you think he did it?
- No, we'll check his whereabouts,

513
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,505
but, you know, I don't think so.

514
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,776
Nice hat, huh? Come on. I'll
take you back to the lab.

515
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,791
What happened with your RICO bust?

516
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:19,503
Nothing. Why?

517
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,432
- Have you been talking to Cam?
- No. Did you do something wrong?

518
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,774
What do you mean?

519
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,522
You didn't get
the credit you deserve.

520
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,646
- What'd you do?
- Life's not always about credit.

521
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,238
That's not what you said before.

522
00:27:30,363 --> 00:27:32,701
You said life was all about credit
and you were going to Hawaii

523
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,477
and they were gonna put
you on a coin.

524
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,105
Let's just forget about it.
Okay, Bones? Forget about it.

525
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,574
Jared warned me that you
tend to sabotage yourself.

526
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:41,742
Jared said that?

527
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,661
He said that you're
afraid of success.

528
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,163
So basically I'm a loser.

529
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,999
No, he never said the word "loser."

530
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:50,835
Do you think I'm a loser
like that guy in there...

531
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,915
some clown in some dumb-ass uniform
who basically can't do any better?

532
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,215
Is that what you think?

533
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,905
Anthropologically, males tend to
rank themselves into a hierarchy.

534
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,515
There's no shame in not being
at the top of the hierarchy.

535
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,181
You're not answering the
question, Bones. Answer my question.

536
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:13,607
Booth.

537
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,861
Your forensic techs got an ID for
the fingerprint on the money bag.

538
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,321
Is it Stegman or Pongetti?

539
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,698
Stegman, but not the
one you're thinking of.

540
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:21,615
The son?

541
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,193
Nope, the wife.

542
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,287
The fingerprint belongs
to Lily Stegman.

543
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,849
Thanks. The fingerprints
belong to Lily Stegman.

544
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,708
We know that because
she works with kids.

545
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,839
She acted like she'd never
seen that money before.

546
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,235
Well, she was lying.

547
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,697
Bones, let's just
go and do our work.

548
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,355
I thought he was Paul's father.

549
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,710
I would never hurt him.

550
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,608
We found your
fingerprints on the money.

551
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,138
Can you explain that?

552
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:58,915
I'm ashamed.

553
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,975
Well, whatever you're ashamed
of, believe me, murder is worse.

554
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:04,169
The day after Jim...

555
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,705
The man we thought was Jim...

556
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,955
The day after he disappeared,
a package arrived for him.

557
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,156
When he didn't come back, I started
to think he meant for us to open it.

558
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:14,925
That doesn't make any sense.

559
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,565
No, I understand. He's
gone, it's sitting there.

560
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,235
Maybe he meant for you to have it.

561
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,137
Yes.

562
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:24,178
Plus... you have a family to take care
of. We do whatever we can for family.

563
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:27,133
I opened it, it was full of cash.

564
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,495
And...

565
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:31,872
A note.

566
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,845
"Jim, do me a big favor.

567
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,315
"Hold on to this until I
can get it back from you.

568
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,568
Help yourself to
whatever you need, P."

569
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,545
"P"... Pongetti.

570
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,659
I know I should have called
the police, and...

571
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,926
when you came I should have told you,
but by then...

572
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,159
You needed the money,

573
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,154
and in a way, you felt like you earned
it for taking that old man in.

574
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:51,975
Family.

575
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,859
My teaching salary barely
pays the bills,

576
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:55,675
and we're trying
to have another child.

577
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,130
So you were the one that hid
the money in the dust trap thing?

578
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:00,214
Yes.

579
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,159
- What does your husband know?
- Nothing, I promise.

580
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:04,739
She could just be protecting him.

581
00:30:04,864 --> 00:30:07,212
I am, by not letting him know
about the money you found...

582
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,417
or the...

583
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,266
rest of it.

584
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:12,985
- The rest of it?
- There's more?

585
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,979
Yes, I put it into our
safety deposit box.

586
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,190
Okay, how much?

587
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:21,131
$150000...

588
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,117
So I figure what happened is that

589
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:31,425
Pongetti got his cash in some,
you know, illegal way,

590
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,581
maybe in a way that
could get him killed.

591
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,791
Stegman... He's about
to go visit his son.

592
00:30:36,054 --> 00:30:39,003
So Pongetti sends the cash
to his friend for safety.

593
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,704
Then Stegman gets killed,
so to go get that cash,

594
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:44,592
Pongetti decides to pretend
to be Stegman.

595
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,811
People make stupid,
irrational decisions.

596
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,935
Brennan.

597
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,976
They act from the heart
sometimes, Bones. It's not a crime.

598
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,771
Okay, I'll be right there.
Cam needs me.

599
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,035
Hello.

600
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,075
Dr. Brennan.

601
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,055
I don't want you to think
this is an intervention.

602
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,665
I don't know what that means.

603
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,648
An intervention is when
a group of loved ones

604
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,915
bands together to help one of their own
make a difficult decision.

605
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,001
Oh, then,
then it is an intervention.

606
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,503
Are you my loved ones?

607
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,671
I was...

608
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:24,785
troubled by a conversation
I had with Jared Booth.

609
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,765
Sweets came to me with
some theories about

610
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,470
Booth's family life,
and he pretty much nailed it.

611
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,668
- Nailed what?
- Sit down.

612
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,954
Booth and Jared are children

613
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,234
of a physically abusive,
alcoholic father.

614
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,804
Booth's been digging Jared out
of trouble since they were kids.

615
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:48,864
Jared always comes up smelling
like a rose and Booth takes the hit.

616
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,298
He's denying his brother the opportunity
to take responsibility and learn

617
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:53,871
from his own mistakes.

618
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,329
You have no evidence of that.

619
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,955
I've known the Booth
boys for 15 years.

620
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,255
Now, i-it's natural to be
protective of a younger sibling.

621
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,275
Of course, Jared is a grown man...

622
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,881
an intelligent,
talented, capable adult.

623
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,425
- I like him very much.
- Yeah, well, cut it out.

624
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,628
Booth shouldn't be threatened
by the fact

625
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:12,429
that his brother is more successful.

626
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,412
I am absolutely certain
that however it is

627
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:18,105
Booth lost all the credit
for that RICO bust,

628
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,520
it's because of Jared.

629
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,481
We're all scientists here, right?

630
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:24,275
Not you.

631
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:26,345
- What is your evidence?
- How about this?

632
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,785
The last time I told Booth
what I thought of Jared,

633
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,531
he didn't speak
to me for six months.

634
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,525
That is an anecdote.

635
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,946
We're saying maybe Booth deserves
the benefit of the doubt here

636
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,122
until all the evidence is in.

637
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:41,792
Evidence. I am
comfortable with evidence.

638
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,685
Okay, here's some evidence.

639
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,300
The bullets that killed both Stegman and
Pongetti were fired from the same gun.

640
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,335
Which suggests they were killed
by the same person. Thank you.

641
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,695
Should I tell Booth?

642
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,514
No, I'll do it.

643
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:13,035
Thanks for coming, Jared.

644
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,243
When a beautiful woman
asks me out for lunch...

645
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:17,911
Something wrong?

646
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:25,419
I need to know the truth.

647
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,838
I've heard that about you.

648
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,758
Do you know anything about Booth
losing credit on the RICO case?

649
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:34,261
No. What? I mean, that's
the first I've heard of it.

650
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,796
People are telling me that

651
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:39,892
somehow all the credit went to
the state police because of you.

652
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,351
Is that possible?

653
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:45,356
So it is possible.

654
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,795
What did he say to you?

655
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:47,798
Nothing.

656
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,708
I think this is something
between brothers.

657
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:52,029
No offense.

658
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,275
- Tempe.
- You took advantage of him.

659
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,755
You know, you made me
think that he's a loser!

660
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,168
And what really makes me
angry is that I believed you.

661
00:34:04,655 --> 00:34:07,496
I wouldn't blame Booth if
he never spoke to me again.

662
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,105
You're the loser!

663
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,655
You all right?

664
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,065
Why didn't you pick up?
Were you in the bathroom or something?

665
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,885
- To be honest, I was discussing...
- Okay. Never mind.

666
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,335
Just never mind, all right?

667
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,404
Agents recovered
the rest of the cash

668
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:36,825
from Lily Stegman's
safety deposit box, all right?

669
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,474
The bills were bundled
with evidence bands.

670
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,008
What does that mean?

671
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,458
The money is from the county
sheriff's headquarters in Bowie.

672
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,585
- It was confiscated during a drug bust.
- Oh, so drug money?

673
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,995
It was scheduled for transfer to
the Federal Reserve two weeks ago.

674
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,325
A driver from the reserve shows up.

675
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,111
He flashes his credentials,
drives off with the dough.

676
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:57,219
Forty minutes later,
the real driver shows up.

677
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,995
Oh, so the fake one was Pongetti?

678
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,516
But it had to be. Right? I mean,
jeez, he got away with over 200 grand.

679
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,520
But he was in custody there.
How come no one recognized him?

680
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,620
What? It's a logical question.

681
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:11,326
No, you know what?
You are a genius.

682
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,425
- Hold on for a second.
- Why am I a genius?

683
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:17,982
"Why?" Because I let
that big sheriff know

684
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:20,701
that we found $20,000
in Stegman's house.

685
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,889
Why is that bad?

686
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:24,002
Because if he was
in it with Pongetti,

687
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,358
then he thinks he knows
where the rest of the money is.

688
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,249
Thinks.

689
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,328
We turned everything
over to the FBI.

690
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,315
All the money, everything
the guy touched.

691
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,229
Well, it's probably just a breakdown
in jurisdictional communication.

692
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:42,977
I'll check with the FBI.

693
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:44,835
Why don't you check
with me right now?

694
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,519
Better yet, why don't you
just come with us now?

695
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:53,233
The grating is what hit
Pongetti in the face.

696
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,115
Old school, huh? Perp was
handcuffed to the back.

697
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,455
You sped up, slammed on the
breaks. Slam, sped, slam, sped...

698
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,657
- He couldn't protect his face.
- No! Stop! Let her go!

699
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:06,515
Mr. Stegman, take
your little boy inside!

700
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,873
Do it, honey, please.

701
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:12,464
Now, this is what's going to happen.

702
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,620
You're going to get in
your vehicle and drive away.

703
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:17,216
I'm gonna do the same thing,
everybody lives and everybody's happy.

704
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,965
Well, that sounds like a good idea.

705
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,575
No, not a good idea.

706
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,930
You drive off with the
evidence? Not going to happen.

707
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,432
Paul! Oh, God!

708
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,962
Agent Booth, you are by far

709
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:31,313
the worst hostage negotiator
I have ever run into.

710
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,615
Don't you know you're
supposed to talk?

711
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,151
Disorient, distract the perpetrator?

712
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:38,028
- Booth?
- Not now, Bones.

713
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,905
- You want me to try to shoot him?
- No.

714
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,370
Why? I'm a good shot.

715
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:43,909
- You are not a good shot.
- Well, you are.

716
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,770
You know, maybe if
we switched weapons,

717
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,926
you could hit him right
between the eyes.

718
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,358
Bones, are you okay?

719
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:52,918
I'm okay.

720
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:08,628
Lily!

721
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:09,776
I'm okay.

722
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,255
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

723
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,129
I would like to propose a toast

724
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:04,385
to my partner, Seeley Booth.

725
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,989
To Booth.

726
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:07,867
I know who he is,

727
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,867
but I forget sometimes because...

728
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:15,247
because he never shines
a light on himself.

729
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,586
He shines it on other people.

730
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,214
Yeah, right after I conk
them on the head with it.

731
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:24,644
Anthropology teaches us that the

732
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:28,300
alpha male is the man
wearing the crown,

733
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:32,123
displaying the most colorful
plumage and the

734
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:33,855
shiniest baubles.

735
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,851
He stands out from the others.

736
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:39,933
But I now think that
anthropology may have it wrong.

737
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,321
In working with Booth,

738
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:46,657
I've come to realize that

739
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,910
the quiet man, the invisible man...

740
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,035
the man who is always there

741
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:56,541
for friends and family...

742
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,307
that's the real alpha male.

743
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,850
And I promise that my eyes
will never be caught by those...

744
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,999
shiny baubles again.

745
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:14,449
Happy birthday, Booth.

746
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,105
Happy birthday.

747
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:21,671
Thanks, Bones. Thank you.

748
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:24,736
Oh, Bones, all right,
what are we doing?

749
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:27,245
- Come here.
- What?

750
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,469
Just come here for a second.

751
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:35,598
What you're doing for
your brother isn't fair.

752
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,485
Come on, Bones. Don't get me mad
at you after that great speech.

753
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,208
All right, not after I got you shot.

754
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,065
You didn't get me shot.
I got me shot.

755
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,385
You know what, I don't want
to talk about my brother.

756
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,466
Would you prefer Sweets do it?

757
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:53,223
I'm listening.

758
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,191
I forgot all the psychological
stuff, but basically...

759
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:59,744
when you rescue somebody all the time,
if you keep

760
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:02,367
- getting them out on bail...
- Bail them out, Bones.

761
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,318
If you bail them out.

762
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:07,446
You're thwarting their
ability to help themselves.

763
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:10,324
Now you're angry.

764
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,118
Come on, you have to admit, getting
a psychology lesson from you is like

765
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,704
Getting an anthropology
lesson from you?

766
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,126
The RICO case...

767
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,618
I traded my one shot at glory to

768
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:26,673
keep my brother from being arrested.

769
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,846
For drunk driving.

770
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,125
You know, what if he does it again?

771
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,025
What if he kills someone next time?

772
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,695
You shouldn't have done that.

773
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,921
Right, says the woman
who got her father

774
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,985
off murder charges.

775
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:54,007
Face it.

776
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,162
We do things for family.

777
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:00,248
You're right. You're totally right.

778
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:06,561
No, I'm not.

779
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:07,839
What? Why?

780
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:11,720
There's no risk that your
father will kill again.

781
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,604
Jared?

782
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,955
You, uh, bringing me out here to
give me advice on your partner

783
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,915
because I think
that ship has sailed?

784
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,860
No, no, it's, uh...

785
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:31,101
What I gotta do here, I...

786
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,305
I gotta stop.

787
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,670
Do you understand?

788
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:39,117
- "Stop"?
- Yeah. And you should stop, too.

789
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,249
I gotta stop what?

790
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,584
The drinking. Stop it.

791
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:48,554
I'll take that under advisement.

792
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,600
Seriously, Jared.

793
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:55,470
No more stepping in
to make things go away.

794
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,224
I carry my own water, Seeley.

795
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,778
Now, you should go back inside
and enjoy your birthday party.

796
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,249
Right.

797
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,870
- Cheers.
- Yeah. Happy birthday to me.

798
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:29,705
You going to come back in for cake?

799
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,756
Bones, I just need
some time, that's all.

800
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,801
Do you need time and space?

801
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,221
Just some time.

802
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,910
My dad drank.

803
