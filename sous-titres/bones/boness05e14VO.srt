1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,755
Come on then, William,
let's not keep God waiting.

2
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:11,749
By this holy water
and by your precious blood,

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,060
wash away all my sins, O Lord.

4
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:14,930
Amen.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,682
May this holy water protect us

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,227
against evil in this world
and in the next.

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,104
I smell something weird.

8
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,417
The new candles are smokier
than the last batch.

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:34,745
My Lord!

10
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,548
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly armies,

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,385
Saint Michael the Archangel.
God help us.

12
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:54,993
Be gone, Satan!

13
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:56,430
Pray with me.

14
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:01,185
Defend us in battle against
the rulers of this world of darkness,

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,647
against the spirits of
wickedness in high places!

16
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:14,281
Notice how I'm not tailgating?
Adaptive cruise control.

17
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:18,432
Right now I'm more worried about
a safe distance between you and me.

18
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,477
- Why?
- Because we're going to a church

19
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,581
and you tend to get blasphemous
in churches.

20
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,585
You're afraid that if God smites me
with lightning, you could get hit?

21
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,717
I'm usually
standing right beside you.

22
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,753
The Greek god Zeus all used lightning
to incinerate his enemies.

23
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,719
Although, Zeus apparently
had better aim than your God.

24
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,404
Exactly, stuff like that.
Just don't say stuff like that.

25
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,099
All right... what's going on here?
Are we going the right way?

26
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:44,395
All I had to say was,
"St. Dominic's Roman Catholic Church"

27
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,814
into the voice activated GPS.

28
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,305
Car, could you please
get us there a little faster?

29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,652
No, the accelerator
is not voice activated.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,988
It's foot activated
like a normal car.

31
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,700
You're joking. That's funny.

32
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,028
Father Patrick,
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

33
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,838
My partner, Dr. Temperance Brennan.

34
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,550
I have no idea what I'm going
to tell our congregation.

35
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:15,894
He has horns.

36
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,538
That would have great meaning
for your superstitious followers.

37
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:19,863
Yeah, like me.

38
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:22,349
Was the... sanctuary locked?

39
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:26,145
Yes, but doors and windows mean
nothing to unclean spirits.

40
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,314
Many cultures,
since the dawn of humanity,

41
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,443
have explained evil as the work
of mythical, supernatural beings.

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,499
Evil is not mythical.

43
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,964
It emanates from the opposition.
From Satan...

44
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,016
and his minions.

45
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,665
Yeah, Bones,
that looks like a demon.

46
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,638
All right?
You understand?

47
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:51,469
Booth, if your superstitions
are getting the best of you,

48
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:53,555
I can continue my examination alone.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,394
I am just saying a prayer for us

50
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,839
to protect us from the
evil, you understand?

51
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,429
Come on... even you believe in evil.

52
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:04,266
Well, I believe in genetic
anomalies and aberra behavior.

53
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:05,987
Also, accidents.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,897
Unfortunately, prayers do not have
much affect on the physical world.

55
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,734
Those are horns.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,719
Smell indicates
the remains were doused

57
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,739
in some kind of petrochemical
accelerant.

58
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,826
Which also explains why
the fire is localized.

59
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,036
And you just blew
right past the whole horn thing.

60
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,539
- Have you seen th before?
- No. It's fascinating.

61
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,910
Fascinating.

62
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:31,418
Can't be real, right? It must be
some kind of plastic or something, no?

63
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:34,713
No, they appear to be
composed of actual bone.

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,592
- Those are real horns?
- You okay, Booth?

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,441
I'm all right, let's just...
What do you say we just get Hellboy

66
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,348
wrapped up and back to the Jeffersonian?
Come on, guys, let's go.

67
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,064
Bones - Season 5 Episode 14
"The Devil in the Details"

68
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,067
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,
Dark_Chii

69
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,715
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

70
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:28,664
I've been a coroner a long time,
I've seen a lot of bad things.

71
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,083
Define "bad things. "

72
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,803
Murder, mayhem, torture,
catastrophe, suicide,

73
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:36,231
explosions, you know, the usual stuff.
But this... this gave me a chill.

74
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:38,781
Because of the demonic
symbolism of the horns?

75
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:41,221
Well, I just don't want to
end up hovering above my bed

76
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,624
with my head spinning
around 360 degrees.

77
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,837
That would not only be
impossible but fatal.

78
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,374
Right.

79
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,999
- Preliminary findings, Mr. Vaziri?
- Victim is human, mostly.

80
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,961
He's only half joking.

81
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:56,523
This extension of cartilage here...

82
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:57,421
A tail.

83
00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:00,090
- The victim had a tail?
- Unmistakably devilish.

84
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,856
Believing in fallen angels
and living by the tenets

85
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,013
of empirical science
are mutually exclusive.

86
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,519
Islam teaches us that shaitan
was not a fallen angel but a jinn.

87
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,387
Angels are created from light
and have no free will.

88
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,273
Jinns are created from smokeless fire
and use their free will to defy Allah.

89
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:17,953
Not an angel, not a jinn,

90
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:20,444
and yet, not your
run-of-the-mill man either.

91
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,739
The victim is Caucasian,
and judging by the partially

92
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,450
fused epiphyseal
union of the clavicle,

93
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,330
19 to 24 years of age.

94
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,622
The accelerant was common motor oil
available at any gas station.

95
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:34,541
At least it wasn't brimstone,
available only from hell.

96
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,182
I can't get much off
what's left of his clothes.

97
00:05:37,307 --> 00:05:40,130
It's just a generic mixture
of cotton and man-made fibers.

98
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,614
What do you make of the horns,
Mr. Vaziri?

99
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,012
- Horns fall under my area.
- Only if they aren't made of bone.

100
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:48,931
But they are made of bone.

101
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,381
Really?

102
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,298
Well, I took a sample of your horns

103
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,020
and ran it through the mass spec.

104
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,732
In addition to calcium, potassium,
manganese and silica...

105
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:00,734
Bone, as Mr. Vaziri stated.

106
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,050
I also found calcium carbonate
in the crystal form, aragonite,

107
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,263
which is better known as coral.

108
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,423
Likely, the horns
were cosmetic implants

109
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:13,998
but as a result of biocompatibility,
the remodeled bone

110
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,374
grew within the coral.

111
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:18,935
What about the tail... do you think
it's a cosmetic implant as well?

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,754
Vestigial.
It's a vestigial tail.

113
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,465
That's extremely rare
for a child to be born with one.

114
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:27,070
There is a man in West Bengal
with a 33 centimeter long tail,

115
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:30,028
who some believe is the
reincarnation of Hanuman.

116
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:34,226
- I got an ID on our victim.
- Is his last name Lucifer?

117
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,162
Can we please call him "Hellboy"
until we find out otherwise?

118
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,023
Well, we found out otherwise.

119
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,644
Neal Lowery.

120
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:44,028
Turns out Neal's the only
missing guy with horns. Go figure.

121
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,056
Where was his last known residence?

122
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,073
I'm guessing
Mr. Stephen King's basement.

123
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,060
Havenhurst Sanitarium.

124
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,866
Where he was being treated
for schizophrenia.

125
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,190
Things were fine
when Neal was little.

126
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,015
He was the happiest boy.

127
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,940
He loved cars, toy trucks.

128
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,315
Real smart kid.

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,385
Your son, he was born with a tail?

130
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:12,056
Vestigial, the doctors called it.

131
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,212
When Neal was 14, a teacher
noticed he'd been beaten

132
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:16,852
and reported it to Child Services?

133
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:20,914
Yes, there was an investigation.
The boy's father had just died and...

134
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,422
Neal was getting
really hard to handle,

135
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,527
and I... reacted badly.

136
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,863
He started setting things on fire,

137
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,776
Hung my mom's cat in the garage.

138
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,164
- So she hit him.
- I lost my temper.

139
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,330
But I got the counseling
I needed and it never happened again.

140
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,248
None of us knew what was happening.

141
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,254
We didn't know Neal
was getting sick.

142
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,933
The counselor thought
it might help Neal to...

143
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:44,838
to have the tail removed.

144
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,007
By then he wanted to keep it.

145
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:48,811
Why?

146
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,552
He thought he was marked by God.

147
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,640
Told people he was the son of Satan.

148
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,307
Neal was schizophrenic,
it wasn't his fault.

149
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,103
Well... what about the horns?

150
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,102
When Neal was 16,
he went off his meds

151
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:04,229
for the first time and ran away.

152
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,437
And, when the police found Neal,

153
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:10,569
he'd had these horns implanted.

154
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:13,745
We never saw our Neal again.
Not really.

155
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,416
And when people asked
where he got the horns...

156
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,997
he said hell.

157
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,128
And he's been in and out
of the loony bin ever since.

158
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,355
Havenhurst was a good place,
wasn't it?

159
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,678
Every cent I ever had
went to them for Neal.

160
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,972
He's crazy, but he's my brother.

161
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,808
So, if they did anything
that got him killed,

162
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,643
negligent, whatever,

163
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:42,020
they need to be held responsible.

164
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,652
This section
of the peritoneal lining

165
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,404
is both thickened and inflamed.

166
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,636
Which indicates the intestines
might have ruptured.

167
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,011
Cause of death?

168
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,882
Hard to tell based on sample size.
Did you

169
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,914
find any fractured bones
in the X-rays that might have

170
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,412
- perforated the intestines?
- I don't think so.

171
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:07,623
I know that smell.

172
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,340
Yep, gangrene.

173
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:13,056
I've seen this before in junkies.

174
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,762
They inject between the toes,
it gets infected.

175
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:21,726
As you can see, there's a fracture
on the anterior aspect of the right T5.

176
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,979
There's no way that
ruptured the intestines.

177
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,643
I finished my analysis of the
coents of the boot treads.

178
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:30,396
Within the treads,
I found peat moss, sand and perlite,

179
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,294
also known as potting soil.

180
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,720
As well as seeds
from a plant commonly known

181
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:35,991
as Christmas roses.

182
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,785
Christmas roses...
that doesn't sound very satanic.

183
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,051
Yeah, from the genus hellebore.

184
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:43,602
Sorry.

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,240
Even more interesting though,
is the legend that hellebore

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,506
is the key ingredient in a potion
meant to summon the Devil.

187
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:53,969
Of course it is.

188
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,934
Did I mention that I interned at a
mental health facility in Philadelphia?

189
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,806
By "interned," do you mean lived in?

190
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,188
You know the old thing about
how all psychologists

191
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,732
need psychological help,
it's not true.

192
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,526
Is there any chance that Hellboy
wasn't crazy but actually possessed?

193
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,114
You mean by a demon?

194
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,699
Well, listen, if the Pope
believes in demonic possession,

195
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,574
then, you know,
I at least gotta ask.

196
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,052
I spoke briefly to the victim's
psychiatrist.

197
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,313
Neal Lowery didn't show
any symptoms of demonic possession.

198
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:25,624
Okay, growing horns
isn't a sign of possession?

199
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,815
You mean you spoke
seriously on the matter

200
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,804
to a man
with a university education?

201
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,495
Evil is out there, Bones.

202
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,840
There's just more
than one explanation.

203
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,950
Yes, chemical imbalance,
poor role models, ignorance.

204
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,722
Neal Lowery was
a simple schizophrenic

205
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:42,057
living a simple delusion.

206
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,393
See, simple question, clear answer.
Thank you.

207
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,186
You could've asked him
on the phone.

208
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,389
I brought Sweets along so he could
sift through all the crazy-asses

209
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,775
at the loony bin,
see if any of them are homicidal.

210
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,736
I'm an excellent loony bin
crazy-ass sifter.

211
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,495
You've got to come back inside.

212
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,911
Shouldn't these patients be
in straitjackets or rubber rooms?

213
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,620
Well, some of the patients are
here of their own free will.

214
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,224
There will be a more
secure locked down section

215
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,916
for those who've been committed.

216
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,394
Look over there.
That's hellebore.

217
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,858
The question is, did Hellboy
trample on those flowers

218
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,473
before or after he was dead?

219
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:19,194
Hellboy couldn't have trampled on them
<i>after</i> he was dead.

220
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,013
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

221
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,311
Hi. I'm Lloyd.
I'm one of the nurse practitioners.

222
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:25,887
Dr. Copeland's expecting you.

223
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,986
Neal disappeared
the night before last.

224
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,953
He didn't show up
for his morning meds.

225
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:35,273
So, you thought perhaps
he bolted that night?

226
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:36,909
- Yes.
- He's escaped before?

227
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:40,255
Escape implies incarceration.
We prefer the term AWOL.

228
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,670
The man was committed
to your insane asylum

229
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,238
because he believed he was
the mythical embodiment of evil.

230
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:46,577
Escape seems accurate.

231
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,896
Neal was genius at
finding nooks and crannies

232
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,431
where he'd hole up for days.

233
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,500
We were hoping he'd done that again,
that he'd show up when he got hungry.

234
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,505
We'd like to ask
your patients and staff

235
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,996
if they know anything.

236
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,552
- Is that a problem?
- Staff.

237
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,969
I'm good with that. Patients...

238
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:05,160
These are damaged people,
agent Booth.

239
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:07,225
Their hold on reality is tenuous.

240
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,353
That's why we brought
our own psychologist.

241
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,021
Dr. Sweets?

242
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,274
You sounded more experienced
on the phone.

243
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,269
He means you sounded older.

244
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:18,712
I know.

245
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,330
Love it.

246
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,072
- It's not that funny, Booth.
- I think it is.

247
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,852
This is the arts and crafts area.

248
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,503
Well, the work is quite...

249
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,623
- Disturbing?
- Fascinating.

250
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,085
Yeah, fascinating.

251
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,858
So, did Neal Lowery
have any enemies here?

252
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,798
The whole presence of the Devil,
the tails

253
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,258
the horns,
that must've been quite disrupting.

254
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:43,470
Actually, schizophrenic hallucinations
can be way worse than that.

255
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:47,557
Way, way worse. Yes, one boy
with horns would barely register.

256
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:50,936
Why don't you just have
the horns removed as part of the cure?

257
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,497
I thought this would be a significant
and visible breakthrough for Neal

258
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,650
if he made that decision
without being forced.

259
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,903
- What do you think, Sweets?
- I buy it.

260
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,644
Thank you, Dr. Sweets.

261
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:05,496
You don't think Neal was killed
on the grounds here, do you?

262
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,868
That would not be good.

263
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,496
I'm quite certain it wouldn't
make any difference to Neal.

264
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:11,564
Neal, did he have any...

265
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,996
I don't know...
fights with fellow...

266
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,549
people?

267
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,424
- Physically, no.
- Arguments?

268
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,021
A case of competing delusions, yes,

269
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:26,567
that deteriorated into shouting
upon occasion, but nothing more.

270
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:30,308
Neviah, these people have some
questions for you about Neal Lowery.

271
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,244
Do you feel up to
speaking with them?

272
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,608
God warned me you'd be here
with questions.

273
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:40,360
God warns you?

274
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,091
Of course.

275
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,980
How else would I have known
to have this ready for you?

276
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,748
I'm gonna need another
word for fascinating.

277
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,666
Creepy?

278
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,420
So, what are we to learn from this?

279
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,030
You are very...

280
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,132
You're talented. You're...

281
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,883
Obviously, she's replaced
the face of Longinus, the soldier

282
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,096
who drove his spear
through Christ's side during

283
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,016
- the crucifixion with her own face.
- Neviah believes herself to be

284
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,935
the earthly manifestation
of the angel Uriel.

285
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,617
She's put the murder victim's face

286
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,365
in place of the crucified Devil.

287
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:22,694
Are you confessing to murder?

288
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,447
You mind if I conduct
the conversation, Dr. Brennan?

289
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,774
No, but you might want to know
that the placement of the lance here

290
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,870
in the victim's side,
exactly matches

291
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,414
the location
where the victim was struck

292
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:35,909
in real life.

293
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,335
So, this is true?

294
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,214
I only tell the truth.

295
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,252
As Dr. Copeland told you,

296
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm an angel.

297
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,132
I just don't think it's wise
to have Dr. Brennan present

298
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,400
- when we question Neviah.
- Well, why?

299
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,486
What if Neviah told you
that she's an angel,

300
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:02,442
something she believes with her
whole heart, how would you respond?

301
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,738
Well, I'd tell her
that angels don't exist,

302
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,096
except, of course,
in works of fiction,

303
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,447
such as the Bible,
and in children's books.

304
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:13,370
Right, after which all we'll get
from Neviah is argument, no answers.

305
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,955
Sweets is right. You're out.

306
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,291
I have to admit,
it's eerie the way when I move,

307
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,356
she follows me, as though she knows
exactly where I am.

308
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,215
That's because she can see you.

309
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,802
It's a window, Bones.
It's not a two-way mirror.

310
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:34,658
Perhaps I could wait
in some other part of your facility?

311
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:35,787
Yes, certainly.

312
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,369
This isn't really a good use
of my time.

313
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:39,978
Thank you.

314
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,188
Neviah, could you describe
to me the process

315
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,962
by which you create your paintings?

316
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,658
God guides my hand.

317
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,776
I would imagine that God guides
all of your actions, right?

318
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,031
You being an angel.

319
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:53,118
I only exist to do his will.

320
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,246
Did you know that
Neal Lowery is dead?

321
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:57,676
Of course.

322
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,217
- God told me.
- God told you?

323
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,835
Does God speak to you?

324
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,003
Does he come to you in visions?

325
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:06,631
He takes over my body
and performs his miracles through me.

326
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,008
Did you kill Neal?

327
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,230
He was a demon.

328
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,762
I am an avenging angel.

329
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:14,087
It was my duty.

330
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,225
- I used the holy lance.
- Same as in the painting?

331
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,936
Where is this lance now?

332
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,049
It's right there.

333
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,304
It's invisible.

334
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,818
Right. Gonna be hard getting
fingerprints off that.

335
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,114
Hello.

336
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,752
Can I offer you juice, cookies?

337
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,504
Perhaps a nice
serotonin reuptake inhibitor?

338
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,840
Thank you, but I just ate.

339
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,551
Hi. I'm Dr. Phillip Womack.

340
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,596
I am Dr. Temperance Brennan.
Temperance would be fine.

341
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,044
Beautiful name.

342
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,722
Unfortunately,
patients here don't exhibit temperance.

343
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,518
Hence the need
to fill them with drugs.

344
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,668
Well, I would probably
medicate, as well,

345
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,814
if I was forced to interact
with psychiatrists

346
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,279
all day. No offence.

347
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,534
Well, none taken.

348
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:10,256
Ours is a subjective profession
that often marginalizes

349
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:11,946
the importance of empirical data.

350
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:16,368
It is refreshing to meet a psychiatrist
with such a grounded perspective.

351
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,632
But I assure you we have been
getting very good results

352
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:23,618
with psychopharmacology,
as well as electroconvulsive therapy.

353
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:25,377
Perhaps you'd like to see?

354
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,253
I would enjoy that immensely.

355
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,705
Who knows?

356
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,454
I may be able to convert you
to the wonders of psychiatry.

357
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,582
Hello, Phillip.
I see you've met Dr. Brennan.

358
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,764
- Where were you two going?
- Dr. Womack was gonna show me around.

359
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,766
I don't know if now is the time.

360
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,863
Lloyd is distributing medication.

361
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,551
Yes, of course. I should assist.

362
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,940
- Perhaps later, Temperance?
- I'd like that.

363
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,988
Did Phillip try
to cure you of anything?

364
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,658
- He's a patient?
- For almost six years now.

365
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,032
Believe it or not, he came a long way
before plateauing with this delusion.

366
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,942
I thought we had
quite a lot in common.

367
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,063
- Hey, Lloyd.
- That's right.

368
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,329
Did you find cause of death?

369
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:28,773
Looks like the victim
was struck in the frontal bone by

370
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,067
a weapon approximately
two centimeters in diameter.

371
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:33,628
Possibly the same object
that struck him in the ribs.

372
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,824
So we've got
a fracture to the forehead...

373
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,479
And a Colles fracture on
the right distal radius.

374
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:43,496
All delivered by an invisible,
heavenly lance.

375
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,228
If it was invisible,
it struck with a mighty force.

376
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,712
What if, despite her insanity, what
the young woman saw was, in fact, evil?

377
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,964
So you do believe in the Devil.

378
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,468
- As I said.
- You told me what your religion says.

379
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,026
I know shaitan to be real.

380
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,230
I've been in his presence.

381
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,150
I look into his eyes every day.

382
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,357
I should put my efforts
towards identifying the weapon.

383
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:12,754
Yes.

384
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,582
That would be good.

385
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:30,338
Jung believed art provides an insight
into the unconscious.

386
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:34,626
Yeah. No, I know the drill.
I assisted an art therapist in college.

387
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,721
You can take one look at
Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night...</i>

388
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,315
the dark blues
and the violent brushstrokes.

389
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:43,792
It's no wonder he killed himself
after painting it.

390
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,769
But Neviah's work seems conflicted.

391
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,814
The central image is straight
out of Hieronymus Bosch,

392
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,398
but the background

393
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,318
is full of warm and vibrant colors.

394
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,278
And her brushstrokes are calm.

395
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:00,445
There's no turmoil
or rage in her work.

396
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,662
It could indicate a cold,
measured person

397
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,539
disconnected from an emotional life
that's too painful to confront.

398
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,223
Hold on.

399
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,037
This is weird.

400
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:17,443
The topography of the paint
is unusually thick right here.

401
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,844
This could mean that there's
something underneath the image.

402
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,013
Sometimes when an artist
bowdlerizes their own work,

403
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:27,642
infrared refrectography can show us
what's under that top coat of paint.

404
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:35,483
That's one of the nurses

405
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,818
from the hospital.

406
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,902
He's a demon.

407
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,988
Who has just killed the Devil.

408
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,576
Neal Lowery.

409
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,950
I don't think you need
Jung to figure this one out.

410
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:49,873
Hold up, Lloyd!

411
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,352
Hey, there, Lloyd.
How's it going?

412
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,640
- Turn off your vehicle?
- Sure.

413
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,806
What are you doing here?

414
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,886
Checking out security tapes to see
if Neal vamoosed through the front door?

415
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,430
You recognize this picture?

416
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,682
You're not really treating
this as evidence?

417
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,656
What was your relationship with him?

418
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:12,503
I was nice to the guy.
That's my job.

419
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:15,982
- Look, I'd like to go home.
- No, no. You mindopping your trunk?

420
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,160
What?

421
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,834
Not unless you have a warrant,
which I'm guessing you don't.

422
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,697
Really? Look at this here.
Excuse me.

423
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,826
See? "All visitors and employees agree
to vehicle search upon entry

424
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:28,362
and exit."

425
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,122
- We don't need one. Right?
- We don't need one.

426
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:33,117
Let me just grab that for you.

427
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,621
You stay nice and comfy
in your chair there.

428
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:39,338
We found evidence of gangrene
between Neal's toes.

429
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,426
He was injecting something there.
It's common practice for heroin addicts.

430
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:45,316
Bones, look at this.

431
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:47,972
Guy's got his own personal dojo
back here.

432
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:51,768
Those appear to be the same diameter
as the bruise on Neal Lowery's skull.

433
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:53,937
Swords.

434
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,235
Nunchakus.

435
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,745
Well, look at this.

436
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,870
Drugs...

437
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,214
and heroin.

438
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,701
Looks like we found
Neal Lowery's heroin dealer.

439
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,399
None of that stuff's mine.

440
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:18,544
One of the patients
must have planted it in my car.

441
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,214
No, I really would not advise you
going down that route.

442
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,465
It's the truth.

443
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,802
We're gonna find your fingerprints
all over, so don't get caughin a lie.

444
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:27,929
Right? Right, okay, so...

445
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:30,473
why don't we start with
the dorky martial arts stuff?

446
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,884
Nunchakus and shuriken
aren't dorky, all right?

447
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,728
They're weapons of a true master.

448
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:39,206
The fact that you just called it
"shuriken" proves my dorky theory.

449
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,944
Drugs... did you steal them
from the hospital pharmacy?

450
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,697
How do you know I didn't buy them
from someone else who stole them?

451
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,535
Look, people say
you're really a good guy.

452
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,399
I am.

453
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,664
So what do you say we try
and tell the truth?

454
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:59,964
Look,
Neal's medications didn't work.

455
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,386
All right, I mean, the tranqs
and the antipsychotics...

456
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:06,009
they turned him into a zombie,
but they didn't make him feel better.

457
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:07,896
But this did?

458
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:11,671
I mean, heroin removed
his agitation.

459
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,294
For the first time,
you could talk to the guy.

460
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:16,363
How did Neal pay for the heroin?

461
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:19,217
- I took his meds in exchange.
- For your own use?

462
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:22,635
No, no, I volunteer at a community
outreach for the homeless.

463
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,694
A lot of those people need meds.

464
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,116
You see?
You really are a good guy.

465
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:33,115
- Yeah, I am, I am a good guy.
- You are a good guy.

466
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,719
The only problem is...

467
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,732
these nunchakus...

468
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:40,043
they could probably be
the murder weapon.

469
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,779
- Why would I kill Neal?
- Doesn't matter if you're a good guy.

470
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:45,704
You're a drug dealer. Drug dealers
get into arguments with other clients.

471
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,050
No, I was helping him.

472
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:50,503
When was the last time you saw him?

473
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:53,100
In the dayroom.

474
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,350
We talked, and then later that evening
his brother came, but he was gone.

475
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:59,937
I'm still holding you
on controlled substances.

476
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:01,814
You believe I didn't kill Neal.

477
00:24:02,347 --> 00:24:05,401
Doesn't matter what I believe.
Matters what I can prove.

478
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,514
Anything on the nunchakus?

479
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:12,057
They are completely clean.

480
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:14,519
There are dents, though,
so they've been used.

481
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,926
Can you rule them out
as the murder weapon?

482
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,823
Are you asking me
to do an experiment?

483
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,099
With Arastoo...

484
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,545
- Why are you saying his name like that?
- Like what?

485
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,543
"Arastoo..."

486
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:28,395
Like you're chewing on his name.

487
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:32,428
Arastoo said that he looks
at the Devil every day.

488
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:35,640
- Maybe he has low self-esteem.
- Or...

489
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:39,560
- You know what they call us, right?
- "They" being?

490
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:43,272
Muslims, some Muslims,
the ones over there trying to kill us.

491
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:45,270
They call us "the Great Satan. "

492
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,887
Look, here, what I found.

493
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,776
Radiating microfractures
in the cartilage

494
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:00,414
of the victim's vestigial tail.

495
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:03,668
Radiating microfractures
plus a ruptured intestine?

496
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:06,337
- What does that mean?
- He was slammed into something.

497
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:10,508
Perhaps in fact he did wrestle
with an archangel and lose.

498
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:17,348
As it should be.
The Devil lost, as he always must.

499
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,490
I will inform Dr. Brennan.

500
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:26,274
- "The Devil lost"?
- "As he always must"?

501
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:27,817
What if Arastoo means us?

502
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:29,742
Arastoo is a very...

503
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:32,805
sweet, gentle guy, you know?

504
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,101
I know, but that doesn't mean
in his heart he doesn't look down on us.

505
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,213
And if he thinks
you're the Great Satan?

506
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,138
No, I don't want to be
the Great Satan.

507
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:42,022
I don't even want to be
a minor demon.

508
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,285
Want me to talk to him?

509
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,844
Yes, but unfortunately,
dopey interpersonal crap

510
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,630
falls under my job description.

511
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,303
The discrepancies from
the pharmacy have always been so small,

512
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,608
well within breakage.

513
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:57,766
We understand.

514
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,069
Why do we understand?

515
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:01,642
Lloyd Robertson
was a nurse practitioner.

516
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:05,313
He had pharmacy privileges, right?
He cooked the drug log.

517
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,549
Patients liked Lloyd, the staff.

518
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:10,776
He honestly wanted to help people,
or at least fooled me.

519
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:13,874
So much for penetrating
psychological insights.

520
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,064
Can I speak to you for a moment?

521
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,157
I've listened to you take shots
at my profession, and

522
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,375
that's okay.
I'm a big boy, a tolerant man.

523
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,623
I want you to think about something.

524
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:31,404
I spend every working hour
of every day

525
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,880
trying to help people
who are living in hell.

526
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:35,867
That's an honorable way
to spend a life,

527
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,012
perhaps more honorable
than figuring out

528
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,265
what happened to dead people who
are beyond pain and suffering.

529
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,772
Intentions,

530
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:48,075
however misguided, do count.
I understand that.

531
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,879
I hope you won't think
I'm too picky when I point out

532
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:52,978
that that wasn't an actual apology.

533
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:57,258
But perhaps it's the best
you can manage.

534
00:26:58,797 --> 00:26:59,992
You're shaking hands.

535
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,286
It's great, everyone's made up
and we're friends.

536
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,542
Just get away, get away!

537
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:10,802
It's all right.

538
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:12,272
Do you hear me?

539
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,397
Just relax and let
the medicine help.

540
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:17,969
It's not the right medicine!
I need the right medicine.

541
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,428
What's the right medicine?

542
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,334
The one Lloyd gave me.
Where is he?

543
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,807
I need it.

544
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,059
- I'm a doctor.
- He gave you special medicine?

545
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,227
I'm a doctor...

546
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,546
I'm a doctor.

547
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,361
I'm gonna need to
search this facility.

548
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:37,779
I apologize, Dr. Copeland.

549
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:40,654
I apologize
for undervaluing your work.

550
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:49,996
Test number one.

551
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,742
Now, I've placed sensors
in this dummy

552
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:57,036
to register the impact
of the nunchaku strikes.

553
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:14,442
With nunchakus

554
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,274
it's very important that you...

555
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:21,504
Are you all right?

556
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,094
Son of a bitch.

557
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,355
Nunchakus are deceptively difficult

558
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,289
to maneuver if you've
had no practice.

559
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:31,917
May I?

560
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,186
Knock yourself out.

561
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,484
I did.

562
00:28:58,864 --> 00:28:59,902
What are you,

563
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,196
some kind of Persian ninja?

564
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,211
That can't be right.

565
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,836
That's better.

566
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,261
Was this the murder weapon?

567
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,985
The diameter of the weapon
matches, but, see,

568
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,765
nunchakus swing on an axis

569
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,476
because of the chain, which means

570
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,603
the force increases exponentially

571
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,814
along the length
of the striking surface.

572
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,900
The victim's wound was proportional
along the length of the weapon.

573
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,408
If Lloyd the drug-dealing nurse

574
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,738
killed Neal
the demonic schizophrenic,

575
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,533
then this was not the weapon.

576
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,841
So how long have you been
practicing psychiatry, Dr. Womack?

577
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,950
Longer than you have, Dr. Sweets.

578
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:58,106
Yes, my youth has
often been an obstacle

579
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,754
to gaining trust with patients.

580
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:00,840
That's why

581
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,111
I often pretend to be one of them.

582
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,666
That's interesting.

583
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,941
Okay, so in order to gain trust

584
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,568
from the patients at the ward,

585
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,724
you pretend to be
mentally ill yourself.

586
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,115
I'm a natural actor.

587
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,355
It helped Lloyd
cooperated and treated me

588
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,689
like I was a patient instead
of his immediate superior.

589
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,482
What about Dr. Copeland?

590
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:22,653
Ethan is a very fine psychiatrist,
but he's very conservative

591
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,522
when it comes to the distinction

592
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,143
between doctor and patient.

593
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,575
A traditionalist?

594
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,685
Exactly, Dr. Sweets, exactly.

595
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,497
I'm sorry, but this
is an official investigation

596
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,065
and I must be honest.

597
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:40,087
You and Lloyd Robertson
treated Neal Lowery together?

598
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,048
Only with regard to medication.

599
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:44,415
Neal and I shared a few secrets.

600
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,728
I did not divulge
patient confidentiality.

601
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,263
I don't suppose you'd tell me what.

602
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,374
I couldn't possibly.

603
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:55,853
I breached patient confidentiality
once and I still feel bad about it.

604
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:59,440
Was this regarding
Neal Lowery or...?

605
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,403
I'm sorry, I have nothing whatsoever
to say on the matter. It's closed.

606
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,890
I'll ask that you extend me
that professional courtesy.

607
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:07,015
Sure.

608
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,418
- You found something?
- Yes, cause of death.

609
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,337
Excellent.
What happened?

610
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,456
First, I'd like to
clarify something.

611
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:26,342
After we talked about my beliefs,
you were clearly upset.

612
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,709
What?
No, that's not true.

613
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,118
My words could have been construed

614
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:34,099
as a Muslim referring to
America as the Great Satan.

615
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:38,205
I'm not familiar with that phrase.
Could we get back to this?

616
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,835
I found micro-fractures
on the metacarpal bones

617
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,123
on the same arm

618
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,946
with the Colles fracture.

619
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,950
I love this country.

620
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:54,207
When I said I see the
Devil's face daily...

621
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,499
You know I served as
a translator in Iraq?

622
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:03,216
Normal day, milk run to an outlying
village to talk about water,

623
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:04,922
and an IED took out our Humvee.

624
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:06,799
Oh, my God.

625
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:08,979
Two dead, three wounded,

626
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:10,935
and I was the only
one left conscious.

627
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm a translator, I use words,

628
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:17,427
but coming towards us with an AK-47,

629
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:18,856
an insurgent.

630
00:32:19,956 --> 00:32:22,051
He raised it, intending
to finish us off.

631
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,866
And that was the Devil?

632
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:28,070
I shot this man in the heart.

633
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,057
The Devil, that evil,

634
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:33,349
I saw it in his eyes,

635
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:35,797
but it was in me, too,
when I pulled that trigger.

636
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:38,303
You were defending
your unit, Mr. Vaziri.

637
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,224
This man lay dead at my feet.

638
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,281
I searched his body
for identification

639
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:47,923
and I found a photograph
of him with his little boy,

640
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:50,629
his wife laughing.

641
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:52,948
A family.

642
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,808
Tell me that the Devil
did not win on that day.

643
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:01,404
You didn't lose your faith.

644
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,355
You pray five times a day.

645
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:06,172
I have to believe that Allah
will show me how to live.

646
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,136
I found microfractures

647
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,574
on the maxillary and mandibular.

648
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:17,336
He was electrocuted?

649
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,339
The current must have passed
through his hand,

650
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,338
traveled across his body,
then out his back.

651
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:22,771
It was the muscle spasms

652
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:25,118
that caused his intestines
to rupture.

653
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,629
I should let Dr. Brennan
know right away.

654
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:28,754
Of course.

655
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,260
I did

656
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:35,713
think that...
wonder

657
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:38,153
if you considered us

658
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:41,310
to be the Great Satan.
I am familiar with that phrase.

659
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:42,725
I know.

660
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,474
I was there when you told
Dr. Hodgins that his T-shirt,

661
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,567
which read, "I am with
the Great Satan," 

662
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,237
is not suitable work attire.

663
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:02,081
Was Neal Lowery

664
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,666
receiving shock therapy?

665
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,032
No. Why?

666
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:07,218
Neal Lowery died
from being electrocuted.

667
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,171
ECT equipment generates

668
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,424
a maximum 225 volts.
And there's a fail-safe mechanism.

669
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,093
Our analysis indicates

670
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,863
that Neal Lowery endured
an extended shock

671
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,747
of at least 480 volts.

672
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:22,434
Is there anywhere in this complex
where 480 volts might be generated?

673
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:25,979
I think it would be best if we get
an electrical engineer to answer that.

674
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:28,440
A guy in Ward 4
believes he's Thomas Edison.

675
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:31,426
Sorry.

676
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,572
These are the electrical plans
for the retrofit

677
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,903
that was completed
at Havenhurst 15 years ago.

678
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:40,682
All the wiring and the breakers,
there's nothing more than 225 volts.

679
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:42,821
I'm scanning the original plans.

680
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:44,498
And they're from 1908.

681
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:49,920
On the original blueprints

682
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,525
there was a four-wire,

683
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,133
600 volt transformer
in the basement.

684
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:56,165
The southwest corner of the basement

685
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,887
where the old generator is
installed was sealed off.

686
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:02,015
Except for these all access panels.

687
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,825
They'd need those in case of a fire.

688
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,228
Dr. Copeland said that
Neal Lowery had a knack

689
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:08,856
for searching out nooks
and crannies to hide out in.

690
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:14,152
The access panel should be
down this corridor to the left.

691
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,346
- You got to be kidding me.
- Wait.

692
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,775
I also have an app that
gives you songs titles.

693
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,825
- You have to hum a few notes...
- Maybe later.

694
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,190
It should be behind all of this.

695
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,393
Look at that.

696
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,361
Check this out.

697
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,359
Someone was cooking heroin.

698
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,977
So, maybe Phillip
follows Neal down here,

699
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,188
sees him using,
decides to administer

700
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,418
a little electroshock on the spot.

701
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:00,240
Burnt flesh on the transformer.

702
00:36:01,114 --> 00:36:03,243
And blood on the water pipe.

703
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,484
Oh, my God.

704
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,835
The electrical circuit
must have been completed

705
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,942
when Neal backed
into this water pipe.

706
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:12,245
Look what I found.

707
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,567
"Welcome to hell."

708
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:40,030
I ran a simulation
of the electrocution

709
00:36:40,213 --> 00:36:43,200
based on the current that was generated
by the equipment at Havenhurst.

710
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,865
Wait, but he's not dead.

711
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,078
I know.

712
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,581
Based on Neal's age and weight,
plus the clothes he was wearing,

713
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,876
that current would've thrown him clear.
He should have survived.

714
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,635
Plus the muscular contortions
and spasms

715
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,632
were nowhere near violent enough
to fracture his wrist.

716
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,217
So, then what happened?

717
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:03,512
What if Neal Lowery wasn't
wearing his rubber-soled boots?

718
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,543
Okay, give me a second.

719
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:07,381
You know, I just don't think

720
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:10,217
that someone who just
shot himself up with heroin

721
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:12,604
is likely to put his boots on.

722
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:15,148
- Why?
- Well, 'cause he's on the nod.

723
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:17,324
That means that he

724
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,319
vomits and succumbs to the euphoria.

725
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,968
Listen to you, all street.

726
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:25,332
Maybe Phillip administered
the heroin to Neal,

727
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,899
as though it were some kind
of legitimate medicine.

728
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:29,997
Between the toes,
that's not legitimate.

729
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,790
The guy is crazy, Sweets.

730
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,340
But he's consistent.

731
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:35,675
Phillip operates rationally
behind his delusions.

732
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,310
He believes he's a doctor.

733
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:40,716
Angela, can you call up
a photo of Neal's boots

734
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,595
as they were found in the remains?

735
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:47,478
Here.

736
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,770
Let me get in closer.

737
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,563
Neal Lowery was left-handed.
He didn't tie these shoes.

738
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:56,273
What? How can you tell?

739
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,731
A left-handed person,
double knotting,

740
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:00,360
the second knot would loop behind.

741
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,170
This one loops in front.

742
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:05,699
But still it must have been
a left-handed person who tied the knot.

743
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:08,285
Only he or she must have
been facing the victim.

744
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,105
That is amazing.

745
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,373
I think.
It's al-it's also very confusing.

746
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,148
I am ready to run the simulation

747
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:18,462
with the boots removed
from the equation.

748
00:38:24,496 --> 00:38:26,858
That's it.
He was electrocuted first,

749
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:29,431
and then his boots put back on
after he was dead.

750
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:32,205
Double knots, that's the way
someone would treat a child.

751
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:34,686
I say we're looking
for somebody left-handed.

752
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:38,131
I say the killer may have left
his or her DNA on the laces.

753
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:49,156
It's not possible.

754
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:51,620
It's just not possible.
Gabe wouldn't kill his brother.

755
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:55,269
Mrs. Lowery, what you and
your family went through,

756
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:58,293
it's almost unbearable.

757
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:00,963
Gabe loved his brother.
Why would he do such a thing?

758
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,341
We know that Gabe went to visit Neal
the night he disappeared.

759
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:06,718
We believe that there
was another patient

760
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,747
named Phillip who told Gabe

761
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,886
about Neal's hide out
in the basement.

762
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,726
Gabe found Neal shooting up heroin.

763
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,692
Gabe struck Neal with a pipe,

764
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,134
Neal fell back into a transformer

765
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:23,406
and was electrocuted.

766
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,607
But the church?

767
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:28,615
The burning on the altar?

768
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:32,604
We all become angry at God
sometimes, Mrs. Lowery.

769
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,487
Who could blame him?

770
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,973
Why did God do this to my family?
We were good people.

771
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,081
And then...

772
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,429
this.

773
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:50,103
I'm sorry for your pain.

774
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:52,217
You?

775
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:55,475
You can't even imagine my pain.

776
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,996
I need to ask you some things.

777
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,500
You going to ask me
about God and the Devil?

778
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:29,468
You're going to ask me how God can
place such a burden on good people.

779
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,508
I'm going to ask you

780
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:34,899
how you still believe in a kind
God after a case like this.

781
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,767
Was my faith shaken?

782
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:41,063
It is.

783
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,148
It is?

784
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,544
I'll go home tonight
and I'll lie in bed

785
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,490
and I'll toss and I'll turn

786
00:40:48,891 --> 00:40:50,512
and I'll beat myself up.

787
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:54,034
And, I'll question everything.

788
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:55,931
Will you get your faith back?

789
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,038
Always have in the past.

790
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,666
So you have faith that
you will retain your faith?

791
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:05,003
Why?

792
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:06,507
Because, Bones,

793
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:10,926
the sun will come up
and tomorrow's a new day.

794
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,193
I know that feeling.

795
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:17,309
Really?

796
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:21,103
You know what it feels like
to get your faith back?

797
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:24,626
When I see effects and I'm
unable to discern the cause,

798
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:27,829
my faith in reason
and consequences is shaken.

799
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:30,762
Then what happens?

800
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,215
Two plus two equals four.

801
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,756
I put sugar in my coffee
and it tastes sweet.

802
00:41:39,648 --> 00:41:42,791
The sun comes up
because the world turns.

803
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,087
These things are beautiful to me.

804
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,287
There are mysteries
I will never understand,

805
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:55,971
but everywhere I look,

806
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:59,126
I see proof that for every effect

807
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:01,151
there is a corresponding cause,

808
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,348
even if I can't see it.

809
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:06,581
I find that reassuring.

810
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:10,110
And life is good again.

811
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,156
- Life is very good.
- Yes, it is.

812
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,579
