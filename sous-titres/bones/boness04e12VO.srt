1
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:10,509
That must be them there near
that big piece of nothing.

2
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,555
According to my GPS,
it's where Texas turns into Oklahoma.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,877
Oh, great,

4
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:19,069
right in the middle
of a jurisdictional pissing contest.

5
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,387
Look, I'm out of water.
Give me yours.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,361
Are y'all FBI?

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,171
FBI Special Agent Seely Booth.

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,184
This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

9
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,092
- Welcome to Oklahoma, ma'am.
- Welcome to Texas, ma'am.

10
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:38,427
Guy, welcome
to the United States of America.

11
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:41,302
- Where are the remains, please?
- Oh, right here.

12
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,423
Hardly any flesh left.

13
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:51,328
It's very dry here,

14
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,220
so I'm guessing the time of death
was some months ago.

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,764
How do you think they died?

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,933
They left Oklahoma, hit Texas,
then died of despair.

17
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:01,852
Nope, they're definitely Oklahomans.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,313
If they were from Texas,
they'd had sense to carry water.

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,329
That wouldn't show up in the bones.

20
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:07,900
No clothing.

21
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,474
Might have blown away.

22
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,029
Maybe a young couple,
some kind of suicide pact?

23
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:15,157
Sub-pubic angle
suggests two females.

24
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,577
- Lesbian suicide pact.
- Definitely Texans, then.

25
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:22,498
The victims were Pygopagus,
or some would say Illeopagus.

26
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,791
- What?
- Greek?

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,751
- Conjoined twins.
- What's that?

28
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,211
Siamese twins.

29
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,797
The point of attachment
is posterior.

30
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:31,746
Joined at the ass.

31
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,175
Definitely Texans.

32
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:36,581
- So what do we got here, Doc?
- It's a federal case, boys.

33
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,615
The FBI will take jurisdiction.

34
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,183
Conjoined twin births

35
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,898
occur once every 85,000 births.

36
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,484
The same frequency
as hermaphroditic births.

37
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,238
Oh, Mr. Nigel Murray,
we've so missed your insights.

38
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,430
- Thank you.
- Why weren't the remains

39
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:57,816
dispersed by scavengers?

40
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:00,114
The depression
in the earth suggested that

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,788
that they were buried
in an extremely shallow grave.

42
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,846
The remains were spotted by
an oil survey team from a helicopter.

43
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,835
The question is,
what exposed the bones?

44
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:11,464
Well, there was a sandstorm
in that area eight days ago.

45
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,357
Sustained winds of 60 miles an hour,
gusts of about 80.

46
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,326
Their molars have not completely emerged
and root development is incomplete.

47
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:22,141
Indicating that the victims were
between 19 and 21 years of age.

48
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,726
Guys, hello?

49
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,228
ID'ing them is not going
to be a problem.

50
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,439
How many sets of conjoined twins
can there be?

51
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:32,693
Over the last 500 years,
approximately 600 sets.

52
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,737
Over 70% women.

53
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,281
I did not expect him to know that.

54
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,160
Well, all facts are useful.
It's just the context that shifts.

55
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,748
I bet I could just go search for

56
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,290
missing Siamese twins
and find them in, like, ten minutes.

57
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,083
By all means, give it a shot.

58
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,084
The victims had two
separate spinal columns

59
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,768
fused distally at the lower
sacral level extending to the pelvis.

60
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,759
No other vertebral anomalies.

61
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,220
Neither one of them could've survived
the death of the other.

62
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,014
So murder-suicide.
Suicide-murder.

63
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,982
- Or vice-versa.
- That was vice-versa.

64
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:09,496
Soil beneath the skeletons
was full of weirdness.

65
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,440
Quite a bit of decomposed cotton.

66
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,275
We didn't see any fabric.

67
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,736
Wow, it's decomposed.

68
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,488
It's fairly cheap stuff, too.
I think they were wrapped in a sheet.

69
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,454
Naked, wrapped in a sheet.

70
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,423
Sweets will've something to say
about that.

71
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:24,995
Also I found soil-dwelling mites:
Genus Ameronothrus.

72
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,873
Nearest place they could've picked up
soil mites was hundreds of miles away.

73
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,543
And decomposed popcorn.

74
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,728
- They were killed at the movies?
- I have a theory...

75
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,089
The circus.

76
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:38,217
Kind of stole my thunder there.

77
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:41,011
But, yeah, yeah,
the traveling circus.

78
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,448
I found them.

79
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:44,721
Already?

80
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,807
- The circus.
- The circus.

81
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,142
The circus.

82
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:58,594
"Abracadabra" was first uttered
to cure hay fever.

83
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,451
Conjoined twins wrapped in a sheet?

84
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,055
According to Hodgins.

85
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,500
It would help to know
how they were wrapped.

86
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,249
All the evidence is gone with wind.

87
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,399
- No other clothing?
- According to Hodgins.

88
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,962
The murder didn't want anyone
to identify them from their clothes.

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,483
They're conjoined twins.

90
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,869
You might as well buried them with
their driver's licenses in their hands.

91
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,429
Wrapped naked bodies
often indicate a careful burial,

92
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,208
or of course, sexual assault.

93
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,914
You know what?
That's creepy.

94
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,293
We got to get going there,

95
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,862
- Where?
- Texas. That's where the circus is.

96
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:35,343
Circus folk are extremely
tight-lipped and close-knit.

97
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:37,941
- They won't tell you anything.
- How do you know?

98
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,487
I... you know, I've read articles.

99
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,241
You're the worst liar I have ever met.
You read articles?

100
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,939
Even I know he's lying.

101
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:47,161
Okay, I'm adopted.

102
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,246
You know what?
My story isn't important here.

103
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,128
No, it's very important.
Go ahead.

104
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,332
I...

105
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:55,150
when I reached the age of majority,

106
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:57,591
I tried to find my birth mother,

107
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:01,932
a psychic who worked the circus
and carnival circuit in Florida.

108
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,303
Bio mom was a carney.

109
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,265
You know what?
Let's stay on track.

110
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,641
The point is
no one would talk to me.

111
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,127
- Were you wearing a suit?
- You'll be wearing a suit,

112
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:14,104
they won't open up to you, either.
I'm just trying to be helpful here.

113
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,148
I suspect Sweets is right.

114
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:19,151
I studied a carnival
for six weeks as research

115
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,253
for my cultural
anthropology dissertation,

116
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,984
no one would tell me anything.

117
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,118
Even though I became
quite adept on the high wire.

118
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,662
Fine. If they're going to talk
to their own, we will go undercover.

119
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,766
- What?
- If we're joining a circus,

120
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:34,166
we'll need an act.
I am quite adept on the high wire.

121
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,210
No, we'll have a knife-throwing act.

122
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:37,926
- I can't throw knives.
- I can.

123
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,089
I had the best knife skills
in the Rangers.

124
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,666
We're going to join the circus.

125
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,787
We're going to join the circus.

126
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,276
Bones - Season 04 Episode 12
"Double Trouble in the Panhandle"

127
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,229
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

128
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,126
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

129
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,297
OK, so we're going to talk
to the twins'mother here in Ft. Worth,

130
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,138
then we'll pick up our mobile home.

131
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,102
And we'll join the circus
right outside Waco.

132
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:29,068
- "Our mobile home"?
- Yeah, we're circus folks, Bones.

133
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:32,182
We crisscross the country
in a mobile home.

134
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,023
I'll have the field office here
paint up something special for us.

135
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:37,813
Is that all you need to get a job
at the circus, a mobile home?

136
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,236
You know what? It's going to help.
It's showy,

137
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,859
we're show people.

138
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,733
It's always possible that
we'll talk to the girls'mother

139
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,072
and solve this whole case tonight.

140
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,324
- Right?
- I hope not.

141
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:50,617
What?

142
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,484
I should've never let those girls
leave this home.

143
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,883
Worst thing that can happen
to a mother, isn't it?

144
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,844
Finding out
that you outlived your child.

145
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,737
- Unnatural.
- Except for societies with

146
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:13,414
infant mortality rates.

147
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,351
My understanding is you tried to sue
the circus several times, Mrs. Van Owen.

148
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,603
It's Mrs. Hicks.

149
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,856
Dell Hicks here
is my husband and my lawyer.

150
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:24,118
- Dell helped me sue the circus for...
- Loss of income,

151
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,778
alienation of affection,

152
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,906
civil rights abuses,
animal abuses, improper hiring,

153
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:31,992
emotional distress,
mental anguish...

154
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:35,370
- Any of these go to court?
- It's just a matter of time.

155
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:39,224
- You really hated that circus.
- They stole my daughters.

156
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,023
I'll do anything
to get back at them for that.

157
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,089
- When did you last see your daughters?
- Four months ago.

158
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,341
They told us
to butt out of their lives.

159
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,802
Jenny did.

160
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,700
If one of the girls
wanted something,

161
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:52,638
it was the same
as both of them wanting it.

162
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,988
If Jenny wanted something,
then they both want wanted it.

163
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,883
Didn't matter what Julie wanted.

164
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,444
I took a look at their remains, and

165
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,132
I had to wonder if you ever considered
having them surgically separated?

166
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:06,159
It was too dangerous.

167
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,569
I disagree.

168
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,552
So did Jenny and Dr. Muir.

169
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:13,142
Well, Julie and I thought
it was too dangerous.

170
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,064
Your daughters disagreed on whether
or not they should be separated?

171
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,792
Dr. Muir's office here
in Fort Worth?

172
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,004
I'm sure you understand
that my responses

173
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,572
to your questions about
the Van Owen sisters is

174
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:30,876
is somewhat tempered
by patient privilege.

175
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,972
Well, they're murder victims, right?

176
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,433
Patient privilege no longer applies.

177
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,077
Ah, yes, of course.

178
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,531
I've never had
a patient murdered before.

179
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:44,648
You thought that the twins
could safely be separated.

180
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,692
- Yes.
- I agree.

181
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:48,257
As did Jenny.

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,863
But Julie and her mother disagreed.

183
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,072
She and her...

184
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,450
ambulance chaser husband
tried to sue me.

185
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,583
- So how did you leave things?
- Well, in the end,

186
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,861
it didn't matter what
the rest of us thought.

187
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,583
Julie and Jenny were going
to have to come to an agreement.

188
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:05,460
I wonder if they thought
they could continue

189
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,899
to work in the circus
if they were separated?

190
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,964
Well, they both loved the circus.

191
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,376
Jenny told me once that they had

192
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,011
some ideas on
how to expand their act.

193
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:20,017
Sounds like Jenny was the bossy one
and Julie was a little nicer?

194
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:23,184
They were like any other sisters.

195
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:26,397
They had distinct personalities
and strengths.

196
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,903
If there's anything else
I can do to help the FBI...

197
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,281
Yeah, tell you what. Why don't you send,
the records to the FBI in Washington.

198
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,992
- Why can't you simply take them?
- We have another appointment.

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,827
Thank you for your cooperation.

200
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,134
The FBI did a wonderful job
with this trailer.

201
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,567
Okay, just lose
the Katharine Hepburn voice.

202
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,717
I'm just trying to find my character,
you know, acting.

203
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,834
Well, don't.
It sounds ridiculous, okay, Bones?

204
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:58,972
What's my name there, Wanda?

205
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,968
It's written right there on the side
of the truck, which "high wire" is not.

206
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:06,438
It's just sometimes you get irritated
and you say "Booth" without thinking.

207
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,775
I don't do anything without thinking,
ever... Buck.

208
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:19,117
Buck and Wanda
and their Knives of Death?

209
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,497
- Never heard of you.
- We worked the Pacific Northwest,

210
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,830
Canada, Alaska.

211
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,333
I guess that makes you
the beautiful assistant then?

212
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,835
Wanda, yes. I'm also
quite adept on the high wire.

213
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,631
I got to admit, it would be nice to have
a knife-throwing act around.

214
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,758
Well, folks,
they love a little danger.

215
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:37,427
- So what's your thing?
- Our thing?

216
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,294
Yeah, your gimmick.
You know,

217
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,098
cowboy and Indian princess?

218
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,767
Pirate and kidnapped princess?

219
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,436
Jack the Ripper and princess?

220
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,763
- We're Russian.
- Or Cowboy and Indian princess thing.

221
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,817
No, no,
the Russian thing sounds good.

222
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,436
- It does?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,955
OK, yeah. We're Russki.

224
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,281
All right. Well, you do
the first show for free,

225
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,574
and if I like you,
then we talk payment.

226
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,917
You... you ain't seen nothing yet.

227
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,964
You two
ain't the first of May, are you?

228
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:17,050
- No. In fact, we are not...
- We are no first of May.

229
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,635
We're no first of May.

230
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,222
This is Lavalle.
He's our 24-hour man.

231
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,516
Lavalle, meet Buck and Wanda Moosejaw.
They do a barber act.

232
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,010
Moosejaw?

233
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,186
- What are you, Indian?
- Canadian.

234
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,224
He will show you
where to park your digs.

235
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,441
- You can get ready for the show.
- They any good?

236
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:33,775
How about that?

237
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,528
Being able to splinter a post
don't make you any kind of a showman.

238
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,322
Oh, we're show people, all right.

239
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:40,280
You will be amazed.

240
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,751
- Russian? You had to pick Russian.
- I know. Brilliant, right?

241
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,003
- It just popped into my head.
- You know what?

242
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,751
Don't pop things, Bones.

243
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,994
Sweets, what the hell
is the first of May?

244
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,621
A newbie. A rookie.

245
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:02,512
Why would a little person
be referred to as a 24-hour man?

246
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,598
Oh, having a little trouble
with the lingo?

247
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,468
He is the advance person.

248
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,655
He goes to town ahead of the circus

249
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:12,431
and sets everything up. If you like,
I could e-mail you a lexicon.

250
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,316
I would certainly appreciate that.

251
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,484
Sure.

252
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,670
Can I offer a piece of advice?

253
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,273
That's why we called you, Sweets.

254
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,652
Don't try too hard
to be their friends.

255
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,743
Act like you're more interested
in each other than any of them.

256
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:26,676
All right? They will come to you.

257
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,788
Okay, thanks.

258
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:30,866
So... sex, right?

259
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:33,853
Oh, good idea.

260
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,284
Okay.

261
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,438
Okay, well, I think
what we need to do is

262
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,134
get a syncopated rhythm
going that takes advantage

263
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,341
of the natural frequency
of the springs.

264
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,473
Are you this spontaneous
during real sex?

265
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:47,849
Yes, I am.

266
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,239
What do you think?

267
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:59,485
Let's just hope they're as good
outside the trailer as they are in.

268
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:02,780
I'll give them good marks
for staying power.

269
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,309
- I don't know what that is.
- I can try to balance.

270
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,966
- Getting settled in, Moosejaw?
- Yep.

271
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,714
Nice tent. Very...

272
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,471
- It's a piece of crap.
- Right.

273
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,510
Let's just pray
there's no wind or rain.

274
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,804
Hate for it to collapse
on paying customers.

275
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:30,543
- There something we can help you with?
- Aim me at the Van Owen sisters.

276
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,396
- The Van Owen sisters?
- Yeah, sisters, jugglers,

277
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,355
Julie and Jenny, joined at the hip.

278
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,674
Literally.

279
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,358
Yeah, funny.
How do you know them?

280
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,377
I worked a carney up
in Alaska last year.

281
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:43,283
Nice kids. Said they were
coming down here to work at Bingham's.

282
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,115
I'm afraid you missed them.

283
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,786
They... they moved on...
Well, when was it, Lavalle?

284
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:52,912
After Petersburg, wasn't it?

285
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,905
Julie and Jenny
don't work here anymore.

286
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,999
- Where'd they go?
- You know what?

287
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:02,211
I think I got a note in here
somewhere from them that they left.

288
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,164
"Thanks for everything. We loved
working here, and we love all of you,

289
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,934
"but we've decided to take
another direction in our lives.

290
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,228
"You'll always be family.
Love, Julie and Jenny."

291
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,481
- Doesn't sound like them.
- It sounds like Julie.

292
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,957
- Not Jenny.
- Well, maybe

293
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,734
they were forced to leave
under duress.

294
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,069
Listen to the five-dollar words
the target can use.

295
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,835
She likes to read the dictionary.

296
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,948
Tough girl, Jenny.

297
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,825
Yeah, the rubes sure loved them.

298
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,453
Them quitting probably hurt
your box office.

299
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,846
Sweetheart...

300
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,177
I got nothing but trouble
at the box office.

301
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,005
I'm sure we'll run into the girls
somewhere or another. I mean,

302
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,046
there's not many circuses
anymore, right?

303
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,393
Food's ready in the mess tent.

304
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:46,213
If you two can drag yourselves
out of your trailer, I'll

305
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,803
introduce you
to the rest of the gang.

306
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,370
"Duress"?

307
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,941
- Real smart.
- What? Why?

308
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:54,249
- Just because I'm in a carnival.
- Forget it.

309
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:58,021
Doesn't mean I can't read books
and have a good vocabular...

310
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,327
Is it more impressive that they can
do that joined at the hip or less?

311
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,647
Twins die an average
of ten years apart,

312
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:18,250
even when they are
genetically identical.

313
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,952
Not helpful.

314
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,671
Ah, X-rays from
the twins'doctor in Dallas.

315
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,589
Okay, notice the antemortem

316
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,752
bone lesion in the carpal capitate,

317
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,678
suggesting a stab wound on the hand.

318
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,514
Did you see the video?
They were juggling machetes.

319
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,518
Found particulates of magnesium
carbonate on both girls.

320
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,229
Do you have any
fascinating trivia on that subject?

321
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:42,107
One man's trivia
is another man's wisdom.

322
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,430
The chalk used in flooring,

323
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:49,114
fireproofing, cosmetics,
toothpaste and laxatives.

324
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,700
Obviously, we are on
the lookout for a clean-toothed,

325
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,161
eye shadow wearing,
constipated contractor.

326
00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:00,917
Brennan sent a photograph of the note
the twins left at the circus.

327
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,888
How long will it take you
to analyze it?

328
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:05,547
I found something pretty interesting
just by looking at it.

329
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,300
You said Jenny
was the left-handed twin.

330
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:10,341
- Yes.
- Correct.

331
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,138
The smudges and the slants
on the letter indicate

332
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,600
that the note was written
by the left-handed twin.

333
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,518
On a standard keyboard,

334
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,814
there are over 3,000 words that can be
touch-typed with the left hand alone.

335
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:24,816
It's not typed; it's handwritten.

336
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:27,236
How many can be typed
with the right hand?

337
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,071
450. Thank you ever
so much for asking me.

338
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,162
Please don't encourage him.

339
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,825
The point is, "Jenny"

340
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:36,494
was signed with a right hand,
while "Julie"

341
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,121
signed the note with a left.

342
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,251
This note was obviously
not written by them, guys.

343
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,716
It's fake.

344
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:51,885
Can you look at them?

345
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,322
Clowns.

346
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,015
The psychiatric term for
fear of clowns is coulrophobia.

347
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,487
It's not fear; it's hate, okay?
Big difference.

348
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,032
- You mind?
- Sure, have a seat.

349
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,774
Buck, Wanda, this is
Magnum the Strongman,

350
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,192
and this is Madame Nina.

351
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:10,320
- Oh, are those your legal names?
- Is Wanda yours?

352
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,990
Buck and Wanda...
they knew Jenny and Julie.

353
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,273
I miss those girls.

354
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:17,667
We all do.

355
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,038
- Not the clowns.
- Why is that?

356
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:21,906
The girls were trying a new act.

357
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:24,263
They borrowed some of the clowns'
equipment without asking.

358
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:27,456
- They should have stuck to juggling.
- They were trying to save the circus.

359
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,596
They wanted more time
in front of the audience.

360
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,976
Not Julie, she wanted
to spend more time with her boyfriend.

361
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,121
- Julie had a boyfriend?
- But her sister was

362
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,223
literally right beside her
all the time.

363
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,495
People can't help
who they fall in love with.

364
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:46,022
When you fall in love with an outsider,
that's the end of circus life.

365
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,231
- Who was it?
- He was a gillie.

366
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,111
- What's a gillie?
- A gillie's an outsider.

367
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,766
So, one of the girls had a boyfriend.
You're sitting on my clothes.

368
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,576
Sorry,
but it's kind of tight in here.

369
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,271
Which is why you shouldn't throw
your underwear on the floor.

370
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:02,565
- They fell.
- No,

371
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,333
don't blame gravity
for a lack of tidiness.

372
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,124
Is there only one bed there?

373
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,462
Can we please hit rewind?

374
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,288
One of the girls had a boyfriend?

375
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,091
- Yes.
- Only one of them?

376
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,309
I mean, how did they,
you know, when they were...

377
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,956
- I don't see physically how they...
- Okay, look, that's not the issue.

378
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:23,601
Just take that image
out of your mind and pretend

379
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,520
that they are separate individuals,

380
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,092
and ask yourself if you found anything
that suggested a relationship.

381
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:35,447
Yeah, sorry. Still working on
the mind picture eradication thing.

382
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:38,726
Did you find anything
on one of the sisters

383
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,785
that you didn't find
present on the other?

384
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,538
Yeah, actually. Yeah, I did.

385
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,273
Residue of polyelectrolyte polymers
under the fingernails of Julie,

386
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:50,194
and not Jenny.
It was polyvinylpyrrolidone.

387
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,546
What is that, makeup?

388
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,506
It's not makeup; it's hair gel.

389
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,161
Seems that Julie was running
her fingers through someone's hair.

390
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,720
- Julie was the one with a boyfriend?
- Can you identify a brand?

391
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:01,806
No, but it would smell
a lot like sandalwood.

392
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,137
Smooth sure Power Hold.

393
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:09,105
It's definitely on the list
of possible products, yeah.

394
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,902
Dr. Muir was wearing a ton of hair gel
that smelled just like sandalwood.

395
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,059
What? Son of a barber, OK?

396
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,738
I know my traditional hair products.

397
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,324
So, Julie was having an affair
with Dr. Muir?

398
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,395
If we leave now, we can question them
and be back in a couple of hours.

399
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,164
No, not in this thing.

400
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,304
And we have a show.
We can't be late.

401
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,358
We're not circus performers, okay?
We solve murders.

402
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,248
Yeah, we're undercover
murder solvers,

403
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,917
and if we don't make it back in time,
we'll blow our cover.

404
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:37,077
Tell you what, I will search
for a faster vehicle. All right?

405
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:39,610
Oh, but first,
I got to go scavenge, you know,

406
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:42,847
some Russian costumes because
somebody said we did a Russian act.

407
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,453
It was a great idea.

408
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,392
Dr. Brennan,

409
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,103
if you do have to perform,
any chance that you could

410
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,980
set up a Webcam so we could watch?

411
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:54,609
You know, to see if we might be
of any help with the case, I mean.

412
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:56,778
Yeah, absolutely. Anything to help.

413
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:03,969
- You bring our real clothes?
- Yes, they're in the bag.

414
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:05,882
Where did you learn
to drive this thing?

415
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,039
You're kidding me, right?
I'm a cop.

416
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,211
We should really talk about our act.

417
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,544
Two complementary fractures

418
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,800
on each of the victims'craniums.

419
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,803
Like their heads were
cracked together?

420
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,304
- Interesting fact.
- Yes, but is it pertinent?

421
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,595
Indeed.

422
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,781
In the fraternity of forensic
anthropologists,

423
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,561
these are known as
"kissing fractures."

424
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,646
Heads knocked together
is the cause of death?

425
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,018
Little known fact.

426
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,525
There were actually six men
known as the three stooges.

427
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,611
So, we're going with the three
stooges as the cause of death.

428
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:41,072
Such would be my inclination.

429
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,335
I'll let you pass that nugget
on to Dr. Brennan

430
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,121
when you tell her
about the fractures.

431
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,422
I already sent off
the girls'medical records.

432
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:56,205
I'm not sure how else
I could help you.

433
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,590
I want to run my fingers
through your hair.

434
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:01,726
- Why?
- To prove you were

435
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,720
in a sexual relationship
with Julie VanOwen.

436
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,431
And running your fingers
through my hair will prove that?

437
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,273
I tell you what, look Dr. Brennan up
on the an internet.

438
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,681
She's getting very famous
for this kind of stuff.

439
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:14,731
You're not gonna understand this.

440
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,150
- You had a threesome?
- Absolutely not.

441
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,716
I dated Jenny first,
and then I fell in love with Julie.

442
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:23,573
Jenny didn't really like that.

443
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,001
That's why he recommended
separating the twins.

444
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,264
That's not true.

445
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:30,038
My recommendation was
totally objective.

446
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,307
Maybe their mother found out
and sued his life away.

447
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:34,726
Which is the only reason we kept
the relationship a secret.

448
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:36,044
Relationship.

449
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,588
- Sexual relationship?
- How?

450
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,924
Well, when you were...
I'm trying to understand.

451
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:44,844
- When you and Julie...
- The girls had separate genitalia.

452
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,096
A fair amount of privacy
could be achieved

453
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,600
by an eye mask and an mp3 player
turned up very loud.

454
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,312
Julie liked the kings of leon.
Jenny liked maroon 5.

455
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:57,403
The american medical association is

456
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:59,192
going to take away your license.

457
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,569
- That's a motive for murder.
- We should arrest him.

458
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,964
Wait. On what charges?

459
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,824
Definitely positive for the whole
suspicion of murder thing, but,

460
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,296
you know, the other thing is just,

461
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:10,286
it's a little confusing.

462
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,380
Can you go faster?
We'll miss the show.

463
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,449
We're making great time, bones.
All right, relax.

464
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,694
All right, a little help there.
Phone's ringing. I'm kind of busy.

465
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,580
Okay.
Should we talk about our act?

466
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:29,707
We need costumes.

467
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,518
We don't need the russian costumes.
We're dropping the act.

468
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,545
What?
You can throw knives. I saw it.

469
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,938
I know I can, but we caught
the bad guy, all right.

470
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:39,100
We don't need to go undercover.
What are you doing?

471
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,883
Digging for loose change?

472
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,736
Got it.

473
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:47,281
Special agent seeley booth's phone, dr.
Temperance brennan speaking.

474
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,206
Dallas field office.
It's for you.

475
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:52,165
Yeah, of course it is.
It's my phone.

476
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,772
Then ask'em what they want.

477
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,455
What is this about, please?

478
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,128
They say that all of Dr. Muir's

479
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,402
alibis checked out and they can't
hold him for murder.

480
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:01,840
He didn't kill the twins?

481
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,276
He couldn't have driven
all the way to

482
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:06,509
the texas/oklahoma border
during that time.

483
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,354
Now can we talk about our act?

484
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:11,291
- I do know a few words in russian.
- Oh, no.

485
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,697
Vincent provided me with
the approximate forces

486
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:20,390
it would take to cause the kissing
fractures to the twins'skulls.

487
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,234
Approximately 300 pounds
per square inch,

488
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,862
which is, by the way,
the same as a pit bull's bite.

489
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:29,085
- Were they attacked by a pit bull?
- Not a likely scenario.

490
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,918
See how this works, mr.
Nigel-murray?

491
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,708
A kind of mental winnowing process?

492
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,833
Okay.

493
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:36,789
Scenario number one.

494
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:38,849
Whiplash.

495
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:40,794
No.

496
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,919
No?

497
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:45,647
There'd be evidence of trauma
in the vertebrae as well.

498
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,459
Excellent mental winnowing.

499
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,677
Okay. Scenario number two.

500
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:51,371
A fall.

501
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,284
The rest of the skeleton would
have showed evidence of a fall.

502
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,603
Scenario number three,

503
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,481
they are assaulted separately
by a weapon.

504
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:07,463
That's possible.

505
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,198
- No, actually it's not.
- Why not?

506
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,212
Because the wounds are
absolutely symmetrical here.

507
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:15,828
The possibility of an assailant
striking them separately

508
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,164
at the exact same angle
with the exact same force...

509
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,690
It ain't going to happen.

510
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:23,205
Okay, well, the heads could
have been conked together.

511
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:27,632
There'd be evidence on
the soft tissue of the face.

512
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,592
There was no soft tissue left.

513
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,471
What if the blunt
instrument was soft?

514
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,061
Like a pillow?

515
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,909
Oh, wait a second.

516
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,163
Clown props.

517
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:44,712
- I'll call booth and Dr. Brennan.
- Nice.

518
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:48,853
When cortez conquered the aztecs,

519
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:51,181
clowns were among the many treasures

520
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:53,991
he carried back to clement VII.

521
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:55,697
Thank you.

522
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:03,942
- You ready?
- Yes.

523
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:07,255
Ready to throw knives
at beautiful woman.

524
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,173
- Not at, I hope.
- Right, no, of course.

525
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,383
Around her.

526
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,206
Wow, wanda.

527
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:16,139
You look...

528
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,910
You too, boris.

529
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:20,309
You make beautiful natasha.

530
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,771
Man, you, you act like it's
the first time you've done this.

531
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,481
We like to keep things fresh.

532
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,148
So I've seen.

533
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,941
Okay, so...

534
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,301
I stand against a board,

535
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:34,304
right, with balloons all
around me and then

536
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,652
you pop them
with your razor sharp knives?

537
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:40,163
Right. Unless we do our actual
job and find the murder weapon.

538
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:42,206
What's with the moustache?

539
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:45,319
- I thought it'd add a russian flair.
- It looks like a small animal.

540
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:49,508
There's a giant
plastic ice cream cone,

541
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,009
giant plastic shoe,
giant plastic phone,

542
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:54,974
giant plastic...

543
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,725
- You mind telling me what you're doing?
- Or what, you're going to play tough?

544
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,661
You're clowns, right?

545
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:04,145
I throw knives.

546
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,481
- Let's kick his ass.
- Bring it on, bozo.

547
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,067
Uh, we're just looking
for a prop that's all.

548
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,111
Buck here is going to knock

549
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,363
this nose off my face with a knife.

550
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,093
Why does everyone think the clown
stuff is there for everyone?

551
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,952
This is our stuff!

552
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,592
Let's kick his ass, you guys!

553
00:26:21,717 --> 00:26:24,405
Traditionally,
clowns are fun loving and anarchistic.

554
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,001
You are rigid and humorless.

555
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,748
Let's kick both their asses!

556
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:30,880
You better have your biggest
ass-kicking shoes on.

557
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,090
Stop!

558
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,012
Y'all want to have a clem, that's
your business, but after the show.

559
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,018
Tumbles, I'm serious.

560
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,814
All right, let's go, guys.

561
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,618
Not so funny now, hey, tumbles?

562
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,866
That's enough, moosejaw.

563
00:26:53,815 --> 00:26:54,843
We're lining up.

564
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,586
You two damn well better be ready.

565
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,618
I'm ready.
How about you?

566
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,577
I'm ready.

567
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,996
- Oh, god! Bones
- My eye.

568
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:04,997
You okay?

569
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,095
I'm okay.

570
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,626
Well, we can't do the show now.

571
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,200
What? No!

572
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,963
The show must go on!

573
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,840
Says who?

574
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,582
Ladies and Gentlemens,

575
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,596
and children of all ages.

576
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,516
Welcome to bingham's
circus of wonders.

577
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,352
The most sensational, death-defying

578
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,145
one ring spectacular

579
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:29,896
on Earth.

580
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,846
They're clapping for us.

581
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,348
Smile, Boris. And wave.

582
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:06,542
Show them your knives!

583
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,020
Come on.
Where's the buck moosejaw I married?

584
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,164
- I got props.
- Props? For what?

585
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,333
Props. Objects for you
to throw knives at.

586
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,210
No, no. You are going to
stand against the board still.

587
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,297
I am going to throw knives around you.
But not too close.

588
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,193
That does not sound
like a very good act.

589
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,676
I'm sure the crowd is
expecting a lot more than that.

590
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,345
There is no act. Remember?

591
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,649
There's just me trying
not to kill you.

592
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,017
What... you said you were very good,
trained in knife skills by the military.

593
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,285
I am very good.

594
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,187
But it's you I am concerned for.

595
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,396
Well, if you say you're skilled then
I have no reason to doubt you, do i?

596
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,986
You know it's not good for
the barbers to fight before a show.

597
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,143
Those things are sharp.

598
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:05,910
Let's just get through this,
all right, mrs. Moosejaw?

599
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:07,242
Okay.

600
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:11,773
Look at that.

601
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:15,002
The clowns are using
those fake barbells.

602
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:20,424
One of them could've clocked
the twins

603
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,122
and smashed their heads together.

604
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:25,337
The bar joing the foam
weights together is too short.

605
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,118
The fulcrum wouldn't give
any of them sufficient force

606
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:29,648
to cause the kissing fractures.

607
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:31,995
But they're clowns.
They have their ways.

608
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:35,892
You're up.

609
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,139
And now,

610
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:41,320
direct from their triumphant
tour of europe and the far east,

611
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,507
bingham's circus of wonders
is proud to present

612
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,492
the razor sharp skills

613
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,662
of the most thrilling,
the most breathtaking,

614
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,749
the most dangerous
knife throwing act in the world.

615
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,833
Boris and natasha...

616
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,908
and their russian knives of death!

617
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:07,513
What's up with brennan's eye?

618
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,890
An eye patch.
That's very rakish.

619
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
Plus she only has to
be half as scared.

620
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,523
Bones, just keep your arms
outstretched like...

621
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,776
This, Okay?
Be very, very still.

622
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,875
Shouldn't the balloons
be closer to my body?

623
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,464
Not if you want to live.

624
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,482
Natasha's balloons are no match

625
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,004
for boris's knives of death!

626
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,250
Boris,

627
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,888
moya lyubov,
spare the life of your lyubov.

628
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:12,933
Definitely.

629
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,768
Are they sure they know
what they're doing?

630
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,227
You really are as good as you said.
You should try a blindfold.

631
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,208
Yeah, says the half blind woman.

632
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,413
Is it me, or does she seem
a little too into this?

633
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:00,551
There is, of course, a sexual
component to an act of this sort,

634
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,582
- the knife representing...
- we get it.

635
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:05,941
Dr. Brennan is showing
remarkable trust and willingness.

636
00:33:06,845 --> 00:33:08,289
Be careful!

637
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:09,987
She's only got one eye left!

638
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:55,578
Well, how about that?!

639
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,104
Let's hear it for them, folks.

640
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:02,106
Boris the brave
and the knee-knockingly lovely natasha!

641
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:03,458
Come on, boris.

642
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,777
Let them hear it, folks!

643
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,923
They loved us.

644
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:12,393
You were great.

645
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,802
Superb hand-eye coordination there,
buckie.

646
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,178
I could have killed you.

647
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,363
Therein lies the excitement
for the spectators.

648
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:22,735
... super strong, mighty magnum!

649
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,939
- Oh, my god.
- What?

650
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:28,607
Magnum, look!

651
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,931
He definitely has the upper
body strength to swing

652
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:39,034
the foam barbell hard enough
to cause those fractures.

653
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,495
Check out those arms of steel!

654
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,834
Hey there, big guy,
you got a minute?

655
00:34:47,515 --> 00:34:48,424
For what?

656
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:51,672
I want to ask you a question
about my friends, Julie and Jenny.

657
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:54,237
No, this is getting old.

658
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,136
I told you, they were here,
they left, that's all I know.

659
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,971
Check with some
other circuses maybe.

660
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,484
They're dead but you knew that,
didn't you?

661
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,142
Dead?
What are you talking about?

662
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,321
Their heads were smashed together.

663
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,562
Weren't they?

664
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:13,819
Geez!

665
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:17,912
- That guy is strong.
- He is called the strongman.

666
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:20,325
- Help me get out of this.
- I'm trying to get out!

667
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,264
Look, I wanna put a bolo on
this guy right away.

668
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,354
Magnum the strongman, real name:
norman von gluck.

669
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:32,202
Well, of course he's big,
he's a strongman.

670
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,835
He's wearing a tank top
that says "magnum"...

671
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,599
shouldn't be too hard to spot.

672
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,179
Mr. Nigel-murray has found
some additional bone anomalies.

673
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,276
- Can you explain?
- "Anomaly"

674
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,141
from the greek "anomalos."

675
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,352
I'm thinking we could move this
along a bit faster, mr. Nigel-murray.

676
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:51,244
I found slight
longitudinal fractures

677
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,991
along the distal ends of all four
lower leg bones and

678
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:56,902
stress fractures on their cuboids.

679
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,198
Fractures to
the lower legs and feet.

680
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,117
Did the guy torture them first?
Rubber hose to the feet?

681
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,188
That wouldn't be consistent
with the injuries,

682
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:06,516
which are isolated
to those specific areas.

683
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:07,932
Can you send me the x-rays?

684
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:09,744
- The x-rays...
- They're on their way.

685
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,668
I was more than capable
of telling her that.

686
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,630
I was afraid you'd start talking
about wilhelm conrad

687
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,340
and the discovery of the x-ray.

688
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,175
November 8th, 1895.

689
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,172
He made an image of
his wife's hand...

690
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:21,496
I rest my case.

691
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:23,555
By the way, we all loved your show.

692
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,589
Oh, thank you.
Did you hear the cheering?

693
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:26,809
It was all for me.

694
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,392
Booth was undeniably good.

695
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:31,768
However he's not very imaginative
as far as the act goes.

696
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,274
Look, there is a difference
between imagination

697
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,703
and tempting fate.

698
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,203
I am just asking for a little flair.

699
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:40,906
- Flair?! You want flair then...
- Can I ask about the eye?

700
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,282
No.

701
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,514
I was thinking that I could wear
a hat of fruit

702
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,893
and then you could slice
through each fruit, while...

703
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:51,769
Bones, it's over.
No more undercover act.

704
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:53,712
It's over.

705
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:00,611
We have to go question
the other performers.

706
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,145
Right.

707
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,455
You two want to explain
what happened with magnum?

708
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,687
- He trapped us in the net.
- For no reason?

709
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,020
- We asked him about the twins.
- Asked what?

710
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:16,367
If he knew anything
about how they died.

711
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,814
- You want us to take care of this?
- Settle.

712
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,741
- Who are you people?
- Fbi special agent seeley booth.

713
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,396
Dr. Temperance brennan of
the jeffersonian institution.

714
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,838
Okay, the van owen twins
were murdered.

715
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:32,666
Our prime suspect
right now is magnum.

716
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,793
He had the requisite strength.

717
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,670
Magnum never killed anyone.

718
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,877
People, can you please
come back now?

719
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:41,341
- Tell them to come back.
- None of us are gonna help you.

720
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,427
Don't you care what
happened to the twins?

721
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,018
You aren't one of us.

722
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:46,807
You don't get it, do you?

723
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:48,807
How could you?
You're gillies.

724
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,828
No, no, we're not gillies,
our act was good.

725
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:54,114
Yeah, you're gillies.

726
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,024
Right.

727
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,633
- We have no case.
- We will when we bring magnum in.

728
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:05,407
We have no definitive forensics tying
him or anyone else to the murder.

729
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,993
You will when you get back
to the lab, you'll find evidence.

730
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,955
The bonius maximus will have
his initials on it or something.

731
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:18,045
I really was pretty
good on the high wire.

732
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,690
I'm going to try it.

733
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:22,693
No, up there now?

734
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:25,552
Wait a second, bones, no!
You'll fall, it's too high!

735
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,615
- There's a net.
- You got no depth perception.

736
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,848
You have a patch on your eye.
You won't be able to see!

737
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,204
But no, it's more
a case of feel, Booth

738
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,051
I could do it with my eyes shut.

739
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:36,889
You shut your eyes and I will
shut mine'cause I am not watching.

740
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,566
My teacher said I was
one of his best students.

741
00:38:42,157 --> 00:38:43,438
This is crazy.

742
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:52,704
Look!

743
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,499
No, I told you. I'm not gonna look,
i'm keeping my eyes shut.

744
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,152
This is absolutely...

745
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,196
oh, my god!
Bones, whoo!

746
00:39:00,442 --> 00:39:01,927
Wow, you are fearless!

747
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,381
My feet! I'm not in shape for this.

748
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:08,178
Look at you, you're doing great!

749
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,758
You think maybe you could
ride a bike on that thing?

750
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:13,630
And maybe spin a ball on
your nose at the same time?

751
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:14,880
Ow! My cuboids!

752
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,759
- Your what?
- The cuboids are the bones in my feet.

753
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,981
You all right?

754
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,037
Yeah, I'm fine.

755
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,065
Oh, my god!

756
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,478
Bones, are you all right?

757
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:30,964
Yeah, I'm fine.

758
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:35,038
- I know what happened.
- It's obvious, you lost your balance.

759
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:36,796
No, to the twins.

760
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,166
They weren't murdered.

761
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:42,129
The stress fractures
to their fibulas and cuboids,

762
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,674
they were caused by walking
on the high wire.

763
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,063
And the kissing fracture,

764
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:49,469
their heads snapped together
when they fell into the net.

765
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,506
That's why there
was no other trauma.

766
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,224
A conjoined twin high-wire act?

767
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,837
Henry said that Jenny
wanted to be famous.

768
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,438
Their act would have
been completely unique.

769
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:05,404
Well, that's a first.

770
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:08,828
Yeah, covered up an accident by
making it look like a murder.

771
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,041
I didn't kill the them.

772
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,013
I didn't kill them.

773
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,237
I loved them.

774
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:18,756
I would never hurt them.

775
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:19,881
We know.

776
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,629
I buried them.
They needed a proper burial.

777
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,697
Don't say anything, magnum.

778
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,800
You asked them not
to go on the high wire,

779
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,827
but that's exactly what
they wanted to do.

780
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:33,305
It's probably the only thing
Julie and jenny ever agreed on.

781
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,682
When they dropped to the net,
the force of the fall

782
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,412
snapped their heads together.

783
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:40,246
An accident like that,
their mother definitely would've sued.

784
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:42,927
The circus would
never have survived.

785
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,110
You know, I'm going to have to arrest
you for interference with a dead body.

786
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,820
We're sorry. Aren't we?

787
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,909
- Sorry.
- We're going to get you a good lawyer.

788
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:56,572
Just don't bring them into this.

789
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,647
I don't want to see
the circus die because of me.

790
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:02,417
What you're going to have to explain,
is why you wrapped them in a sheet

791
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,947
because that's something a woman
would do out of respect.

792
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,071
You'll also have to explain how you
forged their handwriting on a note.

793
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,573
I will.

794
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,485
Thanks.

795
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,610
Well, I'll just call up the dallas
field office,

796
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,738
- and have them pick him up.
- Think he'll run again?

797
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:34,908
No

798
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,466
He won't run.

799
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,140
They're gone.

800
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,265
Yeah.

801
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,367
- We slept through it?
- Yeah.

802
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:21,762
"Boris and natasha
and their russian knives of death."

803
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,082
I guess we all got it in us, huh?

804
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:27,213
The desire to run off
and join the circus.

805
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:30,589
We did it.

806
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,883
Buck and wanda were damn good.

807
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:36,386
Buck was more dashing than you.
I mean, Buck drove a motorcycle.

808
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,453
- Wanda was funner than you.
- How?

809
00:42:38,578 --> 00:42:41,933
Well, she let me knock off a rubber
nose from her face with a knife.

810
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:45,453
You would never let me do that.
You're way too rational.

811
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,544
Where do you think they are now?

812
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:56,356
Over the horizon.

813
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:12,896
