1
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,980
Santa. How you doing?
Deposit or withdrawal?

2
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,570
Is this some sort of joke?

3
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,036
Give me all of your money.
Now.

4
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,292
The other ones, too.

5
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,549
Hurry up.

6
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,568
Something's going on over there.
Security!

7
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:48,089
I have a bomb!

8
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,378
Everyone get down!

9
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,056
Put the money in the bag. Quick.

10
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,612
It's a beauty, isn't it?

11
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,862
I got the...

12
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,355
I got the employee's discount;
good tips, too.

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,991
Shall I get some tinsel?

14
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,234
You can do whatever you want,
it's your Christmas tree.

15
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:10,111
It's ours, honey, as in you and me.

16
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:13,531
Dad, I'm going to do
volunteer work in El Salvador.

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,908
Well, that means I'm gonna be
alone for Christmas.

18
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:18,389
Well, what about Russ and the girls?

19
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:21,786
Your brother is going to Orlando
to spend the holidays with his in-laws,

20
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:23,916
and I will be alone,
and it'll be pitiful.

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,211
If I stay, then there'll be two of us
alone, which is twice as pitiful.

22
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,860
That's interesting math.

23
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,789
What if I can get someone else
to share Christmas with us?

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,969
That would make it a real Christmas?

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,054
Dad, some reformed
criminal pal of yours

26
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,820
won't make a real Christmas.

27
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,993
I'm talking family,
a blood relative...

28
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,144
an aunt or one of your
cousins from Minnesota.

29
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,897
- You have contact with these people?
- We're MySpace buddies.

30
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,821
Come on, honey, please?

31
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,572
Well, why do people hate
to spend Christmas alone?

32
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:57,244
'Cause it means nobody loves them.

33
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:06,369
<i>Code 39, code 39,
bank robbery in progress.</i>

34
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,039
<i>Capital Mutual Bank,
corner of 12th and U Street.</i>

35
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,409
<i>Suspect dressed as Santa.
Urgent help needed.</i>

36
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,174
Yes, Agent Booth, 22705.

37
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,884
<i>I'm two blocks from the Bank.
ETA within a minute</i>

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,851
All of you...
stay down, you hear me?

39
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,087
Stay down...

40
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,063
and everybody
goes home for Christmas.

41
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:33,903
Everybody back.

42
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,531
You! Santa!
Move into the road.

43
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,991
Now!

44
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,048
Don't do this.

45
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,205
Just walk away.

46
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:45,664
On your knees.

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,374
On your knees!

48
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,502
FBI, man. Do it now!

49
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,462
I just answered the call.

50
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>Burn!</i>

51
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,205
<i>Cabdriver is stabilized.</i>

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,749
Can we hurry this up?
'Cause I have a witness over there.

53
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:35,339
- You didn't throw out your back?
- No, I didn't; I'm fine.

54
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:38,008
Do you have a medical degree?
I don't think so.

55
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,977
- Your pupillary response is fine.
- Okay, well, there you go.

56
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:43,442
I'm gonna go talk to my witness now.
Thank you.

57
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,892
Got him.

58
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,967
Hi. I'm, Special Agent Seeley Booth.

59
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:53,357
- Are you okay, Miss...?
- Hartmeyer.

60
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:56,610
Georgia Hartmeyer, and no,
I'm not okay. I'm covered in...

61
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,798
Human remains.

62
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:01,101
- The bomber's bones became shrapnel.
- Oh, my God, I got to get out of here.

63
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,894
We want to ask you
a couple questions.

64
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,743
We've to bag her
and take her to the lab.

65
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,870
Right now?

66
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:07,705
I know this is really hard

67
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,666
and you're freaked out,
but what you have on there is evidence.

68
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,834
It's no big deal.

69
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,879
I'm just gonna put this cap
over your hair and bag your hands.

70
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,839
And I'm gonna meet
you back at the lab,

71
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,721
I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions,

72
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,664
and then I'm gonna take you home.

73
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,804
All right, I guess, if I have to.

74
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,591
What do you got?

75
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,852
Recovering bomb fragments...
Check this out.

76
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,228
Explosives unit guys loaned me
these magnetized gloves.

77
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,522
These are so going
on my Christmas list.

78
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,392
That stuff there, is that from the bomb,
or is that from Santa?

79
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:39,862
Bomb. Oily pudding residue
indicates a homemade emulsion bomb.

80
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,544
- Man, you sure you're OK?
- Fine.

81
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,355
He says he's fine, but that may just be
a function of shock.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,064
I'm fine. I'm gonna go home,
grab a shower and get cleaned up.

83
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,582
I'm fine, will you
stop worrying about me?

84
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,792
- Spinous process.
- What? Where?

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,939
Yes, indeed, that is a definite
chunk of Santa.

86
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,839
We're gonna need some bags, Cam.

87
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,634
I'm sorry, Booth,
but you're evidence now.

88
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:07,341
Bones - Season 5 Episode 10
"The Goop on the Girl"

89
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,517
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,

00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,165
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

91
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,153
Did you hear anything
back on that cabdriver?

92
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,233
No, but Cam is in touch
with the hospital.

93
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,526
I have to remove your clothing now.

94
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:46,651
Why?

95
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,389
- Well, there may be particulates.
- Particulates.

96
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:52,064
Evidence for Hodgins,
and flesh for Cam.

97
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:56,605
You know, the bomber said something
about answering "the call."

98
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,803
What do you think that means?

99
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,442
Many terrorists feel
they're acting upon

100
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,737
divine instruction.

101
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,490
I don't think he was a terrorist;
just a bank robber.

102
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,537
There's spatter on the
back of your collar.

103
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:09,662
Spatter?

104
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,092
- I can take my own...
- No, don't.

105
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,286
- You'll compromise the evidence.
- Right.

106
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,121
I'm...

107
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:22,172
having Christmas dinner
at my place this year with my dad.

108
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,509
Considering you've been shunted aside
by your own family, I'd...

109
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,094
like to invite you.

110
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,936
That's a sweet invitation.

111
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:31,939
So, will you come?

112
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,100
I don't know.

113
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:37,312
I was thinking about going
up to Quebec to see Parker.

114
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,523
I really don't care
what Rebecca thinks.

115
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,549
Well, if you do that,
won't she retaliate

116
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,236
by insisting upon coming
to all your special times with Parker?

117
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,823
You have a perfect acromion.

118
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,673
Stand up.

119
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,812
Off the table.

120
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,306
What, is there stuff on my pants?

121
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:55,664
Vascular tissue on
your Cocky belt buckle.

122
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,170
Right.
Slides right off, and we're done.

123
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,110
I have to remove your pants.

124
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,551
You know, I'm just gonna start
reciting some saints, you know.

125
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,762
St. Joseph,
St. Peter, St. Paul, St. John...

126
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,226
Anyone for mistletoe?

127
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,286
I'm recovering evidence.

128
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,655
- Just evidence, that's all.
- Interesting.

129
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,956
Bones, I really got to go question

130
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,152
the other eyewitness,
are we done here?

131
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:26,827
No, you can sit.

132
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:29,020
- There's something in your hair.
- Where?

133
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,682
- Don't touch.
- What?

134
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:33,744
Organic residue...
I'll cut it out.

135
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,542
What do you mean, cut it out?
No. No scissors. Not the hair.

136
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:40,167
Tox results show that our bomber had
propranolol in his bloodstream.

137
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,128
It's a beta-blocker popular
with performers, soldiers

138
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,924
and suicide bombers.

139
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,850
Snipers use that
to calm their nerves.

140
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,510
Also, Hodgins swabbed this.

141
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,678
Found high concentrations
of limonene.

142
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,586
It's a citrus fruit derivative.

143
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,057
What is that, a nostril?

144
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,232
And I have no idea how
the limonene got there,

145
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,144
unless the guy was
snorting orange Kool-Aid.

146
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,522
Right. Listen, Bones,
I really got to get going

147
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,024
to question this other eyewitness.
Will you just...

148
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,869
Are we doing experiments on Booth?
Because if so, I'd like to help.

149
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,580
Make fun of the naked guy...
knock yourself out.

150
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,769
I think we got everything.
No. Mandible fragment.

151
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,671
Just get it all out.

152
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:28,881
- Okay, there you go...
- Agent Booth, you look...

153
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:29,957
How are you?

154
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,961
Finished with the hair;
moving on to the hands.

155
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:35,452
And thank you for asking, especially
given the difficult morning you've had.

156
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,349
He was speaking to Ms. Hartmeyer.

157
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,055
I'm not used to having evidence
that talks, it's a little disconcerting.

158
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:43,963
I'll just get back to work.

159
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:47,143
- How much longer do I've to stay here?
- Just a couple more questions.

160
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,710
Do you remember how long
you were standing outside the bank?

161
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,613
I'm not sure...
I was waiting for the bus.

162
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,926
Do you remember seeing Santa
go into the bank?

163
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,079
- Sorry. It's being stubborn.
- All I know is,

164
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,573
I was minding my own business,

165
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,859
and this guy just
blew up in front of me.

166
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:03,025
Dr. Brennan, look at these
white fragments in the nail bed.

167
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,253
Most likely dental pulp.

168
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,046
- Santa teeth!
- Geez.

169
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,478
Harvest the nail.

170
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,841
Just a quick clip.

171
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,511
- I got something here.
- Great, join the party.

172
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:17,264
- Where's your chest hair?
- I'm highly evolved.

173
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,110
His pubic extension
is entirely within normal...

174
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:21,476
Enough. What do you got?

175
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,324
I'm cataloguing bomb components
so we can run it through EXIS,

176
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,023
the Explosive Incidents System.

177
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,692
Bomb makers signatures are
as unique as handwriting.

178
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,236
We found this computer chip
that sets frequency

179
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,323
on a two-way radio, which means
this bomb was command-initiated,

180
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,950
triggered via an electronic
signal from the two-way.

181
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,758
That would explain the crackle I heard
before bomb went off, and this voice.

182
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:43,957
You know, if Santa had a partner, he was
probably monitoring that frequency.

183
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,776
He hears me say "FBI," he panics,
and he blows up good old St. Nick,

184
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,854
but there's no way
to trace it back to him.

185
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:53,634
Except for that computer chip.
The radio was set to 27.4 megahertz.

186
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,177
You guys have a scanner?

187
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,726
So, this is the first time
I have ever borrowed anything

188
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,370
from the Eisenhower Collection.

189
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,085
I'm just gonna tune in here to 27.4.

190
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,233
<i>... their pockets. No more!</i>

191
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:08,695
<i>Bring down the tools
of capitalist greed.</i>

192
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,710
<i>Burn them, like they burned us...</i>

193
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:13,195
"Burn." That's him.
I heard him say that.

194
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,209
- We expedited tissue removal.
- Great, thanks.

195
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,050
This is Booth. I need an FCC mobile
scanner unit now. Great. Thanks.

196
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,413
You want to search for the source
of this transmission?

197
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,507
It could be the guy
who set off the bomb.

198
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,583
OK, pants, I need pants...
where are my pants?

199
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:30,404
<i>We're not one voice,
we're thousands of voices.</i>

200
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,117
<i>Democracy has been corrupted
by the greed of big business.</i>

201
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,352
- <i>Burn it to the ground...</i>
- If he's referring to lobbyists,

202
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:38,804
then he's correct.

203
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,427
You agree with this clown?
And what about blowing up your partner?

204
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,487
Because it
sounds like this creep was

205
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,645
planning on detonating
Santa right from the start.

206
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,735
That would explain the propranolol.

207
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,819
Who blows up Christmas?
Who does that?

208
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,004
<i>Hear my call.</i>

209
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,140
<i>Get off your ass and do something.
Get up off your...</i>

210
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:57,739
That's what the victim
meant about answering "the call"?

211
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,534
Sure as hell sounds like that.
Take the next right, will you?

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,541
Lancelot.

213
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,679
Does it look like the
frontal near the sinus to you?

214
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:12,735
I have no idea.

215
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,048
Seems appropriately spongy.

216
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:19,011
Look, I know you're busy,
but I'm in a pickle, Daisy.

217
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,973
This is our first Christmas together.
And, though I've avoided the holidays

218
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:25,474
ever since my parents
have been gone,

219
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:28,353
I feel like I shouldn't put
a damper on your holiday zest.

220
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,480
- I'm zestless.
- You are?

221
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:34,100
I see no point in celebrating
Jesus' birth in December

222
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,736
when he was born in March.

223
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,743
- No kidding.
- It'd be like celebrating

224
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,865
the Fourth of July in April.
Ridiculous.

225
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,117
So, what do we do December 25?

226
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:46,163
Would it be wrong to stay
in bed all day and have sex?

227
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:49,166
Yes, it would.
And what is with everybody today?

228
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,959
We were discussing holiday plans.

229
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,342
Did Dr. Brennan ask you
about Christmas dinner?

230
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,738
She did. I said it wouldn't be
a Christmas dinner

231
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,274
unless it occurred in March.

232
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,300
Interesting.

233
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:01,002
Clear off, Sweets.
We have to ID

234
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,347
our Christmas-in-December bomber.

235
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,767
Bye, Lancelot. Colon, end bracket,
colon, capital D!

236
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,745
Semicolon, end parentheses,

237
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,563
"less than" sign, numeral three.

238
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:14,483
- Colon, capital "P."
- Dear God. I'm going to yak.

239
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,184
This isn't skull.
It's minubrium.

240
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,239
Seems to be some kind of burn
on the interior surface.

241
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:22,931
Get that to Hodgins.

242
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,613
Just up ahead.

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,002
That's it. Right there.
Pull over.

244
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,378
Santa's cohort is inside that house.

245
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,149
These men use explosives.

246
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,330
They want to destroy the federal
government. Shouldn't we call in backup?

247
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:42,094
<i>60 seconds of rant, people.
Bring it on, bring it down.</i>

248
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,710
We don't have any time. Do you hear him?
60 seconds or he's going to sign off.

249
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,349
I got to keep him distracted.

250
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:49,732
All right.

251
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,355
You're going to pull down the antenna?
That's illegal.

252
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,108
Well, not when I got him for a Title 97,
malicious interference

253
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,927
and unlicensed operation.

254
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,861
Phone in our location, okay?
Check.

255
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,197
Here. Cover me.

256
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>The banks take our money
to line their pockets.</i>

257
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,423
- What?
- Come on now.

258
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,683
That's it. You have
the right to remain silent.

259
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:26,930
You're a flunky of a corrupt regime.
It is my duty to resist you.

260
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,459
I should warn you,
he's very hard to resist.

261
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,309
- Thanks, Bones.
- Sure.

262
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:32,826
Easy!

263
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:38,275
- What's this?
- Says you waive your right to a lawyer.

264
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:44,614
I know my rights better than any
lawyer whose a pawn in the system.

265
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,909
Fully aware that's there's nothing
illegal about my broadcasts.

266
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,337
- Freedom of speech.
- You were in the military?

267
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,430
- You're trained in explosives.
- So what?

268
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:55,000
Explosives and ordnances
are part of Basic Training.

269
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,146
I don't think that
they meant for you to use

270
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,839
your Basic Training
experience to Rob Banks.

271
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,332
You know what?
You got the wrong guy.

272
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:07,637
All I do is broadcast my show,
go to meetings, hand out pamphlets.

273
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,677
Just before he blew up,

274
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:12,184
the robber said that, uh,
he answered "the call."

275
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,269
My call? From the radio?

276
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,751
Some nut listens to me, goes crazy,

277
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,630
I'm not responsible.

278
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,873
- I never told anybody to break the law.
- Right. You know what?

279
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:27,255
Your little pirate radio
frequency set off the bomb

280
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,410
right before the robber
was about to get arrested.

281
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,208
- Must have been a coincidence.
- Just a coincidence?

282
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,877
You should just keep saying that

283
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,212
to yourself over and over again,
so you can believe it.

284
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,210
This is fun.

285
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,429
Isn't it fun to meet
a new relative, girls?

286
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,824
So, you're my cousin, Margaret?

287
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,257
My mother was your mother's cousin,
according to Uncle Max.

288
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:57,771
It's an uncanny resemblance.
You're practically sisters.

289
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,190
Why aren't you home for Christmas?

290
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,791
This time of year,
I prefer to be in Philadelphia,

291
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,986
away from my family
and all those kids.

292
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,475
You don't have children?

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,503
"Keep your eyes wide
open before marriage,

294
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:09,950
and half-shut afterward."

295
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,136
I never got to the half-shut part.

296
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,995
What's your excuse?

297
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,232
For not being married?
I don't have an excuse.

298
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,917
- I just have very good reasons.
- Like what?

299
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,963
I think that marriage is
something you need to have

300
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,577
a reason to enter into.
I never found that reason.

301
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:27,941
I totally agree.

302
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:31,137
"Experience keeps a dear school,
but fools learn in no other."

303
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,182
You see, Margaret is a big fan
of Benjamin Franklin.

304
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,685
Yes. He was the smartest man
who ever lived.

305
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,187
His advice has...
never failed me.

306
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:41,853
Actually, the person with
the highest recorded IQ

307
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:43,191
is Marilyn von Savant.

308
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:45,172
"Tim was so learned

309
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,875
"that he could name a
horse in nine languages.

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,198
So ignorant that he
bought a cow to ride on."

311
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:51,700
This isn't gonna work.

312
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,578
Listen, family reunions
are always awkward.

313
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,329
Do you think this is going well?

314
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,665
Not really.
You seem like a bit of a know-it-all.

315
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,802
Nice to meet you.
I'm going to El Salvador for Christmas.

316
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,640
You both are welcome to use my place
over the holidays.

317
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,435
"He that won't be counseled
can't be helped."

318
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,388
I told you to keep
to Ben's scientific stuff.

319
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,876
All righty.
Here's your head.

320
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:22,328
Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth are
kind of in a hurry to ID him.

321
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:23,969
No problem, Daisy.

322
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:26,931
I have no intention of letting
Santa ruin Christmas.

323
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,072
Were you aware of the fact
that Jesus was really born in March?

324
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,316
I don't care.

325
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,394
That Rudolph would
have to be a girl,

326
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,705
because male reindeer drop
their antlers in winter.

327
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,225
Okay. I'll be right back.

328
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,310
Okay, here he is.

329
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:36,429
The guy who bombed Christmas.

330
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,386
Can you hand me my sketch pad,
so I can get him to the media?

331
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,264
I was just thinking of you.

332
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,773
Oh, my God, what did you buy?

333
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:50,443
Gingerbread house,
talking reindeer, peppermint bark...

334
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,279
I went a little crazy.
I know your dad loved Christmas.

335
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:56,324
- You didn't get my present, did you?
- Still working on that.

336
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:58,118
Good.
I know what I want...

337
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,704
Hawaii. The Big Island.

338
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,793
- That would be hard to wrap.
- No. I want to go there for Christmas.

339
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,626
Please don't say no, Cam. Please.

340
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:10,026
That sounds fantastic,
but I only have a couple days off.

341
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:13,258
Not with you. With Paris's family.
Her mom and dad invited me.

342
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,718
They did?

343
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,470
I know it's totally last minute,
but I found a cheap flight,

344
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,888
and the hotel is covered,

345
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,599
and all I have to do is pack
shorts and bathing suits.

346
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,100
You...

347
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,854
really thought this through.

348
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,774
If I stay, it's just the two of us,
and that's depressing.

349
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,737
You want to go?
It's important?

350
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:35,235
It's important to me.

351
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,287
And this way you can do what
you usually do at Christmas

352
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:40,660
- instead of worrying about me.
- You're not a worry.

353
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,039
If that's what you want,
then you can go.

354
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,219
Thank you.

355
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:54,276
- Mind if I steal her away?
- She's all yours.

356
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:04,892
We ran the explosive residue.
It's predominantly ammonium nitrate.

357
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:08,852
Also fuel oil, naptha,
detergent and antimony sulfide.

358
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,447
Any of that unique enough
to pinpoint our bomb maker?

359
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,598
Not even close.

360
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:15,195
Sweets says the pirate radio guy
doesn't fit the profile.

361
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,517
He's an extrovert,
and we're looking for

362
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,741
a lock-yourself-in-the-basement
type of fellow.

363
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,008
All we know so far
is that the detonation pressure

364
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,245
was about half a million pounds
per square inch.

365
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,039
Which is consistent with the damage.

366
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:29,626
You can see blow out to the back,
as well as curvature and divoting...

367
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,628
all going in one direction,
to the rear.

368
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,297
So the explosive was confined
to the front of the vest.

369
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,800
Until we find the
rest of the manubrium,

370
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,135
it's gonna be pretty tough
to figure out specifics.

371
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,459
The manubrium doesn't
juste get up and walk away.

372
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,181
Unless...

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,267
the bomber's own bones
became shrapnel.

374
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,062
We checked the scene of the explosion,
but not the cab driver,

375
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,924
who took the biggest hit.
I'll call the hospital.

376
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,218
So, I've decided
to take you up on your offer.

377
00:19:58,736 --> 00:19:59,751
What offer?

378
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:03,230
You inviting me to your house
for Christmas dinner?

379
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:06,392
- You forgot you invited me...
- No, it's just... No!

380
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,928
My dad brought by my second cousin
and...

381
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,378
- I really didn't like her.
- That makes sense.

382
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,046
- Why?
- Because she's family.

383
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,963
I mean, 90% of the time,
family just gets under your skin.

384
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,677
That's the difference
between family and friends.

385
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,147
She's unapologetically dogmatic.

386
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:24,697
She lives her entire life

387
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:27,267
based on the quotations
of Benjamin Franklin.

388
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,686
Maybe she feels the same way
about your mania for logic.

389
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,801
- Mania?
- Okay, enthusiasm.

390
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:36,192
Look, if you ditch this opportunity
because a family member annoys you...

391
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:38,695
it just goes
with the family territory.

392
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,494
That's true. You and Jared can barely be
in the same room together.

393
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,981
He's a whole other kettle of fish.
I'll tell you that.

394
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:46,449
He's just annoying.

395
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,878
Somebody saw Angela's sketch on the TV.
Says it looks like her son.

396
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,755
Name of Holden Chevaleer.
Great. Thanks.

397
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,007
Get this.

398
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:02,010
Our bomber was an exterminator.

399
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,971
That makes sense.
Exterminators use orange oil.

400
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,808
Hodgins said the bomb contained naptha.
Exterminators use it to kill bed bugs.

401
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,368
That picture on the news.

402
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,285
- It's my son, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

403
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,273
They didn't say why
they were showing it,

404
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,284
just that they wanted
information. Why?

405
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,812
Well, we believe that your son
was involved in a robbery at,

406
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,548
Capital Mutual Bank.

407
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:34,918
Your son, did he ever use explosives,
Mrs. Chevaleer?

408
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:38,171
No, of course not.
Holden wouldn't hurt a fly.

409
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:41,591
Well, he's an exterminator.
By definition, he hurts flies.

410
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,301
That's not what she meant, Bones.

411
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:45,345
Holden is a good boy.

412
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,054
We have dinner together
almost every night.

413
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,433
There's just the two of us,
you understand.

414
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,476
Any friends?

415
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,230
He's very shy.

416
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:56,272
He's much happier working on
his projects in the garage.

417
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,447
- What kind of projects?
- I don't really know.

418
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,947
- I like to give him his privacy.
- He have any financial troubles?

419
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,605
Everybody does.

420
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:09,118
He tried to get a loan,
but the bank wouldn't give him one.

421
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,204
That must have made him very angry.

422
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:14,040
Well, he isn't perfect.

423
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,494
But I know my son.

424
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,561
And if there has been
any kind of trouble,

425
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,355
it is not his fault.

426
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,488
Just let me talk to him.
He'll tell you, I know he will.

427
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:30,306
I'm afraid
that's not gonna be possible.

428
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,121
Please.

429
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,074
You just tell me
what's happened to my son.

430
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,202
<i>These just came through
from the hospital.</i>

431
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:01,203
<i>Pre-op photos of the cab driver
and his X rays.</i>

432
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,674
Severe trauma

433
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,675
primarily to the proximal phalanges
and metacarpals.

434
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,429
Pitting and multiple fractures
to the palmar side.

435
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,954
He was trying to shield
his face from the explosion.

436
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,651
We think the fragment
in his zygomatic arch

437
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,894
- may be the missing manubrium fragment.
- There.

438
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,731
Did the hospital deliver
the bone shrapnel fragments?

439
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,106
Ms. Wick's works on it.

440
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,067
We're hoping they'll give us
a better sense.

441
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,017
We need Angela to recreate
the explosion.

442
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,864
<i>As soon as Hodgins figures out
the bomb.</i>

443
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,797
It's very difficult to work when someone
is looking over your shoulder.

444
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:41,352
It's even more difficult to work
when you have nothing to work on.

445
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:42,795
Snap it up.

446
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,592
This is it. The missing manubrium.

447
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:51,096
Three parallel burns
about two millimeters apart.

448
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,016
I think we got our initiator.

449
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:58,144
The bomb maker used the base
of a small light bulb.

450
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,521
Battery on one end,
explosives on the other.

451
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,484
I'm going to run this through
the EXIS database.

452
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:05,186
One more thing.

453
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:08,571
I found this in Santa's 12th rib.

454
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:12,033
- I'm never going to make my flight.
- I recommend celebrating in March.

455
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,035
Thank you, Ebenezer.

456
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,002
You're not going to El Salvador
for Christmas?

457
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,851
You don't strike me as someone
who's flexible about their schedule.

458
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,927
I took advice from someone
who knows more about families than I do.

459
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:33,554
"He that raises a large family

460
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,588
"does stand a broader mark

461
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:37,225
"for sorrow, but then

462
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,103
"stands a broader mark
for pleasure as well."

463
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:44,273
Well, that's sort of what he said,
but without the pleasure part.

464
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,455
So an explosives unit checked out
Holden's garage, there was nothing.

465
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,947
His name doesn't pop up
in the system.

466
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,032
That's very interesting, but I...

467
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,404
Which just confirms that we
have to find his accomplice.

468
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,531
Nice tree.

469
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:00,832
- Who is this, your sister?
- No...

470
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,167
- my second cousin.
- I'm Margaret.

471
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,587
- There's no resemblance.
- What do you mean?

472
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,755
You're both very beautiful.

473
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,538
"Beauty and folly
are old companions."

474
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,755
- Told you... Benjamin Franklin.
- Right, right.

475
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:17,640
Good old Ben, he invented electricity
and the hundred dollar bill.

476
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,851
Neither one of those things is true.

477
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,540
You're right, there's no
resemblance whatsoever.

478
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:23,729
Nice meeting you.

479
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:27,670
- Bye, Booth.
- See ya.

480
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,994
That's my partner. He's FBI.

481
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:41,045
His eyes are too small
to be really handsome.

482
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,337
I have to admit, I...

483
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,607
find him pleasing to look at.

484
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,222
I'm busy.

485
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:01,142
What you were saying about
my broadcast blowing that guy up...

486
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,685
- Can I contact his mother?
- Stay away from her.

487
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:05,620
It was a coincidence.

488
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,098
No way I could have known
in a million years...

489
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:11,160
If you don't feel responsible,
why do you want to talk to his mother?

490
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,947
I was Army, man.

491
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,822
Just like you.
I served my country.

492
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:18,868
You don't remember what
this country stands for.

493
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,454
Maybe it's you who forgot.
Freedom of speech.

494
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:23,589
- I have the right to be heard.
- Legally.

495
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,708
Maybe you should say
something worth hearing.

496
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:27,919
Look, it wasn't my fault.

497
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,981
You spew the poison out in the airwaves,
this happened, you know it.

498
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,478
Agent, show him out.

499
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,495
Let's go.

500
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:44,477
<i>We ran the details of the bomb
against the EXIS database.</i>

501
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,868
<i>It's an identical match
for a number of devices</i>

502
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:49,730
<i>- all built by the same man.
- A guy named Malaki Wallace.</i>

503
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:52,526
<i>He got busted in the '90s
for robbing a Western Union office.</i>

504
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,571
And using an emulsion bomb with
a light bulb initiator.

505
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,822
Anything current?

506
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,950
No. He's been dormant
since he got out of prison.

507
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,451
<i>- Prison?</i>
- Yeah.

508
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,411
It looks like he came back
with a bang.

509
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,833
You're not listening. I been out
of the bombing game for years.

510
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,168
- Really?
- Really.

511
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,912
Yeah, so how do you explain this?

512
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,605
Well, I'm always happy to consult.

513
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,549
That is a simple incendiary device.

514
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:18,060
Very rudimentary.

515
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:20,642
Right.

516
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,153
Was that strictly necessary?

517
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,523
<i>See, explosives unit,
they found that</i>

518
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,189
<i>in your apartment there, Malaki.</i>

519
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:31,899
So, I'm a fidgeter.

520
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:35,738
Bomb making is a compulsive
activity, much like arson.

521
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,238
The problem is about anything

522
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,131
will fidget itself into a bomb
given half a chance

523
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:42,326
and readily available
household products.

524
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,661
<i>Something like this?</i>

525
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:46,998
What is that?

526
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,917
- What do you want?
- Where've you been for the past 48hr?

527
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:53,629
- Pushing plungers.
- Demolition?

528
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:56,674
I'm an apartment super.
Sewer line backed up

529
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,677
and I spent Monday and Tuesday
unclogging the toilets.

530
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,178
I got 35 witnesses.

531
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,306
The tenants all had to share
one Porta Potti.

532
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,858
It's not that easy, pal.

533
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,351
We have a device with your
name written all over it.

534
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:09,812
Naptha, limonene, light bulbs,

535
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,043
Whole deal.

536
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,566
These guys consider themselves
artists, Booth.

537
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:15,092
Teachers.

538
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:17,153
Maybe you have a protege.

539
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,319
Someone you passed the torch to?

540
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,683
If someone built one of my devices,

541
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,285
they probably just got the
recipe off my Web site.

542
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,287
You have a mad bomber Web site?

543
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:29,012
What can I say?
I got fans.

544
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,375
And these fans... they subscribe?

545
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:34,545
E-mails and passwords
and correspondence, you name it.

546
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:35,978
Right.

547
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:42,181
I found this in the area of
the right articular capsule.

548
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,804
It's a puncture mark, like you
would get from a deep needle jab.

549
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,060
Perhaps it's where the bomber
injected himself with propranolol.

550
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:53,272
It's unlikely someone would inject
themselves deep enough to strike bone.

551
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:54,655
Exactly.

552
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:56,936
I reviewed the X rays

553
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,298
of the right scapula and hand.

554
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,416
Look at the extensor facet
of the glenoid cavity,

555
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,985
and the bilateral asymmetry
of the second metacarpal.

556
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,578
Indicative of pronounced
right-handedness.

557
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:10,041
He couldn't have injected
himself in the right arm.

558
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,826
I ID'd the fragment of
wire we got out of his rib.

559
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,172
Booth's gonna want to hear this.

560
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,807
So someone else injected Santa
with the propranolol.

561
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:21,759
Evidently.

562
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,316
And the wire in his rib was
triple heat treated

563
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,930
boron manganese steel.

564
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,439
Is that what they used to wire
the tubes of the explosives together?

565
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:31,602
No, it's a patented form of steel

566
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,064
used exclusively in high-end bike locks.
It wasn't part of the bomb.

567
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:38,484
It was what locked
Holden Chevaleer into the bomb.

568
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,693
Someone locked him into the vest,

569
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:44,240
dressed him like Santa and then
forced him to rob the bank.

570
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,022
Wait a sec. Patsy.

571
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,536
That's why he said what he said.

572
00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:50,454
"I just answered the call."

573
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:54,542
The guy's an exterminator, Bones.
He meant "the call" literally.

574
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,280
He answered a service call.

575
00:29:57,405 --> 00:30:01,292
Only his customer locked him
into a bomb and made him rob a bank.

576
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,618
- This is not good.
- Why?

577
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:05,678
Because whoever strapped
Holden into the bomb

578
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,266
didn't get what they wanted.

579
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,337
What if they try again?

580
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:15,827
You looked peeved.

581
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:19,092
I went to wash my hands just now,
but there was no soap in the dispenser.

582
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,467
It had to be...

583
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,069
You look irked.

584
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:30,410
She's mad about the soap.

585
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:34,415
Your analysis of the emulsion
bomb included detergent.

586
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,657
You didn't actually get permission
to recreate the bomb, did you?

587
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,573
My God!

588
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:41,281
I needed this so that Angela could
recreate the explosion.

589
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,342
- You told him that?
- Don't let him turn this around on me.

590
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,844
I do not want an
explosive device in my lab.

591
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,472
Relax, I did not connect
the initiator...

592
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,149
It is perfectly safe.

593
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:55,682
What's that?

594
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,396
It's antimony sulfide.

595
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,743
It's fine on its own.
It's perfectly harmless.

596
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,609
He used it in the detonating charge.

597
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,070
Hodgins is very authentic when
it comes to his reconstructions.

598
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,198
We have to pull the evidence trays.

599
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,411
Give me a clue here, guys.
What are we looking for?

600
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,160
It's H11209,

601
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,832
biological evidence
from witness Georgia Hartmeyer.

602
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,830
Got it.
It's her fingernail.

603
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,757
I thought it was just blast residue,

604
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,302
but that stain's
definitely on the inside.

605
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,918
- Did you have to do that?
- It's metallic and sweet.

606
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:35,726
That is definitely antimony sulfide.

607
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,313
And it couldn't have gotten there
unless she helped assemble the bomb.

608
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,484
We just have a couple follow-up
questions, that's all.

609
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,865
Like what were you doing
outside the bank...

610
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,190
for instance?

611
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:53,911
I told you, waiting for the bus.

612
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:57,154
I checked. You live on
the other side of town.

613
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:59,333
I take the bus to work.

614
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,701
You were fired three months ago.

615
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,546
I like to shop in that area, okay?

616
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:07,049
That is very interesting,
because we checked your credit cards

617
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,803
and you've never made a purchase
anywhere near Capital Mutual Bank.

618
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,400
Gotcha.

619
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,981
You got nothing.

620
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:16,647
I didn't blow him up.

621
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:19,440
I swear I didn't blow him up. 

622
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:26,476
So, I recreated the scene
outside the bank.

623
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:29,306
That's Booth...
with the Cocky belt.

624
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,973
And this is the cab driver
and Georgia Hartmeyer.

625
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,261
Now, I factored in
everything we know

626
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,413
about the bomb's
velocity and direction...

627
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:40,104
Including the positions
of Booth, Georgia

628
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,209
and the cab driver
prior to the blast.

629
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,083
Okay, here we go.

630
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,510
You see the problem?

631
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:54,283
The cab driver covered
his face with his hands.

632
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:57,394
We know that from his injuries.
But given his proximity,

633
00:32:57,815 --> 00:32:59,342
he wouldn't have had the time.

634
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,005
Now, I can adjust
his reaction times,

635
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,648
but even when I go superhuman...

636
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,360
and I'm talking, like, Maverick
and Iceman reaction times...

637
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:11,016
look at where the
bone shrapnel lands.

638
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,496
The only explanation
is that he was reacting

639
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,871
not to the explosion
but to the sound of the radio.

640
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,749
Now check out the FCC's

641
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:24,102
frequency allocation chart.

642
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,405
Now, Owen Thiel broadcast
his pirate radio signal

643
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,340
- at 27.4 megahertz.
- Which is right

644
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,652
next to 27.41 megahertz,

645
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,263
which is the land/mobile
frequency this cab driver used.

646
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,433
So Georgia and the
cab driver must have

647
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:43,227
locked Holden into the bomb vest.
They waited outside of the bank.

648
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,152
If Holden didn't do what they asked,

649
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:48,483
the cab driver could
detonate him with the cab radio.

650
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,362
Only Owen Thiel beat him to it.

651
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,460
I'll have Booth look for
the cab driver's name on

652
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,701
Malaki's Web site subscriber list.

653
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:02,276
All those jokes that I made
about Santa ruining Christmas,

654
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:04,068
I suck.

655
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:06,102
At the time you made those jokes,

656
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,127
you weren't aware
that Holden was a patsy.

657
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,050
You don't think that sometimes we forget
those bones out there are people?

658
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:19,264
Georgia and the cab driver,

659
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,017
flipped on each other the second
I got them into interrogation.

660
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,728
Apparently they found each other
at a debt counseling

661
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,397
seminar, of all things.

662
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,523
- How did they pick Holden?
- The phone book.

663
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:31,902
They called, and as soon as
he showed up, they jumped him.

664
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:35,292
Told him if he did what they
wanted, they would set him free.

665
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,283
Sometimes people are terrible.

666
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,452
I know.

667
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,831
Cam says that the victim's mother
is burying him on Christmas morning.

668
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:48,252
- I heard that.
- It was just him and his mom, right?

669
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,630
Yeah, guy worked alone.
He never had time for any friends.

670
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,022
What's wrong?

671
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,805
Max told me that being alone

672
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,849
at Christmas means
that nobody loves you.

673
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:07,577
She's burying her son.

674
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:09,484
Alone.

675
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,281
On Christmas.

676
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,070
That's heartbreaking.

677
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,802
You know, when I say
"heartbreaking,"

678
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,867
you say that the heart
is a muscle so it...

679
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,421
It can't break, it
can only get crushed.

680
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:27,859
Isn't it heart-crushing?

681
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:33,297
- You want to go to his funeral?
- Yes.

682
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:35,340
I would.

683
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,665
Then... she won't be alone.

684
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:42,025
You know what?

685
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,428
Sometimes I think
your heart muscle is

686
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:47,060
bigger than people
give you credit for.

687
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:09,389
You're being quiet.

688
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,879
I promise to text 85 times a day.

689
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,787
Why are you stopping?

690
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:22,679
- I don't want you to go to Hawaii.
- You're changing your mind?

691
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,107
You and me...

692
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:28,101
- we're the closest thing we have.
- You can't just change your mind.

693
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,166
And family spends
Christmas together.

694
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,981
- We're spending Christmas together.
- You're serious?!

695
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,235
- You're gonna have a good time...
- What's wrong with that?!

696
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,403
Everything.

697
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,473
Because that's what
we'll be to each other,

698
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,906
just two people who don't
spend Christmas together.

699
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:45,077
So you want to be two people
who spend Christmas together

700
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:48,247
- but one of them is really mad?
- I know deep down you care.

701
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,708
I just hope not too deep down.

702
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,576
- Can we at least talk about this?
- No.

703
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,188
It's my job to prove
to you every day

704
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:01,091
that you are loved in this world.
And if doing that makes you angry...

705
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,859
- It makes me furious.
- Then that's the price I pay.

706
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,961
But you will know beyond
a doubt that I can't just

707
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,392
let you go flying off and not have
it absolutely ruin my Christmas.

708
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:11,769
Because right now,
the way things are,

709
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
there's...

710
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:15,858
no Christmas without you.

711
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,715
I love you, too.

712
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:50,917
A man died this week.

713
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,355
By all accounts, he was a good man.

714
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,391
Loved his mother, worked hard,

715
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:01,324
shouldered his responsibilities.

716
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:05,145
He was a man that any one of us
would be proud to call "friend".

717
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:15,007
<i>I killed him with this microphone.</i>

718
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,258
<i>I killed him
by going on these airwaves</i>

719
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,178
<i>and sharing my rage with you.</i>

720
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,075
<i>Spreading my rage.</i>

721
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,766
<i>You can say that it wasn't my fault,</i>

722
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:33,538
<i>that it was a coincidence.</i>

723
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:35,061
<i>I thought about that.</i>

724
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:37,485
<i>Thought about it a lot.
But the fact is...</i>

725
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,485
<i>the fact is, if it weren't for me,</i>

726
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,396
<i>he might still be alive.</i>

727
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,565
<i>I'm so sorry for that.</i>

728
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,122
<i>And I remembered something
that I forgot</i>

729
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:52,543
<i>over the last few years,</i>

730
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:55,457
<i>that God is not only a god</i>

731
00:38:55,722 --> 00:38:57,161
<i>of anger and vengeance.</i>

732
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,593
<i>Now, my religious beliefs tell me
that Christ did not die in vain.</i>

733
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,934
<i>That He died to redeem us all.</i>

734
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,052
<i>And I intend to show</i>

735
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,086
<i>that this good, simple man</i>

736
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,716
<i>also did not die in vain.</i>

737
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:22,308
That he redeemed
one angry, shouting man.

738
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,641
So these are the last words
I will ever broadcast.

739
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,441
And I hope they're the words
you remember best.

740
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,540
Peace on Earth.

741
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:01,221
What happened to the "down with
Christmas, let's hump like bunnies"?

742
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,224
I'm not here for baby Jesus,
I'm here for Agent Booth.

743
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:05,860
That explains the antlers.

744
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,197
- It was a moment of whimsy.
- They look good on you.

745
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,387
Thank you.

746
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:13,931
Thanks.

747
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,978
So you think that we should
feel like big, giant losers

748
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:18,874
not spending Christmas with family?

749
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,257
There's more than
one kind of family.

750
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:24,754
- Merry Christmas, Hodgins.
- Merry Christmas, Angela.

751
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,761
That's too much salt there,
that's too much salt.

752
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:35,389
"He that would fish
must venture his bait."

753
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:37,684
- When are we gonna eat? I'm starving.
- Right now.

754
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,520
If Booth wants to fish, he'll.
What are you trying to say?

755
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,189
Honey, families always give
unwanted advice.

756
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,089
Unwanted advice?

757
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,985
You have to stop quoting
Benjamin Franklin at me.

758
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,445
Why?

759
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,598
I have no evidence
of this, but I feel that

760
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:54,075
every time you do that, it's
not actually communication.

761
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:56,077
I feel the same way
when people tell jokes.

762
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:59,163
I never thought of it that way.

763
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,124
I'd rather hear what you have
to say than Benjamin Franklin.

764
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:07,004
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

765
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,762
This is your gathering.
Wouldn't you like to say something?

766
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:20,581
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
Let's eat.

767
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,523
I mean, would you like to say
something about Christmas?

768
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,851
Christmas has its roots
in the pagan festival of Saturnalia,

769
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,653
which is traditionally celebrated

770
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:39,742
by intoxication, naked singing and the
consumption of human-shaped biscuits.

771
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,832
I think what Bones
is trying to say here

772
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,458
is that we're all just happy
that we are all together.

773
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,754
- We're all together every day.
- Not me.

774
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,337
I'm not here every day.

775
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,506
It's a different kind of together.

776
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:52,686
To family...

777
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,724
friends...

778
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:57,398
lovers... family...

779
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,146
and food.

780
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,475
You said "family" twice.
It's repetitious.

781
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,185
It's a good toast.
Cheers.

782
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,729
Cheers.

783
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,199
- What do we do now?
- Let's say a prayer.

784
00:42:17,545 --> 00:42:19,118
No prayer, not in my place.

785
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,452
I always pray.

786
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,663
- Just a moment of silence.
- Hold hands.

787
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,091
Silent night.

788
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,105
