1
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:18,695
Help me!

2
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:20,965
Help me!

3
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:22,943
Hodgins?

4
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,179
Dr. Brennan!

5
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,402
Help!

6
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:54,196
<i>The Gravedigger case</i>

7
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,158
<i>finally begins today
with an evidentiary hearing.</i>

8
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,241
<i>The defendant, prominent
federal prosecutor Heather Taffet,</i>

9
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:04,206
<i>will be defending herself
against multiple charges of kidnapping</i>

10
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,339
<i>and murder.</i>

11
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:07,418
<i>One charge involves ten-year-old</i>

12
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,882
<i>Terrence Gilroy,</i>

13
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,546
<i>who has never been found.</i>

14
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,597
<i>Testimony is expected
from three kidnapping victims:</i>

15
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>Seely Booth, an agent with the FBI,</i>

16
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,512
<i>as well as scientist Jack Hodgins</i>

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>and Temperance Brennan</i>

18
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,432
<i>of the Jeffers...</i>

19
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:27,480
You okay?

20
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,227
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

21
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:32,359
We're about to come head to head with
the woman who tried to kill both of us.

22
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,944
So are you. Aren't you okay?

23
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,906
Sure. Yeah. I'm just checkin' in.
I just want to make sure you're okay

24
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,158
- and if you need anything.
- It's just another case.

25
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,243
- Right.
- Dad!

26
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:42,661
Max?

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,117
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,252
I thought you should have
a support from somebody

29
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,875
who's been through the system.

30
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,127
Why is everyone treating me
like a child?

31
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:54,298
Because I don't want you to get your
hopes up. This is far from a slam dunk.

32
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,342
That's exactly why Caroline is here.

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,344
We have five cases, multiple counts:

34
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,513
Bones, Hodgins,
the ten-year-old boy...

35
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,473
Whose body has never been found.

36
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,767
Your prosecutor's getting desperate.

37
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,352
She knows what she's doing.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,729
I thought you were here for support,
Dad.

39
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,911
You all ready to play nice?

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,121
- Always, Your Honor.
- Your Honor, since

41
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,588
I'm representing myself, I'd like
to request that my shackles be removed.

42
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:33,420
This is only an evidentiary hearing.
There's no jury to prejudice.

43
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,507
And frankly, I feel a bit more secure
with her in chains.

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,968
Spare us the dramatic flourishes,
Ms. Julian.

45
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,763
When we go to trial,
we can revisit the request, Ms. Taffet.

46
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,973
First witness.

47
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,911
Burn marks were found on the victims
that were consistent

48
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:51,532
with injuries one would sustain
from a three-million volt stun gun.

49
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:54,309
The stun gun was found
in the suspect storage locker.

50
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,938
It matches the stun gun
that was used in the attack on me...

51
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:02,116
The suspect's steel-toed boots
were also found in the storage locker.

52
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:06,231
This storage locker was found
with information obtained illegally,

53
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,194
wasn't it?

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,283
We didn't know that at the time,
Your Honor.

55
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,639
We obtained a legal warrant
to search the locker.

56
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:15,619
The fact that Agent Booth's brother gave
you the lead didn't make you suspicious?

57
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,132
He was an officer assigned
to Homeland Security.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,916
We had no reason to question
the information he provid.

59
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,013
- The warrant was obtained legally.
- That's irrelevant, Your Honor.

60
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,757
Everything found in that storage locker
should be dismissed.

61
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,268
I submit that a warrant
wasn't even necessary.

62
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,597
Under precedent of imminent danger,

63
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:35,636
law authority had the duty to enter that
storage locker without a valid warrant.

64
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:38,485
- Agent Booth's life was in danger.
- Imminent danger

65
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,906
applies only if law enforcement hears
a violent threat

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,491
- or struggle at the scene.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Julian,

67
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,677
but no matter how pure
the intention,

68
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,996
the warrant was obtained illegally.

69
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,124
Therefore, any and all evidence gathered
during the search and seizure

70
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,334
is inadmissible.

71
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,253
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- This was not a personal favor.

72
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,801
I am restrained by the law.

73
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,965
I'd like to move
that all charges be dropped.

74
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,343
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
We still have dirt

75
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,886
samples from the crime scene,

76
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,889
- the ransom tapes...
- This is a waste of the court's time

77
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,641
and the taxpayers' money.

78
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,602
If I lose, I'll send everyone.

79
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,214
You aren't left with much,
Ms. Julian.

80
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:17,191
Are you sure you want to proceed?

81
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:34,750
Yes, Your Honor.

82
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,838
The charges stand.
We're going to trial.

83
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,507
Court is adjourned.

84
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,262
If you're so brilliant, Dr. Brennan,

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,307
why couldn't you find something
as simple as the number?

86
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,187
You all right?
What'd she say to you?

87
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,398
- She says I missed some evidence.
- Evidence?

88
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,484
She doesn't think I can find it.

89
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,576
Bones - Season 5 Episode 21
"The Boy with the Answer"

90
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,204
Synchro: JoJo13, Kujathemas,
Dark_Chii

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,682
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

92
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,817
Booth is getting her arrest records,
as well

93
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,144
as old case files
from when she was a prosecutor.

94
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,128
I'm pulling every record
we have so far associated with Taffet:

95
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:51,035
social security numbers, birth dates,
blood test results.

96
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,151
- Ages of the victims?
- Got those.

97
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,428
I'm using a recursive search algorithm
which analyzes

98
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:58,350
and cross-references the data.

99
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:02,087
Since they're related, any
inconsistencies can raise a red flag.

100
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,276
I think Taffet is just messing
with us again.

101
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,966
No, I have to disagree.

102
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,635
her pathology is consistent,
this is all a game to her.

103
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,135
She won the first round, she's upping
the stakes by challenging Dr. Brennan.

104
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,055
Maybe she knows there's something
in the soil samples we already have,

105
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,852
she's just trying to distract us.

106
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,021
You analyzed those soil samples
a hundred times.

107
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,814
- Are you telling me to give up?
- No, of course not.

108
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,544
But I mean, I understand the need
to cling to anything...

109
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,362
"Cling"? Okay, so I'm crazy now.
That's not what I meant.

110
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,200
Go, Dr. Hodgins. Look at the soil again.
You might find something.

111
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,375
You know, he still gets nightmares.

112
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,253
- Says he wakes up in a sweat.
- I should have been more sensitive.

113
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,484
This must be difficult for you, too.
If you need...

114
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,343
I'm fine. What about the weight
and size of the victim's remains?

115
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,804
Yeah, it's a good idea.
I'll check it out.

116
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,399
Here are the first set of documents
you asked for.

117
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,669
More numbers than I've ever seen
in my life.

118
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,488
- Thanks. You okay?
- You mean because

119
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,616
this case is a career killer? I'm cute.
I can always find a job.

120
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,296
They're gonna come up with something.
They always do, right?

121
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,870
Do you really believe that?

122
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,498
They saved my life, remember?
That was impossible.

123
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:22,163
I'll give you that one.

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,256
- How's your girlfriend holding up?
- She's fine.

125
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,214
She's not my girlfriend.

126
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,758
So those little looks
between you...?

127
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,413
Nothing.

128
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:32,594
Right.

129
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,721
I hope you're more believable
on the stand.

130
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:38,016
Have Angela run these numbers
as quickly as she can.

131
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:40,972
The judge isn't gonna give me
more than a day.

132
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,745
<i>If I don't receive the money</i>

133
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,901
<i>in the numbered account
within eight hours,</i>

134
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,553
<i>your child will die.</i>

135
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,869
<i>This is the last time
you will hear from me.</i>

136
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,717
<i>There will be
no further communications.</i>

137
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,685
What happened to the numbers?

138
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,579
Well, I came up dry.

139
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,793
Brennan and Booth
are compiling another set.

140
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,667
But until then, I'm trying to drag
Taffet's voice from these ransom tapes.

141
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,430
- Any luck?
- She used a variable band inversion,

142
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:09,418
so the wave is broken up
into hundreds of small sections,

143
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:12,367
each section scrambled
with different frequency sequencing.

144
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:15,095
You didn't ask me if I found
anything new in the soil samples.

145
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,096
Did you?

146
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,516
No, of course not. Sweets was right.
You knew that.

147
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,767
I'm barely keeping it together here,
Ang.

148
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,197
You were sane enough to marry me.

149
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:38,379
But I don't feel strong enough
to tell anybody yet.

150
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,206
I feel like she's still
got me locked up, you know?

151
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:46,869
When I see her, there's just this,

152
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,963
anger, kind of helplessness that...

153
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,627
I know, I know.

154
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,051
When I was buried in that car,

155
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,304
I didn't think
I was ever gonna see you again.

156
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,141
Now I feel like
she's still in between us.

157
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:03,053
She's not.

158
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:05,562
Look at me.

159
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:07,650
She's not.

160
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,628
Nobody can get between us.

161
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,795
You've been at it for hours.
You gotta eat something.

162
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,011
In a little while.

163
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,850
Her old court documents from
when she was a prosecutor have

164
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,810
case numbers, criminal code numbers,

165
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:36,260
- and then there are zip codes.
- That's great and all,

166
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,465
but you know, it's not gonna be any good
if you starve yourself to death.

167
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,262
She was laughing at me, Booth.

168
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,767
I can't let her win.

169
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,560
She won't.

170
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,739
You hope.

171
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,856
She may be amoral,
but she is brilliant.

172
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,190
You're more brilliant.

173
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,667
What if her dispassion
makes her more logical?

174
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,786
What if that gives her
an advantage over me?

175
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:58,907
Wait. Now you're upset because
you're not more like a psychopath?

176
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:01,559
I just think...

177
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,880
maybe I've lost my advantage

178
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,498
because of all the people
I'm involved with now.

179
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:12,129
All of the relationships,
they complicate logical thought.

180
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,940
You don't mean that.

181
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,659
Could we please just work?

182
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:20,801
Sure.

183
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,018
Salt Lake City?

184
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,311
What?

185
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,076
When they arrested Taffet,
she used her one phone call

186
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,190
from jail to Salt Lake City.

187
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,671
Area code 801.

188
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:36,778
Well, she's representing herself,
so it couldn't be to a lawyer.

189
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,294
Who would she call inalt Lake City?

190
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,376
<i>Larry's Pizza, how may I heIp you?</i>

191
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,362
None of the employees at the pizza place
have a connection to Taffet, and...

192
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,235
None of them here have
any criminal records.

193
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,344
Well, the phone records show
that Taffet hung up after ten seconds.

194
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,970
She didn't request another call.

195
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,972
Angela's matching the number

196
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,850
with a numerical sequencing program.
This is the number.

197
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,935
Booth, this has to be the number.

198
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:19,154
So, I'm running a numerical
sequencing program to see

199
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,250
if there's a match
with any of our victims.

200
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,537
But I'm coming up with nothing.

201
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,965
Oh, my God.
The number is

202
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,565
a GPS location.

203
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,068
Let's go, everybody out.

204
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:13,861
It's the kid, isn't it?

205
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,219
Terrence Gilroy had

206
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,528
a remodeled right ulna from
a break when he was eight.

207
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,862
This is the boy she kidnapped.

208
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,412
I'm going to call the parents.

209
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,433
Why did she lead us here, Booth?

210
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,548
Why did she want us to find him?

211
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
Hands off!

212
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,295
No one touches a thing.

213
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:02,064
- What are you talking about?
- It's our chance to get

214
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,759
- some hard evidence they can't dismiss.
- Not if you touch it.

215
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,999
You can't act as an expert
witness in a case

216
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:09,878
when you are also a victim.

217
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:11,975
We aren't victims in this crime.

218
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,394
We filed one complaint
with seven counts.

219
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,822
Since the trial started, you and Brennan
are linked to all the crimes.

220
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:20,525
That's why Taffet wanted us
to find the boy.

221
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,237
She knows we're the only people

222
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,446
who have the skills
to connect her to the crime.

223
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,822
Now our hands are tied.

224
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:29,284
Not if you drop our case.

225
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,995
Excuse me?

226
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,203
If Caroline doesn't prosecute
our kidnappings,

227
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:37,334
we'd be free to testify
as expert witnesses in the boy's case.

228
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,419
- You'd be willing to do that?
- No.

229
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,351
No. Caroline...

230
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,508
has to prosecute our case.
Taffet tried to kill us.

231
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,154
Our evidence has been throw out.

232
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,138
The ratial thing to do is to pursue
a case with fresh, untainted evidence.

233
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,533
Are you kidding me?

234
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,143
Is it really that easy for you
to forget what happened to us?

235
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,345
I will never forget
what happened to us,

236
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:00,023
or to Booth, or this boy.

237
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,651
You are not the only one suffering,
Dr. Hodgins.

238
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,446
But your emotions have no relevance,
not if we want to convict Taffet.

239
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,442
This better work.

240
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,286
I'll have the charges
dismissed in the morning.

241
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,341
You can start right after that.

242
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,666
So the Gilroy kid was last seen
at the Rockland Mall on June 23.

243
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,513
I'm gonna check all Taffet's credit
card records for that day, too.

244
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:53,999
Caroline said you can't give
expert testimony

245
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,787
if she's prosecuting your case.

246
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,987
I told Caroline
to drop my charges, too.

247
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,961
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.

248
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:09,634
She's gonna see the judge tomorrow
at 10:00, then we can dive in on this.

249
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,511
Thanks, Booth.

250
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,598
We're partners, it's what we do.

251
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:15,838
Right?

252
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,729
If Taffet is acquitted
on this count,

253
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,338
she can never be tried again.

254
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,066
Maybe that's why she wanted us
to find the boy.

255
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:28,236
Well, she's arrogant...

256
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,824
like Sweets said.
And she's misjudging you.

257
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,719
I have nightmares, Booth.

258
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:38,660
Hodgins is bleeding...

259
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,451
you're drowning...

260
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,421
I can't help anyone.

261
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:48,590
You know what?

262
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,385
She's never gonna get the better of you.
Just know that.

263
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,220
All right? I promise, okay?

264
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,335
These are perimortem fractures,

265
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,112
bilaterally on the fifth,
sixth and seventh ribs

266
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,615
on the posterior axillary lines.

267
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,825
And injuries to the greater cornu

268
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,204
and the left lateral thyroid
and cricoid cartilages.

269
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,066
I see injuries like this
in victims who've been strangled.

270
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,901
Perhaps he struggled,
and Taffet was trying to subdue him.

271
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,878
Taffet Tasered all her victims.

272
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,365
Three million volts.
That should be enough to knock out

273
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,175
- a ten-year-old boy for a few hours.
- He wasn't unconscious.

274
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,852
These are defensive wounds,

275
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,846
consistent with the boy
resisting being placed in the freezer

276
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,351
arms outstretched.

277
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,355
I'll take samples
from under his fingernails.

278
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,519
Maybe he scratched her
during the struggle.

279
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,558
Maybe she knew the facts
in this case

280
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:47,392
wouldn't be consistent
with the other crimes,

281
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,526
and would give her reasonable doubt.

282
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,020
We have evidence from
credit card charges

283
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,880
the defendant was at
the Rockland Mall

284
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,998
on the day that Terrence Gilroy
was abducted.

285
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,386
The team at the Jeffersonian
discovered

286
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,146
that the number Taffet called,

287
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,488
turned out to be
the same GPS coordinates

288
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,263
as to where the boy was buried.

289
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,352
The same M.O., same ransom tape,

290
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,934
the same demands
as the other kidnappings.

291
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,104
Do you have any evidence the Gilroy boy
was abducted from the mall?

292
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,034
It was the last place he was seen.

293
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,332
So, no.

294
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:30,942
Did anyone else

295
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,653
make any purchases at the mall that day,
or was it just me?

296
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,571
No.

297
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,157
As for the phone call
that I allegedly made,

298
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,660
is it possible that the number
was placed in my file by mistake?

299
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:41,619
Objection.

300
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,371
- Conjecture.
- Sustained.

301
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,624
Did you know that the officer on duty
when I was arrested was from Salt Lake?

302
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,879
Answer the question, Agent Booth.

303
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,048
Isn't it more likely

304
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,259
that he made that call,
and the number

305
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,553
was placed in my file by mistake?

306
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,680
Objection. Conjecture again.

307
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,475
I thought it was reasonable doubt.
Very reasonable.

308
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,143
- Your Honor...
- Withdrawn.

309
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,936
No further questions, Your Honor.

310
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,261
You know that Taffet's
playing you, right?

311
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,723
We're fine.

312
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:29,459
- No, she's got you all on defense.
- We got the boy, all right?

313
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,753
It's because she wanted you to.
Every psycho takes

314
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,963
one step too far and hangs themself.

315
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:36,649
Not before a lot of innocent people
get hurt.

316
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,844
See you.

317
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,816
Sorry to bother you.
You have a minute?

318
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:53,996
Yeah, sure.

319
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:03,010
- How's it going?
- I don't know, actually.

320
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,536
That's why I'm here.

321
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:08,206
I'm worried.

322
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,669
This case is taking
its toll on everyone.

323
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,922
- Including you?
- Including me, yes.

324
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,221
It's a very stressful situation.

325
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,454
You're not immune to that.

326
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,974
I feel like everything's fraying
around the edges.

327
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,195
We're all searching
for some piece of evidence

328
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,641
that can put Taffet away.

329
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,894
But we keep coming up empty.
Everyone feels manipulated by her.

330
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,436
And I should be able

331
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,606
to pull everyone together
keep them on track.

332
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,735
You want to guarantee the outcome.

333
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,421
I wish that were possible.

334
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,919
But you know, we knew this was
going to be an uphill battle.

335
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,329
But did we believe that?

336
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,906
We all knew she was guil.

337
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,393
So someplace,

338
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:55,142
we assumed that in a just world
she'd pay for what she did.

339
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:59,529
That assumes a just world,
I'm afraid.

340
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:02,888
These...

341
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:06,163
are my people she hurt, my friends.

342
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:07,288
I should...

343
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,643
be able to do something.

344
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:16,006
I know.

345
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:59,651
You didn't think
I was going to follow you?

346
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:10,870
Max, is this what you want?

347
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,704
- Don't trust the system.
- You miss, you compromise the case,

348
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,587
- Taffet walks.
- I don't miss!

349
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:24,676
When are you gonna learn to
stop messing with me, huh?

350
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,558
You're making a big mistake.
Tempe could die.

351
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:31,891
Yeah, come on.

352
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:36,832
- He tried to kill her?
- He had a rifle pointed right at her,

353
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:39,852
- so you do the math.
- Why? Why would he do that?

354
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,219
To protect you.
And a career criminal like Max...

355
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,404
he obviously doesn't
trust the legal system.

356
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,925
I'm sorry, Booth.

357
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,450
- I wish he were different.
- Me, too. He socked me in the eye, too.

358
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,033
- Brennan.
- Hey, honey.

359
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,708
- I need you to bail me out.
- What?! No, Dad.

360
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:58,559
I was doing it for you.

361
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:01,421
<i>No, I don't want you
to kill people for me.</i>

362
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,423
Buy me a sweater,
like a regular dad.

363
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,050
- Leave her alone, Max.
- Booth says you're not getting out

364
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,677
until after the trial is over.

365
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,959
I have to go.

366
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,048
I've got a bad back. You know
the beds in jail.

367
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,357
<i>Good-bye, Dad.</i>

368
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:15,518
I'm sorry, Bones.

369
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,685
I'm sure this is the last thing
you want to deal with.

370
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:22,316
Part of me wishes he'd done it.

371
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,986
Not the good part, so let just keep
our eye on the ball.

372
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:28,023
So, any news about the boy?

373
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,459
I'm getting an accurate
recreation of the assailant

374
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,411
from the fracture patterns on
his remains, and it matchs for Taffet.

375
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,884
I'm putting a presentation
together for court.

376
00:23:36,223 --> 00:23:39,487
- The kid put up a good fight, huh?
- There's evidence of strong resistance.

377
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:41,836
- Yes.
- Yeah, at least he didn't go easy.

378
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:45,026
Parker... he'd do the same thing.

379
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:46,841
Probably bite her ear off and run.

380
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,705
- He'd bite her?
- Yeah.

381
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,056
Ten-year-olds...
it's kind of their thing.

382
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,641
They bite.

383
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,567
I have to get back to the lab.

384
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,780
If the boy bit her, there should be

385
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,282
some evidence on his maxilla,
mandible or his teeth.

386
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:15,286
The teeth seem to have been cleaned.
Taffet probably wiped them off.

387
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,528
Second left premolar is chipped.

388
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:20,041
There might be some trace
in the abrasion,

389
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:22,824
maybe some tissue
from Heather Taffet.

390
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,047
Saliva contains amylase that would
have broken down any bits of tissue.

391
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,413
Not if it were imbedded between
the teeth or under the gum line.

392
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,976
<i>If I don't receive the money</i>

393
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,354
<i>in the numbered account
within eight hours,</i>

394
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,795
<i>your child will die.</i>

395
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:44,496
<i>This is the last...</i>

396
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:46,317
Okay, this encryption is

397
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,407
a rolling code split
band voice inversion.

398
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:52,366
Individual frequencies between
the clicks are inverted and recombined.

399
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,033
I applied software

400
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,537
that decrypts each of
the 423 separate segments

401
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,241
until the voice becomes clear.

402
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,073
<i>If I don't receive the money</i>

403
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:04,252
<i>in the numbered account
within eight hours,</i>

404
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,833
<i>your child will die.</i>

405
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,866
<i>This is the last time
you will hear from me.</i>

406
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,218
- <i>There will be no further...</i>
- You did it, Angela.

407
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:13,695
It's Taffet.

408
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,628
Like to see her
explain away that one.

409
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,540
<i>If I don't receive the money
in the numbered account</i>

410
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:23,261
<i>within eight hours,
your child will die.</i>

411
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,174
<i>This is the last time
you will hear from me.</i>

412
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,318
<i>There will be
no further communications.</i>

413
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:32,196
And in your expert
opinion, Ms. Montenegro,

414
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:34,866
- whose voice is that?
- It's Heather Taffet.

415
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,494
The frequency and vocal patterns
are an exact match when compared

416
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,930
to unencrypted recordings
of her voice.

417
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,207
Thank you.
No further questions.

418
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,468
That was very

419
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:47,170
impressive, Ms. Montenegro.

420
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,672
Could you share your credentials
with the court?

421
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,255
I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts
from the University of Texas

422
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,051
with a Minor in Computer Science.

423
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,345
And I've also studied
biomedical illustration

424
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,722
at American University.

425
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,989
But you do not have a degree
in sound engineering, is that correct?

426
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:02,476
No.

427
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,478
Objection. Ms. Montenegro has

428
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,105
numerous patents pending from

429
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,707
her work in auditory
forensic reconstruction.

430
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,236
One homeless man has a patent pending
for a time machine.

431
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,722
That doesn't mean I'm going
to ask him to testify.

432
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,036
Enough, Ms. Taffet.

433
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,627
Do you have anything else?

434
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:20,203
Yes, Your Honor.
I'd like to introduce into evidence

435
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:22,538
item 461B,

436
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,333
which is a deconstruction
of the same ransom tape

437
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:28,211
by former FBI Special
Agent Graham Steele,

438
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,837
who has a PhD

439
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,507
in Forensic Auditory Analysis
from the University of Pennsylvania.

440
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:37,595
<i>If I don't receive the money
in the numbered account</i>

441
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,764
<i>within eight hours,
your child will die.</i>

442
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,032
That isn't me.

443
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:43,809
He obviously manipulated
the pitch and the timbre

444
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,479
- of the voice.
- Isn't that what you did?

445
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,189
Those sound waves have

446
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,447
an underlying pattern
of frequency modulation.

447
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:52,506
Like a fingerprint.

448
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:54,237
Whatever the technical jargon,

449
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,280
it seems clear that anyone,

450
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,449
even someone without
any credentials,

451
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,382
can make one voice
sound like another.

452
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,411
Objection!
Counsel is making speeches.

453
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,288
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

454
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,752
No further questions.

455
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,352
- Hey, Bones, you ready for court?
- Yes.

456
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,190
I have a video presentation

457
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,898
which shows the victim
sustained rib fractures

458
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,609
and a fracture of the lateral
epicondyle of the left distal...

459
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,153
What do you say we ease up
on the scientific stuff, okay?

460
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:39,413
The science gives us
the height of the assailant.

461
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:41,664
162 centimeters...
Taffet's height.

462
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,619
That's good and all,
but Taffet's kind of had a field day,

463
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:46,776
trashing the whole
technical goobledy stuff.

464
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,500
And the jury seems
to like her for it.

465
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,585
But those are the facts.

466
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,510
It's how you present the facts that

467
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,424
win or lose a case.

468
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,652
Bones, the jury needs to know

469
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,842
what that little boy went through.

470
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:05,460
I've testified before, Booth.

471
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,809
I'll be fine.

472
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,015
We should go.

473
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,150
Terrence Gilroy's

474
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,629
left greater cornu of
the hyoid was compressed,

475
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,572
indicating that the assailant

476
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:22,658
strangled the young boy
using only one hand...

477
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,846
the dominant left hand,
in this case.

478
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,955
I'd like to submit writing samples

479
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,504
which confirm that the defendant
is left-handed.

480
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,501
No objection, as long
as it's also noted

481
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,432
that eight percent of the general
population is also left-handed.

482
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:37,381
Including you, Your Honor.

483
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:41,552
Continue.

484
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,976
The victim sustained a fracture

485
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:48,267
of the lateral epicondyle
and the shaft

486
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,478
of the left distal humerus.

487
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,399
I can be clearer.

488
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,540
Terrence Gilroy's bones
could only have been broken

489
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,759
by someone kneeling on top of him

490
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:03,657
as they pushed him into the freezer.

491
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:05,968
The radiating fracture lines show

492
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,828
that this assailant
had to be between

493
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,365
125 and 135 pounds...

494
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,124
the weight of the defendant.

495
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,855
Objection. This is speculation.

496
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,711
Are you questioning
my qualifications?

497
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,254
Because you will not find

498
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,049
a more experienced or respected
forensic anthropologist

499
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:22,847
anywhere in the world.
So I'd appreciate not being interrupted

500
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:24,726
until I finish testifying.

501
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:25,968
Dr. Brennan,

502
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:28,265
I'll make the rulings here.

503
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:31,268
Overruled.

504
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:32,812
Continue.

505
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:35,981
Since these broken bones were
caused by the assailant's knees

506
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,328
and the chipping
on the boy's kneecaps

507
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,820
was caused by the toes of

508
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,965
her heavy boots,
we can determine the length of her shin.

509
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,700
And what is the significance
of the shin length?

510
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:48,941
It gives us the height
of the assailant,

511
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:50,797
which is five feet, four inches.

512
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:53,290
The same height as the defendant.

513
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:55,894
It is clear from
the circumstantial evidence

514
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,539
and these facts
that this child was attacked

515
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,423
with vicious cruelty by Ms. Taffet.

516
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,591
Objection.

517
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,968
The jury makes that
determination, not the witness.

518
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,679
The five-foot-four assailant...

519
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:09,625
crushed the boy's chest,

520
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:11,559
choked him,

521
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:14,310
and finally caused him
a torturous death

522
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,688
by burying him alive.

523
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,301
Objection.
Speculation.

524
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,859
- She can't know what the witness felt.
- I was buried alive.

525
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,309
Which makes me uniquely qualified
to comment on its horror.

526
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,625
Objection, Your Honor.
This is grandstanding.

527
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,997
Unless the witness has
any additional facts...

528
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,165
Sustained.

529
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:37,710
Do you have any further questions
for Dr. Brennan, Ms. Julian?

530
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,983
No, Your Honor.
I learned everything I need to know.

531
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,715
Your witness.

532
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:50,014
Dr. Brennan, don't you think
your trauma as a kidnapping victim

533
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,849
prevents you from being objective?

534
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,142
Objection.

535
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,854
She is testifying as
an expert witness, not a victim.

536
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,820
- She brought up being buried alive.
- She did, Ms. Julian.

537
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,901
Overruled.

538
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,944
It's only natural
that you would want

539
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,239
to construct facts that would
give you some closure and peace.

540
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,676
I resent your implication.

541
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,146
I do not let my emotions
cloud my findings.

542
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,800
Not intentionally, of course.

543
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,080
- Is there a question coming?
- Yes.

544
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,956
Sorry.

545
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:19,251
Dr. Brennan, you are currently seeing
an FBI psychologist, are you not?

546
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,170
That has nothing to do with...

547
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,720
A yes or no is all that's required,
Dr. Brennan.

548
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,651
Are you currently seeing an FBI
psychologist?

549
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,531
- Yes, but...
- Thank you. No further questions.

550
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,455
That has
nothing to do with this case.

551
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,089
My findings are sound.

552
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,270
- You may step down, Dr. Brennan.
- My findings are sound.

553
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,823
A dust mite?

554
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,035
- So that little bug is gonna save us?
- Don't call him a bug.

555
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,916
Sounds insulting.
We reexamined the boy's teeth and

556
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,137
found it wedged between
the right lateral incisor and canine.

557
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,601
Dust mites eat
dead human skin cells.

558
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:03,775
And this one's stomach sac is full.

559
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,256
If the boy bit Taffet,

560
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,223
the skin cells are probably hers.

561
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:11,027
Whatever's left is gonna be small, but
there might be enough to give us DNA.

562
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,093
This is a Dermatophagoides farinae.

563
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:19,144
For those of us who don't
speak insect, what is that, exactly?

564
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,437
It's a dust mite...

565
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,219
an insect found on clothes,
but it also feeds on

566
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,527
the cells of the person
wearing those clothes.

567
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,810
And where was this dust mite found?

568
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,932
Between Terrence Gilroy's teeth.

569
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,033
It was transferred
there when the boy

570
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,071
bit the person who kidnapped him.

571
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:37,997
And how do we know that?

572
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,404
The dust mite contained
human female epithelial cells.

573
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,502
We extracted those cells

574
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,095
and ran them through
several DNA databases.

575
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,382
The cells belonged
to Heather Taffet.

576
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,219
Nothing further.

577
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,221
Your witness, Ms. Taffet.

578
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,762
It seems that you have
neglected to include

579
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,625
a sample of the evidence that I
could have tested independently.

580
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,064
Since there was so few cells in the mite
the testing destroyed the sample,

581
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,693
but the procedures and results are
all contained in our documentation.

582
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:10,365
Let me get this right.

583
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,961
I have access to your notes,
but I can't examine

584
00:33:13,086 --> 00:33:15,659
the actual evidence
because you destroyed it?

585
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,387
Your Honor, in California
versus Trombetta,

586
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,636
the Supreme Court ruled
that the prosecution

587
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:22,818
could destroy a sample
to test for DNA

588
00:33:22,943 --> 00:33:25,502
- because there was no bad faith.
- Bad faith?

589
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,057
The motives of every single person
at the Jeffersonian are suspect,

590
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:31,383
and now their only physical
evidence is gone...

591
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,886
- if it existed at all.
- I've just about had it with

592
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,804
your unsubstantiated allegations.

593
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:38,474
- As have I.
- That's enough, Ms. Julian.

594
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,018
Your Honor, I would
like to file a motion to have

595
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,534
this unverifiable
DNA evidence dismissed.

596
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,531
Protocol has been followed,
Ms. Taffet.

597
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,086
It's up to the jury
to decide how the evidence

598
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:50,861
will figure in the outcome of this case.
Your motion is denied.

599
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,868
Did you see Taffet's face?
She was completely blindsided.

600
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:05,375
Caroline's closing...

601
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:07,731
it's going to kill.

602
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:09,338
All right, so here we go.

603
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,560
That's it, huh?

604
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:16,870
Are you okay, Bones?
Your team just nailed Taffet.

605
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:18,962
I'm just tired.

606
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,684
It's been a tough case.

607
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,435
It's not just the case.

608
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,107
I'm tired of...

609
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:30,587
of all of it.

610
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:32,913
I'm tired of dealing with murders

611
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:36,688
and victims and sadness and pain.

612
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,025
That's what we do.

613
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,249
All right?
We catch the bad people,

614
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,122
and we make the world
a better place.

615
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,917
That's what you do, and somehow,
I got caught up into it.

616
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,318
You were dealing with dead people
long before we got together.

617
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:52,798
As a researcher, an anthropologist.

618
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:56,102
That's how I can make
the world a better place.

619
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,886
And you do. Come on.

620
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,774
Cheers to that, all right?

621
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:03,058
You're anxious.

622
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:05,269
And tomorrow,

623
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,538
when we have won,
everything will be perfect.

624
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,189
It'll be fine.

625
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,290
We are here to seek justice

626
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:24,329
for this ten years old boy

627
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:27,882
who was kidnapped, brutally beaten

628
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:30,419
and buried alive by Heather Taffet.

629
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:33,436
Taffet was seen
where this child was abducted.

630
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,883
She matches the size
of the assailant.

631
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,676
She's left-handed.

632
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,675
Her voice was discovered
on the ransom tapes.

633
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,931
It all sounds very reasonable,
doesn't it?

634
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,820
These so-called facts

635
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,814
were compiled by people
who themselves

636
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,523
were victims of a vicious criminal
who has not yet been caught.

637
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:54,683
- They need a scapegoat.
- But only Heather Taffet

638
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:58,418
could have the DNA that was
found in this child's mouth.

639
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,785
That evidence was delivered
to us in death by this brave boy.

640
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,599
And yet, the only people
who saw that dust mite,

641
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,427
the only people who touched
the alleged

642
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:11,310
epithelial cells

643
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,504
were two kidnap victims...

644
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,256
one a known conspiracy theorist,

645
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,592
the other a traumatized
anthropologist

646
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,719
who's currently being
treated by a psychologist.

647
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:22,638
And Dr. Saroyan,

648
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,933
who couldn't perform her job
without destroying the evidence,

649
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,019
conveniently preventing me
from mounting a defense.

650
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,647
Because she has no defense,
except slandering

651
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,148
these experts.

652
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,549
They have told you what
Heather Taffet did to that boy.

653
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,445
The law is clear.

654
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:42,115
You cannot convict a person
based on innuendo

655
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,160
or groundless accusations.

656
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,190
I weep for that boy.

657
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:51,250
No child should suffer like that,
and whoever did this...

658
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,756
should never be allowed to

659
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,116
walk among decent people again.

660
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:59,312
For that boy, for justice,

661
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:02,956
- you must return a verdict of...
- Not guilty.

662
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,579
Because it's clear
that I am a scapegoat.

663
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:07,785
I am innocent.

664
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:12,134
Thank you.

665
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,889
Caroline nailed it in there.

666
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:22,531
- Taffet was pretty convincing.
- You know what, Hodgins?

667
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,450
- You ever see the bright side?
- You know what? You're right.

668
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:28,614
Because no matter what happens
in there, I've got Angela.

669
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:30,622
It's okay.

670
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:32,526
I don't care, Angie.

671
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,419
Taffet's not going to make
the rules anymore.

672
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,920
I want everybody to know.

673
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:39,298
Angela and I are married.

674
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:41,948
What?

675
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,805
- When, Ang?
- In jail.

676
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,516
Hodgins wanted to wait
until this was over,

677
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,019
so everybody could be happy for us.

678
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,902
- This isn't another pregnancy scare?
- No. No, this is...

679
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,243
this is love.

680
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,696
Why were you hiding this from us?

681
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:06,265
I was having trouble dealing
with things because of the trial.

682
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,104
Then I thought...
screw it.

683
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:10,871
The jury's back.

684
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,849
The defendant will rise
for the reading of the verdict.

685
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,026
In count one,

686
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:39,316
the kidnapping of Terrence Gilroy,

687
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:42,945
the jury finds the defendant,
Heather Taffet,

688
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:45,152
guilty.

689
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,319
Order, or I will clear the court.

690
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:49,263
In count two,

691
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,584
the murder of Terrence Gilroy,

692
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:54,924
the jury finds the defendant...

693
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,668
guilty.

694
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,880
The defendant is remanded into
custody until sentencing.

695
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:03,840
We are adjourned.

696
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:14,893
This isn't over.

697
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:47,184
I was out of town
for a couple of days.

698
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:49,377
I knew Tempe had
everything under control.

699
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:50,836
She didn't need me.

700
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:53,171
Let's raise our glasses here.
To the squints.

701
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:55,183
- To Booth.
- And Caroline.

702
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,854
I never doubted any
of you, not for a minute.

703
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:00,522
Come on.

704
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:01,968
Please.

705
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,239
Let's not forget the happy couple.

706
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:08,113
Best wishes

707
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,824
for a successful blending
of familial obligations,

708
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,494
as well as monetary
and property consolidation.

709
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,330
What?

710
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,547
I guess I'll go home.

711
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:34,514
A real bed is probably
going to feel good.

712
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,684
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

713
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,353
Sweets would say that subconsciously
you wanted Booth to catch you

714
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:44,566
so you and I wouldn't have
to be separated again.

715
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,904
Smart guy, that Sweets.

716
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:50,778
I love you, honey.

717
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:53,654
Thanks for leaving me with
the bill again. That's nice of you.

718
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:56,202
Your fault, Booth.
My wallet got stolen in jail.

719
00:40:57,574 --> 00:40:59,915
Can't believe they
actually got hitched.

720
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:01,193
I know.

721
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,795
I have this sense that
everything's changing.

722
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,015
Not everything.

723
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,176
Look... we're still partners.

724
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:12,648
Right?

725
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,896
And Taffet...
she's put away.

726
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:16,807
You're feeling good
about that, right?

727
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,888
You almost died, Booth.
That can happen again.

728
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:22,437
- What if, I can't get to you?
- It's not going to happen.

729
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,730
I envy your ability to

730
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,527
substitute optimism for reality.

731
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,914
Maybe you just need
to take some time off.

732
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,547
Go to a beach.
Lay in the sun.

733
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,955
I might need more
than a little time.

734
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,209
Don't make any decisions
about your future right now.

735
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:46,628
You know when
a dentist gives you anesthetic

736
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,249
and tells you not to operate
any heavy machinery

737
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,591
or make any important decisions
within 24 hours?

738
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:53,218
This case

739
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,011
was bigger than a root canal.

740
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:57,887
Let's just go back inside
and have one more drink.

741
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:00,456
I'm tired, Booth.
I'm going to go home.

742
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,326
All right. Come on.

743
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,364
We'll get you in the cab.

744
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:07,041
I know, it's been a long, long day.

745
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,858
All right, get in there, all right?

746
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,778
I'll see you tomorrow, right?

747
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:16,862
