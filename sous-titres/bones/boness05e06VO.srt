1
00:00:01,118 --> 00:00:03,029
I had a feeling
that my <i>Melolontha melolontha</i>

2
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:05,663
might hatch this morning,
so I came in at the crack of dawn,

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,800
and there they were,
lined up at the door.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,509
What, your <i>Melolontha melolontha?</i>

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,927
The Woodchucks.

6
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,462
They appear to be little girls.

7
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:17,808
Woodchucks are like
girl Scouts, only scientific

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,204
and administered by the Jeffersonian.
They brought in the dead body.

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,541
A bunch of little girls
brought a dead body here?

10
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,858
Woodchucks are
very industrious marmots.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,945
Okay, now, this is
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

12
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:34,951
- Why are they applauding?
- Apparently, you're their role model.

13
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,914
 Why they aren't all freaked out
and getting trauma counseling.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,550
Because they're the type of children
who idolize Dr. Brennan.

15
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,794
So, they were eco-camping on the banks
of the Savage River.

16
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,968
These remains are
completely saturated.

17
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:49,623
The girls fished the body
out of the river

18
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,726
and brought it to us.

19
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,760
How?

20
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,492
In our Woodchuck bus.

21
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:55,917
Very impressive.

22
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:59,334
I disagree. Those Woodchucks
disturbed a federal crime scene.

23
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,951
The area should have been secured,
samples taken.

24
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,854
They did all that.

25
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:07,525
Water samples from the river
where the body was found.

26
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,584
Digital photographs
of the entire area.

27
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,357
Plants, insects,

28
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,241
soil samples tagged
with GPS coordinates.

29
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,099
Now, I know my soil samples,
and let me tell you something.

30
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,482
These ladies... they are pros.

31
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:24,358
Perhaps you should throw them a bone.
Not literally. Metaphorically.

32
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,920
After all,
they were very professional.

33
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,134
Attention, Woodchucks.
You were thorough

34
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,681
and assiduous in your treatment
of the body and the crime scene.

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,060
But next time, please leave the evidence
where you found it,

36
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,692
and let the experienced
professionals do their job.

37
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,149
But we helped!

38
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,692
You're mean!

39
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,574
Their moods are capricious.

40
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,240
You couldn't have just let them
have that one, let it go by?

41
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,255
Then they'd never learn.

42
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,834
What causes a corpse
to smell like a fart?

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,931
A number of things.

44
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,607
A compromised intestinal tract,

45
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:13,674
methane, some mining processes,

46
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,533
oil and gas refining.

47
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:16,942
Volcanoes?

48
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,217
Volcanoes? Awesome.

49
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:21,716
- Which of those was it this time?
- Probably sulfur.

50
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,683
Tissue samples indicate a high
concentration of hydrogen sulfide.

51
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:27,021
X-rays indicate
this is a middle-aged male

52
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,999
between 170
and 190 centimeters tall.

53
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:32,499
Skeleton is pretty banged up.

54
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,682
Bouncing around the Savage River
for two months will do that.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,117
All the distal phalanges are missing
from the interphalangeal joints.

56
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:42,767
He's missing his fingers.
What does that tell you?

57
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,105
Tells me it was the mob,
snipping off fingerprints.

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,416
That very well may be,
but what it tells me

59
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,407
is you're going out
to look for fingertips,

60
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,180
in case the Woodchucks missed them.

61
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,501
The body was found by woodchucks?

62
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,341
Take Hodgins.
He'll explain.

63
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,800
- Hydrogen sulfide?
- Yeah, guy's full of it.

64
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,085
So he smells basically like a fart?

65
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,725
Had to be pretty strong to cover up
the rotting corpse smell?

66
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,946
Maybe somebody
drenched him in sulfur

67
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,716
to deal with the dead body stench.

68
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:11,143
Or somebody tried to put
him in suspended animation.

69
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,918
That involves sulfides.

70
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:16,217
Are you referring to ultra-secret
military experiments

71
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:18,197
to prolong life
by inducing hibernation?

72
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:20,784
It's not ultra secret.

73
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,660
The Army is doing field trials.

74
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,359
I got a cousin in Iraq.
It maybe saved his life.

75
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,018
It's not ultra secret?

76
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:30,042
Look, man, the trouble with getting
your info from conspiracy nuts is

77
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,670
- they never know when to turn it off.
- You wait and see.

78
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,590
We're gonna find that our victim was
tortured a little too enthusiastically,

79
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,800
and the government tried
to bring him back to life.

80
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,636
Proving my point there, Hodgins.

81
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,079
Should we call the military
possibility in to Booth?

82
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,226
Just leave out my torture theory.

83
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:53,482
- So, you got a face on the victim?
- Why are you here?

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,150
I would have called.

85
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,737
I thought Hodgins might
have something on this whole

86
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,817
suspended animation thing.

87
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,943
- You listened to Hodgins?
- No, Wendell.

88
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,334
Well, what is DARPA?

89
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,328
It's a Department of Defense agency.

90
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,997
The Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.

91
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,207
Hodgins says they're into
some pretty weird stuff.

92
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,709
Like creating super soldiers

93
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,462
who don't need sleep and can
kill with their laser beam eyes.

94
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,048
Right, well, I don't know
about the laser beam eye thing,

95
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,474
but they did have a master sergeant
go missing about a couple of months ago.

96
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,042
Was the sergeant involved with
the hydrogen sulfide trials?

97
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,775
Well, they wouldn't confirm,
but they sounded nervous.

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,435
- There's no photograph in here.
- DARPA doesn't give out any photos.

99
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,271
You give me the reconstruction, though,
I can show them that,

100
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,774
and they can tell us
if we got their guy.

101
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,451
What do you have?

102
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,411
Before you freak out,
you should know

103
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,909
that I double and triple checked
the measurements and indicators.

104
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,234
I don't freak out.
Do I freak out?

105
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,454
Some... Sometimes.

106
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,276
Can we just see the image, please?

107
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,921
- Yeah. What's that supposed to be?
- Half man, half chicken?

108
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,423
- Come on.
- I believe this to be fairly accurate.

109
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,892
Okay, so you want me
to go ask the Defense Department

110
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:05,680
if their experimental super soldier
is half man, half chicken? 

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,252
Bones - Season 5 Episode 06

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

114
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,628
DARPA created a chicken soldier?

115
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:46,517
I do not see the United States Military
making a chicken soldier.

116
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,015
- An eagle, maybe.
- That's why we couldn't find

117
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,442
his so-called fingers.

118
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,644
They were transformed into talons.
I mean, talons...

119
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,271
they would be better weapons.

120
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,774
Human remains in water tend to lose all
their fingers and toes due to predation.

121
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,694
But if I were going
to combine human and animal DNA

122
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,156
with an eye toward creating
a super soldier, I'd go with a flatworm.

123
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:08,159
- Why?
- Self-regeneration, obviously.

124
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:09,285
People!

125
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,954
Let's break this down as though
we aren't in a comic book.

126
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,917
No water in the sinuses or
lungs, no pulmonary edema.

127
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,294
- He didn't drown.
- The sinus cavity is

128
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,135
abnormally large.

129
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,250
His whole sinus cavity is scarred.
The septum's almost gone.

130
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,321
Evidence of multiple constrictions of
the arterioles at Kiesselbach's plexus.

131
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,075
That is a lot of scar tissue.
What are we talking,

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,356
plastic surgery?

133
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:35,061
Well, the scarring could explain
why he has a beak-like nose.

134
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:38,773
Polyps and tumors in the maxillary
and sphenoid could have enlarged it.

135
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,164
The closest thing I've ever seen to that
is a cocaine addict who ran out of drugs

136
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,613
and started snorting things like
sugar and powdered detergent.

137
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,908
Does anyone have any explanation
for these red stripes

138
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,659
extending from the soft palate
down the esophagus?

139
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,033
Lacerations?

140
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:53,120
May I?

141
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,543
I don't think these are lacerations.

142
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,426
Is that an organism?

143
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,116
<i>Syngamus trachea.</i>

144
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,304
It's a gapeworm.

145
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:11,806
Where'd it come from?

146
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,943
I don't think
you're gonna like my answer.

147
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,009
It's a parasite found in chickens.

148
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:19,939
Do not tell me we're back
to super chicken soldier again.

149
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:27,822
Why a chicken?

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,101
Wendell thinks maybe he was
supposed to be an eagle.

151
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,367
You should be getting it now.
You make a super soldier,

152
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:34,662
you think it would be a robot
or something invisible.

153
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,498
- You're delving into science fiction.
- Like a flatworm...

154
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,085
that's science fiction or a half chicken
that's not considered science fiction.

155
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,713
Yeah. Okay, so we agree that
it does look like a chicken.

156
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,351
No, it is not a joke.

157
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:48,077
Just tell me if we have
your missing DARPA guy.

158
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:52,383
Does your missing sergeant look
anything like an animal?

159
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,932
Any kind of an animal?

160
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:55,975
A bulldog.

161
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,105
So the Defense Department
won't be claiming the body?

162
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,664
Getting a hit off
of Angela's chicken man picture.

163
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,624
Probably from the animal shelter.

164
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,617
- God.
- What?

165
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,746
Is Angela good, or is she good?

166
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,372
Those are the same question.

167
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,713
"Nick Rabin."

168
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,625
He's head of personnel
at Clucksten Farms.

169
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:29,926
A chicken farm?

170
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,601
This is getting weirder and weirder.

171
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,145
<i>Save a chicken! Fry a worker!</i>

172
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,941
<i>Cluck you! Cluck you!
Close down Clucksten!</i>

173
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,784
- Wonder what they're protesting.
- Well, my first guess...

174
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,118
the stench.

175
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,209
At least they're not
throwing eggs at us?

176
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,707
<i>Chicken killer!
Close down Clucksten!</i>

177
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,718
Rest the voice, Josh.

178
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:07,722
You the, FBI folks?

179
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:10,983
Come on in.
We'll find a quieter place to talk.

180
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:12,985
<i>You're working in a death camp!</i>

181
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,257
So, what's with the protesters?

182
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,582
Maybe half are animal rights nuts.

183
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,902
They might have a point.

184
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,509
The other half must
just hate the smell.

185
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,945
Clucksten Farms has been here
since the 1940s.

186
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,073
We didn't ask anyone
to build a development downwind.

187
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,316
What's that smell?

188
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:46,742
John.

189
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:47,753
Mrs. Rabin,

190
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:52,174
this is Agent Booth
and his associate Dr. Brennan.

191
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,581
They're from the FBI.
This is Gaynor Rabin.

192
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:56,559
She's the accountant here
at Clucksten.

193
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,573
She's also Nick's wife.

194
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,434
Is this about my husband?

195
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,312
- He's dead, isn't he?
- I'm afraid so.

196
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:06,147
We're very sorry for your loss.

197
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,776
What happened to him?

198
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,193
We're still in the process
of figuring that out.

199
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,280
You don't seem too surprised.

200
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,992
Nick was never the type to disappear.
I knew it was something terrible.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,138
- Where'd you find him?
- In the Savage River,

202
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,423
approximately 16 kilometers
from here.

203
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:23,857
Nick drowned?

204
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,284
I don't understand.
He never swam in that river.

205
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,029
Your husband's nose
and sinuses were deformed.

206
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,590
He didn't take the proper
precautions at work, did he?

207
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:34,967
No, I told him, but he didn't care.

208
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,598
Precautions to what? {\keep
from turning into a chicken?}

209
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,763
It's the hydrogen sulfide we smell.

210
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,057
Without a breathing apparatus,
high concentrations

211
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,976
over a period of time
would deform the sinuses.

212
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,217
Nick worked here
since he was a teenager.

213
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:49,178
He said he was a chicken farmer,
and he'd take the consequences.

214
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,799
How did my husband end up
in the river?

215
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:54,219
We were hoping that maybe
you'd be able to help us with that.

216
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:57,198
When I filed the missing persons report,
I told the police everything.

217
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,718
He just disappeared.

218
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:02,453
We have reason to believe
this wasn't an accidental drowning.

219
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,873
You think my husband was murdered?

220
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,800
Mr. Clucksten said that Nick was next
in line to take over the business.

221
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:20,699
First people that you wanna check out
are those anti-chicken fanatics

222
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,738
They always threaten to make
an example out of someone.

223
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,444
Five months and 14 days

224
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,883
- I have been celibate.
- Angela, that is very impressive.

225
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,117
Thank you.

226
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,728
Sweets was right.
Taking sex out of that equation

227
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,917
made me relate to people
in a totally different way.

228
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:49,333
Yeah, once you got past
the mega-horny stage.

229
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:53,686
The point is, is that
my six months is almost up.

230
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:55,074
So...

231
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,590
- No.
- No, what?

232
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:00,845
I am not gonna be
the one that breaks your fast.

233
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,805
I... I wasn't asking.

234
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,891
In fact, you should know that
I was considering going for a year.

235
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,438
That's definitely a chicken parasite
we found in the victim's esophagus.

236
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,374
I wasn't asking, Jack.

237
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:14,235
I was just...

238
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,276
keeping you in the loop.

239
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,131
<i>Cluck you! Cluck you!</i>

240
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,242
<i>Save a chicken! Fry a worker!</i>

241
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,609
<i>There's the employees!</i>

242
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,482
<i>Hey, lady, you gonna go
kill some chickens today?!</i>

243
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:42,637
- Get out of my face and go get a job!
- Murderer!

244
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,640
Murderer now?
What do you want me to do?

245
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,768
She's psycho!
Psycho chicken killer!

246
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,591
Psycho chicken killer!

247
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:52,939
I got kids to feed!

248
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,149
You're just...
giving them what they want.

249
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,270
- I'm doing an honest day's work!
- Just go, just go.

250
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,780
You don't wanna be
late for your shift.

251
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,499
They don't seem to like the way
you treat the chickens.

252
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:06,993
So how do you treat them?

253
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,112
Like delicious birds
that people love to eat.

254
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:12,666
Look, does anyone in particular here
have a beef with, Nick Rabin?

255
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:15,253
Josh Parsons.

256
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:20,303
He snuck in,
he took some unauthorized video,

257
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,344
cut it together in a very damning manner
and he put it on the Internet.

258
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,137
Nick popped him one, too.

259
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:29,100
<i>Close down Cluckster's!
Veggies, not birds!</i>

260
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,783
FBI Special Agent Booth.
This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

261
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,930
You're here to protect them
while they torture

262
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:37,191
chickens on this farm and the people who
live downwind of its foul emanations?

263
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,990
- You practice that speech much?
- We found Nick Rabin's body.

264
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:41,862
Now you are our number one suspect.

265
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,490
Please, I didn't kill anyone.
I'm an extreme pacifist.

266
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,129
That's an oxymoron.
You're either extreme or pacifist.

267
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,923
- You can't be both.
- You're working

268
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,739
as a tool of the poultry lobbyists.

269
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,707
Code Yellow! Code Yellow!

270
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,819
<i>They're with the
the chicken lobbyists!</i>

271
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,213
Joke's on you!

272
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,749
Here's your feathers!
Why don't you fly back to Washington?

273
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:09,053
Okay, you do know that
you're all under arrest, right?

274
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:10,553
What are you talking about?

275
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,856
<i>The stench of ammonia</i>

276
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,762
<i>and feces overwhelm you,
as 30,000 silent chickens</i>

277
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:24,342
<i>sit miserably in total darkness
waiting to die.</i>

278
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,900
<i>That's your voice narrating,
isn't it, Mr. Parsons?</i>

279
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,845
<i>Yes, I'm proud of my work.</i>

280
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,537
<i>The FBI believes that
you snuck onto the premises</i>

281
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,781
to record a second video.

282
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,499
You were caught by Nick Rabin

283
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,460
- and you killed him.
- It's what happened.

284
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,445
I don't think it
played out that way.

285
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,517
Dr. Sweets says you're the type of guy
who couldn't kill, except

286
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,926
- in self-defense.
- I never attacked anyone.

287
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,970
- 'Cause you tarred and feathered me.
<i>- It was corn syrup and paper feathers.</i>

288
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,249
I didn't sneak in
and take that video footage.

289
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:53,351
I got back to my bicycle one night
and there was an envelope in the spokes.

290
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm gonna need the name
of your chicken spy on the inside.

291
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:58,648
- No.
- And the original footage,

292
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,150
- not the stuff you cut together here.
- I will absolutely

293
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,528
<i>not turn over to you any information
which was entrusted to me</i>

294
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:08,672
by the courageous individual who risked
his or her job to aid innocent creatures

295
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,728
- who are unable to defend themselves.
- You don't hand over the original,

296
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:14,046
I'm gonna charge you
with assaulting a federal agent.

297
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,959
That's what? $200,000 fine
and one year in a federal prison?

298
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,803
You know, if you're locked up,
who's gonna speak for the chickens?

299
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,673
Just hold on.

300
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,557
That's the raw video footage.

301
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,687
- Exactly the way that I got it.
- See? It all worked out great.

302
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:42,857
Cause of death, Mr. Bray?

303
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,135
Most of the fractures
are postmortem.

304
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,441
The bone bruising,
probably from going over the dam

305
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,217
and getting stuck in the whirlpool.

306
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:51,777
Like going through
a giant washing machine.

307
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:57,243
But this damage to the cervical
vertebrae is not postmortem.

308
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,251
This is an undamaged
cervical section.

309
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:02,044
Here is our victim.

310
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,589
The C2 vertebra rotated laterally

311
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,493
while the ligaments and facets
of the transverse processes

312
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,926
were subluxed and locked.

313
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,059
A broken neck.

314
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,930
The fracture pattern
suggests a wrenching motion.

315
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,765
You mean wrung?

316
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:17,503
The chicken man

317
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:20,062
- was killed by having his neck wrung?
- Yeah.

318
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,355
Ironic, right?

319
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,899
We are gonna have to
catalog these injuries

320
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,776
chronologically.
Talk to Angela.

321
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,279
See if she has some kind of
imaging technique that can help.

322
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,670
Nearly ten billion chickens
are hatched in the U.S. annually.

323
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,614
- Most in places like this.
- It's like a warehouse.

324
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,085
Each chicken is given less
than a half a square foot of space.

325
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,103
And look at this part,
the little baby chicks

326
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,671
get their beaks cut off.

327
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,631
Why?

328
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,747
Supposedly to keep them
from fighting.

329
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,744
How do they fight
when they're penned up?

330
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,179
It's the stress
of being jammed together.

331
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,851
I guess they go crazy.

332
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:56,557
Are you upset?

333
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,107
Yeah, I am.

334
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:04,478
- Aren't you?
- I'm not certain how sentient

335
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,567
chickens actually are, Angela.

336
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,820
Yeah, but they can feel.
I mean, you can see that they can.

337
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,822
You know,
if it turns out that there was

338
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,409
some kind of chicken revolution
and they offed this guy, I am with them.

339
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,745
It's our job to figure out
who killed the human being.

340
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,787
Yeah, I guess.

341
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:22,997
Because it probably
wasn't a chicken revolution.

342
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,253
It was probably another human being.

343
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,398
Fine.

344
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,591
I was able to extract the metadata

345
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,718
that was embedded
in the original video file.

346
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,915
Time and date

347
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,098
that the video was taken and aperture,
make and model of the camera

348
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:40,184
- including the serial number.
- Could you trace the serial number?

349
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,438
The owner sent in
the manufacturer's warranty.

350
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,650
- Which included the serial number.
- Gaynor Rabin.

351
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,132
The victim's wife.

352
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:51,529
Thank you, Angela.

353
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,906
And I'm sorry the chickens
make you feel bad.

354
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,137
What about pigs?

355
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:02,809
Pigs are sentient.

356
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,362
That's a non-sequitur.

357
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:05,699
Pigs make bacon.

358
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,741
And not only are they sentient,
they're smarter than dogs.

359
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,923
Well, I don't eat bacon.
I'm a vegetarian.

360
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,467
Yeah, for health reasons.
Listen, Brennan.

361
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,741
I want to save this little piglet.

362
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,121
That particular, specific piglet?

363
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,178
Yes. It's gonna be $1,500.

364
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,812
- Are you in?
- No.

365
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,808
Yeah, but look at his face.

366
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,109
How can you resist this face?

367
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,280
Saving one pig or chicken
is symbolic at best, Angela.

368
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,241
This is not a symbol.
This is a face.

369
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:41,525
It worries me that you can
look into these eyes and be so cold.

370
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm sure he's a fine piglet, but...

371
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,639
How are we friends?

372
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,172
How is it possible?
I mean, we have nothing in common.

373
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,425
What, you don't wanna be friends
anymore because the pig is cute?

374
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,396
<i>What if the victim
used his wife's camera</i>

375
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,681
<i>to strike back at the company
that disfigured him?</i>

376
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,965
Maybe he was having an affair.

377
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,902
Or maybe she was just sick
of kissing a guy with a beak.

378
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,479
Today's special: Chicken.
Ironic.

379
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,159
Everything okay there, Bones?
I know when something is wrong with you.

380
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,582
Something's wrong, all right?
What can I do to help?

381
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,049
Angela and I had a fight.

382
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:28,910
Nothing I can do to help.

383
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,795
- You want to hear about it?
- No.

384
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,993
- Why not?
- Her and Angela are best friends.

385
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,423
And Bones is going to
want me to take her side

386
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,469
and agree that Angela was wrong.

387
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,555
Then the two of them are gonna make up
and then they're gonna be mad at me.

388
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,765
So, no, thank you.

389
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,433
That's very interesting.

390
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,801
You know, the way you
say "very interesting"

391
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,559
is very irritating.

392
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,691
Listen, Bones,
I would do anything for you.

393
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,054
I'd die for you,
I would kill for you,

394
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,871
but I am not getting
in between two best friends.

395
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,473
What were you saying, Sweets?

396
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,925
I've been considering
the symbolism of this murder.

397
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,535
Being tossed over a dam
isn't very chickeny.

398
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,751
You'd think that the
victim would show up

399
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,637
in a rotisserie or a deep fryer.

400
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:16,273
I remember a month ago,
a chicken restaurant chain

401
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:19,051
reported human phalanges
in some deep fried treats.

402
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,505
Kid bit into a thumb.
Right, the mom hit a toe.

403
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,264
It was... Bock Box Chicken Hut.

404
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,808
- Maybe the toe is our victim's.
- Totally poetic justice.

405
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,310
If you can get the body parts

406
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,356
from those chicken treats
to the Jeffersonian,

407
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,513
- we'll see if they match our victims.
- Okay.

408
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:36,652
I'm going back to the lab.
Send the fingers over when you get them.

409
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:39,500
Listen, Bones,
everything is gonna be okay

410
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,324
between you and Angela, all right?

411
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:42,908
You two are like sisters.

412
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:47,247
- I'm not used to not getting along.
- Seriously? 'Cause it seems like...

413
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:49,929
Thanks, Booth.

414
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:54,879
Just bring in the human
parts tomorrow, and I'll...

415
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,258
- I'll take a look.
- Okay.

416
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,579
If you combine your
"don't get between women" rule

417
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:07,702
and your "like sisters" observation,
you know what I come up with?

418
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,393
You dated sisters.

419
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:11,943
They were identical twins.

420
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:16,192
- Yeah, it was all wrong.
- No, it's all right. It's all right.

421
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,960
We should stop. Order your wings.

422
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,784
These have been frozen,

423
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,228
flash-fried, microwaved,

424
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,866
bitten, spat out, then
preserved as evidence.

425
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:32,087
Bone density would indicate
that all four digits

426
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:33,584
came from the same person.

427
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,061
They all came from the same local
chain of chicken restaurants.

428
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:39,006
- Bock Box.
- I beg your pardon?

429
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,226
Bock Box Chicken Huts.
Is Clucksten a supplier?

430
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,678
They're one of them.
No way of telling where these particular

431
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,136
human nuggets came from.

432
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,555
There's a lack of bruising on
the bone at the incision point.

433
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,103
Removed postmortem,
so not torture, obviously.

434
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,589
There are symmetrical slice marks.

435
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:58,235
Also, pinching
in the center of the bone and tissue.

436
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,610
Removed with shears?

437
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:03,072
You should do a DNA test,
of course, but I'm confident

438
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,515
that all four body's part
came from Nick Rabin.

439
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,758
Are you here because of your
argument with Dr. Brennan?

440
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,174
No, I'm here for a donation.

441
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,180
She told you about our fight?

442
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,964
Booth figured it out.
I was just sitting there.

443
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:32,524
A donation for what?

444
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:37,607
It's going to cost $1,500
to save this piglet.

445
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:41,652
- How much are you in for?
- Are those tears in your eyes?

446
00:22:42,814 --> 00:22:43,838
I'm just...

447
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,657
I can't stop thinking
about this little piglet.

448
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,258
I'm going to suggest
that perhaps it's time for you...

449
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,873
to abandon celibacy a little early.

450
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,348
- What does that have to do?
- You're forming inappropriately strong

451
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:59,670
attachments
to photographs of baby animals.

452
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,361
Your libido is being rerouted.

453
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:04,133
- You need to come back to the world.
- Wait a minute.

454
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,864
Inappropriate, my ass.

455
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:09,668
Can I ask you: what is wrong
with everyone here?

456
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:12,995
You had a falling out
with your best friend over a pig.

457
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:14,894
Your perspective is skewed.

458
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,312
It's time

459
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,315
to reconnect with humanity,
gain a little perspective.

460
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,568
All right, so...

461
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:26,150
if I have sex,
will you donate to save my pig?

462
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,992
That's not really the point
I was trying...

463
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,705
We'll revisit the pig question.

464
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,803
You can keep this.

465
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:38,698
I have multiples.

466
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:47,697
You think I killed my husband,

467
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,052
cut off his thumbs,

468
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,913
and then dumped him over
the Savage River Dam?

469
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:54,505
Thumbs and toes, yes.

470
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,142
Do you recognize this?

471
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:00,130
It's the video those PECT people
put on the Internet.

472
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,673
It was taken with your camera.

473
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:03,646
You're making that up.
You can't know that.

474
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,724
No, we can prove that.
Let's start this all over again.

475
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,074
Did you take this footage?

476
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:12,849
Yes, I took it.

477
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:14,961
- Did you give it to Josh Parsons?
- Yes.

478
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,391
- I wanted Clucksten's shut down.
- Why?

479
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,251
Your husband is next in line
to take over the business.

480
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,130
Because I was tired of getting
threatening phone calls.

481
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,858
I was tired of being hated
in my own town.

482
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:27,425
But most of all, Agent Booth,

483
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,103
I wanted my husband
to get his real face back,

484
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,367
so I gave the footage
to the activists.

485
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,228
How is it possible that your...

486
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,964
husband's thumbs
ended up on the menu?

487
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,769
Easy.

488
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,543
Toss them in with the nuggets

489
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:43,149
just before they're breaded,
fried, and frozen for shipment.

490
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:46,045
Are you suggesting that
the killer was working

491
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:47,889
in Clucksten Farms?

492
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,781
You realize Clucksten's
is doomed after this?

493
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,156
- Yeah.
- So you got exactly what you wanted.

494
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:55,661
No, Agent Booth, I did not.

495
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,143
What I wanted was my husband back.

496
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:00,829
I understand.

497
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:07,444
Is there anyone else who benefits
from Clucksten Farms going under?

498
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:12,762
Probably the anti-smell people,
the people who live downwind.

499
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,912
I need a name, that's all.

500
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:17,717
The main clean air nut
is Roy Meyers.

501
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,834
He's a baker with a shop
about two miles downwind of Clucksten's.

502
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,137
I got some more data
on the bone bruising.

503
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,904
So I need $1,500.

504
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:40,384
I need about $40,000
to repay student loans.

505
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,250
What do you need your money for?

506
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:45,734
I need to save...

507
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,004
this pig.

508
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,480
- From being made into bacon?
- Yeah.

509
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,884
I love bacon.

510
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:54,338
I love ribs.

511
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,758
I love steak.

512
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:57,802
I love meat.
I'm a meat eater.

513
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:00,434
I'm not apologetic about it.

514
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,751
Look at his face.

515
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:10,672
Look, Angela, I'm sorry.

516
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,782
Here's... 20...

517
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:16,830
25...

518
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,170
$45?

519
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:22,364
Take it all.

520
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,418
We'll save your pig.

521
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:55,929
- Roy Meyers?
- Yes?

522
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,847
FBI, Agent Booth.
This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

523
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:01,093
We understand that
you're trying to get the state

524
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,453
- to shut down Clucksten Farms?
- Sure.

525
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,709
Because nobody will come in
and make them regulate the stench.

526
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,287
- They were here first.
- Yeah, back when it was

527
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,506
a free-range chicken ranch.
It's a different beast now,

528
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,722
factory farm "Heartless",
reasonable people call it.

529
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:17,738
You'll excuse me.

530
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:20,637
I took this up as a way
of getting some fresh air,

531
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,490
as ironic as that sounds.

532
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,214
Considering your malodorous habit,

533
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,563
would you say that your dispute
with Clucksten Farms

534
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,523
is more financially motivated
than health-related?

535
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,360
Sure.
You know how a baker sells his wares?

536
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,260
People smell the bread from the outside,
go in, and spend the dough.

537
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:37,994
Thanks to Clucksten Farms,
to smell my cinnamon buns,

538
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,327
people got to jam their noses
right in the damn thing.

539
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,621
Clucksten Farms is trying
to put you out of business.

540
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,706
Can I take a look at that?

541
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,376
Yeah, me and anybody who
relies on a sense of smell,

542
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:51,317
- sense of taste.
- Will your thumb fit in this hole?

543
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:54,131
Don't be sticking that on my thumb.
It's like a mini-guillotine.

544
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,617
You want to be careful with that.
It's sharp as razors.

545
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,064
That'll nip your
thumb off in a jiffy.

546
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,697
What,

547
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:07,186
some kind of federal crime
to own a cigar clipper?

548
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,203
The human eye
can only perceive color

549
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:20,151
between wavelengths
of 400 and 750 nanometers.

550
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:22,613
This full-spectrum light source
simulates both

551
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:24,412
the visible and UV spectrum.

552
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,038
Angela is brilliant.

553
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,745
So we run the image
through the spectroscope

554
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:34,292
and now we can detect color differences
that are not visible to the human eye.

555
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:36,856
I was able to confirm
these as postmortem bruises

556
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,337
likely caused by rocks and debris
from the victim traveling downriver.

557
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:42,849
Then we assigned
all postmortem bruising

558
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:45,348
with one distinct color
and perimortem with another.

559
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,361
Now, injuries sustained
before death will appear red

560
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,093
and after death, black.

561
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,475
- Saves me hours and hours of work.
- This is what happens when two people

562
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,487
from different disciplines find
each other and work together closely.

563
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:06,154
Can you highlight
the perimortem bruising?

564
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:13,793
Evenly-spaced circular impact bruises to
the right temporal and sphenoid region,

565
00:29:13,963 --> 00:29:16,425
continuing here along
the frontal and parietal bones.

566
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:19,865
All of them...
have identical directionality.

567
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,277
- What would leave marks like that?
- Some kind of machine.

568
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:25,288
And why do they stop there?

569
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,411
Something stopped the weapon

570
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:29,810
from striking down
to the skull in this area.

571
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,358
The microscopic metal deposits
on the clipped thumb bone

572
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,230
don't match
the baker's cigar cutter,

573
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:35,858
but fortunately

574
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,251
I'm extremely
thorough and tenacious.

575
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:42,030
There's evidence of streaming
nuclei in the bone cells.

576
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,382
- That was my job to find.
- It's okay, kid.

577
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:46,744
Around here we step in
for each other as needed.

578
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,024
What?

579
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,040
- You mean work.
- What did you mean?

580
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,439
I'm agreeing. It's work.
Can we move on?

581
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,968
- We have electricity?
- Who does?

582
00:29:58,093 --> 00:30:00,257
The streaming nuclei
suggests voltage.

583
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:01,717
I know.

584
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,231
A self-cauterizing blade.

585
00:30:03,356 --> 00:30:06,174
There's got to be something like that
in a place that kills thousands

586
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,662
of chickens every day.
Here we go.

587
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,434
This might narrow things down.

588
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:13,015
He had beak
and feather disease virus.

589
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,092
He had beak and feather
disease in his thumb?

590
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,691
I'm going to go out on a limb here

591
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,801
and guess that maybe
what we're looking for

592
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:20,635
is a self-cauterizing instrument

593
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,657
that cuts beaks and feathers.

594
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,908
Wait a minute.
The video.

595
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,253
<i>Pluckers beat the
feathers off dead chickens</i>

596
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:32,232
<i>and beak clippers clip the beaks
off of baby chicks.</i>

597
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:36,241
That's you, right, Ms. McNamara?

598
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,106
Your occupation is beak clipper?

599
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:44,135
Baby chicks are jammed
so close together, they get stressed,

600
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:47,071
attack each other. It's my job
to cut the tips off their beaks.

601
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:50,592
- Really isn't a good job to have.
- I got demoted from plucker.

602
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:53,014
Bet you didn't know
there was something worse.

603
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:55,773
When you were demoted,
was that before or after you charged

604
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,407
- Nick Rabin with sexual harassment?
- After.

605
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,360
Go figure. Nick was a groper.
Never heard the guy coming.

606
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,933
It got old real fast.

607
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:06,912
How much training does it take
to run the beak-clipping machine?

608
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:08,944
None. Just got to be
the kind of person

609
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,356
willing to cut the beaks
off of newborn chicks.

610
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,579
Why?

611
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,500
Because your machine was used to
remove Nick's thumbs and big toes.

612
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,752
If I was gonna cut something off of
Nick Rabin, it would not be his thumb.

613
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:24,573
What people usually do right now
is they insist

614
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:26,989
- that they didn't kill anyone.
- Maybe I fantasized

615
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,347
about it,
it's like I actually did it.

616
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:31,534
Do you know anything
about Rabin's death

617
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,894
or the mutilation of his body?

618
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,802
But still, if you could arrange it,

619
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:40,771
I wouldn't mind getting away
from Clucksten's

620
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,818
and spending a few days in jail.

621
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:50,249
I don't need a professional
consultation, Sweets.

622
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:52,916
This is not that. It's
just a friendly conversation.

623
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:55,867
- Angela will come around.
- I'm certain that she will.

624
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:59,590
Eventually Angela will see
the rational nature of my argument.

625
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:03,253
- She will come around.
- I already said that.

626
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,593
Crazy thought-

627
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:08,398
what if, this time, you were
the one who came around?

628
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:11,709
Saving one pig is an irrational act.

629
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,947
Are you suggesting that I point
that out to Angela more clearly?

630
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:16,932
Because that would
make this conversation

631
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:19,285
very much like
a professional consultation.

632
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,794
No, I'm suggesting,

633
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:23,481
in a very friendly,
conversational way,

634
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,544
that you help her save that one pig.

635
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:27,426
We agreed that
that's a meaningless act.

636
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:30,310
Meaningless by your
definition, not by Angela's.

637
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:33,202
- My definition is correct.
- And if life were

638
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:36,746
simply a debate,
you would win, hands down,

639
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,429
but we know that it isn't a debate.

640
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:41,876
It's something much tougher.

641
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:45,587
Our very work shows us that,

642
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:47,163
that those people

643
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,431
that call the world an abattoir
a slaughterhouse

644
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:52,221
they have a point.

645
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:56,975
Now, you handle that knowledge
by imposing this...

646
00:32:57,251 --> 00:33:00,078
gossamer web of rationality

647
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,465
over the ugliness.

648
00:33:06,044 --> 00:33:08,154
Angela has a very different way
of handling.

649
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:13,873
Sometimes you don't save
the world, Dr. Brennan.

650
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:21,239
Sometimes you just make
your friend happy.

651
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,837
But even when it's irrational?

652
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,942
He is

653
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,313
very, very cute.

654
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:37,409
I mean,

655
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:40,061
it's almost like he's smiling.

656
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:48,960
Wendell and I have been testing
chicken factory implements

657
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:52,322
to find something that would leave
the symmetrical marks on the victim.

658
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,867
- Searching for the murder weapon.
- Did you find it yet?

659
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,786
No, but we have the parameters.

660
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,843
Please assume the position.

661
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,099
The skull was struck repeatedly.

662
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:04,877
We need someone to actually
spin Wendell on the stool.

663
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,868
I don't twirl the interns.

664
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,005
Perhaps Angela would do it.

665
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,658
I'll... I'll do it.

666
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:13,970
Now,

667
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:17,533
it appears as if
the victim was turning,

668
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,344
and/or rolling.

669
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:20,935
Someone rolled him?

670
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,687
- That's how it appears.
- The directionality indicates that.

671
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,190
Can Istop turning
while you discuss this?

672
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,270
Not yet.
What we haven't determined

673
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,954
is what he was rolled on
that would've done this.

674
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,961
What if... what if the
victim wasn't spinning?

675
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,492
What if the weapon was spinning?

676
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,137
Oh, thank you, God.

677
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:41,352
The bruises had
common directionality.

678
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:44,187
It's likely the victim
was face down at an angle.

679
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:45,728
If...

680
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:49,188
the implement striking the
victim's head

681
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,623
was spinning...

682
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:59,988
I know which piece of
equipment caused these bone bruises

683
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,685
and run the victim's neck
in the same time.

684
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,015
There I go.

685
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,101
Look at that,.

686
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:15,804
Bones, look at this.

687
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,583
We served a warrant
for your chicken plucker.

688
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,122
We've got blood.

689
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:24,539
From the chickens?

690
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,709
They are drained
by the time they get here.

691
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:29,113
There'd barely be any blood left.

692
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:35,642
What's that?

693
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,303
If my theory is correct,

694
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,680
it'll turn out to be a fragment
of the victim's necktie.

695
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,266
I need your tie to test the theory.

696
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,875
The one I'm wearing now?

697
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,071
This tie?

698
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:48,940
I'm not certain the
tie will be ruined.

699
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,522
We will reimburse you if it is.

700
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:54,236
- Just a tie.
- The murderer and victim struggle,

701
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:57,782
the victim's tie enters
the chicken plucker...

702
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:01,994
That amount of force would definitely
have wrung the victim's neck.

703
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:04,854
What? My reasoning is flawless.

704
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:06,349
Shut that off, will you?

705
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,042
Your theory suggests
that it was an accident.

706
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:10,842
- I disagree.
- They fight.

707
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:14,674
- The tie gets caught inadvertently.
- No, this pattern has a missing

708
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,305
component. Here.

709
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:19,476
It suggests that something
blocked the strike.

710
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,305
Obviously, the murderer's hand.

711
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,516
Like this.
See?

712
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:26,060
We should see if any employee

713
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,980
of Clucksten Farms was treated
for a broken hand.

714
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,568
These fractures to your second and
third metacarpals

715
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,752
in your left hand...
they were caused by being struck.

716
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:40,755
- That had to smart.
- How do you have my X-rays?

717
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,412
See, a judge decided that we
had reasonable cause for a warrant.

718
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:47,440
Why is it that the
head of security reaches

719
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,876
into a moving chicken plucker?

720
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:58,301
Eight years I worked at
that hellhole. You know why?

721
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:04,640
Your wife?

722
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,543
We were going to have kids.

723
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,311
Only, she got sick,

724
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,438
because she worked at Clucksten's.

725
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,946
- Did you have evidence of that?
- That's exactly what Nick asked.

726
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,153
But we moved to the next
county and she got better.

727
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,697
That's evidence enough,
if you ask me.

728
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:24,285
All I wanted from Nick
was a gas allowance.

729
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:25,911
He said no?

730
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,080
We shoved each other a bit, I guess.

731
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,720
His tie got stuck in
the chicken plucker,

732
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:33,672
and I reached in.
I tried to save him.

733
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,629
And that's how my hand got broke.

734
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:38,233
But you didn't intend to kill him.

735
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:39,885
God, no.

736
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,887
Right, I understand.

737
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,934
I know you trust your gut,
but it's wrong this time.

738
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:53,101
The directionality of
these fractures shows

739
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:57,027
that your hand was on Nick Rabin's
face as it went into the machine.

740
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,260
You pushed him.
You killed him.

741
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,084
I drive 68 miles to work every day.

742
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,956
And all I wanted was
a gas allowance.

743
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,327
I work there eight years,
just a gas allowance

744
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,099
so my wife

745
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,071
can stay healthy.

746
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,800
Would I like one of those
fruity drinks?

747
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,098
You know, he fooled me,
he fooled me.

748
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,012
I mean, I actually

749
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:14,270
believed he was trying
to save the victim.

750
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:17,273
He's a very good liar.

751
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:20,133
Now, I could tell
when people are lying.

752
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,965
I mean, I-I could tell
before my whole...

753
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,294
recto-cerebral infracture.

754
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,533
What?
That's not a real medical

755
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:30,477
- condition.
- Are you sure?

756
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,446
Because that's what I'm
feeling right now.

757
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,974
If it were real,
it'd be pretty disgusting.

758
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,456
- Recto-cerebral...
- I know, I'm losing it.

759
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:42,501
Look, I just...
I'm not up to speed here.

760
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:46,050
I woke up this morning and I
realized that I didn't even know

761
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,343
if I like brown sugar on my oatmeal.

762
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:49,787
Next time call me.

763
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,386
You like brown sugar on everything.

764
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:55,962
I'm the one who is supposed to
know when people are lying.

765
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,858
Who do I call up for that?

766
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:06,295
You said he's like a human
lie detector test.

767
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,137
I don't like things at half speed, okay?
I'm a full speed kind of a guy.

768
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,076
Well, even at half speed, you're
twice as fast as anyone else.

769
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:19,139
You want to see the fastest draw
in the west?

770
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:20,920
- Sure.
- You want to see it again?

771
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,514
Sweets thinks that I
should humor Angela.

772
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:34,642
Sweets is a bright kid.

773
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,286
But I want to know what you think.

774
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,791
As a full-grown

775
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:42,817
man of experience.

776
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,931
I need to know what you think.

777
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:53,828
I think you should let her
have this one.

778
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:57,514
What are you doing?

779
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,851
No, wait. Now? No, I
didn't mean this second.

780
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:04,370
Excuse me.

781
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:09,113
I want to help you...

782
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:16,203
Thank you.

783
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,773
It's everything.
You got it. That's great.

784
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,880
- Angela's very happy.
- I can see that.

785
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,863
You said that in a funny way.

786
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:43,289
You noticed something.

787
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:45,463
See?

788
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,265
You still got it...

789
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:53,854
You're not going to ask me
what I saw?

790
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:56,891
Do I want to know?

791
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,251
Do you want to know, anyway?

792
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,778
It can wait.

793
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:12,094
I trust you.

794
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,563
