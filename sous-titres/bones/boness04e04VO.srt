1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:04,424
You know what the most
beautiful thing in the world is?

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:05,947
Mom says a sunset.

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,762
Okay, well, one of the most
beautiful man-made things.

4
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,123
Mom says the Mona Lisa.

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,517
Look,
all due respect to your mom, buddy, but

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,346
a perfectly thrown spiral
is way better than any of that stuff,

7
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,188
OK, so let me show you to do this.

8
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,065
Put your hand up here like that,

9
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:21,948
spread your fingers wide.

10
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:24,177
- My hand's too small.
- It'll grow, all right?

11
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:27,197
Okay, hand there to steady the ball.
Lift it up to your ear.

12
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,886
No, your ear, not your chin, silly.
All right...

13
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,819
- What's it saying?
- It's saying,

14
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,078
"Throw your old man a deep pass
for a touchdown," hey!

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,748
What? What you got?

16
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:40,947
There's a bird's nest.

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,483
- Where?
- There.

18
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:43,414
Cool?

19
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:46,173
You want me to lift you up
so you can see inside?

20
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,187
- How about I knock it down with...
- No, no,

21
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,041
Don't do that,
you don't want to do that.

22
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,724
That's somebody's home, OK, buddy?

23
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,459
Something could be alive in there, OK?

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,378
You want me to boost you up
so you can see?

25
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:56,520
- Sure.
- Ready?

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,149
- Yeah.
- One, two, three, and up.

27
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,822
- What do you see?
- Higher.

28
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,636
- Okay.
- I see something.

29
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:04,447
If it's an egg, don't touch it,
because if the mommy bird comes back...

30
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:06,447
- It's not an egg.
- What is it?

31
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,884
It's somebody's finger.

32
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,496
He pulled the finger
out of a bird's nest.

33
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,119
Did he completely freak out?

34
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,050
Booth said Parker wanted to put it
in his pocket and take it home.

35
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,679
When it comes to boys, that "snips and
snails and puppy dogs' tails"

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,134
thing is pretty accurate.

37
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,799
- You have a son?
- I have four.

38
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,218
Mr. Starret is my oldest grad student.

39
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:32,846
- Can you get a fingerprint?
- Not enough flesh.

40
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,668
There are scrapes on the bone and

41
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:36,681
a jagged appearance here
where it was severed.

42
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,777
It was probably
chewed off by a wild animal.

43
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,448
The sticky stuff on the finger

44
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:43,857
turns out to be sap from
a flowering Japanese cherry.

45
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,165
I know you from somewhere.

46
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:54,242
Right. I sold you a vintage
'50s hot rod back in the mid-'90s.

47
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:55,874
You were clean, shaven back then.

48
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,328
Because I was a kid.

49
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,080
But you drove a hot rod, Hodgins?

50
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,677
No, I did not.

51
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:03,476
The lemon he sold me
broke down after a week.

52
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,837
Body parts in park,
mystery needs solving.

53
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:11,776
The nest was made by Corvus
brachyrhynchos the American Crow.

54
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:14,846
A crow will seldom stray
more than 12 miles from its nest.

55
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:18,224
There's a spectacular copse
of Japanese flowering cherry

56
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:19,685
at the Jefferson Memorial.

57
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,353
- How do you know?
- Career number two: parks supervisor.

58
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:25,815
The Jefferson Memorial is eight miles
from where Parker found the finger.

59
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,150
Good work, guys.

60
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,611
I'd say "King of the lab," but...

61
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,404
That just depresses me.

62
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:34,790
Don't ask.

63
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:38,606
- A human finger?
- Yes, a human finger, all right?

64
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:42,040
Look, is my son gonna be suffering from
some kind of post-traumatic stress,

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,659
you know, like suppressed feelings,
memories, all that hooey?

66
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:47,587
Well, a child's brain
can't process death as an end.

67
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,404
You know, that's why we tell
children that their deceased

68
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,446
loved ones are looking down
on us from heaven.

69
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,871
- Which they are.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,846
It's an excellent coping technique.
You know, Grandma isn't worm food,

71
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,018
she's simply moved on to a better place.

72
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,645
- Which she did.
- Yeah. Parker looks good to me.

73
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,977
So. You talk to him?

74
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,771
"Hi, Parker. I'm Dr. Sweets,

75
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,940
"I'm a psychologist,
I'm here to talk to you

76
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,581
about the finger that you found."

77
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,184
- Great. Could you do that?
- No,

78
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,737
That could introduce issues
that don't currently exist.

79
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:15,213
Just call me if he displays
any symptoms of distress.

80
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,774
Okay. Any symptoms of distress.

81
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:18,618
Like?

82
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,078
Killing cats?

83
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,120
Yeah. Sure.

84
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:30,839
When I was five years old, I went next
door to visit our neighbor, Mrs. Walkey,

85
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,004
and she was dead,
sitting at the kitchen table.

86
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:36,678
- And I'm all right.
- You spend your life with skeletons.

87
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:39,770
It's just a matter of time.
He's just a kid.

88
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,784
He's gonna realize he had a dead finger
in his hand, he's gonna freak out.

89
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,932
You afraid you're gonna
get in trouble with Rebecca?

90
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,179
There's a chance that
he might not say anything to her.

91
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,777
- So, yes.
- Agent Booth?

92
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:50,441
- Yeah.
- We found something.

93
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,529
Okay. What have you got?

94
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,157
Oh, it's an opossum.

95
00:03:58,317 --> 00:03:59,378
Eating a body.

96
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,950
- Should I shoot it?
- No. No, no, no.

97
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,051
Opossums are scared of humans.

98
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,957
Here. Shoo, shoo, shoo!

99
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,750
Shoo, shoo! Go, go, go, go!

100
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,163
Go, go, go. Shoo, shoo.
Come on. Shoo, shoo.

101
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,963
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

102
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:13,339
Yeah. They're terrified.

103
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,599
A number of body parts are missing.
We'll have to grid the vicinity.

104
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,697
Okay, we'll re-calibrate the search,
and will call this ground zero.

105
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,219
Fanny pack. PDA clip.

106
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:26,187
Well, if you can identify this person,
I can subpoena the PDA's contents.

107
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,736
Partial skull.

108
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:30,011
Look at that. The possum's dead.

109
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:31,274
I got it.

110
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:34,125
The victim was poisoned.
The possum ate the victim,

111
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,571
got poisoned and died.
That's it.

112
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,924
A stressed-out opossum
can go into a false sleep,

113
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:41,993
lasting up to four hours.

114
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,506
The possum was faking it?

115
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,831
Yeah. There it goes.

116
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,587
- You should go get him.
- What do I look like, Ranger Rick?

117
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:55,003
He could have evidence
in his digestive tract.

118
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:56,825
- Come on, Bones.
- Booth, evidence.

119
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:59,187
- Fine, I'll go get your possum.
- Opossum.

120
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,137
- Possum.
- Opossum.

121
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:06,351
Bones - Season 04 Episode 04
"The Finger in the Nest"

122
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:10,897
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Icefreak

123
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:31,125
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

124
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:37,822
The sternal rib end indicates the victim
was between 35 and 40 years old.

125
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:41,997
Length of the long bones
suggests he was between

126
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,119
- Five foot-eight and five-ten.
- He?

127
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,230
Bone density and skull indicators
suggest male.

128
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,329
Time of death...
Approximately four days ago.

129
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,983
Lividity indicates that he died
somewhere else and was then dumped.

130
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,944
Deep puncture wounds
to the trachea pierced the jugular.

131
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,626
He bled to death.

132
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:02,782
I'll make an impression of the wound,
see if we can't specify a murder weapon.

133
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,315
First we look for particulates.

134
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,204
Bull penis.

135
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,611
Beg your pardon?

136
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:14,828
The fanny pack had dandruff-sized
flakes of bull penis in it.

137
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,346
Why are you spying on me?

138
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,135
Could it be because I'm the dupe

139
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,610
of an organ of the shadowy forces
that secretly run this country?

140
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,824
You got the dupe part right.

141
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,212
Freeze-dried

142
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,227
bovine phallus.

143
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,648
You know where to find me
if you wish to discuss anything.

144
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,818
Yeah... The problem
isn't finding you, it's avoiding you.

145
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,411
Okay.

146
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,635
The skull was badly mangled,

147
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,113
so I was only able
to construct a partial, but

148
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,702
I cross-checked physiological markers
against the missing persons database,

149
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:56,216
and it yielded three possibilities.

150
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,286
Robert Sanchez, 24...

151
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:01,360
Too young.

152
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:05,641
Michael Minden, former
basketball coach, thirty-nine.

153
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:06,670
Too tall.

154
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,423
That leaves Dr. Seth Elliot,
veterinarian, 37.

155
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:14,437
- Any objections to Dr. Elliot?
- He falls into the parameters.

156
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:18,483
Plus, Dog-trainers use freeze-dried
bull penises as rewards.

157
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:19,857
He was a veterinarian.

158
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:21,944
How do you know the bull penis stuff?

159
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,931
He's middle-aged and
he's held every possible job.

160
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:30,036
Four boys, seven dogs, 14 guinea pigs,
one reticulated python...

161
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:31,833
You get the point.

162
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,457
I got it.

163
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,163
Oh, God.

164
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,920
I've always hated that fanny pack.

165
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:41,547
That's blood on it, isn't it?
What happened?

166
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,921
Mrs. Elliot, when did you last speak
with your husband?

167
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,048
Ex-husband.

168
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,506
On Thursday,

169
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,723
we made arrangements
for Seth to pick up Brando.

170
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,473
We have joint custody.

171
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,051
And Brando is...?

172
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:56,896
- Your cat.
- That's a dog, Booth.

173
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,083
I... Thank you.

174
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,034
So...

175
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:01,767
- Seth Elliot never picked up Fido?
- Brando.

176
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:02,880
The dog?

177
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,678
Seth's dead, isn't he?

178
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:07,824
I'm afraid so.

179
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,166
May I hold your dog while you cry?

180
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:24,169
He's so compact.

181
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,468
Brando adored Seth.

182
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,648
So did I.

183
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:33,516
Wow, not so many ex-wives speak
so fondly of their former husbands.

184
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,602
I never wanted to divorce Seth.

185
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:37,931
Then why did you?

186
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,861
You know,
Seth had a serious gambling problem.

187
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,559
He would either lose our car payment,

188
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,112
or he would come home
with diamond earrings

189
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,303
And when he lost our house,

190
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,993
filing for divorce was supposed
to be a wake-up call.

191
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,540
And he never woke up.

192
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,395
No.

193
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,165
Listen, do you have the, bookie's name?

194
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:58,217
No.

195
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,851
Ask Karen.

196
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:02,503
- Who's Karen?
- Who's Karen?

197
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:04,833
I've been Dr. Elliot's assistant,

198
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,312
receptionist, whatever, for,

199
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,407
like, eight months.

200
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:11,509
Murder?

201
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,393
His remains were found
in the Jefferson Memorial Park.

202
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,434
Oh, my God. Poor Seth.

203
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,821
I don't know what'll happen
to this place now.

204
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,038
Was it doing well?

205
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,776
We made barely enough to pay the rent,
cover his salary, mine and...

206
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,193
and the kid who sweeps up.

207
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,614
So, no. Not very well.

208
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,341
Seth didn't tell me everything, but

209
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,860
I could sense
he was under a lot of pressure.

210
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,821
He tossed and turned all night.

211
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,598
So you slept together?

212
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:39,017
He's divorced. I'm single.

213
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,268
There's nothing enervating about it.

214
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:44,324
Oh, for future reference,
that word doesn't mean what you think.

215
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:47,452
Look, are you aware that Dr. Elliot
had a gambling problem?

216
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:49,383
That was Seth's one fault.

217
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,878
We'd like to talk to his bookie,
if you know where he is.

218
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,596
I don't think that's how Seth gambled.

219
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:56,682
- How did he gamble?
- Online poker. Mostly.

220
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:58,474
Can you think of anything else?

221
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:02,306
Just after I started here,
Seth caught a guy stealing drugs.

222
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:05,043
He wrestled him to the ground,
called the cops.

223
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,109
Everyone said Seth was a hero.

224
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,070
- What kind of drugs?
- Ketamine.

225
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,239
It's an animal tranquilizer.

226
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,032
And the guy went to prison.

227
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,117
Do you think he killed
Seth for revenge?

228
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,631
You know, thank you for your help.
We're sorry for your loss.

229
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,792
Come on, Bones.

230
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:20,623
Without Seth, I'm paralyzed.

231
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,917
I don't know how
I'll find the energy to go on.

232
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,971
Now that is what "enervating" means.

233
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,430
- Bones.
- What?

234
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,758
Okay, Tucker Payne.

235
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:34,395
He was found guilty of stealing drugs
from Dr. Elliot's vet clinic,

236
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:38,282
sentenced to two years and
he was paroled one month ago.

237
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,561
I'll have the drug thief's parole
officer bring him in for questioning.

238
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:43,771
- Brennan.
- Dr. Brennan,

239
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,243
Hodgins found saliva.

240
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,819
- Where?
- On the victim.

241
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,882
But why was Hodgins looking for saliva?

242
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:51,153
I wasn't looking for saliva. I found it.

243
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:52,405
Giant difference.

244
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,448
Oh! Easy, pal. Watch your tone.

245
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,701
I don't care about tone,
I just care about results.

246
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,122
Dr. Hodgins was looking for particulates
on the mandible and vertebrae

247
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:03,520
that might lead to a murder weapon
when he found saliva.

248
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,752
There was enough saliva
in the wounds to run a DNA profile.

249
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,325
It had to be the possum, right?

250
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,711
The puncture wounds indicate
something larger.

251
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,259
- Hey, who's that?
- A fraudulent used car salesman.

252
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,052
Booth, meet Mr. Starret.

253
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,264
I ran the standard eight nuclear
markers for canids...

254
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,261
What is that,
like some kind of a bug?

255
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,260
- Not a bug, Agent Booth.
- Canis lupus familiaris.

256
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:27,106
See how annoying that interrupting know
it all used-car salesman thing can be?

257
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,665
I mean, I'm sorry, what is a can-ass...

258
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,583
Familiar-ass...?

259
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,030
Domestic dog.

260
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,223
Seth Elliot was killed
by a dog with filed teeth.

261
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,415
Tucker Felix Payne.

262
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,130
You really must hate
your parents for naming you that.

263
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,336
It's a good name.

264
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:49,842
Felix means "lucky."

265
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,756
Assault, possession
of various restricted weapons,

266
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:54,992
various drug offenses.

267
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,469
You don't seem so lucky.

268
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,679
You should see the stuff
they didn't get me on.

269
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,451
Was it good luck that
you got taken down by a veterinarian?

270
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,851
I was so high
I could've been taken down by a florist.

271
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:05,144
Yeah. The vet is dead.

272
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,508
You get paroled, vet turns up murdered.

273
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,377
You see where I'm going with this?

274
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,227
Make your dog bark?

275
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,947
You told me to bring Schatzi
so you could hear him bark?

276
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:17,990
Schatzi?

277
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,756
It means "treasure" in German.

278
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:22,078
Yeah, I want to hear Schatzi bark.

279
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,171
Gib Laut!

280
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:28,083
I can't see its teeth.

281
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,111
Want to show me his teeth?

282
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,515
Why do you file
its teeth down to points?

283
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,853
I'm a drug dealer.

284
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:46,519
You people catch me with a gun,
I go away forever.

285
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,701
- Schatzi your choice of weapon?
- Never had to use him yet.

286
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,692
- Were you really going to shoot my dog?
- I got nothing against your dog.

287
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,070
I was going to shoot you.

288
00:12:57,898 --> 00:13:00,157
See, I'm going to take your dog.

289
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,829
Man, you got a warrant for my dog?

290
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:06,359
That's cold.

291
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,626
Per your instructions,
I Microsiled the lethal bite mark.

292
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:13,281
- See here?
- An irregularity in the wound track.

293
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,631
Yes. I took an impression
of Schatzi's bite.

294
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,923
Who's Schatzi?

295
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:18,968
Drug dealer's dog.

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,043
Sei jetzt sch n brav!

297
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:23,931
He responds to German commands.

298
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:25,599
Very intimidating.

299
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,769
The dog that killed Dr. Elliot
has a pronounced crack

300
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,398
in its canine tooth, and the neighboring
bicuspid shows a slab fracture.

301
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,192
- Very distinct.
- So Schatzi's not our killer?

302
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:36,777
Schatzi is innocent.

303
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:41,323
Hey, Hodgins.

304
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:43,137
City police found the vet's car.

305
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,035
A forensics crew
is going through it now.

306
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,737
Booth wanted me to make sure
they didn't screw things up.

307
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,785
Hey, deal with it.

308
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,802
I hope you find something
'cause this puppy's innocent.

309
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:55,921
Yeah, well,
we're finding gobs of dried blood.

310
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,257
It's a vet's vehicle,
could be from one of his patients.

311
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,342
- It's not.
- Don't listen to him.

312
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,888
You'll end up buying this blood
soaked heap for three times its value.

313
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,641
I worked as a vet's assistant in college
when I was studying to be an EMT.

314
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,561
We were as careful with
blood as any human doctor.

315
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,423
You ever think this vet

316
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:15,188
didn't live up to your high standards?

317
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:18,110
Most likely, the car was used
to transport the victim's body,

318
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,279
- and then dumped.
- That does make more sense.

319
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,707
I found a...

320
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:26,369
Excuse me. The crack FBI team

321
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,705
found a prescription bottle
of erythromycin.

322
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,409
That's not an animal drug.
That's a macrolide antibiotic

323
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,670
used for a number of conditions.

324
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,921
Including acne and STDs.

325
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:39,089
Four boys.

326
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,909
Maybe we got lucky, and
the bad guy dropped his prescription.

327
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,150
Bottle reads "Donald Timmons."

328
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,708
We should track him down.

329
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,443
That is an absolutely wonderful idea.

330
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:51,018
That could only have sprung from
the time-tempered mind of a man

331
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,772
with your life's experience ripping off
unsuspecting car enthusiasts.

332
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:55,895
I feel better.

333
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:58,123
You treat everyone like crap.

334
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,024
Look at that pit?

335
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,791
Muscles like cantaloupes.

336
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,399
Is that why we're not getting out?

337
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,339
No, it's the country, Bones. They got
a different way of doing things.

338
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,067
- You're afraid of the dog.
- No, I'm not.

339
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,137
What you do in the country
is you sit in your car and you wait.

340
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,056
It's rural-polite.

341
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,976
- Parker had a nightmare.
- About severed fingers?

342
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,727
No. It was a singing frog.

343
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:38,240
I don't see the connection, but
then I'm one of those people who thinks

344
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,427
if you dream about a bana,
it's probably just a bana.

345
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,694
He's acting up in school,
he's talking back to his mom,

346
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:44,655
- he's not flushing the toilet.
- He's a boy.

347
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,241
Okay. Yeah. I get it.
You saw a whole lady's corpse

348
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,515
when you were a little girl,
and you were fine.

349
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,604
Yes. Although, for some reason
that I do not understand,

350
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:54,748
I kept staging my own death.

351
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:58,502
Pretending that I drowned in
the bathtub, faking electrical shock.

352
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,954
It really freaked my parents out.
And then, once, when Russ

353
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,491
found me hanging, he had to go
see the school psychologist.

354
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,092
But otherwise you were fine?

355
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,051
Yeah.

356
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:08,304
Yeah. Okay. Do you dream
about banas a lot?

357
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:11,140
Why?

358
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:14,710
Can we get out of the car now?

359
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,230
Quiet. Don Timmons?

360
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,599
Why you just waiting in the car?
Gladys wouldn't hurt you.

361
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:23,384
FBI Special Agent Booth.
This here is my associate, Dr. Brennan.

362
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,646
- Do you know Dr. Seth Elliot?
- Sure, I do.

363
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,656
Went to high school with him.
He's my vet. Why?

364
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:28,921
He was murdered.

365
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,032
Oh, man.

366
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,791
Hey, Robbie. Hey, Robbie!

367
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,317
What's up?

368
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:37,664
Seth died.

369
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,045
- What happened?
- This is the FBI.

370
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,213
They say he got murdered.
This is my boy Robbie.

371
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:44,921
He used to work for Seth part-time.

372
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,135
Can you think of a reason why
Dr. Elliot's car would be full of blood?

373
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,938
No. No. It's not like he ran an animal
ambulance or something.

374
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:53,781
You ever ride in his car, Mr. Timmons?

375
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,933
No. Never. Why?

376
00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:00,824
When it's bagged like that,
it means it's evidence, Dad.

377
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,733
It's not his. It's mine.

378
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,523
Dad, it's a murder investigation.

379
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,167
They don't care about insurance.

380
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm too old to be on my dad's insurance.

381
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,449
He got the prescription under your name?

382
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,659
But that's fraud.

383
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,490
That's working around a system
that doesn't care about people like us.

384
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,206
Listen, I'm the father.
Robbie shouldn't be held responsible.

385
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,760
How about you?
You been in Dr. Elliot's car recently?

386
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,585
Last... last time was on the weekend.

387
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:23,961
We did a gelding over
at Danny Oliver's place.

388
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,798
What about Tuesday night?
Where were you?

389
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,257
I was at my tutor's.

390
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,801
I'm trying to get my GED.

391
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,323
Hi.

392
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:34,228
Robbie's going to go to medical
school if it kills both of us.

393
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:35,974
I was kind of thinking I'd be a vet.

394
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,665
Yeah. Well, that's a good backup
if you crap out on medical school.

395
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,237
We're going to need the tutor's name,
address, all that stuff.

396
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:43,213
It's Andrew Hopp.
He'll vouch for Robbie.

397
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,209
Gladys is a very nice animal.

398
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,152
Yeah. Dad really trained her great.

399
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:48,806
Gladys, come.

400
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:50,383
Sit.

401
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,508
Lay down.

402
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:53,879
What?

403
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,799
That's impressive.

404
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,404
No sense in owning a dog
if you can't control it.

405
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,253
- Gladys' teeth are not filed.
- What?

406
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,578
Dr. Elliot was killed by a dog
with sharpened teeth.

407
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,876
Bones, what are you doing?
Enough playing with the dog.

408
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:09,797
What?

409
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,844
Seth was murdered by a dog?

410
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:15,768
The murder was a human being.
The murder weapon was a dog.

411
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,652
Back to this, are we ?

412
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,404
You staring at me?

413
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:32,628
Well, I have concerns, Dr. Hodgins.

414
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:33,605
About me?

415
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:35,755
Yeah, you seem to

416
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,096
have completely abandoned
your paranoid conspiracy theories.

417
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,248
I'm not a trained psychologist,

418
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,531
like you,
but that sounds like a good thing.

419
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,886
Dr. Saroyan, I've found something
important I need to show you.

420
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,451
Conspiracy was the

421
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:54,308
central idea around which
you organized your sense of self.

422
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:57,436
Also, I can't help but note that
you're not paying quite so much

423
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,346
attention to your personal appearance.

424
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,229
Less paranoid and less vain.

425
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,576
Again, that sounds like a good thing.

426
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:08,295
These kind of changes in a man's life
indicate intense distress.

427
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,927
Would you like to discuss this with me?

428
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:14,156
I'd rather drive a motorcycle
full speed into a bridge abutment.

429
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,087
Do you...

430
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:20,257
Do you often entertain
suicidal thoughts?

431
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,248
No, I'm more homicidal in nature.

432
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,516
Pretty sure you're not saying
that in earnest, but as a way

433
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:27,961
to keep me at arm's length.

434
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm here. What's up?

435
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,256
Oh, do you mind?

436
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,683
I have work to do.

437
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,885
You need to talk about
these things, Dr. Hodgins.

438
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,137
If not with me, then with someone else.

439
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:39,306
Dr. Saroyan.

440
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,780
What have you got?

441
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:47,773
I found some particulates that
the geniuses at FBI forensics missed.

442
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,274
From the victim's car?

443
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:53,304
Crushed exoskeletons of copepods
and other crustaceans.

444
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,740
Yeah, I don't know what it means either.

445
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,784
So, you called me over here to...?

446
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,196
Make Sweets go away.

447
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,455
Not an appropriate use of your boss,
Dr. Hodgins.

448
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:05,822
It worked, didn't it?

449
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,886
Thanks for coming in
to the Jeffersonian, Dr. Hopp.

450
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:11,546
I'm not a doctor yet.
I'm only a third year medical student.

451
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,256
So, you tutor Robbie Timmons?

452
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,822
Yeah, twice a week... Here's
a complete record of our meetings.

453
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,219
I'll take that. Thanks.

454
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,763
So, you do a little, uh,
needlepoint on the side?

455
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:21,890
It's used to practice suturing.

456
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,559
Next year, we use actual corpses.

457
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:25,644
So, what is, uh, Robbie like?

458
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:26,823
He's a good kid...

459
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,336
He's never going to be
what his dad wants, but he tries hard.

460
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,568
I'm sorry, I have to run.

461
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,013
I got a class.

462
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,700
Did you ever meet Dr. Elliot?

463
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,511
The vet that Robbie worked for?

464
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,825
The one who got murdered?
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,323
I take it you didn't like him, huh?

466
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:45,080
Uh, I was raised
not to speak ill of the dead.

467
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,305
Yeah, well, I was raised
to ask questions like that,

468
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,419
so I'm afraid I'm going
to have to insist.

469
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:52,572
I met him maybe twice,
and I'm pretty sure he was tweaking.

470
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,624
- What's that?
- He's a meth addict.

471
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:57,593
I'm just not sure Seth Elliot
was the best role model

472
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,093
for Robbie Timmons.

473
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:01,139
Did Robbie Timmons' father know?

474
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,013
No way.

475
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,706
Old Don's a pretty straight arrow.

476
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:05,449
Robbie's his main project, so...

477
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,687
Thanks for coming in.

478
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,472
Thanks for letting me see this place.
It's legendary.

479
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:11,477
It's dogfighting.

480
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:14,887
I hate this job, so I'm quitting
to go run a gallery in Dubai.

481
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:17,011
Oh, it's just disgusting.

482
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:19,196
We got the subpoena to download

483
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:21,512
Dr. Elliot's PDA records
from the server.

484
00:21:21,632 --> 00:21:22,951
These were on his PDA?

485
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,063
Time-stamped the day of his death.

486
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,874
Fighting pit, spectators.

487
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:32,899
A rape stand used to restrain
uncooperative females.

488
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,138
The smaller cages are for bait...

489
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:38,383
Small animals used as rewards
for the winners.

490
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,511
They teach you that
in anthropology school?

491
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,303
Pitting animals against each other is

492
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,411
a common pastime in evolving cultures,
where violence is more commonplace

493
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,434
and animal life has no value.

494
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,751
To men.

495
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:51,389
No value to men.

496
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:54,013
- Yes, it's always men.
- Here we go again.

497
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:58,111
Okay, you two, don't get all, you know,
Xena: Princess Warrior, on me.

498
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,615
I guess we know now
where Elliot liked to do his gambling.

499
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,892
Wait, Ange, go back.

500
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,287
Right there, can you magnify that?

501
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:08,819
What, that blob?

502
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,025
There's something familiar.

503
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:14,126
It's Gladys' ball.

504
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,296
- Who's Gladys?
- Could be enough to get a warrant

505
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,966
if the judge had a glass of wine
or two at lunch.

506
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,175
Dubai, people.

507
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:24,596
I'm going to go sell Inuit art
to gazillionaires.

508
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:31,144
Sweets, you got a minute
for me and Parker here?

509
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,879
There you are, actually right here in
my office without an appointment or...

510
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:39,097
Hi, Parker, I'm Dr. Sweets.

511
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,822
His face doesn't look like
a baby's behind.

512
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,345
Look, okay, he's having nightmares.
He's not eating.

513
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:47,077
He doesn't want to go to school,
and suddenly, he's afraid of meteors.

514
00:22:47,237 --> 00:22:50,137
Giant flaming rocks from outer space?
Who wouldn't be afraid?

515
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:51,676
You know, I can still hear you.

516
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,917
Okay, hum, hum, okay, got it? Hum.

517
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,324
I know all this is connected
to him finding that finger.

518
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:59,840
I'm not some radio advice hack
who performs diagnoses over the phone.

519
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:03,176
This is exactly why I brought him
here in person... Cure him.

520
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:05,971
No, it doesn't really work that way.
Therapy with a child is...

521
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,713
I thought I was going
to run out of breath.

522
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,826
I'm going to run out of breath
when I run upstairs

523
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,763
and get that warrant from
that senile judge.

524
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,887
Ten, 15 minutes?
Is that good enough time?

525
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,084
Bye, have fun.

526
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:19,359
Are you my babysitter?

527
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:21,135
Parker...

528
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:24,315
that is exactly what I am.

529
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,012
The judge said no.

530
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,953
Gladys' ball wasn't enough
for a warrant.

531
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:29,783
Why?

532
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,039
Because over two million of them
were sold last year.

533
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,641
Well, we did our best.

534
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:34,577
Next case.

535
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:37,419
We need evidence that the Timmons place
is used for dogfighting.

536
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:41,015
All right, well, I found crustaceous
material in the victim's car.

537
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,389
It's an antifungal treatment
used on Astroturf.

538
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,453
That doesn't link us
with dogfighting either.

539
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:47,262
Yeah, it does.

540
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,858
All right, here we go.

541
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,020
Brennan said that this was
the dogfighting ring.

542
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,106
So it's Astroturf?

543
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,208
If this Astroturf cleaning stuff
was delivered

544
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,319
to the Timmons place,
that should get us a warrant.

545
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,862
You're a genius.

546
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:06,247
No, you're the genius.

547
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:23,965
Okay, people, what we're looking for
is evidence of a dogfighting operation.

548
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,347
Mr. Millan, thank you
so much for coming.

549
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,428
- I hope I can help.
- I've seen you on TV.

550
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:29,607
Thank you.

551
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,204
No, I only stated a fact...

552
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:34,100
There's nothing inherently complimentary
about being on television.

553
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:36,186
She's happy you're here and so am I.

554
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,230
- What's going on here?!
- You know what?

555
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,648
Serve them this warrant, tell
we're looking for Astroturf.

556
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,362
- So where do we look first?
- Start with the larger outbuildings.

557
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:46,196
You don't hurt the ones you love.

558
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:50,033
You don't send the ones you love
to their death for entertainment.

559
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,578
You must really hate these guys.

560
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:53,832
I really do.

561
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:04,634
What is it?

562
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,135
He said that the dogs
fight to their death, so...

563
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:09,844
We should have expected this.

564
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:20,730
It's a mass grave.

565
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,859
These seem to be all dog bones,
but there's other stuff, too.

566
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,820
Some trash, betting slips.

567
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,655
We'll send it back
to the Jeffersonian.

568
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:31,741
See if we can trace the betting slips.
Find these people and charge them.

569
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:35,239
Yes, that would make me feel
a bit better if we did that.

570
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:38,623
Agent Booth, we found something.

571
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:44,697
Dogfighting ring, the Astroturf.

572
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,828
It's just like the pictures
on Elliot's PDA.

573
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:48,891
Find any dogs?

574
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,826
Yes, quite a few, in fact.

575
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,046
Down.

576
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:35,414
- How does he do that?
- He's a dog whisper.

577
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:38,835
You didn't do anything.

578
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:43,938
Dogfighting ring, there remains
of a dozen dead dogs.

579
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:46,933
And you're gonna tell me all that
happened a hundred yards from your house

580
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:49,629
and you had no idea what was going on?

581
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,440
I never go to the barn.

582
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,752
I, uh, I ran an ad.

583
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:01,314
Numbered company.
Don't tell me.

584
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:03,680
They pay cash, and you never
met the tenant.

585
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,931
That's right. As far as I know,
they use it for storage.

586
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:07,420
How involved was Dr. Elliot?

587
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,298
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

588
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:12,092
He owe you money or maybe
you just wanted a bigger cut.

589
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,753
Let me go or get me my lawyer.

590
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:17,752
Whatever happened, you know what?
Four days ago, you snapped.

591
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:20,565
You had one of your trained dogs
attack him.

592
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:21,827
Four days ago?

593
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,309
I'm a driller, Agent Booth.

594
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,773
I dig wells mostly, some pylon holes.

595
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:30,394
Four days ago I was at
an auger seminar in Chicago.

596
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,279
Can you corroborate that?

597
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:35,949
Airplane tickets, hotel receipts,
about 60 eyewitnesses.

598
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:38,236
I'm kind of the life of the party
at those things.

599
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,870
I know how to organize a good time.

600
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,579
Just like you know how
to organize a dogfighting ring.

601
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,458
I don't know anything about what goes
on down at that barn.

602
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,118
Hey, stop that now.

603
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,062
Could I see your teeth, please?

604
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:00,348
That's not how you do it. Sss.

605
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:01,606
Down.

606
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,522
Down.

607
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,432
No, it's not a match.

608
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,753
That mold you made,
it's like Cinderella's slipper.

609
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,261
That story never made sense
to me, but yes.

610
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:24,705
Hey, stop that now.

611
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:29,835
It's not as easy as it looks.

612
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:36,975
Down.

613
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,939
- It's a match.
- Are you positive?

614
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,601
This is the killer dog, yes.

615
00:28:52,977 --> 00:28:54,277
I'm sorry, buddy.

616
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,056
So sorry, buddy.

617
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,959
Should I be looking out for anything
in particular?

618
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,508
Yeah, flashy crap you can sell
to a gullible kid.

619
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:16,308
I didn't sell you that car,
you bought it.

620
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,053
You saw those horizontal scallops
and you just had to have it.

621
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:22,639
I suggested that you look under
the hood, but all you did

622
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,085
was sit behind the wheel
and make vroom-vroom noises.

623
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,643
I was 20 years old.

624
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:29,104
All these years later
you're still blaming me?

625
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:33,024
You're not 20 anymore, Dr.
Hodgins, so cut it out.

626
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:34,316
You know...

627
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,768
I'm sorry.

628
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:45,579
I just...

629
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,390
I've just been having
a lot of problems recently.

630
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,918
I'm sorry to hear that.

631
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,969
My best friend who used
to work here with me,

632
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:58,363
he got himself into a lot of trouble.

633
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:01,490
I really miss the guy.

634
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,554
Dr. Hodgins...

635
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:04,638
You know, Angela?

636
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,663
She and I, we were engaged
to be married, and...

637
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,813
That went south, too.

638
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,648
That's a lot to bear...

639
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:17,986
Especially if you feel responsible.

640
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,772
Yeah, I do.

641
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:21,864
I do feel responsible.

642
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:24,753
You shouldn't be talking to me.

643
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:29,164
Of course not.
I'm sorry.

644
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:33,456
What I mean is, I'm not the right person
for you to confide in.

645
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,202
This is my last day here.

646
00:30:35,322 --> 00:30:37,797
I leave for a dig in Arizona tomorrow.

647
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:44,137
There are people around here
who seem to like you very much.

648
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:48,189
People who are concerned
for your happiness.

649
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,195
What's this?

650
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,767
It's a computer chip.

651
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:03,114
Pet owners have them embedded in
their animals in case of theft or loss.

652
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,741
But...

653
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,664
you knew that, didn't you?

654
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:17,670
I got a message that you have
something to tell me about Parker.

655
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,673
You we're right.
Parker is traumatized.

656
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,679
It has nothing to do
with the finger in the nest.

657
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:35,324
He has a girl problem.

658
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:36,814
Girl?

659
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:37,963
He's six.

660
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,902
The girl, her name's Stephanie Clyde.

661
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,783
She's somewhat large.

662
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,699
Likes to pick him
up and carry him around.

663
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:50,370
Carry him under her arm?

664
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:52,649
Like a pet monkey.
He doesn't know what to do.

665
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,652
He says you told him never to hit girls.

666
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:56,900
I told him never to hit anyone.

667
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:59,461
You know, unless it was
for self-defense.

668
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:02,091
She, uh, carries him around?

669
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,450
Like a monkey

670
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:06,070
At recess, she thinks he's cute.

671
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:08,330
What about the finger?

672
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,881
Parker actually wishes
that you'd let him have the finger

673
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:12,767
so he could show it
to Stephanie and maybe

674
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:14,838
make her barf.

675
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,688
Why doesn't he just run away?

676
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,982
Well, when I suggested that,
he told me very proudly

677
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,985
that his father never ran away
from anything.

678
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:25,040
Proudly?

679
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:27,457
- He said that?
- I think you know what to do.

680
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,631
We've all had our
Stephanie Clydes, right?

681
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,789
No one's ever carried me
around like a monkey,

682
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,623
especially a girl.

683
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,990
Of course not, me neither.

684
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,826
This is exactly where the microchip
would be embedded.

685
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:54,766
Ten digits.

686
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,895
FBI can use it to track down
Ripley's owner.

687
00:32:57,015 --> 00:32:58,387
If it's his microchip.

688
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,026
- Ripley?
- According to

689
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:05,947
The American Veterinary Identification
Device database,

690
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,615
- his owners brought him here.
- To be put to sleep.

691
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:10,783
It's true.
Do you know why?

692
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:11,674
Why?

693
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,258
Because they didn't know when
they bought him that he'd get so big.

694
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:15,705
You didn't euthanize Ripley?

695
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,074
Seth couldn'

696
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:18,831
The dog was completely healthy.

697
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:21,252
- Instead, he found Ripley a new home.
- Where?

698
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:22,579
That I don't know.

699
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:26,174
Ripley ended up at a dogfighting
facility run by Don Timmons.

700
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,847
No, Seth devoted his life
to saving dogs.

701
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:32,852
He simply wouldn't do that.

702
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:34,647
Not on purpose.

703
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:46,645
Hey, Bones, Don Timmons'
alibi checked out.

704
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:48,613
He was in Chicago...

705
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:49,924
What are you doing?

706
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:52,617
I'm just going through the case to see
if I missed anything.

707
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,227
The dog should be, you know,
in the cage.

708
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,371
- He killed Seth Elliot.
- Well, it's not his fault.

709
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:00,500
He's actually a very nice dog,
aren't you?

710
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,104
He reminds me of you.

711
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:02,952
Me?

712
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,867
He's got warm and reassuring brown eyes,

713
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:08,132
and he's capable of great violence.

714
00:34:08,474 --> 00:34:09,851
Hey, great. Thanks a million.

715
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:12,345
Wait, Booth, look at this cruelty.

716
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,099
They send dogs into fight,
to die or be hurt,

717
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:18,935
and then they stitch them back up and
they send them out to fight again.

718
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:22,353
We've been assuming it's been
Seth Elliot doctoring these dogs.

719
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:24,065
- Well, he was a vet.
- But look...

720
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,016
Common suture stitch.

721
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:28,667
See here how it's uneven
in the same way.

722
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:30,655
- And there's an "X" at the end.
- So?

723
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:32,482
It's distinctive.

724
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,021
And I've seen it before.

725
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,744
Common suture, uneven...

726
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:41,833
"X" at the end.
Same thing.

727
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,641
It's like a fingerprint.

728
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:46,293
The thread is green nylon.
You better believe we'll match it.

729
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:48,416
Stitching up wounded animals
isn't a crime.

730
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:49,511
What's going on?

731
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,581
Just everybody shut up,
and we'll be fine.

732
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:54,433
- Everyone, this is Ripley.
- He killed Dr. Elliot.

733
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,097
None of us ever saw that dog before.

734
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,224
We can tie Andy here

735
00:34:58,384 --> 00:35:01,436
to all of these wounded animals
and to Ripley.

736
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:03,989
Is that that guy from TV
who talks to dogs?

737
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:07,942
You see, we want to know who
sicced Ripley here on Seth Elliot.

738
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:09,986
We don't need you.
We know you were in Chicago.

739
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,948
Would you mind clapping like this?

740
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:16,723
- No, we won't do that.
- Do it, Robbie.

741
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,370
- What?
- You're not his master. Do it.

742
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,164
It's not him.

743
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,466
Look at that.

744
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:35,624
He's waiting for your command.

745
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:39,474
Maybe my dog killed Dr. Elliot, but
that doesn't mean I made him do it.

746
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,329
Ripley's a good dog.

747
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,686
He wouldn't attack unless
he was ordered.

748
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,774
Tell these people what you know
about Seth Elliot.

749
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,159
I- I saw it.

750
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,828
Andy told Ripley to attack

751
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:04,373
because he saw Dr. Elliot taking
pictures of the dogfighting.

752
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,836
I don't know how to do this.

753
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,057
Mostly you just tell
me what's on your mind.

754
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,559
Mostly on my mind is I hate everyone.

755
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,659
Everyone?

756
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:26,518
To varying degrees, but, um...

757
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,107
yeah, yeah, everyone.

758
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:33,718
Angela...

759
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:35,843
the most.

760
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:38,449
Because we, you know,
had something great and...

761
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,172
And now it's dirt.

762
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:42,967
Zack...

763
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:45,153
for being such an idiot.

764
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:48,789
Brennan for bringing us all together.

765
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,099
Cam for making us efficient.

766
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:52,838
Booth for giving us a mission.

767
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,716
You for pick, pick, picking at me.

768
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:56,905
Should I go on?

769
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:58,343
No, no, I get the point.

770
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,632
I just hate everyone.

771
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:03,391
So, what?

772
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:05,518
Intense therapy, heavy medication?

773
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,812
No. I'm good with the hate.

774
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:11,497
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.

775
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:12,900
You're doing fine.

776
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:16,988
I hate everyone.

777
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,214
You're coping.
It's a coping technique.

778
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,241
Coping's good.

779
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:22,229
Did you get your degree
on the Internet?

780
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,664
Let me see your diploma.

781
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:24,833
You're working.

782
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,455
You're living a life of purpose.

783
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:28,476
You haven't turned your back
on your friends.

784
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,042
Except I hate them all.

785
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,044
You're independently wealthy, right?

786
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:33,374
You don't have to work.

787
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:36,577
And yet you choose to stay
with the people you hate.

788
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:39,795
Which makes me completely nuts.

789
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:43,223
No, you've replaced one way
of seeing the world--

790
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,343
paranoia...

791
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,183
With another: misanthropy.

792
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:49,657
Soon you'll replace misanthropy
with something nicer,

793
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:51,021
but for now, temporarily?

794
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,534
I'm satisfied with
your coping technique.

795
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,879
My coping technique

796
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:58,321
of hate?

797
00:37:58,907 --> 00:37:59,952
Correct.

798
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,078
So...

799
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,824
Are you, like, my therapist now, or...?

800
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,082
No, we work together.

801
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,033
Great. See ya at work.

802
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:21,412
Robbie Timmons gave a statement.

803
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,664
Andrew Hopp set the dog on Seth Elliot.

804
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,723
Apparently Elliot was furious
when he found out

805
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:29,185
the dog he'd given to Timmons
was used in dogfighting.

806
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:32,271
Dr. Elliot took all the photos
to turn into the police.

807
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:34,755
Andrew Hopp would have lost
his main source of income.

808
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,859
He would have been forced
to leave medical school.

809
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,944
What about the people
in the dogfighting ring?

810
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:41,355
Don't worry about it.
We'll round them up.

811
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:42,573
So...

812
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,992
- What do you got there?
- I've decided to adopt Ripley.

813
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,119
- Bones...
- I've already contacted a dog walker

814
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:50,423
and a doggie day care place, and my dad
will take him when I leave town.

815
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,875
I got a little tag.
See?

816
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:54,000
Ripley Brennan.

817
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,168
He was put down.

818
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:00,034
- What?
- I'm sorry.

819
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,301
He killed someone,
and they had to put him down.

820
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,513
It wasn't Ripley's fault.
People made him do what he did.

821
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:06,976
I know. I'm sorry.

822
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:09,760
You can tell he's a good-natured dog.

823
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:12,478
They put him down?

824
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,691
Damn it.

825
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:18,109
Bones, I'm sorry.

826
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,737
What are they going
to do with his remains?

827
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,732
Can I do that?

828
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,396
You sure?

829
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:32,918
Yeah. You dug it.

830
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,134
So did Sweets help you with Parker?

831
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,895
I told Parker that it's...

832
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:48,848
best just to walk away sometimes.

833
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,457
What, sometimes?

834
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,896
Isn't it always better to walk away?

835
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,083
You know, this dog would still be alive
if he wasn't forced to fight.

836
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:58,415
I told him to walk away
if it's for himself,

837
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,068
and to stand up and fight
if it's for someone else.

838
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:04,947
I don't know if that was
the right thing to say, but...

839
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,700
You're a very good father.

840
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,622
So, do you want to say something?

841
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,687
I feel that this dog, Ripley,
paid a price that was unfair.

842
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:22,840
It's not my fault.

843
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,259
- Why are you talking to me?
- You're the only one here.

844
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,846
Talk to the universe...
or God or Ripley.

845
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,378
I don't believe in God.

846
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:32,433
God spelled backwards is "dog."

847
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,270
And Ripley is dead.

848
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,726
Plus, he's a dog, with, you know...

849
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:41,078
limited vocabulary skills.

850
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:42,317
Bones, just...

851
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,390
Speak from your heart.

852
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,819
On behalf of humankind,

853
00:40:56,816 --> 00:40:58,833
universe, I'd like to

854
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:00,929
apologize for what happened to Ripley.

855
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,021
He was born a cute little puppy...

856
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:06,860
and then the people who adopted him

857
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,577
wanted to kill him because
they were too stupid to realize that

858
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,452
he would grow into a big dog.

859
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,433
That's good.

860
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,992
Ripley was a good dog.

861
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:25,228
He didn't want to fight.

862
00:41:26,247 --> 00:41:28,400
But he did it to please his master.

863
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,533
He didn't want to attack

864
00:41:30,694 --> 00:41:33,914
a human being, but he did it
to please his master.

865
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:37,860
You know, it wasn't
Ripley's fault that his

866
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,501
master was cruel and selfish.

867
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:46,047
Like all dogs, Ripley only saw
the good in people.

868
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:49,440
Dogs are like that.

869
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:51,720
People should take a lesson.

870
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,233
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.

871
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:06,928
As much as any good dog...

872
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:09,490
hey... could hope for.

873
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:13,274
Even with limited
vocabulary skills, okay?

874
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:25,273
