1
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,315
These tigers eat better than I do.

2
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:27,526
- Hey, yesterday's food's still here.
- And the day before's.

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,737
I don't think Matilda's moved
in two days.

4
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:33,324
- I hope she's not sick.
- Maybe there is something wrong.

5
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,895
Should we call the vet?

6
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,910
- Let's go.
- I was here last weekend with Parker.

7
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:04,355
They got monkeys swinging free
right over there.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,469
- You think we got time?
- Booth, we are here

9
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,042
to recover a set of remains.

10
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,612
Bones, yeah, take time
to smell the primates.

11
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,239
Why? They're malodorous,
and they throw their excrement.

12
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:18,536
Who wanders around
in an animal park?

13
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,891
Someone with
extremely poor judgment.

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,800
Guess no one told this guy
it's not a petting zoo.

15
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,223
Never mind.

16
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,330
The flesh has been gnawed
and baked in the sun,

17
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,966
but the nasal root suggests
a black male,

18
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,300
over six feet tall.

19
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,327
According to
Parker's Big Book of Animals,

20
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:38,806
they can pounce at 35 miles per hour

21
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,141
and leap 30 feet.

22
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,477
The tiger fed on the flesh and

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,938
internal organs before
he started cleaning the bones.

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,309
I'm thinking the victim wandered away
from his car,

25
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,651
he was drunk,
and he ended up in this area.

26
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,237
Same thing happened to a guy last year
in the giraffe section.

27
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,448
Giraffes are herbivores.
They don't eat people.

28
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:57,272
That part is different.

29
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,197
But the guy broke his arm.

30
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,967
Did you know that giraffes
can weigh up to two tons?

31
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:05,082
- Everyone knows that.
- And they sleep less than 2 h a day.

32
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:06,792
That I did not know.

33
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,652
Pinky stumps The Brain!

34
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,875
Well, I have no way of determining
cause of death out here,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,509
so we should pack everything up
and bring it back to the lab.

36
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,815
Pack it up.

37
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,504
Teeth marks on the manubrium
and the sternum.

38
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,394
Nice to have you back, Dr. Edison.

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,060
- I wasn't sure we'd see you again.
- Dr. Brennan assured me

40
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:30,566
that I could count
on a strictly professional atmosphere.

41
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,572
I admire your focus
and dedication to your work, Dr. Edison.

42
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:35,362
Thoracolumbar fascia has been eaten.

43
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,268
No stomach contents for me to analyze
because the tiger ate the stomach.

44
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,136
Oh, don't blame the tiger.

45
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,412
Animals shouldn't be confined
for human amusement.

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
- A zoo hater?
- And a vegan.

47
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,959
- Someone's revealing his personal life.
- It relates to the case.

48
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,046
Zoos have many breeding programs
to preserve endangered species.

49
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,576
Animals bred in zoos
have weak natural instincts.

50
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:57,802
- They're basically imprisoned pets.
- Pets generally don't eat you.

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,679
Common house cat will devour you
before you're cold.

52
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:03,453
The victim's hyoid
and spinal cord are still intact.

53
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:07,543
There're no indications of a traditional
tiger throat bite or strangle hold.

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,771
- The tiger was not the cause of death.
- I agree.

55
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,452
Some kind of weapon sliced along what's
left of the right pelvis and thigh,

56
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,112
transecting the femoral artery.

57
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,280
He died of a good,
old-fashioned bleed out.

58
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,549
A shoelace

59
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,263
mixed in with the flesh.

60
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,036
The tiger could have coughed it up,

61
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,454
like a fur ball.

62
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,164
Judging from decomp and...

63
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,291
the amount the tiger ate, I estimate

64
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,709
time of death to be late Friday night,
early Saturday?

65
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,462
Welcome back, Clark.

66
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,800
- Have you been working out?
- Excuse me?

67
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,407
You look so solid and compact.

68
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,515
I believe that all conversation
should relate to this man's murder.

69
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,517
Angela's taking a stab at celibacy.

70
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,270
Sweets thinks it will help me
form more committed relationships.

71
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,230
But it just seems to rev up
her libido.

72
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,404
Chewing

73
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,678
has imbedded particulates
into the teeth marks in the

74
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,027
medial malleolus.

75
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:58,741
I get it.

76
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:00,573
But you're squeezable.

77
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,694
We should thank our tiger
for not eating the victim's teeth.

78
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,453
Dentals gave us an easy match.

79
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,593
Dr. Andrew Welton.

80
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:15,129
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's dentals.

81
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,511
Doesn't take a rocket scientist
to ID off dentals. Sad, huh?

82
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,773
He's handsome.

83
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,803
- He's hot really.
- Okay. That's enough, Angela.

84
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:27,686
Are you all right, Dr. Saroyan?

85
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:31,967
I...

86
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,787
knew Dr. Welton.
We lived together

87
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,317
for two years.

88
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,278
Oh, my God. Cam, I'm really sorry.

89
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,796
No. Let's just...

90
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,292
find out who killed him, okay?

91
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,483
Bones - Season 4 Episode 18
"The Doctor in the Den"

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,668
Synchro: Reborn, ShalimarFox,
IceFreak

93
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,358
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

94
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:26,304
So, I called the hospital,

95
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:28,327
Dr. Welton has been missing
for two days.

96
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:31,731
I'm sorry, Cam.

97
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:34,409
I haven't even...

98
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:38,485
seen Andrew for ten years.
It's silly to be reacting like this.

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,955
No, it's not.
You know what?

100
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,609
He was a big part of your life.

101
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:47,769
What about his daughter?
Who's going to tell Michelle?

102
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,723
- Had he remarried, or...?
- No.

103
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,370
No other family.

104
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:54,228
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

105
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,755
Michelle's mom died

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,581
during childbirth,
and I don't think Andrew could ever

107
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,251
go through loving anyone
like that again.

108
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,029
Michelle became everything to him.

109
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,241
She must be, what, 16 now?

110
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:13,395
What a terrible time
to lose her father.

111
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,530
Listen, Bones and I...

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,418
we'll get the social worker.

113
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,936
No social worker.

114
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,941
If there's no one else,
I have to do it.

115
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,340
I'll talk to her.

116
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,896
Cam, it's been ten years
since you've seen her.

117
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,563
I was her mom
for almost two years, Seeley.

118
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,146
She should hear it
from someone who...

119
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,561
someone who loved her father.

120
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,894
So, you sure you don't want us
to come in with you?

121
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,642
No. I'll be fine.

122
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:11,874
- Did Cam raise her?
- Yup, for two years.

123
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,695
Camille Saroyan?

124
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:20,522
And you know my dad?

125
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,667
You were four when your father
and I were together.

126
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,070
I moved away
just after you turned six.

127
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,347
But I remember your party.

128
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,715
You were sitting on the clown's lap
while he made

129
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,982
balloon animals,
and you kept handing them to me.

130
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,248
- And I had this armful of...
- I don't remember,

131
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:37,331
and my dad's not here right now.

132
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:38,401
I know.

133
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,211
I'm working on a case
with the FBI, Michelle.

134
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:44,566
Could you please sit down?

135
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,541
She told me she never wanted
to have kids.

136
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,473
Maybe Michelle is the reason.

137
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:57,450
- I don't understand.
- She loved Welton,

138
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:00,010
lived with him for about two years,

139
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:03,148
and she raised Michelle
like she was her own, and then,

140
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,019
she's been alone for all that time
because she doesn't want to put herself

141
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,500
in that position again.

142
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,009
But that was ten years ago.

143
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,075
For Cam, there are
emotional considerations here.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,410
That's why she has to be involved
in the case.

145
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:15,536
With us.

146
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,807
It's best that you...

147
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,082
stay in the lab

148
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:22,500
a little bit more,
just this time around.

149
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,793
Because that's where
I'm most useful.

150
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:25,908
I understand.

151
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,283
You and Cam can

152
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:30,426
rely on your statistically
inaccurate guts to solve the case.

153
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,442
She needs this.

154
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:35,013
Just trust me on this, Bones.

155
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,163
Last time I saw him was Friday night.
He was

156
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,821
getting ready for some hospital party
at the animal park.

157
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,693
I spent the weekend at my friend's.

158
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,903
I'm sure that he's still
at the hospital.

159
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,205
Michelle, we found your father.

160
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,609
I'm very

161
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:57,755
sorry to have to tell you
that he's...

162
00:08:58,928 --> 00:08:59,913
He passed away.

163
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:03,316
What?

164
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,960
He was fine.

165
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,426
He was fine.
I saw him two days ago.

166
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:13,927
You're wrong.

167
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,075
I'm so sorry, honey.

168
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,649
Is anyone staying with you?

169
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:24,013
Our housekeeper, Mrs. Jenks.
But she's...

170
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:27,369
What happened?

171
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,026
He was healthy.

172
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:30,986
We believe he was killed.

173
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:32,040
What?

174
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,215
Oh, my God!

175
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,748
Oh, my God.

176
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,352
Look, I don't even know you, okay?

177
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:43,516
Why don't you just do your job,
and find out who did this to my dad?

178
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,919
Is everything all right? My dad.

179
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,962
She says that my dad
has been murdered.

180
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,468
Oh, good God.

181
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,092
How could you tell her alone?

182
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,025
Why didn't you call me?

183
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,762
I thought she'd remember me.
I was...

184
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,557
a friend of the family.

185
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,392
I think you should go.

186
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:06,063
I know this is difficult,
but I have to ask a few questions.

187
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,064
Now?

188
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,888
- In order to pursue an investigation.
- What?

189
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,130
What do you want to know?

190
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:14,742
Did your father have

191
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,367
any enemies,
any difficult relationships?

192
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:20,538
Everybody loved him.

193
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,952
You said that you knew him.

194
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,510
You should know that.

195
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,796
How did it go?

196
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,673
You should have brought
a social worker, she...

197
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,588
didn't rember me at all.

198
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,085
Look at the pelvis.

199
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,447
Surface lacerations to the periosteum
of the pelvic bone.

200
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,849
Those aren't bone chips.

201
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:04,538
Whatever caused the laceration
embedded something in the bone.

202
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,917
Look at the injuries
near the femoral artery.

203
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,875
There are particles of mica in here.

204
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,382
The scarring in the ilium indicates
that something gouged the victim.

205
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,172
I'll start testing possible weapons.

206
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,389
- Do you have anything yet?
- A thorough examination takes time.

207
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:18,951
Let's not take too much time.

208
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,100
- We're being so thorough that we can...
- There's a killer out, Dr. Edison,

209
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,557
so be thorough and fast.

210
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,114
I have the results
of Welton's tox screen.

211
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,936
There were opiates in his blood:

212
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,309
- hydrocodone and carisoprodol.
- Perhaps he was self-medicating?

213
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:34,756
- Doesn't sound like Andrew.
- You haven't seen him in years.

214
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,946
These are high levels of opiates to have
in your system if you're a surgeon.

215
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,949
It's not uncommon for doctors
to have substance abuse issues.

216
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,712
Andrew was not a drug abuser.

217
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,829
Look for physical indicators
that might warrant opiate use.

218
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,873
I'm meeting Booth at the hospital
if you have any information,

219
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:52,313
which I hope you will.

220
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:59,667
I took Michelle to ballet class
and parent-teacher conferences.

221
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:03,126
And I read her to sleep.
And when I saw her, it all came back.

222
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,861
I thought it would for her
some of it at least.

223
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,005
Listen, Parker's seven.
He can't even remember

224
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,279
- how to put on his underwear.
- But he knows you.

225
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,651
- He knows what you've done for him.
- It's been ten years. People move on.

226
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,653
It's a relationship
that didn't work out.

227
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,528
It's a family, Seeley.
A family that didn't work out.

228
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,200
- It's been a long time.
- It's horrible what happened.

229
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:26,081
This is Special Agent Booth.

230
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:27,916
Dr. Bailey is Roosevelt's CA.

231
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,707
Dr. Bailey, I'd like to ask you
a few questions about Dr. Welton.

232
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:31,955
Of course.

233
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:33,877
Let's find some privacy.

234
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,963
We were both residents here.
It was a really competitive environment.

235
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:40,634
- Does Michelle know?
- Yes. I saw her this morning.

236
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,151
Poor kid.

237
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,697
You two were pretty close,
as I rember.

238
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,931
Dr. Bailey, we believe that Dr. Welton
was killed at the benefit Friday night.

239
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,853
- At the animal park?
- He was found in the tiger habitat.

240
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,603
We need a list of everyone
who attended the benefit.

241
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,351
Staff, caters, park personnel
assigned to the event...

242
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,476
Of course.

243
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:01,488
- Dr. Welton have any enemies?
- The staff loved him.

244
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,925
In the spirit
of full disclosure though,

245
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,495
you should know Dr. Welton
and I had our share of disagreements.

246
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,340
It's an occupational hazard.

247
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,374
Maura always
did like being in charge.

248
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,459
I am in charge now, Camille.

249
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,047
Andrew and I
had policy disagreements.

250
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,605
But I admired him.

251
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,175
He was the best
cardiovascular surgeon I knew.

252
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,678
What about any other patients,
people outside the hospital?

253
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,249
Malpractice suits are par for the course
in any hospital.

254
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,349
And we are fighting 15 right now.

255
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,018
I'm going to need a list
of all those lawsuits naming Dr. Welton.

256
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:33,333
Of course.

257
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,505
Andrew usually made
his rounds at night.

258
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,732
Who would have seen him
before he went to the benefit?

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,777
You should check with the nurses
in the cardiac unit.

260
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,196
Dr. Welton was the best.
Everyone loved him.

261
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,741
- He lived for his patients.
- And his daughter.

262
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:49,274
Dr. W. made his rounds
before the benefit.

263
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,246
I helped him change
a chest tube and,

264
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,874
I had to push him aside
so his tux didn't dirty.

265
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,898
Other than that,
it was any other night.

266
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:58,253
And no arguments with patients
or family members?

267
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,921
With Dr. Welton? No.

268
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,927
Do you know if he was taking anyone
to the benefit?

269
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,630
I told him he could take me.

270
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:06,261
He looked like James Bond.

271
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,884
You never knew
who Dr. Welton was dating.

272
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,412
- He wasn't the type to settle down.
- Right.

273
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,781
How's it going?

274
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,232
What is that smell?

275
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,223
Are you wearing cologne?

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,730
It's urine.

277
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,522
I found traces of ureic acid
on the victim's clothing.

278
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,244
Maybe it was the pheromones
you found pleasing.

279
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,622
Yeah, the pheromones in tiger urine?

280
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,665
Well, I assume it's tiger urine.

281
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,025
The cat was probably marking
its territory.

282
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,086
I was turned on by tiger urine?

283
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,173
Celibacy isn't easy, Ange.

284
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,245
Tell me about it.

285
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,315
I don't know why Sweets thinks
this is going to help form more

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,040
stable relationships.

287
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:51,783
Sex is the glue.

288
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:53,558
We were like epoxy.

289
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:56,394
Sometimes relationships
need more than just sex.

290
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,813
Okay, I get it.

291
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,610
I wasn't wrong about Clark though,
was I? He's cute, and he's built.

292
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,378
Yeah. Not too comfortable
with this part of the conversation.

293
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,700
I'm just saying.
I'm allowed to look, right?

294
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,744
- Sure.
- And remember.

295
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:14,908
Remember?

296
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,206
Yeah.

297
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,117
You should join a gym.

298
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:22,587
Go for a run to burn off
some of your excess...

299
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:24,381
whatever it is.

300
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,883
I really, need to get back to my...

301
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,051
Urine.

302
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:29,176
Yeah.

303
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:35,003
I found nodules
of ossified cartilage

304
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:39,126
on Welton's thumbs between
the metacarpals and carpals.

305
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,422
He was suffering
from synovial chondromatosis.

306
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:44,241
He was in pain.

307
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,256
That would explain the opiates.
I also...

308
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:49,307
found ibuprofen,

309
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:52,542
which he would've taken
to reduce the inflammation.

310
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,435
The bony growths in his wrists
would have caused him pain

311
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,664
and severely
restricted his mobility.

312
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,001
It'd've been very dangerous for him
to perform surgery in his condition.

313
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,195
- He wouldn't have done it, not Andrew.
- You can't know that.

314
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,048
- People change in ten years.
- Not someone's nature.

315
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,473
We're scientists.

316
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,093
We can't quantify or rely
on our emotions.

317
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:13,371
They're arbitrary and indeterminate.

318
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:15,870
We know people through
our feelings, Dr. Brennan.

319
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,893
You trust Booth
because of what you feel.

320
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,186
No, I trust Booth
because of past actions.

321
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,346
And faith in the future. I'm sorry,
but feelings are important, even to you.

322
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,416
So a guy named Brandon Casey

323
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,370
filed a malpractice suit
after his wife died during surgery

324
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,410
on Welton's operating table.

325
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,037
After the suit
was arbitrated in Welton's favor,

326
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,105
<i>Welton filed a restraining order
against Casey.</i>

327
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,083
You think Casey killed Welton?

328
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,462
Well, I don't know, but I do know that
Casey bought a ticket to the benefit.

329
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:50,175
Why would someone who sued
the hospital pay to go to its benefit?

330
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,434
I don't understand why I'm here.

331
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,809
Your wife died during surgery
performed by Dr. Andrew Welton.

332
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,491
Yes, that was two years ago.

333
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,522
She was only 32 years old.
She had a congenital heart defect.

334
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,084
And yet he had to take out
a restraing order against you?

335
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,029
<i>I was crazy when Alex died.
I need to blame someone.</i>

336
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,306
<i>Then you attacked him, which is why
he had to take out a restraing order.</i>

337
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:17,786
<i>Which I get, because, you know...
got to let the anger go.</i>

338
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,420
I need to find forgiveness, even

339
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:23,166
- compassion for the doctor.
- He seems sincere.

340
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,085
But he still violated
the restraing order.

341
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,372
And yet, you went to the benefit
last Friday night, ignoring the order.

342
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,839
I went to apologize.

343
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,800
I had accused this man of murder.

344
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,718
I owed Dr. Welton an apology.

345
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,887
And what did he say to you
after you apologized?

346
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,187
Well, we didn't get a chance to talk.
He was arguing with a woman.

347
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,768
They were off to the side
really going at it.

348
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,771
I didn't want to get in the middle
of it. What, what's going on here?

349
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,171
- Has something happened to Dr. Welton?
- Yeah, he was murdered Friday night.

350
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,860
I'm... Oh, my God.

351
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,030
- What this woman looked like?
- No, I don't, I don't rember.

352
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,910
What she was wearing?
Was she tall? Was she short?

353
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,052
- Nothing?
- I'm sorry. I don't remember.

354
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:03,707
It's possible, people don't retain
what they don't think is important.

355
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Great.

356
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,165
I beg your pardon?

357
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,418
- Nothing.
- But the memories are still formed.

358
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,425
See if he'll agree to hypnosis.

359
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,255
The gouge that extends
from the ilium to the femur is deep,

360
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,873
and seems to have torn
through the bone.

361
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,566
I found wounds on the proximal
phalanx of the right fifth digit,

362
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,276
as well as the ulnar tuberosity.

363
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,028
- Defensive wounds.
- Yes, caused by blunt force.

364
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,242
I used the measurements of the injuries
to run scenarios on possible weapons.

365
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,369
And you did this while jogging?

366
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,206
Well, yeah, I was burning off a little
of my extra desire on the way to work,

367
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,668
Sweet Pea.

368
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,752
Is Sweet Pea an appropriate
workplace moniker?

369
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,394
Don't worry, Clark, I won't eat you.

370
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:54,506
- Not that I'm not tempted.
- Thank God.

371
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,719
Most men would be flattered
by Angela's sexual interest in them.

372
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,222
Well, my sexual needs
are well taken care of, thank you.

373
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,182
Really?

374
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,601
Your results?

375
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,650
The force that it would take
to inflict injuries this severe

376
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,320
would dictate either
an extremely strong person

377
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,656
over seven feet tall,
wielding a two-foot metal pole.

378
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,075
Someone at the party
would've noticed a giant.

379
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,243
Or...

380
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,082
someone between 5'7" and 5'11"

381
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,167
wielding a five-foot metal pole
with a ten-centimeter diameter.

382
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,879
A metal pole of that length and diameter
would be consistent with

383
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,924
the defensive injuries we found.
We've to determine what gouged the bone.

384
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,691
Yeah, well, I'm going to need
more information for that.

385
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,639
- Can I borrow you for a little while?
- To do what with?

386
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,206
Sorry, that just popped out.
I need a longer run.

387
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,578
Yeah, I understand.

388
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:51,042
I'm going to be hypnotizing
a witness

389
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,608
who can't remember a suspect,
and I need a sketch artist.

390
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,363
- We're finished.
- Cool. I'm all yours, Sweets.

391
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,531
All right.

392
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,009
You are relaxed, Mr. Casey.

393
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:08,434
Totally relaxed,

394
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:11,867
and completely aware
of your surroundings.

395
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,536
Can you tell me my name?

396
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:17,132
- Dr. Sweets.
- Yes.

397
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:20,969
And we are here together
at the animal park,

398
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:22,637
at the hospital benefit.

399
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:23,887
Yes.

400
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:27,559
There are so many people here.
And I keep missing the hors d'oeuvres.

401
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,812
You've got to be kidding me.

402
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,566
Have you spotted Dr. Welton yet?

403
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,891
I know he's here someplace.

404
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,975
How do you feel, Mr. Casey?
Are you angry?

405
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,697
You thought this man
killed your wife.

406
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,322
No. No, I was wrong.

407
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:49,455
I'm looking forward to seeing the doctor
and making amends.

408
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,397
Would you like some champagne?

409
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,422
- No, thanks.
- Absolutely.

410
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:54,738
All right.

411
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,796
Have you spotted Dr. Welton yet?

412
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,614
No, I keep trying
to get something to eat.

413
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,635
- I didn't have lunch.
- I'd like something to eat, too.

414
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,358
Okay, here comes a waitress.

415
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,353
She's giving you what you want.

416
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:11,242
Now, can you,
can you see the doctor?

417
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:13,549
Yes.

418
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,982
- He's over by the path.
- What path?

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,026
The path that leads to the animals.

420
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,700
I hear there's no fence.
What if the animals can get out?

421
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,075
Don't worry.

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,450
You are perfectly safe, Mr. Casey.

423
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,759
The animals won't hurt you.
They're very friendly.

424
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,636
Yes. Yes, they are.

425
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:49,875
You can see Dr. Welton clearly now.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,808
Can't you?

427
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,931
- Is he alone?
- No,

428
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:56,230
- He's with a woman.
- And they're arguing?

429
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,675
Yes. She's, she's yelling at him.

430
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
He's trying to calm her down.

431
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:01,925
She's pushing him.

432
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,405
Look closer.
Tell me what she looks like.

433
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,475
No, I need to move away.
This is embarrassing.

434
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,550
No. No, no, no.
No, not yet.

435
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:11,037
Look at the woman.

436
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:13,475
You can see her clearly
now, can't you?

437
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Yes.

438
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:19,379
Okay, so let's sit here and we'll sip
a little champagne and...

439
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,500
you can describe her to me.

440
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,625
In detail.

441
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,262
She's about 50.

442
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,598
Oval face, strong features,

443
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,934
cheekbones, hazel eyes,

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,311
pointed nose...

445
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,190
Dude, you're blocking my light.

446
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:44,779
Do you, uh, recognize
this woman, Dr. Bailey?

447
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:46,371
Of course I do.

448
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,668
Mrs. Diane Annenburg.

449
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,162
She's one of our biggest donors.

450
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,374
We have a witness who saw her arguing
with Dr Welton the night of the benefit.

451
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,991
A woman that generous is used
to getting her own way,

452
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,295
but she's not a killer.

453
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,089
She wouldn't have been happy knowing
that your best surgeon was disabled.

454
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,926
Why didn't you mention that Andrew had
synovial chondromatosis when we spoke?

455
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,803
It didn't affect the investigation.

456
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,860
If you think about it, the hospital
would've been ruined if it came out

457
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:15,575
if it came out that Dr. Welton was
operating when he shouldn't have been.

458
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,437
Annenburg would've look like a fool.

459
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,275
I know it's been a while, Camille,

460
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,975
but you knew Andrew.

461
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,175
He would never jeopardize a patient.

462
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,600
We agreed he would
only supervise during surgery

463
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,575
until he decided what sort
of treatment to follow.

464
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,075
Is there any other reason Annenburg
might have been angry with Andrew?

465
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,250
She seems a little old for him.

466
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:39,352
Her son, Rick, is in his
last year of med school.

467
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,669
He applied to Roosevelt
for his surgical residency.

468
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,255
- Andrew ran that admissions committee.
- Did he reject her son?

469
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,758
He did.
We supported that decision.

470
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,844
Looks like we have one unhappy mom.

471
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:57,727
So, you were seen arguing
with Dr. Welton the night that he died.

472
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,275
At the benefit?

473
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
- That wasn't an argument.
- Then what was it?

474
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,350
I was expressing my disappointment

475
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:08,075
with Dr. Welton's decision
to exclude my son

476
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,114
from the residency
program at Roosevelt.

477
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,991
Money doesn't make you a god.

478
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,952
My son should've been accepted
because he's deserving.

479
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,164
Richard never wanted to be
anything but a doctor.

480
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:21,902
He, he worked for it.
He finished second in his class.

481
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:23,586
Obviously...

482
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:26,506
Dr. Welton had some
sort of personal issue

483
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,913
with my son or with me.

484
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,310
Right, and removing him
would solve all your problems.

485
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:33,758
Yes.

486
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,475
I wanted him removed
from the Board of Admissions.

487
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:40,000
I do feel that my generosity
entitles me

488
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,438
to some sort of influence.

489
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:46,977
But I did
not want Dr. Welton killed.

490
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,278
Well, I can only imagine that Richard
was pretty angry with Welton, too.

491
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,829
A young man like that who's used
to getting whatever he wants,

492
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,538
might lose control.

493
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,040
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Was your son at the benefit?

494
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,627
Richard is a good boy, Agent Booth.

495
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,588
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Annenburg.

496
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,575
- Anything of value yet?
- We are cataloguing injuries.

497
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,975
- I thought you would be with Booth.
- Questioning people isn't my thing.

498
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,075
Most of the time I want to beat them
until they tell me what I want to hear.

499
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,975
I know. It gets frustrating, and hitting
can often be quite effective

500
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,258
And you both work with
the Justice Department.

501
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,400
- Yes.
- Ironic...

502
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:29,774
How is Michelle?

503
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,447
The loss of a father can be
quite devastating.

504
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,116
I haven't seen her again.

505
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,708
I imagine Child Services

506
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,883
will probably be moving her
to a foster home soon.

507
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,400
Those white flecks that were embedded
in the pelvic bone?

508
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,175
They're polymerized hydrocarbon,

509
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,375
from the serrated edge
of a plastic knife.

510
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,400
Seems our victim was attacked
in the groin with disposable cutlery.

511
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,513
Didn't we find a blood-soaked
shoelace in the remains?

512
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,891
Yes. We assumed that the tiger
coughed it up.

513
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,311
Under normal circumstances,
a plastic knife could barely cut flesh.

514
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,715
But if there was
already an open wound,

515
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,775
caused by whatever
punctured the artery...

516
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,975
Then a plastic knife could be used
to enlarge the opening.

517
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,904
Why?
Make him bleed out faster?

518
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,531
No. Someone was trying
to make the bleeding stop.

519
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,900
The puncture wounds were too high
for a tourniquet,

520
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,578
so they used the knife to gain access
to the vascular area.

521
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,275
The shoelace was probably used
to tie off the femoral artery,

522
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,001
but the procedure failed.

523
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,251
Who would attack him
and then try to save him?

524
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:31,130
Someone with a medical background.

525
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,136
So, tell me about Dr. Welton.

526
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,576
He was a... good man.

527
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:43,275
A good doctor.
It's terrible what happened to him.

528
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,075
I heard he made the mistake
of getting between you

529
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,314
and something you've been working for
your whole life.

530
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:51,692
- My mother tell you that?
- She said you wanted to be a doctor.

531
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:52,902
She's right.

532
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,475
Roosevelt's got some
of the best residencies.

533
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,185
I can see why you wouldn't want
anything to get in your way.

534
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,295
- What does that mean?
- You see, the suspect

535
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,468
that we're looking for had motive,

536
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,975
opportunity
and a medical background.

537
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,075
Does that sound like
anyone in this room?

538
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,834
You think I killed Dr. Welton?

539
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:13,422
I want to save lives, Agent Booth,
that's why I'm a doctor.

540
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,703
Someone tried to save Dr. Welton.

541
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:18,010
They tried to stop
the bleeding after they attacked him.

542
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,222
I didn't even want the residency.
I begged Dr. Welton to reject me.

543
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,225
After all that hard work. Now, why
would you do something like that?

544
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,050
To get away from my mother.

545
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,772
She seems all benevolent,
but she's a control freak.

546
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,566
And Dr. Welton, he understood that

547
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,248
I had to get away from her to be
the kind of doctor I wanted to be.

548
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:38,030
So he stood up for you, even though
he might lose his job?

549
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Yeah.

550
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,175
Look, you don't have to believe me.
If somebody tried to stop the bleeding,

551
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,675
then they'd be covered
in blood themselves.

552
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,376
Take my clothes.
You can run all the tests you want.

553
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,967
I just wanted to find out
how you were doing.

554
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,475
I know how difficult
this must be for you.

555
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,888
Aren't you supposed to be finding out
who did this to my dad?

556
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,956
And I will.
I swear to you.

557
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:08,874
I know what a good man he was.

558
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,250
And what a great father.

559
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,203
You don't remember?

560
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Yeah.

561
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,917
Yeah, I remember.

562
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,010
I remember that
you said you loved me,

563
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,448
and that we were a family.

564
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,890
And then you just left.

565
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,013
The reason I left...

566
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:48,125
It was between your father and me.

567
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,394
It had nothing
to do with you, Michelle.

568
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,940
Yeah. That's what he always said.

569
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,248
But if you care so much,

570
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:59,779
why don't you explain it
to me right now?

571
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:05,544
I don't know, if he didn't talk
to you about it, I...

572
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,432
I waited for you.

573
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,719
I looked out the window for weeks
waiting on you to come home.

574
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:16,921
You don't say that you love somebody
and then just walk out like that.

575
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,634
Your father and I were going
to get married, Michelle.

576
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:25,471
But your father...

577
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:27,951
He...

578
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:32,645
What?

579
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,365
He was still seeing other women.

580
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:40,275
Even after we were engaged.
And I tried to work through it.

581
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,500
I loved him.

582
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:43,574
I still do.

583
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:46,992
But after your mother...

584
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,997
I don't think your father could ever
commit like that again.

585
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,950
And that wasn't something
I could live with.

586
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:02,527
Maybe because he knew
that you weren't good enough.

587
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,722
Maybe he was just waiting
for the right woman.

588
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,210
Maybe.

589
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,515
I'm...

590
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,226
I'm sorry I brought it up.

591
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,494
I never stopped thinking
about you, Michelle.

592
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:30,393
- And if there's anything I...
- I don't need anything from you.

593
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:31,518
Just go.

594
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,954
Leave me alone.

595
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,327
Go!

596
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,250
So what did Michelle say to you?

597
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,735
She said that, uh,
I wasn't good enough for her father

598
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,953
and that was why he saw other women.

599
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,164
- Welton cheated on you?
- That's why I left.

600
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,429
Did that bother you?

601
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:18,681
Sweetie, how many times
do I have to tell you that

602
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:20,777
most people don't like
to be cheated on?

603
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,255
The only people who don't mind
have just given up.

604
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,762
Or are very, very rational

605
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:29,465
and above those archaic
notions of monogamy.

606
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,812
Right, yes, of course.

607
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm not quite evolved enough.

608
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,230
Excuse me, this is not
my area of expertise,

609
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,334
but if welton cheated on you,

610
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,189
he may have been cheating
on other women.

611
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,591
Probably was.

612
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,776
The only person he was ever
faithful to was Michelle.

613
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,915
There you go.

614
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,446
He was playing the field and
somebody probably nuked him for it.

615
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,149
Well, how do you know?
Because.

616
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:52,888
Despite the fact that I'd love to have
my legs wrapped around one right now,

617
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:54,537
men are awful.

618
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:01,293
- What'd I do?
- You're a man.

619
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:03,254
I have information.

620
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:04,840
Go ahead.

621
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,950
The ureic acid on the victim's clothing,
it's feline, but it's not tiger pee.

622
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:12,429
Sediment composition and ph level
suggest that it was from a lion.

623
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,276
Are you aware that lionesses
do all the hunting?

624
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,936
Yes, the males simply copulate
and eat what the females catch.

625
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,064
And when they get cranky,
they eat the cubs.

626
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:23,841
Men.

627
00:32:25,454 --> 00:32:26,986
Before I flee for my life,

628
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:30,552
the particles I found in the wounds
around the femoral artery,

629
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:32,950
the ones I thought might be mica?
They're scales.

630
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:35,655
- Hmm, fish?
- No, snake.

631
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,782
I can maybe have
a species by tomorrow.

632
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:39,999
You want to stay and have a drink?

633
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,291
Yeah. We hate men.

634
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,657
I'm going to go, now.

635
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,095
He does have a terrific ass.

636
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,557
Oh, perhaps that's why you're always
making him leave.

637
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:01,351
- No lions?
- None in the whole park.

638
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:02,477
There are tigers.

639
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:05,091
How much difference can there be
between lion urine and tiger urine?

640
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,090
There are no stripes in tiger urine.

641
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:09,820
- I didn't say there are.
- I know how much you love cartoons.

642
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,572
- Tom and jerry?
- Bugs and daffy.

643
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,739
All right, now,
this is the capybara enclosure.

644
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,203
Now, they use
crystallized lion urine

645
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,165
around the edges of this enclosure
to keep the capybaras inside.

646
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:22,666
Then, look at this.

647
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,679
The reptile shed.

648
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:27,835
Snakes!

649
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:30,507
What is that?

650
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:35,090
It's a snake hook. It's used
for picking them up,

651
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,756
but keeping them at a safe distance.

652
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,433
That hook could have severed
the artery and deposited

653
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,717
the snake scales
in the gouge in the femur.

654
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:44,855
So, he was killed around that
area with something like that thing.

655
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,398
That is very imprecise.

656
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:47,941
Works for me.

657
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,843
Angela?

658
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,447
Clark... Hello.

659
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,700
I would like you to meet my
romantic partner, Dr. Nora Oldhouse.

660
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,369
Hello, romantic partner.

661
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,979
Yes, we're romantically involved...
Together.

662
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,665
- She and I.
- Clark, she heard you.

663
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:05,315
Nora, these are not like
regular people.

664
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,753
It is best to be very,
very clear with them.

665
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,631
Nora is a tenured professor
of women's studies at Georgetown.

666
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,840
And a vegan.

667
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,926
Could you be any more
politically correct?

668
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,157
Or cute?

669
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:16,095
See?

670
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,514
See what she just did there?
I mean, it's harassment, baby.

671
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,225
We're in a monogamous relationship.
I need you to back up off me.

672
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,353
I understand you've recently decided
to be celibate, ms. Montenegro?

673
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,094
Uh, temporarily, yeah.

674
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,341
That can have some
physiological repercussions.

675
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,068
Tell me about it.
But unbelievable fantasies.

676
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,043
Did you know that women in the 19th
century would visit their physicians

677
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:36,031
for anxiety and hysteria?

678
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,618
And as treatment the doctor'd provide
manual sexual stimulation to the women

679
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,329
- and the subsequent orgasm...
- Oh, God! Nora, what are you doing?

680
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,540
I don't think
that my insurance covers that.

681
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,751
I'm just saying that these women weren't
getting what they need at home,

682
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,905
you understand?

683
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,964
In the absence of a sex partner,
there are other alternatives.

684
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,276
To me.
Alternatives to me.

685
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,041
- Vibrators, other sex toys.
- Oh, God, why am I here for this?

686
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,054
I don't need to be hearing this,
excuse me.

687
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:00,597
He's very sweet.

688
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,765
I know.

689
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:04,852
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too, thank you for the tip.

690
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:08,009
Hey, Dr. Oldhouse?

691
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,566
I wasn't wrong about clark, was I?

692
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,345
he's tightly wound, but...

693
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,115
Dynamite, Ms. Montenegro.

694
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:16,238
A briefcase bomb.

695
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,698
Tthat's what I thought.

696
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:19,713
Baby.

697
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,466
When I was talking with Ange
and Brennan last night about men,

698
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,626
it occurred to me that andrew probably
didn't change when it came to women.

699
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,899
It's been 10 years.

700
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:33,034
You think andrew was still
visiting the same place?

701
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,116
Andrew was set in his routines
and if I remember

702
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,654
Langston correctly,
this guy didn't miss a thing.

703
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,350
Hiya, Langston.

704
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:41,305
I know you.

705
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,556
It's been a while.

706
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:44,847
Three-zero-one.

707
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:47,144
Wednesday afternoons with Dr.
Welton.

708
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,188
Noisy afternoons.
You always left smiling.

709
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:52,345
- You were a nurse at the hospital.
- She was a doctor.

710
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,408
Okay, and now she's
a federal coroner.

711
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:57,569
So, a little respect,
okay, Rumpelstiltskin?

712
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:02,076
- Coroner, huh? Somebody die?
- Yeah, Langston, Dr. Welton.

713
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,424
My bet, jealous husband.

714
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,747
Or jealous ex, maybe.

715
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,885
You're wearing on me, sport.

716
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,919
I'm gonna guess that Andrew
kept coming to your motel after me.

717
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,462
Yeah, he kept coming.

718
00:36:13,848 --> 00:36:15,756
- With anyone special?
- I don't know her name.

719
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,096
Describe her then.

720
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,884
Good looking, like all of you.

721
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:21,637
Uh, tall.
He liked them tall.

722
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,705
Pretty face, sharp features.

723
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,015
And red hair.

724
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:26,780
Red hair?

725
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,025
- I have no idea what that is.
- That's the murder weapon.

726
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,920
The point of the hook taper
in a manner identical

727
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,807
to the fatal wounds we found

728
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:45,073
on the head of the femur
and the pelvic bone.

729
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:47,271
Plus, the curved nature
of the weapon resulted in...

730
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:48,539
Cortical splintering.

731
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,376
Dr. Brennan's people found that Dr.
Welton was struck between 2 and...

732
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,063
- Four times.
- Four times.

733
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:57,188
And then stabbed with this.
In the femoral artery.

734
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,008
Would you give us the clothes
you wore the night of the benefit?

735
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,062
If you had any evidence implicating
me, you'd have a warrant.

736
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:05,347
I believe I'll decline.

737
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,516
We know you had
an affair with Dr. Welton.

738
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,686
- Which means your husband is a suspect.
- We'd have to question him, too.

739
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:13,313
I don't appreciate your veiled
attempt at blackmail.

740
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,103
She thought that was veiled!

741
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:18,392
My position dictates
that any legal dealings

742
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:21,051
that concern me have to go through
the hospital's attorney.

743
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:22,823
I'm sure you understand.

744
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,033
Got her on the run, bones.

745
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,796
Hodgins found another way
to track the killer.

746
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:42,151
Angela's going through all the
digital photos from the benefit now.

747
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,417
You want to hear the details?

748
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:46,471
Not right now if you don't mind.

749
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:51,065
What's this?

750
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:54,130
When I left michelle 10 years ago,
I knew...

751
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:56,607
Andrew wouldn't say
what needed to be said so...

752
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,003
- You did it.
- No.

753
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,658
I didn't know what to say.

754
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:04,833
And she was so little
and I loved her so much.

755
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,998
And I haven't had
a child of my own, but...

756
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,662
I find it impossible
to believe anyone...

757
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,333
Anyone could love a child more.

758
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,901
But I had no place in her life
anymore so...

759
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:22,747
I had to...

760
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:25,788
you had to leave room in case Andrew

761
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:28,913
found someone else who
might help raise michelle.

762
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:34,041
I had this old salt and pepper set my
grandmother gave me before she died.

763
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,365
Fits together.

764
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,898
I kept this one and I gave Michelle
the other half.

765
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,691
And I told her that...

766
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,396
Whenever she looked at it
she should know

767
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,563
that at that exact moment,

768
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:46,490
I'd be thinking
of her and loving her.

769
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,826
- That is not strictly...
- I know, Dr. Brennan.

770
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,828
But I swear sometimes

771
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,449
I looked at my half and I knew
that little girl was missing me.

772
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:59,628
Perhaps you should take her in now.

773
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:01,672
What?

774
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,605
She's an orphan.

775
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,550
She's alone in the world.

776
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,168
She needs a parent.

777
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:10,722
Michelle stopped
loving me years ago.

778
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,291
But you never stopped loving her.

779
00:39:13,881 --> 00:39:15,231
She'll know that.

780
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,355
The Mohawk Indians
have a saying that

781
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,026
when a child falls in the rapids,
the one who rescues her

782
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,569
will share in her new life forever.

783
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,897
I assume that doesn't only apply
to a potential drowning victim.

784
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,865
I have to go help
angela find a snake.

785
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,442
Hodgins says the scales from the wound
didn't come from any snakes at the park.

786
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,787
So, we should look for bloody
clothing or snake skin.

787
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,801
Dr. Bailey is here but she's wearing
this white dress.

788
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,501
Well, that's late in the evening.

789
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:57,876
If she'd been the killer,
it would be covered in blood.

790
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,986
- Oh, boy.
- A snake skin handbag.

791
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,893
Can you magnify that more?

792
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,951
- That is definitely torn.
- Could be from the murder weapon.

793
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,662
Can you pull back to see the person?

794
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,441
- It's nancy lauder.
- The nurse.

795
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:23,712
But her dress is black.
It wouldn't have shown blood.

796
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,679
We have a warrant
for a snakeskin handbag

797
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,227
and the dress you wore
to the fundraiser that night.

798
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,050
I burned the dress.

799
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:52,949
I was covered in blood.

800
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,328
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Dr. Andrew Welton.

801
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:57,942
I thought he'd change.

802
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,771
Yeah, you knew Dr. Welton was
having an affair with Dr. Bailey.

803
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,566
All those years.

804
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:04,068
I was always there for him.

805
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:05,837
If anyone knows how I felt,
it's you.

806
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,195
No, Nancy, we're not the same.
I left Andrew.

807
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,942
Why did she kill my father?

808
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:31,922
Yeah, I got it.

809
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:35,123
Your father was a good man,
Michelle.

810
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,067
I still carry him with me.

811
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,823
And he loved you.

812
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:43,424
We were both very lucky.

813
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,033
I miss him so much.

814
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,677
I want you to consider something.

815
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:56,054
You need a place to live now.

816
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:59,681
Yeah, um, my dad has some
kind of cousin in Chicago.

817
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,563
I...

818
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:07,795
would like you to come live with me.

819
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:43,821
Where are you going?

820
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:47,981
I thought...

821
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:18,497
