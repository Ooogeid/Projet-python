1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,155
Mom, it's snowing!

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:08,716
Are you jumping
on your bed again, Dylan?

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,016
Yeah, 'cause it's snowing!

4
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:13,266
Come make a snowman with me!

5
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,973
What have you done in here?

6
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:20,019
Sweetie, come here.

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,947
Oh, my God!

8
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:24,686
What's wrong?

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,938
It's not the good kind
of snow, honey.

10
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:54,888
Cool!
Dibs on the skull.

11
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:05,657
Who keeps this much junk?

12
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:09,610
Washington Capitals puck
from the '80s.

13
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,028
That's classic.

14
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:14,422
Victim is male...
in his 40s.

15
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,621
That's it?
That's all you got?

16
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:20,037
I mean, usually you have just a list
of specifics I don't even understand.

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,624
- I'm very distracted.
- I bet you are with all the junk here.

18
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,946
No, not that.

19
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,420
You probably heard
about the full set

20
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,755
of interspecies hominid remains
that were found

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,265
in the Maluku Islands.

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,885
- I missed that one. Where's Mypoopoo?
- Maluku. Indonesia.

23
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,806
Anyway, this could be a crucial link
in the evolutionary chain.

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,985
Could be huge, I bet. But what about
the 40-year-old dead guy here?

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,956
There are apparent perimortem injuries
to the temporal and parietal bones,

26
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,840
and the squamosal suture.

27
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:49,358
So, he got hit in the head?

28
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,447
Let's go see if what hit him
is upstairs.

29
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:53,487
And I'm keepin' the
puck, that's vintage.

30
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:56,365
I tried to get him to
clean up his place.

31
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,367
He wouldn't answer the door
and his phone.

32
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,550
It's clean by now.
His stuff came crashing

33
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:02,580
through the ceiling
of the downstairs apartment.

34
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,206
You know what'd be great?

35
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,333
If it didn't get out
that Murphy died in it.

36
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,335
Makes it tougher to rent.

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,213
A big hole in the floor probably
makes it less desirable, too.

38
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,972
- Not one of those guys.
- What guys?

39
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,097
A hoarder.

40
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,351
This is an anthropological
microcosm of this man's life.

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,305
How are we gonna find
any pertinent evidence in all this crap?

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,982
All this "crap" is evidence, Booth.

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,602
This is a little slice of heaven.

44
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:38,311
Cockroaches, fleas,

45
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:40,918
rat droppings, bat guano.

46
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,542
One of those guys.

47
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,302
I think I'll be happier
downstairs with the dead stuff.

48
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,001
Who could live in this stench?
Put on the fan there, will ya?

49
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,982
Sense of smell,
it's destroyed after awhile.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,175
Must be a survival mechanism.

51
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,000
In the Maluku Islands.
It's a remarkable find.

52
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,563
Better than upstairs?

53
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,921
Well, upstairs
can't really shed light

54
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:06,101
on the interspecies similarities
of human evolution.

55
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,742
Now this guy must've been dead
for a long time.

56
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,815
Maybe not.

57
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,427
Hodgins found so many
insects and rodents,

58
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,104
they could've cleaned
the flesh quite rapidly.

59
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,397
Anyway, remains were found
on the islands

60
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:20,699
which suggest <i>Homo floresienses</i>
may have mated

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,217
with early <i>Homo sapiens</i>.

62
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:24,678
I've been in touch
with the organizing committee.

63
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:25,545
Really?

64
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,332
That shouldn't cause surprise.
I'm an anthropologist.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,501
Who's been focusing
on murder lately.

66
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:31,591
Lately.

67
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,887
Down below.

68
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:35,798
You might want to check this out.

69
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,692
- Did you find more remains?
- Not exactly.

70
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,637
I did, however,
find 36 waffle irons.

71
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,430
No syrup though,
so what's the point?

72
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,599
Right.

73
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:46,757
Behold.

74
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,023
I'm thinking cause of death
might have something to do

75
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,316
with blood loss.

76
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,729
Bones - Season 5 Episode 22
"The Beginning in the End"

Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,

00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,603
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

79
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,902
There.
A place for everything,

80
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,288
and everything in its place.

81
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,732
The place for this guy's
flesh is on his bones,

82
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,697
not in the buggy bellies
of thousands of maggots.

83
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:48,579
Dental records confirm
that these are the remains

84
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,332
of Timothy Daniel Murphy, age 48.

85
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,167
You'll excuse me
if I'm a bit excited.

86
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,002
You've a thing for hoarders, do you?

87
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,197
Lord, no.

88
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:59,089
They make a little nauseous,
actually, but I have excellent control

89
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,461
of my gag reflex.

90
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,697
There are two sets
of parallel cleft wounds

91
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:05,596
to the parietal and temporal bones,

92
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,973
consistent with an attack
with some kind of blade.

93
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:10,495
Hacked to death, that would
explain all the blood.

94
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,479
- Weren't we talking about me?
- It always seems that way.

95
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:14,855
It's just...

96
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,734
I've been accepted to go
to the Maluku Islands!

97
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,778
Hearing loss, Ms. Wick.

98
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:22,696
That is excellent news.

99
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,949
That did not sound sincere.

100
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,331
If it weren't for that letter
of recommendation you wrote,

101
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:28,927
I would not've made the cut.

102
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,164
I had no idea that recommendation was
for the Maluku project.

103
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,529
But it was.
This is amazing.

104
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:37,460
I could be referenced
in research materials.

105
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,756
Daisy, you have
to stop making that noise.

106
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:45,008
Hacking suggests a crime of passion.

107
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:47,846
Any blade marks on the other bones?

108
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,688
Yes, Ms. Wick is
indeed very fortunate.

109
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,148
The Maluku anthropological team

110
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,943
could influence scientific
thought for many years.

111
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:05,026
Perhaps we could return
from the Maluku Islands

112
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,699
and focus on the murder?

113
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,204
Disposophobics.

114
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,590
What's that?

115
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,708
The psychiatric term
for those who hoard.

116
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,597
These photos indicate

117
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,295
that the victim was
a level five hoarder.

118
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:22,604
- Five out of ten?
- No, out of five.

119
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,675
Well, things are usually out of ten.

120
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,511
Well, they should be out of ten.

121
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,472
But level five is extremely severe.
You'd be classified as a level one.

122
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:31,598
Me?

123
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,976
I've seen your office, your apartment.
You cling.

124
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,105
I don't cling, OK?
I collect things. It's a big difference.

125
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,110
Level five disposophobic
might also be an agoraphobic,

126
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,639
which would limit his relationships

127
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,314
in the outside world.

128
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,026
You'd be dealing with
a very small pool of suspects.

129
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,521
- Why are you staring at that soldier?
- That's not a soldier.

130
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,764
That's a full bird colonel
in the U.S. Rangers.

131
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,596
And he's staring at me.

132
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:02,004
- I hope this is coincidental.
- Most definitely not, Master Sergeant.

133
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,923
No, I'm not a master sergeant.
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

134
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,185
- Why'd they send you?
- I told them you'd talk to me.

135
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,571
- So far, so good.
- I'm not talking to you.

136
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,696
This is me not talking to you.

137
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:17,772
We're losing men every day,
men who don't have to die

138
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,289
and wouldn't if you trained them.
Your country needs you.

139
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:23,091
Don't say that word.

140
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:25,166
I served my country, Colonel.

141
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,376
- Who's that guy?
- Do me a favor,

142
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,834
Just head back to the murder
victim's apartment, see if you can

143
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,613
pick out any psychological clues
from the garbage, okay?

144
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,843
Hello?

145
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Look at you, all squinted up.

146
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:00,229
Yeah, they didn't really
get me a pair that fits.

147
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,920
To be honest, I'm feeling
kind of pinched in my...

148
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,984
Those photographs did not lie.

149
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,987
So have you found
anything that points to the killer?

150
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,990
No, not unless he was trying
to hoard the hoarder's hoard.

151
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,197
There might have been something of value
in all this, right?

152
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:17,832
You think someone actually tried
to take something from here?

153
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,859
How would he even
know where to look?

154
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,585
Did I just see a snake?

155
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:26,380
<i>Thamnophis sirtalis.</i>
It's a common garter snake.

156
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,715
We're on the third floor.
How does he get in here?

157
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,969
Probably followed the bats, rats,
mice, squirrels, and fleas.

158
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,280
There's also extensive
termite damage,

159
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,391
which explains
why the entire floor fell

160
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,098
into the apartment below.

161
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:41,019
Four, five, six fans,

162
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,187
and there're air fresheners
hanging all over,

163
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,337
obviously there were
complaints by the neighbors.

164
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,996
Suspects. I mean, heck, wouldn't you
kill him if you lived next door to this?

165
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,115
Daisy said that the victim
was killed by a blade.

166
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,082
Hacked to death maybe.
This could be the murder weapon.

167
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,328
You can put it
over there with all the others.

168
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:05,460
Maybe all of these fell on
him and it was just an accident.

169
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,238
That wouldn't explain
the blood spatter.

170
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,427
This is going to be difficult because
everywhere you look, there's a weapon.

171
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,786
- What's wrong?
- He's back.

172
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,059
- Who's back?
- Angela's father.

173
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,483
Okay, I saw him down there.
You don't believe me, but I saw him.

174
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,609
No, I totally believe you.

175
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,903
The man carries a black cat
bone in his back pocket.

176
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:33,363
God help me.

177
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:36,092
Yeah, of course I got complaints.

178
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:38,577
And not just from his floor,
from the whole building,

179
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,542
from people passing
by on the street.

180
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:44,065
- Why didn't you just evict him?
- I tried and tried and tried.

181
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,684
Look, "eviction notice for cause,
to wit:

182
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,921
health, hygiene,
damage to the building."

183
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,571
Here's a summons and a complaint,

184
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,508
both of which Mr. Murphy ignored,

185
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:55,832
and multiple filings with
the health department,

186
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,472
including mold, mildew,
dust mites, vermin...

187
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,767
And there are snakes in the
apartment, Agent Booth. Snakes.

188
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,769
Why couldn't you have
turned off the heat?

189
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,230
Yeah, because that would be illegal.
He could sue me.

190
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,899
All this stuff must have made
you pretty desperate.

191
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:13,137
Yeah, I know you think I killed Murphy
to get him out of the apartment.

192
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,032
The building is rent-controlled.

193
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,950
You could have just kicked him out
and charged your new tenant double.

194
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,316
More like quadruple,

195
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,538
but I didn't kill him. I went through
the channels, which you can see...

196
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,209
These are the court filings
which Mr. Murphy ignored,

197
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,086
the last one filed three days ago.

198
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,171
You sure came prepared.

199
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,477
I got to pay
for the ceiling that collapsed.

200
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:36,093
I can't afford that and a lawyer.

201
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,759
What are you doing here?

202
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,430
Well, you asked me here
to compare notes on the murder.

203
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:23,348
Right. Yeah.

204
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:25,100
Who was that soldier?

205
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,853
Just an old army buddy of mine.

206
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,730
You didn't look like buddies.

207
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:31,815
What, you can tell stuff like that?

208
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,693
You've taught me to be more observant
of human interaction.

209
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:39,072
I can tell you're reluctant to be honest
about your real relationship with him.

210
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,322
Secretary of Defense?

211
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,626
They want you to go back
into the Army?

212
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:55,547
As a Sergeant Major?
I thought you were a Master Sergeant.

213
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,383
They're just trying to tempt me
with a promotion, but I'm not going.

214
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:02,233
This lists your commendations.
You were...

215
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:04,097
really good at being a soldier.

216
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:05,974
Why do they want you back?

217
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,936
They just think that my experience
as an FBI agent and a sniper

218
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,215
- in the first Gulf War...
- You could train soldiers in techniques

219
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,400
for tracking
and apprehending insurgents.

220
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,871
Well, I'm real happy

221
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:19,321
tracking and catching
murderers right here.

222
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,614
You could save lives.

223
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,492
Of course they say that. It's the Army.
That's what they want.

224
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,868
You don't think that?

225
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,162
Yeah, but I mean,
anyone would in that position.

226
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,747
Not everybody is as good as you.

227
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,106
I served my country, I have a kid here.
I got responsibilities, all right?

228
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:35,087
I'm not going to go to Afghanistan,
and you to the Makapoopoo Islands.

229
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,046
Maluku.

230
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,529
Right. Exactly.

231
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:39,869
You know what?
We have our jobs here, right?

232
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,816
Excuse me, Dr. Brennan.
If I could just have a moment.

233
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,557
And I'd like to preface
my statement with a caveat.

234
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:56,462
- Your unquestionable brilliance...
- What is it, Ms. Wick?

235
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,175
In your preliminary report,

236
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,050
you said the injuries
to the temporal and parietal bones

237
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:06,131
and squamosal suture
were inflicted at time of death.

238
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:07,536
That's correct.

239
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,178
"That" meaning what I said,
or "that" meaning what you said?

240
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,230
- I'll read what you wrote.
- That's not...

241
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:14,299
"There are apparent
perimortem injuries

242
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,753
to the temporal and parietal
bones and the squamosal suture."

243
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,380
That sounds correct.

244
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,384
How angry would you be
if it were not correct?

245
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,928
- You mean if I were wrong?
- I would never

246
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,097
state it in those kind
of bald terms.

247
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,682
Does inaccurate

248
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,988
sound better? No.

249
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,352
- Erroneous?
- What have you found?

250
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,982
You'll know instantly
when I point it out.

251
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,525
Here...

252
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,611
and here
under 40 times magnification.

253
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,904
Remodeling.

254
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,824
The wounds started to heal
before the victim died.

255
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,497
Which means we have
no clear cause of death.

256
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,912
And even after
your superlative recommendation,

257
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,330
I am stumped.

258
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:55,625
Please conduct
a histological study of the bones.

259
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,252
Yes, yes, of course.

260
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:00,422
May I ask why you want to do that?

261
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,091
There's something funny
about the way these bones feel.

262
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,010
Bones have a feel?

263
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,053
Touch them.

264
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,610
Compare them kinetically

265
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:10,825
to the thousands of other
bones you've examined.

266
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,225
Lighter.

267
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,352
My God, yes.

268
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,315
I wish you were coming to Maluku.

269
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,275
It seems odd

270
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,319
that you'd be missing something
so important.

271
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,112
The histological study, Ms. Wick.

272
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,407
The victim's apartment is like
an archaeological dig.

273
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:34,789
We should be able to put together
a picture of his life from his effects.

274
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,469
Now, Hodgins is dating
each pile of junk

275
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,249
according to insect larvae,

276
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:41,588
rat droppings
and the yellowing of the paper.

277
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,526
Apparently, he's been hoarding stuff
for about four years.

278
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,593
The oldest is where
he fell through the ceiling.

279
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,185
Hoarders often organize
their holdings

280
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,922
by category and value,

281
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,974
much like one would find
in a museum.

282
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,352
So he was curating garbage?

283
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,395
The term garbage is relative.

284
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,488
The only intrinsic value things have
is what we give them.

285
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,031
It seems odd now,

286
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,759
but in Holland,

287
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:06,367
tulip bulbs were once
as valuable as houses.

288
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:10,572
Maybe we all overvalue things
that are...

289
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:12,577
essentially worthless.

290
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,164
Well, that was more
than a comment on this case.

291
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:19,417
What's going on?

292
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,371
What separates what I do here
from what this man did?

293
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,093
So, going to Malulu is worth more?

294
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,275
Maluku.

295
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,264
The murders will never stop,

296
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,141
but this find has real,
finite value.

297
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,848
I'd be able to answer questions
about our origin,

298
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:39,093
evolutionary track.

299
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,356
It has implications
for history, science.

300
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:43,091
Listen,

301
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:45,567
you're allowed to make life changes
without

302
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,737
picking a fight with your old life.

303
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,300
But I need a break from that life.

304
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,368
I'm worried all the time.

305
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,080
Worried that Booth
might get hurt on a case,

306
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,942
and I couldn't prevent it,
worried...

307
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,167
about what our partnership means.

308
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,587
So you want to get away from Booth?

309
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,685
No. It's just...

310
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:10,040
I just need some perspective

311
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:12,857
so that I can view my life
with some objectivity.

312
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,390
Have you talked to him about it?

313
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:20,854
The Army wants Booth
to go to Afghanistan.

314
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,227
To train soldiers in
the apprehension of terrorists.

315
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,650
Is he going to go?

316
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,070
Even though he said he wasn't,
it felt like he wanted to.

317
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,365
Perhaps it's all for the best.

318
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,580
You two at opposite ends
of the world?

319
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,871
I don't think so.

320
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,108
We have work.

321
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,249
Traditionally, hoarders have

322
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,904
one section of possessions

323
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:45,003
that has a greater value
than the others.

324
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,639
We should be looking for that.

325
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,368
Where did you learn
how to throw a fast ball like that?

326
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,554
You were amazing.

327
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,307
- You taught me.
- No! No. I'm not that good.

328
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,267
Right? Yeah.

329
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,079
Dad?

330
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,854
Are you going back
to being a soldier?

331
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,857
Why are you asking me that?

332
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,652
Mom said the Army called our house,
looking for you.

333
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,525
I'm not in the Army anymore.

334
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:11,980
I'm out, okay?

335
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,825
I made a decision to stay with the FBI
to be with you all the time.

336
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,870
It's my fault?

337
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,831
- Is what your fault?
- It's my fault people are going to die?

338
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:24,376
That's not what I meant.

339
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,211
I want you to save lives.

340
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,004
Well, I do that here.

341
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,913
No, here, you catch people
that kill other people.

342
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,885
There, you would make it
so people won't die.

343
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,444
Isn't that better?

344
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,017
It was just a phone call, buddy.

345
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,560
That's all. It's over with.

346
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,404
I got an even better idea.

347
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,861
What do you say
we go get one of those huge,

348
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,275
giant, root beer floats
that you love

349
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,735
- so much?
- Sure.

350
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,800
All right. My kid.

351
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,520
Where are the Maluku Islands?

352
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,045
Formerly known as the Spice Islands,
indicating they smell very good.

353
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,756
There are earthquakes and
volcanoes, and a number

354
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
- of venomous creatures.
- What about our wedding?

355
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,511
We could elope
in the Maluku Islands.

356
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,514
What then?
What would I do there?

357
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,435
I know this isn't easy for you,
Lancelot.

358
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,838
But this is the biggest career
opportunity I've ever had,

359
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,875
and, like my mentor,
Dr. Temperance Brennan,

360
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,777
my career means everything to me.

361
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:34,779
Everything.

362
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,152
For now.

363
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,365
I know you're not exactly Mr. Adventure,
so this has to be difficult for you.

364
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,122
But this is
a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

365
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,666
I have to go.

366
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,877
For a year.

367
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:49,556
What?

368
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,297
If you do decide to follow me,

369
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,456
here's some literature
on the Maluku Islands.

370
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,217
You were a swimmer in college.

371
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,119
There seem to be
lucrative opportunities

372
00:18:58,244 --> 00:18:59,721
in the pearl-diving trade.

373
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,433
Hello.

374
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,811
<i>Special Agent Seeley Booth.</i>

375
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:21,785
Hey, Booth,

376
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,161
- <i>I found something.</i>
- What kind of something?

377
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:27,081
<i>It's accounting records
dated four years ago.</i>

378
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,584
They seem to have been
neatly put away.

379
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,577
What if the traumatic event

380
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,838
that turned him into a hoarder
was work-related?

381
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,432
<i>I mean, remember Enron? Madoff?</i>

382
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,821
<i>Those guys would've loved to
have killed their accountant.</i>

383
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,805
<i>I'm just saying, you never know</i>

384
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,603
<i>what secret lives people have
in their past. You know what I mean?</i>

385
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:44,966
Yeah, I do.

386
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,602
<i>All right, I'm going
to crate these up and I'll go ahead</i>

387
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:51,273
and send 'em over to you...
You hung up, didn't you?

388
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,729
Booth? Yeah, okay.

389
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,825
That wasn't a scream.
That was a yelp.

390
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,984
It's perfectly understandable.

391
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,232
This is a...

392
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:04,828
crime scene, so,
technically, no one should be here.

393
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,121
You're not afraid of me, are you?

394
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:08,685
You?

395
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,624
No.

396
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,793
Good.

397
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,813
So now that you're family,

398
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:17,006
I'm gonna have to go ahead here
and ask you for a favor.

399
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:18,856
Anything for family.

400
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:20,718
Dad.

401
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:27,772
I can't believe this.

402
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:30,213
Tim and I worked together
eight years.

403
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,209
The exciting world
of corporate accounting.

404
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,859
When was the last time you saw him?

405
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,825
He left the firm a year ago.

406
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,989
I haven't seen him since,
but we've talked on the phone, though.

407
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,991
Do you know anything
about these records?

408
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,909
There's nothing special about them.

409
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,079
It's simple receivables, cash receipts.
It's office supplies, mostly.

410
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,723
It's the kind of thing

411
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:52,125
that we take to the
recycling bin each quarter.

412
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,877
Which we found in Tim's apartment.

413
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,273
I'm sure.

414
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,199
See, this is where it started.

415
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,463
He'd take home stuff from the office.
It was garbage, really,

416
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,970
but he acted like it was gold
or something.

417
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,725
The signature on these documents...

418
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,059
It's mine, yes.

419
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:14,621
Wait, you're wondering if there's
some kind of crooked accounting here?

420
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,441
Like I might have a reason
to hurt Tim?

421
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,401
Kind of crossed my mind.

422
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,064
You can have any forensic
accountant look at these.

423
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,274
They're worthless.

424
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,324
Tim had problems, Agent Booth.

425
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,534
Yeah, the hoarding.
We know.

426
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:29,713
He was agoraphobic, too.

427
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,165
He wouldn't leave his apartment.
That's why he lost his job.

428
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,751
We tried an intervention,
a year ago, a bunch of us

429
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,284
from work, but he wouldn't
even let us in the apartment.

430
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:40,757
I told him he was going to smother
in all that junk.

431
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,759
But to him, it was treasure.

432
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,695
About a month ago, he said me a guy

433
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,014
offered him $50,000 for something.

434
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,098
For what?

435
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,741
I didn't take him seriously.
Tim was a very sick man.

436
00:21:57,472 --> 00:21:58,524
Starved to death?

437
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,072
Yes. Notice the demineralization,

438
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,344
particularly in the large bones.

439
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,616
But his place was full of food.
Not good food, but basic sustenance.

440
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,582
The histology report
shows decreased bone mass,

441
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,788
and a marked deficiency in calcium.

442
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,298
He starved to death.

443
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:14,958
- After being hacked?
- Yes.

444
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,961
That could take anywhere
from several days to a month.

445
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:21,673
So, after he was attacked,
he was somehow immobilized?

446
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:23,633
Based on insect activity,

447
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,510
Hodgins says he was

448
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,179
trapped under a collapsed pile
of his hoardings.

449
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,187
That's horrible.

450
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:31,432
My God!

451
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,267
I'm so excited.
I just heard the news.

452
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,269
- I could burst!
- What news?

453
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,481
Dr. Brennan has been asked
to head up the Maluku Island project!

454
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,297
Isn't that so exciting?
I just knew they were going to ask her!

455
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:49,018
Someone offered him $50,000?
For what?

456
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:52,328
She didn't say. Just said a guy
offered him 50 grand for something.

457
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,666
A disposophobic has a delusional regard
for the value of the things he hoards.

458
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,236
That's what Dr. Brennan said.

459
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:00,920
But she used anthropology speak
so it sounded more science-y.

460
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,507
The marks on this door here.
You're saying it's from termites?

461
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,101
Yeah, there's termite damage
all through this area.

462
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,679
I don't think so.

463
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,327
See this wood there?

464
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:13,224
That is splintered.

465
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,642
You're right.

466
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,878
Door was probably pried open.

467
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:19,856
So, a robbery, motive for murder.

468
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,152
Hoarder has an actual treasure,
somebody wants it, he won't sell,

469
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,695
he's robbed, murdered.
Yeah, it fits.

470
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,531
I don't think it's possible to tell
if anything got stolen from here.

471
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,452
So, Daisy's going to Indonesia.
She doesn't care if I go with her.

472
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,741
No offense, but you might be better off
without her.

473
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,587
Dr. Brennan will head up the expedition.
Will you be better off without her?

474
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,213
- Excuse me?
- Daisy told me.

475
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:46,424
No, Bones is not going anywhere.

476
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,009
If it's any consolation,

477
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,345
Angela's dad got cheated out of his car
in a card game with some bikers

478
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,098
- he wants me to steal it back.
- How's that any consolation?

479
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,144
<i>Travail d'amour, mes amis.</i>

480
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:57,977
The things we do for love.

481
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,647
You stay here, see if this guy's
got anything that's worth 50 grand.

482
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:06,871
I'll help you get that car back.

483
00:24:07,218 --> 00:24:08,246
Really?

484
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:09,831
You know why?

485
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,394
'Cause I'm Mr. Adventure.

486
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,148
I'd rather you were Mr. Sneaky
Killer Ninja Assassin,

487
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:17,009
but a guy can't be picky
in the sidekick market.

488
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:18,601
Nope.

489
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:22,762
The Raman spectroscope uses
lasers and light diffusion

490
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,829
to measure minute changes
in chemical composition.

491
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,686
This machine would be very
useful on the Maluku Islands.

492
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:30,885
I've already suggested it
to the organizers.

493
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,302
So you're coming?

494
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,503
Agent Booth and I are partners.

495
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:36,474
I have to discuss it with him first.

496
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,143
He's probably going to go be
a big hero in Afghanistan.

497
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,436
He doesn't wanna go.

498
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,814
Lance said that Booth
has the psyche of a true warrior.

499
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,034
That it's a miracle
he hasn't gone back long before this.

500
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,995
Maybe you're holding him back
the same way he's holding you back.

501
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,324
I shouldn't have said that.

502
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,920
But sometimes my mouth just
has a mouth of its own.

503
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,411
We have to determine

504
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,372
the precise day the
victim was struck.

505
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:01,290
The day of attack,

506
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,149
not the day of death.

507
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:05,795
How?

508
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,631
I want you to measure
the amount of remodeling

509
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,550
that occurred since the attack.

510
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:12,176
My God, that's genius.

511
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,414
You have to come to Maluku.

512
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,191
You don't want me being honored
by the anthropologistswithout you?

513
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,024
Remodeling, Ms. Wick.

514
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,616
Okay, what I did was modify
my mass-recognition program,

515
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:27,692
patent pending,

516
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,683
<i>to scan the photographic
reconstruction of the crime scene</i>

517
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,572
<i>to find areas</i>

518
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,341
<i>of comparatively less chaos.</i>

519
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,324
Awesome.

520
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,951
<i>You understand what she's saying?</i>

521
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,212
Not in the least,
but I'm so turned on by her brain.

522
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,416
- I'd like to see her brain naked.
- It's a terrible image.

523
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,667
It's just terrible.

524
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,377
Sweets, you'll understand this.

525
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,006
We have a hoarder.

526
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,876
We also have a possible intruder.

527
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,966
The intruder comes in
to look for something.

528
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,749
- Okay. Stacks of...
- Crap.

529
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,804
... crap grow organically, in a way.

530
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,306
<i>But if someone came in</i>

531
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,099
and disturbed the hoarder's system,

532
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,310
<i>then put everything back,
it would look different.</i>

533
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,498
- It doesn't look different.
- It does to my program.

534
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:07,883
There.

535
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:09,358
Now somebody,

536
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,953
not the victim,
rearranged that pile.

537
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,704
<i>Wait.</i> Where?

538
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,902
<i>So you're going
to go towards the window.</i>

539
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:18,594
Window.

540
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,416
Now turn right.

541
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,387
Right.

542
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:29,652
You're getting warmer.

543
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,968
Warmer.
To the left.

544
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:37,053
Okay, there.
There.

545
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,140
<i>Does anything</i> look strange?
Anything missing?

546
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,183
Yes.

547
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,685
There are silverfish eggs here.

548
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,356
So something was on top of these eggs
that prevented them from hatching.

549
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,700
I'll take some samples and
figure out exactly what it was.

550
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,406
So, Bones, here we are.
What's all the mystery about?

551
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,950
I've been offered the chance to
head up the Maluku Island project.

552
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,075
I heard.

553
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:04,789
Daisy told Sweets
and Sweets told me.

554
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,165
I'd like to accept.

555
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,891
I thought you already had.

556
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,635
We've been partners for five years.

557
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I wouldn't make that decision
without you.

558
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,513
You don't need my permission.
Okay, it's cool.

559
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,708
You say that, but you
won't look at me.

560
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:26,555
You're the one who taught me
the value of making eye contact.

561
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:29,271
So, please...?

562
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:33,686
Sorry.

563
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:39,490
I don't do really good
with change, I guess.

564
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,786
- You're better than I am.
- The pyramids are better at change

565
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,102
than you are.

566
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,248
It was a joke.
I was being affectionate.

567
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:53,045
- Will you go back to the Army?
- It's what's best for me right now.

568
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:55,754
- I'll only be gone for a year.
- Me, too.

569
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,633
So, what's a year?

570
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,095
It's the time it takes the Earth to
make a full revolution around the sun.

571
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,316
In the scheme of things.
You know, the grand scheme.

572
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,933
Just saying, a year is just...

573
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:07,310
it's not too bad.

574
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:08,827
- Right?
- Right.

575
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,316
We come back, pick up where we left off.
Nothing really has to change.

576
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:15,490
No, things have to change.

577
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,266
You know what?
I taught you about eye contact,

578
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,268
you taught me about evolution.

579
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:25,889
Here's to change.

580
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,067
To change.

581
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:38,217
So, here's what you got so far:

582
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:40,654
A crazy hoarder got knocked down,

583
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:42,838
buried alive under his own
hoardings,

584
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:45,446
by a robber who stole something
that maybe killed bugs,

585
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,610
then the hoarder died
a little while later,

586
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:50,157
then fell through the ceiling
of the apartment downstairs.

587
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:53,100
- It sounds better in my report.
- Which raises the question:

588
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:56,400
you usually add a little spice to your
reports when you know your case is weak.

589
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,166
- There was no question in there.
- It was implied.

590
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,569
Connect the dots.

591
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:14,210
Aren't you a little old
to go off wars?

592
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:17,482
I'm not going to fight.
I'm going to be training soldiers to

593
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:19,465
investigate, pursue and detain.

594
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:24,136
I guess that answers my next question
as to whether or not you intend to go.

595
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,558
- What about your partner?
- She's going to Indonesia.

596
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,459
Maybe it's time to find another,

597
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,728
FBI guy and a forensic
anthropologist.

598
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,497
Yes, on account
you're both so replaceable.

599
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:38,442
You gotta act like a big boy
on this one.

600
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,987
- You don't want me to go?
- You go, you stay, that's up to you.

601
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,407
But before you go,
you clear this case,

602
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:47,292
not just dress up nothing
in a nice report.

603
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:55,061
I took the unhatched silverfish
eggs,

604
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:57,446
made a milkshake,
and ran it through the mass-spec.

605
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:00,928
- To find out what poisoned them?
- Not poisoned, but rendered infertile.

606
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:04,094
Oh, suggesting chemical
agents or radiation.

607
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,211
What I found were
phyllosilicate minerals,

608
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:08,998
along with some interesting
metal oxides,

609
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,305
very small traces of vitrified clay

610
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,360
and Uranium 235.

611
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,271
So, an atomic bomb?

612
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,327
No, something much more
interesting than that.

613
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:24,515
- An atomic gnome?
- Basically. Yeah.

614
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:28,659
This is the Fiestaware Christmas
Gnome, circa 1941.

615
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,828
Now, the uranium was
a common ingredient

616
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,988
in the glaze on these gnomes
until the Second World War,

617
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:37,460
when all production of the red
Fiestaware gnome was halted.

618
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:40,577
The victim claimed he possessed
something worth $50,000.

619
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:42,532
How much is the gnome worth?

620
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,552
$50,000.

621
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,228
We have our motive.

622
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,091
Now we just have to find the person

623
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,190
who collects radioactive Hobbits.

624
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,980
Mr. Adventure's here,
ready to kick some biker ass.

625
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,851
Please don't explain.

626
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:15,561
- You sure this is the address?
- Yeah, absolutely sure.

627
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,842
- This is pretty extreme, man.
- Of course, I've got a father-in-law

628
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,560
that plays poker with bikers.

629
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,923
Is that his...

630
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,737
- You mind turning him around?
- Why?

631
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,025
Because he knows what you did?
And you don't like him

632
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,756
staring at you with his eyes?

633
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:43,651
- How do you even know that's mine?
- We found it in your basement.

634
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,152
Someone planted it there.

635
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,458
Why?

636
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,945
Because I'm a well-known aficionado

637
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,783
and purveyor of Fiestaware.

638
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,826
So, the phone records indicate

639
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,332
that you called Mr. Murphy
several times

640
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,945
during the days
leading up to his death.

641
00:31:58,244 --> 00:32:00,186
Someone on the Fiesta message board

642
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:02,244
mentioned Murphy scored
the mother lode

643
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:03,952
at a flea market few years back.

644
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:07,466
He only bought it for 12 bucks.
I was trying to see if he'd sell.

645
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,633
Last time you contacted
him was on April 29...

646
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,597
the day he was assaulted...
You have an alibi for that?

647
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,155
I went to talk to him.

648
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,442
I was going to give him 50 grand.

649
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,625
I mean, he didn't even
appreciate the gnome.

650
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,371
- He was insane.
- So what...

651
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,358
you attack him with a kitchen knife?

652
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,860
No.
No, he saw.

653
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,281
I pushed the guy,
and I took the gnome, that's all.

654
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:32,616
You expect him to answer, Rocky?

655
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,437
He already did.

656
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,371
He says, "Shut up and get a lawyer".

657
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:39,461
Smart.

658
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,627
Smart gnome.

659
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,313
I need more.

660
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,271
Come on, we got this guy.

661
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,055
Cause of death, means,
motive, opportunity.

662
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,992
What caused the hacks to the skull?

663
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:51,727
- We don't know.
- He died of starvation.

664
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,598
The assault caused him to starve. Still
manslaughter. Which will get tossed

665
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,433
if all I have in court is this.

666
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,102
If it's gonna be your last case,
then do it properly.

667
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,271
- It's not our last case.
- We'll be back.

668
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,521
Tight as a drum, that's what I want.

669
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:07,109
And trust methe way you two
are running from each other,

670
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,945
you'd better be damn sure of
these little trips you're taking.

671
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,846
If Angela was going
to the Maluku Islands, I'd go.

672
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,554
Even if it meant
you becoming a pearl diver?

673
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,709
Even if it meant my
having to listen to Daisy.

674
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,742
So, what, I should just go?

675
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:33,922
I should just give up
my career and my life

676
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:36,508
and my friends and my practice,
and go to Indonesia?

677
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,909
I'm about to risk dismemberment just
to impress my scary father-in-law.

678
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:42,601
- How are you going to past the dogs?
- I don't know.

679
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:44,769
- How are you going to start the car?
- I don't know.

680
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:47,304
- Andget the car through the gate?
- I don't know.

681
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:50,723
- And evade the angry bikers?
- I haven't got a clue.

682
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,644
Good plan.
What do I do?

683
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,916
Survive and tell the
story of my love.

684
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:58,599
- This wall is high.
- Nah. No problemo.

685
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,118
Are you okay?
What happened?

686
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:04,823
Just gravity.

687
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:09,505
Dogs at 3:00.

688
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,746
A test? Really?

689
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,479
- You could have done this yourself.
- Sure I could,

690
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,043
but family's about doing things
together.

691
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,754
So, you sicced dogs on me
for nothing?

692
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,174
Well, not exactly,
but we should really get going.

693
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,386
For real?
Okay, yeah.

694
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,769
What do I do?

695
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,396
It's been my experience,

696
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,022
if you drive at 'em, people

697
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,466
clear out the way.

698
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:19,116
The gate!
What about the gate?

699
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,980
- It was built to keep people out.
- They are so gonna chase us.

700
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,812
Lock the gate!

701
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,420
You been here all night?

702
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,229
Is it morning?

703
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,397
Yes.

704
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:53,484
- I've been here all night.
- You find anything new?

705
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,652
Yes. These marks

706
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,947
weren't caused
by a hatchet or a knife.

707
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:01,788
The direction of force is opposite
to the direction of impact.

708
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,994
- What would do that?
- A propeller.

709
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:06,369
So, he walked into a plane?

710
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,101
No. A fan.

711
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,250
The crime scene is full of fans.

712
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,548
Are you really leaving
the Jeffersonian?

713
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,467
Yes. For a year.

714
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:21,686
I can provide you with a list
of forensic anthropologists

715
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,180
who can do this job.

716
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,784
No, Dr. Brennan.

717
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:28,663
You can provide me with a list
of forensic anthropologists.

718
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:32,356
I don't know what that means.

719
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,219
I think we got all the fans.

720
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:54,487
I really am sorry
about leaving you there.

721
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:55,887
No problem.

722
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,025
Mr. Adventure can
take care of himself.

723
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,061
Plus, Daisy rewarded me

724
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:01,639
handsomely for my bravery.

725
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,239
Dude.

726
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,847
Yes, I am the dude.

727
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:06,914
- She still going?
- Yeah.

728
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:12,195
Angela's program recognized this

729
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,152
as the o area of the apartment
that was the most cared for.

730
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,359
These are an escape valve for him,

731
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,779
images of a life outside of here
where he wasn't tourmented by his

732
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,656
compulsion and agoraphobia.

733
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,763
We found your fingerprints
on the fan.

734
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,380
I was in love with Tim.

735
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,264
When was the last time
you guys were together?

736
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:45,888
Over a year.

737
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,266
I thought if I could just
get him out of that apartment,

738
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:51,691
maybe if the sun hit his face,

739
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,229
he would change and we could have

740
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,016
a real life, so...

741
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,317
so I pulled him to the window...

742
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,319
and I ripped down the curtain,

743
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,404
and he lost it.

744
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,697
You two fought?

745
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:05,612
He attacked me,

746
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,809
so I pushed the fan at him,
and I ran away.

747
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,676
But I didn't think I killed him.

748
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:14,944
I loved him, but...

749
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:17,965
there was nothing I could do.

750
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,209
Well, that's that, then.

751
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:26,094
They're free to go.

752
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:29,589
You don't think this success might
make them change their minds?

753
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,046
You know what?

754
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,280
You're a nice kid,

755
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,765
but today is a good day
for you to grow the hell up.

756
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,462
You're giving him the car?

757
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:47,542
Oh, no, honey.
I'm giving him you.

758
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:51,286
The car is just a little something
to remember his new dad.

759
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,351
Welcome to the family, son.

760
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:01,074
That is one weird, scary dude.

761
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,901
So Brennan's going
to Indonesia with Daisy.

762
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,701
Not talking about that.

763
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:14,355
Sweets and Daisy...
they're gonna break up.

764
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,844
Not talking about that, either.

765
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,398
Booth is going to Afghanistan.

766
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:22,651
- Not gonna touch that one.
- You and I will be

767
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,871
staying here.

768
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,051
We...

769
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:27,864
are not.

770
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:30,492
Really?
And where are we going?

771
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>Nous allons à Paris.</i>

772
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:35,622
- For our honeymoon?
- No. For a year.

773
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,374
Because I have no desire

774
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,335
to break in a new anthropologist
and an FBI agent, do you?

775
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:41,883
No.

776
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:43,641
I do not.

777
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,994
Everything's changing.

778
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,274
- What do you think's going to happen?
- Not sure.

779
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,452
But I do know that
we'll be together.

780
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:56,643
Ready?

781
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:08,571
- Lancelot, do you hate me?
- No, Daisy. No.

782
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:16,404
Do you think you'll wait for me?
That would be really romantic.

783
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:19,111
I don't think so.

784
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:21,626
I don't think
you should wait for me, either.

785
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:27,382
I've really enjoyed working
for you, Dr. Brennan.

786
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,843
In fact, Dr. Saroyan,
I worked for you.

787
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:31,855
We both know better.

788
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:38,685
I made you this chart
of all the poisonous

789
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,645
reptiles and insects,
what they look like,

790
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,564
how to avoid them, and what to do

791
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,275
if you get stung or bitten, so...

792
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,106
Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.

793
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:48,392
I love you, too.

794
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:52,365
Booth informed me
that the proffering

795
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,230
of overly solicitous advice
is indicative of love.

796
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,357
I hope you find something that

797
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:11,051
just changes the entire notion
of what it means to be human.

798
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,844
I will.

799
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:19,226
- Dr. Brennan, we really have to go.
- Yes.

800
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:34,384
Dr. Brennan?

801
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,736
Oh, my God.

802
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:43,685
Sorry.
Couldn't get a pass.

803
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,419
I had to sneak off the base
to come say good-bye.

804
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,442
Listen, Bones,

805
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:52,968
you got to be really careful
in that Indonesian jungle, okay?

806
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:56,490
Booth, in a week,
you're going to a war zone.

807
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:00,392
Please don't be a hero.

808
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:03,904
Please just...

809
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:06,529
don't be you.

810
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,319
One year from today, we meet

811
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,227
at the reflecting pool on the mall.

812
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,720
- Right by the...
- Coffee cart.

813
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:27,781
I know.

814
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:30,346
One year from today.

815
