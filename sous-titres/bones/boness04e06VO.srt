1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,716
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

2
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:13,544
Six, please.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,101
He got it.

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,435
Somebody already pushed it.

5
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,854
Sorry about that.

6
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:29,897
Is our coffee machine still broken?

7
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:32,327
It was on Friday,
and I couldn't chance it.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,496
Well, I filled out a 1612 Repair

9
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:37,957
Authorization for office equipment
under $200, but I never heard back.

10
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:40,514
Man, this guitar is bitchin'.

11
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,073
Sorry.

12
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,367
Excuse me.

13
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,587
How's the third quarter P&L?

14
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:53,488
I processed a stack of orders
and returns with Patty on Friday.

15
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:55,810
She was still reviewing them
when I left.

16
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,300
Oh, my God, what's going on?

17
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,732
The conscious mind

18
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,685
represents only
one-sixth of our brain's activity.

19
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:41,788
Now, I want you to both appreciate

20
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:45,442
the power of the subconscious
and our quest for its secrets...

21
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:46,523
Stop!

22
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:51,144
Dr. Brennan, you can't dismiss over a
hundred years of psychological research.

23
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,857
I'm not even actually listening.

24
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:55,661
Your leg has not stopped
moving since we started this session.

25
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,287
Something you should have noticed.

26
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,523
I assumed he was anxious to leave,
as he is every session.

27
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,282
Yeah, well, that's not it.

28
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,337
Okay, a guy at work, Special Agent
Graham Kelton died last week.

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,882
I'm so sorry.

30
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,009
That's awful, Booth.
Were you good friends?

31
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,342
No, he was a creep.

32
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,806
So, then your agitation
comes from...?

33
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,799
Kelton had the best desk chair
in the office building, all right?

34
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,396
Lumbar support, cushioned arms,
Macintosh oak finish.

35
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:25,461
- And?
- And I want it.

36
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,830
I put a request in,
but so have all the other agents.

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,314
This is one sweet chair.

38
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:32,655
You are anxious that
you won't get a dead man's chair?

39
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,999
Right.
Mine, it won't even recline anymore.

40
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,227
Get this: Charlie Baron, okay,

41
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,595
he'd been putting a request
in to Human Resources

42
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:42,290
even when Kelton
was on his deathbed.

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,548
All right? Is that low or what?

44
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:48,464
Bones, maybe you can write me a doctor's
note saying that I need the chair.

45
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,507
- What?
- Yeah, something along the lines,

46
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,501
that I got, like, a bad back,

47
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,493
and the extra lumbar support
could enhance my job performance.

48
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:57,413
I'm not a medical doctor.

49
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,563
The answer's no.

50
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,364
You're obviously trying
to enhance your status

51
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,524
with your coworkers by acquiring
something that they all covet.

52
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:10,485
- You want a throne.
- Back support, okay?

53
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,903
I'm just looking for
a little back support.

54
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:15,865
Perhaps you've been feeling
inadequate at work lately.

55
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,731
- Compensating in this...
- Booth.

56
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:18,993
Right. Be right there.

57
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:20,954
Well, got a case. See ya.

58
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,873
Agent Booth, I really think that
we're touching on something important...

59
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,166
Thank you.

60
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,743
If I could help you
get a better chair, I would.

61
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:38,179
Thank you, but if I wanted a better
office chair, I'd just buy one myself.

62
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,371
No, no, that's not
how it works, Bones.

63
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,218
When you work for The Man,
he buys all the office furniture.

64
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,589
Which man?

65
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,825
You're kidding me, right?
There's no actual man.

66
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,158
Then who buys the office furniture?

67
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,143
Never mind, Bones. Just never mind.

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,613
- Excuse us.
- Sorry. So sorry.

69
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,538
Coming through. That's it.
Watch out.

70
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,639
Look at that.

71
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,655
Hey, Cam, you're a real doctor.

72
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,639
Maybe you could, do a pal a favor

73
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,332
and write me a note for my back.

74
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,820
- The chair?
- Yeah,

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,011
this is a chance
for you to be, creative.

76
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,577
- Tell us about the leg.
- Given the pump, female victim.

77
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:16,017
The skin elasticity,
what's left of it,

78
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,678
indicates she was probably
between 20 and 40 years old.

79
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,931
Striations on the bone suggests
the flesh was scraped away.

80
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,851
And the remaining soft tissue
appears to have been scavenged.

81
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,271
What are you thinking?
A little respect.

82
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,479
I wasn't taking a photo of the leg.

83
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,472
I was taking her picture.

84
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,409
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen in the elevator.

85
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,447
Back up there.
Take-take him out of here.

86
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:38,656
Take care of him.

87
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,382
Did you find anything
besides the leg?

88
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:50,732
The remains are smeared along
the entire length of the hoistway.

89
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,161
God, that,

90
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,736
that's nasty.

91
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:01,378
I'm gonna need a spatula
to scrape off all the

92
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,972
flesh and the organs.

93
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:06,088
The bones are in hundreds of pieces.
I want them bagged.

94
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:10,683
Judging from the amount of putrefactive
liquid on top of the car,

95
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:14,023
she landed here first,
wedging up against the shaft.

96
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,860
So when it went up and down, she...

97
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,740
Oh, that's not good.
That's bad. That's not good.

98
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,742
I don't see any hemorrhagic tissue.

99
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,466
Victim was most likely dead
before she was put in here.

100
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,623
Well, fracturing indicates
she was dropped from quite a height.

101
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,526
It's the machine room. It has
the control system for the elevator.

102
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,632
- Who has access to this room?
- Only maintenance,

103
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,354
but they only unlock it
when the elevator is serviced.

104
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:45,076
Lock's been jimmied.

105
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,713
I don't know how this happened.
I run a safe building.

106
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,852
Right,
except for the mangled dead woman.

107
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,993
It's the first unit.

108
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,399
Those cables raise
and lower the cars.

109
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:56,733
Look at this.

110
00:05:57,985 --> 00:05:58,866
Okay.

111
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:02,225
So you think the, victim's body
could have been, you know,

112
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:03,644
pushed down there?

113
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,909
It's pretty small.

114
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,162
But I've seen bodies carried down
storm drains narrower than that.

115
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,144
Who tries to hide a body
by throwing it down an elevator shaft?

116
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,751
Someone who is toasted.

117
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:17,254
A joint.

118
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,314
I can get DNA from the paper.

119
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:22,218
Marijuana doesn't make you a killer.

120
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,303
Yeah, well, it makes you stupid.

121
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,583
Stupid enough to jam someone
down an elevator shaft?

122
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,690
Bones - Season 04 Episode 06
"The Crank in the Shaft"

123
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,444
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,341
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

125
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,116
Sad.

126
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,848
Woman's whole life reduced to
a bunch of glorified sandwich bags.

127
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:12,143
Not the woman's life, Fisher,
just her body. Big difference.

128
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,978
Whatever gets you through the day.

129
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,863
What have we got?

130
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,367
Her clothes are shredded
and covered in particulates.

131
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,452
Still sorting through it all.
I'm pulling traces

132
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,070
to run through the GC Mass Spec.

133
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,815
Well, I've got the when.

134
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,173
Vitreous humor from an eyeball

135
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:30,161
confirms time of death sometime between
Friday night and Saturday morning.

136
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,483
And her final meal

137
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:35,917
was lettuce,
yogurt, chicken and pita.

138
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:37,710
- A gyro.
- Most likely.

139
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,158
I've got them checking
Greek restaurants in the neighborhood.

140
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:42,531
Maybe someone
made a delivery to her office.

141
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,612
Dead before the fall.

142
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,329
Wish we knew how she died.

143
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,929
Tox screen came back negative.

144
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,601
No drugs, no poison,
not even caffeine.

145
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,008
So, ball's in your court, Fisher.

146
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,030
Dr. Brennan left me with exactly

147
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,621
1,263 bone fragments,

148
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:01,294
each one screaming pain,
violence and hopelessness.

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,277
So how about cutting me
a little slack?

150
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,905
The job gets easier
with time, Mr. Fisher.

151
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,075
Any leads on who she is?

152
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:12,024
The hot chick is doing a sketch
from the few pieces of skull

153
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,656
I could locate and reconstruct.

154
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:14,664
Hot chick?

155
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:15,696
Sorry.

156
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:17,334
The other hot chick.

157
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,539
It's a bow.

158
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,072
With hair.

159
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,212
It's brown.

160
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,137
Natural colors.

161
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,973
Might help Angela with her sketch.

162
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,347
Right.

163
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,402
You should give it to her.

164
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:39,085
- I'm kind of busy.
- And I'm kind of your boss.

165
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,442
Anything else, Mr. Fisher?

166
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,814
I also found hairline impact fissures
on the lateral epicondyle.

167
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,112
And?

168
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,213
My grad thesis explored
the effect of falls on human bone.

169
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,167
I got the idea at my summer job.

170
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,678
I'm afraid to ask.

171
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,336
Suicide hotline.

172
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:03,717
Were you...

173
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,548
For or against?

174
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,941
Hey, got a bow for you.

175
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,757
Look, Hodgins,

176
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:20,507
we both decided it's over.

177
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,062
I don't want any gifts.

178
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,901
The bow's from the victim.

179
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:27,296
Right.

180
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:30,781
Sorry.
That's helpful, that bow.

181
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,165
How's it coming?

182
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:35,912
Well, according to my sketch,
the victim was a model for Picasso.

183
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:37,747
Like it.

184
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,583
Mr. Cheerful's putting
more pieces together for me.

185
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:42,073
That's a good idea.

186
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,373
Just so you know, I'm cool.

187
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,816
You and I, we work together,
and... and that's it.

188
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,130
Great.

189
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,276
- We're two professionals.
- Yep, two professionals.

190
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,351
I should finish this,'cause this is...

191
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,268
Yeah, you know,
and I've got lots to do.

192
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,173
I mean, lots. So...

193
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:03,490
Okay.

194
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:05,220
Okay.

195
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:10,270
From the impact fissures, I'd estimate
her fall was from at least 60 meters.

196
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,304
Okay, first of all,
I doubt even Dr. Brennan

197
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,808
could discover that
from impact fissures alone.

198
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,079
My thesis got me here. Ask her.

199
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,482
And second, that doesn't indicate
what floor she fell from

200
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,246
'cause the elevator car could have been

201
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,374
on any floor in the building
when she landed on it.

202
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:28,204
But since it's a 16-story building,
at about 10 feet per floor...

203
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:30,304
11 or 12, if you count
the space between floors.

204
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,688
Right. That's 252 feet.

205
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,416
That gives us 76.8 meters,

206
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,347
a difference of about 17 meters.

207
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,641
- That's...
- 52 feet.

208
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,861
Meaning she had to fall
from the top floor

209
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,437
or the machine room above it.

210
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:44,272
Very impressive, Mr. Fisher.

211
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:46,662
Well,

212
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,729
I'll still wind up like her one day.

213
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,492
You ever think of finding
a girlfriend, Mr. Fisher?

214
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:53,900
I've got one.

215
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:57,531
Jill.

216
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,485
She's very beautiful.

217
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:00,603
Yes.

218
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:02,206
Now.

219
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,809
Patty Hoyle, she's one of the people
who didn't check into the building.

220
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,348
oAngela's sketch matches
the picture on her ID card.

221
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:17,022
So Cam is actually going to write you
a letter so you can get the chair?

222
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,286
That's right. She understands
how the game is played.

223
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,193
She worked for the same man as you.

224
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,772
- That's right.
- The man who doesn't exist.

225
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,873
Can you imagine working
in a place like this?

226
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,790
No. It's not sterile, and there's
no room for diagnostic equipment

227
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,503
or sufficient bone storage.

228
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:35,448
Bones, I meant the little cubicles.
Look, they look like caged animals.

229
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,842
Throughout history,

230
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,369
you can find examples of human beings
adapting to virtually any environment.

231
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,913
- Like you and the chair.
- Me? You're way off base.

232
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,643
Ziff-Young. Hold the line, please.

233
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,427
Ziff-Young. Hold the line, please.

234
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,651
Ziff-Young. Hold the line, please.
Ziff-Young. Hold the line, please.

235
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,901
- Thank you.
- Did you find out who it was?

236
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,726
The whole building's been wondering.
I was there, you know, in the elevator.

237
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,635
- It was horrible.
- Slow down, okay?

238
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,724
Did this woman show up to work?

239
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,920
Oh, Patty.

240
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:05,061
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Patty?
Really? It's Patty, Chip.

241
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,730
- It was Patty in the elevator.
- Oh, man.

242
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,005
We still have to verify identity
with dental records.

243
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,818
Hey, everybody!
In the elevator? It was Patty.

244
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,142
No, not Patty.

245
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:15,279
Pretty Patty?

246
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,849
- Could you just keep it quiet, please?
- What's going on?

247
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,414
What about Patty?

248
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,220
This is Patty's area
right over here.

249
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,206
Patty decorated the place herself.

250
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,749
Even painted the frogs.

251
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,911
- A lot of frogs.
- She was that kind of person.

252
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:32,042
One who adjusted
to an impersonal workplace.

253
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,136
Nice chair.

254
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:37,927
We're gonna have
to look in her computer.

255
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,559
Whatever you need.
It's all company property.

256
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,098
I can get you the password.

257
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,673
So you last saw her on Friday?

258
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,028
She was still here
when I left, yeah.

259
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,228
Working late as usual.
She... she was

260
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,110
the best office manager
you can imagine.

261
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,315
See? Booth?

262
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:54,026
Some people accept
their position as a drone.

263
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,156
Are you calling me a drone?

264
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,253
It's not a pejorative statement,

265
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,424
without the drones,
the hive would die.

266
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,787
- Anyone else work here late?
- Are you kidding?

267
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,578
When that clock hits 6:00,

268
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,874
it's like the running of the bulls,
especially on Friday.

269
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,418
Did Patty have any eneimes?

270
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,660
Well, we all have to break a few eggs
to make an omelet.

271
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,757
Do you know if she caught
any of your employees smoking marijuana?

272
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,628
Marijuana? No.

273
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:21,303
So, no history of drug use here?

274
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,318
Ted Russo

275
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:28,500
was arrested last year for smoking pot
at a concert in the park,

276
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,159
but he is a good worker.

277
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,606
He promised me
he hasn't touched the stuff since.

278
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,734
Ted?

279
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,015
Yeah?

280
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,195
What's up?

281
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:47,997
Ted, the leg found in the elevator?
It was Patty.

282
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,442
Oh, dude.

283
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,731
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan
would like to ask you a few questions.

284
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,286
Hi, Ted.

285
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:56,964
We found the remnants of a joint
in the room where

286
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,383
Patty could have been pushed
into the elevator shaft.

287
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,044
I don't smoke, man. Yeah, my eyes
look like this 'cause I have allergies.

288
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:07,349
We pulled DNA from the saliva
on the cigaretette paper.

289
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,744
Really?

290
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:11,270
And we can get a court order
to take a sample from you.

291
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:20,738
All right, sure.
I smoke a little weed. Wouldn't you?

292
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:24,298
Locked up in these veal pens all day,
you know, collating invoices.

293
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:26,852
I'm an artist, man.
But my dad cut me off, so

294
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:29,064
without this place
I'd starve to death.

295
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,121
What happened, Ted?
Patty catch you?

296
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,427
Threaten to fire you
and you killed her?

297
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,237
Ted, if you think
these cubicles are small,

298
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:39,006
wait till
you see the inside of a cell, pal.

299
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:50,097
How many times do I have to say it?
I didn't kill Patty.

300
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,072
- Would you call her a friend?
- She was the office manager, man.

301
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,141
Eyes always on me, you know?

302
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,275
"Why are you using
so many envelopes, Russo?"

303
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,171
"Gee, like, maybe 'cause
I'm sending out letters?"

304
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:02,780
But I didn't kill her.

305
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,735
Did you think she was a bitch?

306
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,462
- What?
- Right there, you see that?

307
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,204
That's Patty's car. "Bitch."

308
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:13,359
- Is that an example of your artwork?
- No. I didn't do that.

309
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,035
We found your roach
in the elevator machine room,

310
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:18,787
where we also found
parts of Patty's body

311
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,756
crushed in the hoistway.

312
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,373
We found two weeks worth of invoices
that you hadn't completed.

313
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,711
Maybe Patty caught you,

314
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:28,305
you keyed her car

315
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:32,184
you went back to the machine room
for a quick toke and to chill,

316
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,844
Patty walks in on you,
she catches you, threatens your job...

317
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:37,058
You kill her.

318
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,775
Dude, you are so off base.

319
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,937
- Let me have your keys.
- Why?

320
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,371
Is that a "no," 'cause
I'll just go get a court order?

321
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:48,037
Oh, look at that.
Thanks for your cooperation.

322
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,853
That wasn't too hard.

323
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,627
The depressed intern
is quite clever.

324
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,505
His analysis of the impact fissures

325
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,748
supports Booth's theory
of where the body was dropped.

326
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:03,684
Great.

327
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:06,510
I don't know
how to act around Hodgins.

328
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,415
I beg your pardon?

329
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:11,392
We just ended a relationship
that was intense,

330
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,688
both emotionally and sexually.

331
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,537
Now rather than intense,
we're just...

332
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:17,855
Plain tense.

333
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:21,525
We don't look at each other,
everything is fraught with meaning.

334
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,801
Brennan,

335
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,572
you're supposed to say something.

336
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,824
Oh, I'm sorry.
What am I supposed to say?

337
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:31,155
Something
that will make me feel better.

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,233
Well, both Hodgins and you
mean a lot to me,

339
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:38,913
but since you're my best friend, I...

340
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,895
I guess I could fire Hodgins.

341
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,043
What? No.

342
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,623
I don't want you to fire him.

343
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,722
That's good, because
I would have disliked doing that.

344
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,002
Yeah, of course.

345
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,974
Thank you though for the offer.
It was... it was very sweet.

346
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,435
So I helped?

347
00:16:58,277 --> 00:16:59,688
Absolutely, sweetie.

348
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,685
Thank you, it was...

349
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:09,498
Cam?

350
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,160
Listen, I appreciate the doctor's note,
but you can't send it in.

351
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,861
Too late, that's just a copy.

352
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,012
This note,
it makes me sound like an invalid.

353
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,805
- You want the chair, don't you?
- No, I want to keep my job. Hello?

354
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,794
"Agent Booth suffers
from multi-level

355
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:26,033
"disc disease with
herniation of the L4-5 disc,

356
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,167
producing rad-i-cu-ular..."

357
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,374
Radicular.

358
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,905
"... radicular pain
in a sciatic distribution."

359
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,096
This letter is going to get me
a gurney, not a chair.

360
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,809
I'm a coroner. Tell them...
I confused you with a corpse.

361
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,935
Am I the only one
taking this seriously?

362
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,185
You are now.

363
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,229
You're welcome.

364
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:48,862
You look bummed.

365
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:50,137
What? No.

366
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:53,909
It's just... sometimes answers
pose more questions than they answer.

367
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,557
Thus the melancholy.

368
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,283
- Did you discover cause of death yet?
- Life, man.

369
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,260
Life is always the cause of death.

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,877
Okay, now you're just a tool.
Why are you here?

371
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,689
Well, I was hoping you could
maybe give me a little inspiration,

372
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,528
being a mentor and all.

373
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,741
All I have are facts, man.

374
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,651
Initial particulate analysis shows

375
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,687
a thin layer of styrene acrylate
copolymer on her sweater.

376
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,976
It's, copier toner.

377
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:22,021
She worked in an office. She probably
got dirty changing a cartridge.

378
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,815
She was an office manager
wearing a cashmere sweater.

379
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,641
I doubt changing the cartridge
was her responsibility,

380
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,113
not to mention, the toner dust
was all over her front and back.

381
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,668
Very cool.

382
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:36,201
She probably spent a little time
rolling around the copy room floor.

383
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,247
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

384
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,369
Yeah,
there were some stains on different

385
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,335
sweater fragments
consisting of hesperic acid,

386
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:48,547
ascorbic acid,
citrus sinensis, furfural,

387
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,966
proteolytic enzyme, alcohol,

388
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:54,019
triarylmethane dye,
AKA Brilliant Blue.

389
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,387
It's a food coloring.

390
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,848
Do you think the stain
is relevant to the case?

391
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:00,642
Before I answer that,
I need to know what it is.

392
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,789
I get it.

393
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,482
We live our lives in darkness,
hoping for a sun that seldom shines...

394
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:07,691
Go away, Fisher.

395
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,451
Forensics analyzed
Ted Russo's keys, all right.

396
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,035
There's no evidence of red paint
transfer from keying the car.

397
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,643
This is a very efficient workspace,
don't you think?

398
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,936
It affords a minimum amount
of human interaction

399
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,378
so the workers can concentrate
solely on productivity.

400
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,615
It's demoralizing.

401
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,955
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not some kind of a drone.

402
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,386
You have superiors to whom you
must report, protocols you must follow.

403
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,672
All of your actions
are documented and reviewed.

404
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,737
Look, I do not work for some
faceless bureaucracy, okay?

405
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,187
I work for
the United States government,

406
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,601
and so do you,
which makes you a drone, too.

407
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,372
No. No, I'm a completely
independent contractor

408
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:48,899
operating out of the Jeffersonian.
In the hive, I would be the queen bee.

409
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,007
- Still in a hive.
- In which I am the queen.

410
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,209
OK, what do we got?

411
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,829
We found dried toner
in a section of the floor

412
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,619
and fabric threads that might match
the victim's clothes.

413
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,155
Send them all to Dr.
Hodgins at the Jeffersonian.

414
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:04,874
- Says the queen bee.
- What?

415
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:05,958
Nothing.

416
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:08,280
Use the ALS in this area.

417
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,181
Booth, the light.

418
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,599
I'll tell you what, I am going
to be the king bee in my department.

419
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,046
- There's no such thing as a king bee.
- Sure there is.

420
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,762
And he is going to have
the finest chair in the hive.

421
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:23,724
This area might also have staining
that could help Hodgins identify

422
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,769
what else was on the victim's clothes.

423
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,034
Remove this section of
carpet and send it to the lab.

424
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,661
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

425
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:33,974
Cam and Hodgins will have to check it.

426
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,975
- The lights.
- Yeah, yeah.

427
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,407
Booth.

428
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,516
Right. Just send it
to my phone right away.

429
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:42,971
What's going on?

430
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,872
Computer Forensics, they went
through the victim's hard drive.

431
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,868
Seems that she got a
really angry e-mail last week.

432
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,347
It's from somebody who works here:

433
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,552
Dave Farfield.

434
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,472
"You self-entitled bitch.
"You are done playing with me.

435
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:56,850
"You'll pay. Trust me.

436
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,770
Love and kisses, Dave."

437
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,929
Do you have an employee
named Dave Farfield?

438
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:03,727
Yes. Well, actually, no.

439
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,036
Okay, which is it?

440
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:09,155
Well, Dave worked here for eight years,
but he was let go last Thursday.

441
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,343
- You fired him?
- That's right.

442
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,150
Oh, God...

443
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,911
- What?
- Well, it was Patty.

444
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,973
She told me that Dave was a problem:

445
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,523
disruptive, not doing his work.

446
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,657
- It was Patty who got him fired?
- She showed me

447
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,616
an inflammatory e-mail
that he wrote to her,

448
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:24,620
and I agreed with Patty,
it wasn't right.

449
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,163
And Dave knew he was
fired because of Patty?

450
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:28,325
Yes.

451
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:50,664
I don't get it.

452
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,065
Keying someone's car
is a federal offense now?

453
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,177
- So you admit you did it?
- No.

454
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,660
But did you ever meet Patty?

455
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:01,002
Someone was just
accurately describing her.

456
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:04,146
I mean, what other kind of person
would call the FBI

457
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,118
because she had her car keyed?

458
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,788
Patty's dead, Dave.

459
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,634
Whoa, wait a second.

460
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:14,001
Is that why I'm here?

461
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,576
Okay, look, sir...

462
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,858
I admit that I keyed her car,

463
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:25,119
but she purposely parked across the line

464
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,120
so I couldn't get into my space.

465
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,166
I mean, every day,

466
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,635
I would have to squeeze the car in.

467
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:34,237
I scratched the whole
side of my Corolla.

468
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:35,678
And that car was cherry.

469
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:36,749
You hated her.

470
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,497
She got me fired because
I turned her into the parking guards,

471
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:42,322
but it's not like I'm the only one
that didn't like her.

472
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:45,995
- Your coworkers seemed to like her.
- No, no, she drove us all crazy.

473
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,996
She docked Hamid's pay one time

474
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,423
because he put too much
half-and-half in his coffee.

475
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,135
And then she had me reported

476
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,962
for excessive use of the Internet,
and I was the IT guy.

477
00:22:57,122 --> 00:23:00,038
- So where were you Friday night, Dave?
- I was at Paradise Isle.

478
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,738
- I met Chip over there.
- Chip?

479
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:04,261
Chip's a guy from work.

480
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:08,176
I got a little tanked,
I bitched about getting fired.

481
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:10,998
Chip drove me home, 'cause like I said,
I got a little tanked,

482
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:12,894
but I was home before 8:00.

483
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:15,438
- You got an alibi after that?
- I was online.

484
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:18,128
I was online playing
Knights of Atlantis.

485
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,324
You can check the log or ask...
Thrustkiller278

486
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,673
or Donnerparty819.

487
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:25,793
Right.

488
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,739
Her body sustained
severe postmortem damage:

489
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,254
comminuted crush fractures of
the upper and lower extremities,

490
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,296
burst fractures of the thoracic
and lumbar vertebrae,

491
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,418
and shearing of the spinous processes.

492
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,046
- Your reconstruction looks good.
- It's incomplete.

493
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,168
I suck.

494
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,707
This woman was mulched
in an elevator shaft.

495
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,848
Given her condition,
I'm impressed with your work.

496
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,100
Come on, Mr.
Fisher, let me see a little smile.

497
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,237
That's the ticket.

498
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:59,454
I also found incomplete bilateral
compression fractures

499
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:01,568
of ribs R3 to R11.

500
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,512
There's inward deformation
to the lateral aspects.

501
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:07,235
Curve patterns are consistent
with the outer edge of a shoe.

502
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:09,460
I looked at several sections of
the epidermis

503
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,163
from the area of patterned abrasions,

504
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,163
didn't find any hemorrhage
in the soft tissue.

505
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:15,018
So she was stomped postmortem.

506
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,615
Why stomp on someone
when they're already dead?

507
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:19,878
Good question.

508
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,330
And I have another.
Did you figure out cause of death, yet?

509
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,674
I told you, man, I suck.

510
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:27,453
Buck up, Mr. Fisher.

511
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:30,684
You give me cause of death,
I give you a Kierkegaard T-shirt.

512
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,359
Hello.

513
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:46,988
- Fries look good.
- You want some?

514
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,536
If you don't want them.

515
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,659
So, I need some advice.

516
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,703
I have office hours, Ms. Montenegro.

517
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,748
- This is some...
- How do I deal with Hodgins?

518
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:58,896
I mean, we broke up so I just want it
to be over with so I can get back

519
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:01,378
to work without this unspoken
drama, you know what I'm saying?

520
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,553
First I think it's important
to find out what went wrong,

521
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:12,889
why you were involved in
an unsuccessful relationship.

522
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,474
Who said it was unsuccessful?

523
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:17,226
- You're not together anymore, are you?
- Do you love your parents?

524
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,673
- Yes.
- But you don't live together anymore.

525
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,567
Does that mean your relationship
with Mom and Dad was unsuccessful?

526
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:25,838
- I don't think it's the same.
- I do.

527
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,493
Sometimes you have to move on,
whatever your feelings.

528
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,325
When we create
intimate sexual relationships,

529
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:35,412
and if the relationship isn't
functioning the way it should,

530
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:37,408
one is left with anxiety

531
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:40,709
and confusion that will remain
until dealt with.

532
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:41,752
Okay.

533
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:43,007
So let's deal with it.

534
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:45,647
No, it's going to take longer
than us sitting here for a few minutes.

535
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,508
We need to find out why you were
attracted to him in the first place.

536
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,499
He has kind eyes,
great sense of humor.

537
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,805
Cute ass.

538
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,744
- He does this thing where...
- No. No.

539
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:57,410
I meant what are those things
in your past

540
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,181
that have led you to Dr. Hodgins

541
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,563
and what he represents to you
as an archetype.

542
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:04,491
You know what?
I'm going to look at my schedule.

543
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:06,994
But we should probably
start by meeting twice a week.

544
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:07,872
No.

545
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:09,738
I think I'm okay.

546
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:11,428
Therapy can't be rushed.

547
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,822
Look, Sweets, the way I look at it,

548
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:17,621
if I'm shot by an arrow, I-I don't need
to know where the arrow was made,

549
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:20,415
or what kind of bow it came from, or

550
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:22,617
even who it was who shot me.

551
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:25,081
I just need to get it out of my chest.

552
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:28,653
So... thank you.

553
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,795
This has been helpful.

554
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:33,136
You're good.

555
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,631
Thanks for the fries.

556
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,339
Go ahead.

557
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:39,585
Help yourself.

558
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:44,814
Found another mystery stain
on this piece of her skirt.

559
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:47,442
It's body fluid, so...

560
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:48,999
it's your problem.

561
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:57,536
What have we here?

562
00:26:58,211 --> 00:27:00,121
Do you think I'm off
my game because of Angela?

563
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,666
Because we have all this
residual stuff between us?

564
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:04,876
Every time I look at her,
I still think about...

565
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:06,536
- Semen.
- What? No.

566
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,589
I was going to say something
much more romantic than that.

567
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:11,508
This stain...
It's semen.

568
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:13,746
Right.

569
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,797
I was also given a swatch of carpet from
the copy room that had a stain.

570
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:17,847
Also semen.

571
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,255
So now we know victim was
on the floor of the copy room

572
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,561
and that there were semen stains
on the floor and now on her skirt.

573
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,186
My guess is the stains will match.

574
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,245
Patty Hoyle ordered food Friday night,

575
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,965
had it delivered to the office.

576
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:36,841
Guess whose credit card she used?

577
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,653
Well, I really don't have enough
data to make an educated guess.

578
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:42,079
Oh, her boss'.
Gary Flannery.

579
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,346
So, Cam is comparing
the semen found on the floor

580
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,969
with the stain found on the skirt.

581
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:52,342
Seems like Pretty Patty was
sleeping her way up the food chain

582
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,131
- with the boss.
- Flannery is married.

583
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:57,016
Maybe she threatened
to expose the affair,

584
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,986
and he decided to kill her
to keep her quiet.

585
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:02,338
Just because tech support is in India
doesn't mean I get special treatment.

586
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,889
- Patty knew that.
- Just call them, please.

587
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:06,172
Excuse me.

588
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:08,607
Mr. Flannery, like to ask you
a few questions

589
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:10,358
about your credit card statement.

590
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,708
I'd like to ask him for a DNA sample.

591
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:13,570
Now.

592
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:23,929
Patty was a valued
employee and that is all.

593
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:26,873
Come on, you think I'm gonna
slam you for having a little fun?

594
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,001
It happens.

595
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:30,920
Late night meetings, a little cleavage.

596
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,048
No. I-I'm a married man.

597
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,841
Why did you give
her your credit card?

598
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,294
For the the occasional business expense.

599
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:39,788
Room service, massage,

600
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:42,891
shiatsu one hour,
a purse,

601
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,601
$300 worth of lingerie.

602
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,393
I was not having sex with Patty!

603
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:49,022
- Why did she have your credit card?
- And semen on her skirt.

604
00:28:49,182 --> 00:28:50,147
No!

605
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:56,681
Patty decided to run
an expendables audit,

606
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:59,676
all right, she wanted to account
for every damn pencil.

607
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,433
Then she found out I was
ordering extra office supplies

608
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:05,538
and selling the surplus online.

609
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:07,916
She was going to report me to corporate.

610
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,291
But she said she'd keep her mouth shut
if I let her use my card now and then.

611
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:15,416
Oh, she had the whole office under
her thumb, knew everyone's business.

612
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,092
Sneaky bitch.

613
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:18,590
So she was blackmailing you.

614
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:20,887
That's not easy to stop, is it?

615
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:22,263
But I didn't kill her.

616
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:23,639
Please.

617
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,508
You can't tell the head office.

618
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,538
I've got a family. I could lose my job,
my health care, my pension...

619
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:30,596
Shut up.
Open your mouth.

620
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,695
What have you found?

621
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:38,988
The pelvis?

622
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,450
The anteroposterior
diameter is 160 millimeters.

623
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,801
Transverse diameter is 240 millimeters.

624
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,914
Listen to me.

625
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,458
Reducing the pelvic inlet,

626
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:53,368
the orifice of life,
to a numerical abstract.

627
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:55,523
We need mathematical constructs

628
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,090
to understand any aspect
of our world, Mr. Fisher.

629
00:29:58,252 --> 00:30:00,340
And those figures and
equations are beautiful.

630
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,111
Like a musical composition,
they give life meaning

631
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:06,266
and us the possibility of knowing
the unknowable.

632
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,773
Right.

633
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,607
There's no evidence that the body
was disarticulated prior to

634
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,403
being shoved down the chute, so she
either went in headfirst or feetfirst.

635
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:21,030
Given that, I've cut a hole
that corresponds

636
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,885
to the measurements of the chute.

637
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:24,492
There's only one problem.

638
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,455
Any way you turn it,
the pelvis won't fit.

639
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:32,587
So, the body couldn't have
entered the shaft by that chute.

640
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,252
But since it still had
to fall a minimum of 60 meters...

641
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:37,220
It was dumped from the 16th floor.

642
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,586
I'll call Booth.

643
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,617
DNA results came back.

644
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:42,269
The two semen stains are a match--

645
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,929
the one from her skirt and
the one from the copy room floor.

646
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:46,890
But they're not from her boss.
Sorry.

647
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:58,875
Uh... hi.

648
00:30:58,995 --> 00:31:02,171
Look, this tension between us,
I hate it.

649
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:04,574
I-I mean, I know that we broke up
and everything,

650
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:08,384
but I've experience loss before and
lived through it and... you have, too.

651
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:11,622
I'm not gonna pretend this didn't happen
because it might be easier to break up.

652
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:13,541
I'm going to relive us
huddled last winter

653
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:16,551
in that cabin in Montana when the lights
went out and the heat went out

654
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,713
and laughing our asses off
when you tried explaining

655
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:20,386
that spectrometer thingy to me.

656
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,949
So, I am not going to hide anymore,
and I'm not going to walk on eggshells.

657
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:27,327
I am just going to accept that the whole
damn mess happened and, pain or not,

658
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:29,264
I'm glad it did.

659
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,134
Okay.

660
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,947
So, forensics didn't find any prints?

661
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,136
No.

662
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:49,494
Cleaning crew came in over the weekend
and wiped down all the elevator doors.

663
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,204
Eh, no blood.

664
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,074
- What's that?
- What?

665
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:53,872
That.

666
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:55,179
Those are my cupcakes.

667
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:58,086
I got them for the HR officer at work.
I heard she loves them.

668
00:31:58,246 --> 00:31:59,754
So, fraud and bribery?

669
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:02,707
No. 12 years of service
and lumbar support, okay.

670
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,675
It's all a matter of perception.

671
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,470
Okay.

672
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:08,843
Don't say it like that.

673
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:10,932
"Okay," like I'm some kind of a kid.

674
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:12,093
Okay.

675
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,952
It's looking pretty good, too, Bones.

676
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:17,438
I mean, Willie Ackerman, he got cut off

677
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,439
the list 'cause he got his note from

678
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,905
an acupuncturist,
and that doesn't even count.

679
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,441
Hah! Boob.

680
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:26,614
Watch out, I'm going to try this again.

681
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:28,908
Oh, man.

682
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:30,255
Ah, forget it!

683
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,732
There's no way

684
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:35,498
that I could keep that open long enough
to dump a body, and I'm in shape.

685
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,848
Must have been someone
that was stronger than you.

686
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,253
You're kidding me? Have you
seen the people in these offices?

687
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,045
Compared to them, I am Hercules.

688
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,525
Well, apparently not.

689
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,091
Maybe you do need that chair.

690
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,187
Or maybe it was two people.

691
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:52,308
1,263 bone fragments

692
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,511
and I've checked every single
one of them.

693
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,645
And the only cause of death
I see is on the squamous temporal bone.

694
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:02,201
The localized staining would
be consistent with blunt force trauma.

695
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:04,736
Except there's no sign of
that on the exterior of the skull.

696
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,739
Then it was probably
caused by a ruptured aneurysm.

697
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,300
Which would make her death an accident.

698
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:14,453
And our pursuit for a villain merely
a cry for justice in an unjust world.

699
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,766
But if it's an accident, it wouldn't
account for the elevator or the semen.

700
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:19,886
True.

701
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:22,587
I should have found that earlier.

702
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,924
Dr. Brennan's going to fire me,
isn't she?

703
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:28,801
I guess while I was trying to see

704
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:32,732
the metaphorical sun, I totally forgot
that the chances of survival

705
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:36,141
- in an unfriendly cosmos...
- Have you considered Prozac?

706
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,316
Already on it.

707
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:39,494
Then double your dose 'cause
you're bringing me down,

708
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:41,978
and that's hard to do, 'cause
I have worked with death for years

709
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:44,692
and you are making it all look like
good times now.

710
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:46,587
So, get it together, okay, Eeyore?

711
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:48,510
- What have you found?
- An aneurysm.

712
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,740
It should have been caused
by trauma to the ectocranial

713
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:53,329
surface, but there's no evidence
of trauma at all.

714
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,078
Very good, Mr. Fisher.

715
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:00,306
What do you see there?

716
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:05,254
Two tiny punctures,
approximately seven millimeters apart.

717
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,980
And what's very good?

718
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:08,830
I totally missed them.

719
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,078
You found the hemorrhagic
stain that led us here.

720
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:13,323
- So what caused them?
- Snake fangs?

721
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:16,267
Eastern pipistrelle bat?
Uh, a vampire?

722
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,696
Fingerprint powder.

723
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:23,564
What are you doing?

724
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,900
A fine horizontal bar

725
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,886
terminating in two vertical protrusions.

726
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:31,631
Oh, my God.

727
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:34,389
She was killed by a staple.

728
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:40,980
A staple?

729
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:44,026
How do you kill somebody with a staple?

730
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:46,202
It perforated the thinnest
part of the calvarium...

731
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:48,060
the squamous temporal bone...

732
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,194
causing Miss Hoyle's
preexisting aneurysm to rupture.

733
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,745
And how do you get somebody
to stand still while you staple them?

734
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:55,742
There's a small depression
near the wound

735
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,807
that suggests the stapler was thrown.

736
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,829
So whoever did this
didn't mean to kill her.

737
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:01,979
- No, I can't confirm that.
- It's common sense.

738
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,185
One doesn't usually use a stapler
as a murder weapon,

739
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,816
and they certainly couldn't have known
that she had an aneurysm.

740
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,944
- I'll concede on both points.
- Tell you what

741
00:35:10,104 --> 00:35:12,780
My boys are looking for the murder
weapon. Maybe we can pull some prints.

742
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,352
So Patty has sex with someone
who then hits her with a stapler.

743
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:17,827
It's an odd work environment.

744
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:19,787
Okay, you are not going to believe this.

745
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,123
Yeah, try topping
death by office supplies.

746
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:25,245
I was wracking my brain over
the trace analysis from the sweater.

747
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:26,919
Furfural, proteolytic enzyme,

748
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,661
- triarylmethane dye...
- Hodgins, Hodg-Hodgins.

749
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:31,007
Eyes are glazing over.

750
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:32,591
It's a blue Hawaiian.

751
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,808
- What's a blue Hawaiian?
- Well, it's a potent cocktail.

752
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:37,936
Two of those puppies
and you're asking yourself,

753
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:40,266
"Hey, why am I naked
and who are all these people?"

754
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:42,643
Brilliant blue FCF
from the blue curaçao,

755
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:44,933
furfural from the rum,
proteolytic enzyme--

756
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:47,315
pineapple, alcohol speaks for itself.

757
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,651
Is this the sort of beverage
they would serve at the Paradise Isle?

758
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:53,112
Yeah, comes in one of
those ceramic monkey heads.

759
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:56,744
So the killer must have
stepped in spilled drink.

760
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,817
Given the high level of fructose
and sugarcane,

761
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,536
it would have adhered to his shoe.
He stomps on the victim, and presto,

762
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:03,997
her sweater lights up with more traces
than a luau pig.

763
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:06,833
Dave was at Paradise Isle,
but his, his alibi checks out.

764
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,668
Yeah, but Dave was there with Chip,

765
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:10,338
who gave him a ride home,

766
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:12,935
but we don't know what Chip
did for the rest of the night.

767
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:14,622
- Good work, Hodgins.
- Thanks.

768
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,680
Now you can have a French fry.
Hey, man, right?

769
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:18,416
Hey, you know, uh...

770
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,056
I think Angela and I are cool now.

771
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:21,431
We talked, and I think...

772
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:22,930
- Brennan.
- You know what?

773
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,267
Just keep it to yourself.

774
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:27,146
- We'll be right there.
- You can have all the fries you want.

775
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:28,509
Pay for the bill, too.

776
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:30,475
- to talk to you guys about
- Thanks, Hodgins.

777
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:31,359
Angela.

778
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,284
I was filing the DNA
test I ran on Gary's saliva.

779
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:35,778
Ah, it does match after all.

780
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:37,324
No, but I did double-check

781
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:40,075
the semen sample from the victim's skirt
with the one on the floor

782
00:36:40,195 --> 00:36:41,529
and they do match.

783
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:46,122
And according to the deterioration
of the sperm tail,

784
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,834
the ejaculate is from Friday night.

785
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:49,970
That must have been some happy hour.

786
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,445
The night she was murdered.

787
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:53,422
You can tell all that
from their little tails?

788
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:56,467
Yes, and I can also tell that
our man is probably of Asian descent.

789
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:58,261
Oh, by the way they swim.

790
00:36:58,663 --> 00:36:59,406
No.

791
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,417
From 42 specific DNA sequences.

792
00:37:03,952 --> 00:37:05,835
Yeah, probably more exact.

793
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,353
I'm not sure if that's helpful.

794
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,454
There are 3 billion
Asian people in the world.

795
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,586
- But only one who works in the office.
- And he was at Paradise Isle.

796
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,319
We found the murder weapon, Chip.

797
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,875
- A stapler?
- Yep, a stapler.

798
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:18,906
Picked it up in a Dumpster
behind your building.

799
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,447
Someone threw it at her.

800
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,746
We found some of Patty's hair
embedded in the slide,

801
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,832
as well as a trace of blood.

802
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,624
So, uh, what do you need from me?

803
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,396
I'll help any way I can.

804
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:31,418
I liked Patty.

805
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,213
Enough to make love to her
in the copy room on the floor?

806
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,702
God, no.

807
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:38,633
She was my boss.

808
00:37:38,794 --> 00:37:42,304
We also found semen on the floor
of the copy room and on her skirt.

809
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,432
The DNA showed it
was from an Asian male.

810
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:47,707
You're the only person of
Asian descent in the office, Chip.

811
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:48,810
Look at this.

812
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:52,606
We have a,
uh, court order here for your DNA.

813
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,243
Okay, you're right.

814
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,490
I was sleeping with Patty,

815
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:03,034
but I wanted to end it,

816
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:06,287
so I had a couple drinks to get up
my courage and went back to the office.

817
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:07,496
Then what happened?

818
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:10,770
I told her we had to stop
because we were going to get caught.

819
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,054
She threatened to report me
for sexual harassment

820
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:14,712
if I didn't keep sleeping with her.

821
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,630
She was calling Gary to report me.

822
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,648
- So you threw the stapler at her?
- It...

823
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:21,758
hit her in the head
a-and she just dropped.

824
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:23,466
She had an aneurysm.

825
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,139
You ruptured it.

826
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,266
- I didn't know.
- Then what?

827
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:30,029
I... had to get rid of her.

828
00:38:30,573 --> 00:38:31,980
I... I panicked,

829
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:35,107
dragged her into the
hall, opened the elevator doors, and...

830
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:36,984
shoved her down the shaft.

831
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:38,361
How?

832
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:41,447
W-What do you mean, "how?"

833
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,583
It must have been the adrenaline.

834
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:54,036
Enough of that,
you can lift a car, right?

835
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:56,078
Is this enough adrenaline for you?

836
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:58,324
Okay.

837
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,463
Look at that--
two people.

838
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,966
- Who's helping you?
- No one. It was just me.

839
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:13,729
Somebody had to have helped you hold
the doors open while you kicked

840
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,468
- her down the shaft.
- No.

841
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,038
Who are you protecting, Chipper?

842
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:19,586
- Can you take the door?
- Got it, got it.

843
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,275
All right.

844
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:33,336
Okay, what is that?

845
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:36,619
It looks like a piece of fingernail,
blue nail polish.

846
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:46,283
Chip tried to protect me?

847
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:48,958
Yes.

848
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:51,836
That's just like him, you know?

849
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,438
Whenever I have too many calls on hold,
he'd always answer the phone.

850
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:57,781
He totally didn't have to do that.

851
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:01,732
The best way for you to help
him is just to tell me the truth.

852
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,182
Okay, well...

853
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:07,265
we both have roommates...

854
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,511
so... sometimes...

855
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,230
we'd make love in the office.

856
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,544
We were in the copy room

857
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:20,787
and we thought we were alone,

858
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:23,593
but Patty came back for something

859
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:25,718
and she caught us,

860
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:28,304
and she said she was going to report us.

861
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:31,651
I mean, no one in the office could date.
It was against company policy.

862
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:33,266
She said we'd both be fired.

863
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:35,186
So you threw the stapler.

864
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:37,980
I-I was so sick of her
sticking her nose in everything.

865
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:43,914
Sh-She went over to the
phone to report us to Gary, and...

866
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,239
... I threw the stapler.

867
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,589
I didn't, I didn't mean to kill her.

868
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,772
I just wanted to be with Chip.

869
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,028
I see you got your throne.

870
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,148
That's right.

871
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,090
The chair.

872
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,212
Looks nice.

873
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:25,736
Another victory for the hive.

874
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,548
HR said you called.

875
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:31,077
Yes, but I didn't lie to them.
I wouldn't do that.

876
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,147
Well, you must have said something
because she didn't even eat her cupcakes

877
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:35,542
and the chair was here.

878
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:36,862
No, I just told them why

879
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:39,125
I felt it was important
for you to have it, that's all.

880
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:42,618
And, uh, why is that?
Because even a mindless drone...

881
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,674
... deserves some perks?

882
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,462
No, because of how
important you are to them.

883
00:41:49,784 --> 00:41:53,717
I mentioned your dedication
and courage and sensitivity.

884
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:55,891
- Sensitivity?
- Yes, Booth.

885
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:58,807
I mean, even today with that young
woman who killed her boss,

886
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:00,604
it's very impressive.

887
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,183
Anyway, I said that a chair
is a good way

888
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:10,342
to show the other employees
in the office

889
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:12,742
how much those qualities are valued.

890
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:15,603
Hmm, well, it worked.

891
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:19,278
I'll never understand why you
felt you had to lie to get the chair.

892
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,797
I mean, you could have just
told them about yourself on your own.

893
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,919
Well, because that would have
been bragging, even though it was true.

894
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,860
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, it was just...

895
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,243
I think some of the padding
in the back here is worn out

896
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:37,725
When I lean back, it's hits

897
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:40,394
So ageing counts in oversee
to the attributes to the chair.

898
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:44,482
No, no, this thing is great,
you kidding me?

899
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:45,886
It's a...

900
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:48,652
even old to make tick

901
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,608
doesn't tilt back... yet.

902
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:53,616
And it smells like a 300 pound
dead guy.

903
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:55,973
- So you like it.
- You're kidding me?

904
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,394
Love it.

905
00:42:57,514 --> 00:42:59,916
I give this baby up brilly?

906
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:07,400
You know, that all up and down
thing is little touchy.

907
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:10,776
