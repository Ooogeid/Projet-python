1
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,190
- Excuse me.
- Just a minute.

2
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,240
Ma'am,this woman is asleep next to
me, and I really have to get out.

3
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,020
It's just that this book is so exciting.

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,940
Do you like mysteries?

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
Well,I'm,I'm an FBI agent, so
mysteries are sort of my thing.

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh,I'm an aficionado myself.

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,230
I'm here with Nadine.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,790
She's plotting the perfect murder
for years now, but just for fun.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,530
Right,you can tell me all about it later.
I've really got to get out. I've got to go.

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,530
Oh,right. When you've got
to go, you've got to go.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,330
Yeah.

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,690
sorry.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,560
how old are you?

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,620
Come on, we're at 36,000 feet.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,360
That's outside the three-mile limit.

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,050
This is American soil until we
touch down in Shanghai. All right?

17
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,970
So,come on, hand them over.

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,790
Eli,what are you doing now?

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,220
You know your mother isn't feeling well.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,710
Is he bothering you?

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,400
No,we were just talking. That's all.

22
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,180
You can sleep,Dad. It's all good.

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,380
- What? Booth?
- Wow,look at this.

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,110
I don't even get a hot meal,
and you get pajamas and slippers.

25
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,240
The basic amenities. The
flight is over 13 hours.

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,610
Yeah,I know. I spent the past
eight of them back there in Gitmo.

27
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,940
Yes!

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,320
You know,you aren't allowed up here.

29
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,140
What? We're a... we're a team. Okay?

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,880
This is,uh, government business.

31
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,110
You shouldn't have paid for
your own ticket,you know.

32
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,010
Ooh,a massager. Buzz,buzz.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,280
Sir,you need to return to coach.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,510
See,we're,um, we're partners;
we like being together.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,490
Your sexual relationship's
not relevant,sir.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,720
This is first class.

37
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,820
Why does everyone else think
we have a sexual relationship?

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,000
I mean,we barely ever
even touch each other.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,370
Oh,I got it. All right,here we go.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,630
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

41
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,790
This here's my partner, Dr. Temperance
Brennan,and,uh, she is actually going to China.

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,500
We're going to China, and she's
going to help the Chinese government

43
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,320
help identify some
real,old Chinese dude.

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,390
Bones were found in a Wuhan
cave, over 40,000 years old.

45
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,610
According to Title 18, section 1831,

46
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,250
I must protect the proprietary American
technology Dr. Brennan will be using.

47
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,840
So it is my patriotic duty to be right
next to her-- here-- like a bodyguard.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,660
This trip is taking me
back to my real passion:

49
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,850
prehistoric anthropological discoveries.

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,310
Fascinating. Sir... You
have to go back to your seat.

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,680
Sorry.

52
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,710
- Right now.
- Right.

53
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,290
Bones. Bones-- what do you
mean your "real passion"?

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,630
I thought us working together
was your real passion.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,870
You two can take up this
fight again after we land.

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,350
- All right.
- Watch your head.

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,370
- You okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.

58
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Kicking me back to the cattle
class. You know, that's not right.

59
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,650
Enjoy your flight,sir.

60
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,830
So,the cat's away and it's TGIF,huh?

61
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,660
I'm right here. I'm the cat.

62
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,450
Well,in this case,I think
Dr. Brennan is the cat.

63
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,780
I'm the cat who's giving the
mice the rest of the day off.

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,470
Hey,so, Daisy and I were wondering
if anyone would like to join us

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,230
for a little competitive
karaoke this evening.

66
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,030
Some pre-weekend fun?

67
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm singing "Lime in the Coconut."

68
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,790
Sorry,I'm going to be biking
the Virginia Creeper Trail.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,830
Roxie and I are going to an
artists' retreat in Pond View.

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,820
And I'm driving Angela
to the train station.

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,030
- You are?
- Yes,I am.

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,220
- Ready to go,Angie?
- Yeah,I'm all set.

73
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,440
I haven't been to one of these
retreats since we were in school.

74
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,360
Well,I'll see you all on Monday.

75
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,750
Have a good weekend.

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,180
What do you think?

77
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,250
What do you think?

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,670
Oh,don't, don't do that whole answer
a question with a question thing.

79
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,110
Why does whatever's going on between
Roxie and Angela matter to you?

80
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,050
Because Angela and I were engaged,
and now she's with a woman.

81
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,410
It matters because...

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,900
What? It just matters.

83
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,140
Well,don't you feel that both of you
are entitled to your own private lives?

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,980
Stop asking me questions.

85
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,950
Do you feel threatened?

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,730
Okay,that's it. I'm out of here.

87
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,790
I... You know,a little
karaoke might help you unwind.

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,990
Especially when I'm singing.
I've got a beautiful tenor.

89
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,340
Excuse me.

90
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,860
You should have your prostate checked.

91
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh,this damn thing.

92
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,300
Bones? Bones?

93
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,840
- You're going to get in trouble.
- She's downstairs.

94
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,020
You didn't answer me before.
Are you tired of working with me?

95
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,050
No,it's not that.

96
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,110
But the identification and
analysis of ancient remains--

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,090
that's why I became a
forensic anthropologist.

98
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,390
You're bored. The spark is gone.

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm a scientist first.

100
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,490
Right. Yeah.

101
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,320
"Scientist first," I...
I-I get it. I understand.

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah?

103
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,520
If you get caught up here,
does that make me an accessory?

104
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,700
An accessory to an upgrade.

105
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,190
Ho-ho,yeah!

106
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,870
Oh,my God, that is heaven.

107
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,390
Bones,down there.

108
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,180
Oh,my God.

109
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,460
That's a,uh... that's a body,right?

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,420
Can you account for all
your people, Captain Blake?

114
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,820
Me and the copilot,yeah.

115
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,960
Cabin crew,you'd have
to ask Miss McNutt.

116
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,730
She isn't speaking.

117
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,630
Bones,not everyone brushes
off these horrible experiences.

118
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,910
Okay,let me-- let
me try this,okay?

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,190
What's your name?

120
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,640
What's your first name?

121
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,960
Katherine. Kate.

122
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,820
Kate. Okay,Kate, what you saw down
there you don't ever have to see again.

123
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,780
Are you missing any people?

124
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,430
I can still smell...

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,910
It's very much like roast pork.

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Bones.

127
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,350
Just want you to relax.

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,250
Have a little water.
We might need your help.

129
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
Need her help? For what?

130
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,140
We fly to China and call the cops.

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,260
No,no,no. You're going to
have to turn this puppy around.

132
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,140
- We're going to head back home.
- No can do.

133
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,930
We passed the point of no
return fuel-wise 23 minutes ago.

134
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,740
The polar route takes us over Greenland.

135
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,130
Can we land there to refuel?

136
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,640
Not with the weather they're having.

137
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm sorry,but our next
stop is Shanghai,China.

138
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,900
Don't worry. They have
cops there. Lots of them.

139
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,060
Until these wheels touch down, this
plane is sovereign U.S.territory.

140
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,540
Look,FBI guy, you do whatever you want as
long as it doesn't endanger this flight.

141
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,410
But,in four hours,we're on
sovereign Chinese territory.

142
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,190
Excuse me.

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,440
Before you become
completely catatonic...

144
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,540
can you tell me how
to access the Internet?

145
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,120
I need to contact my people.

146
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,330
Bones,you don't have to shout.

147
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,620
She's in shock, not deaf.

148
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,580
What? What? Are you kidding?

149
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,560
Because the message I got,
that could not be correct.

150
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,460
I'd rather brief everyone at once.

151
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,720
What's going on?

152
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,300
Is that what you really look like?

153
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,460
Cam said an emergency.
I didn't have time to...

154
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,050
I think maybe your message was garbled.

155
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,210
I'd rather brief everyone at once.

156
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,940
There was a murder on
Brennan's plane to China?

157
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,440
Good. We're all here.

158
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,680
What are you? Like,16?

159
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,530
I love these shorts.

160
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,100
A body was found roasted beyond recognition
in a large convection microwave oven

161
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,050
on Booth and Brennan's flight to China.

162
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,500
- ***
- Yeah,I'm gonna. Okay.

163
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,140
Call me when you catch the bad guy.

164
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,120
And I'm here because...

165
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,800
You are on my speed dial.

166
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,920
Uh,Dr. Saroyan?

168
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,600
Two people,they,uh... they go away
together, and they pack one bag.

169
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,030
That... that means something,right?

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,940
You mean Angela and Roxie.

171
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,260
Well...

172
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,510
Yeah,it means something.

173
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,570
Excuse me.

174
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,770
What's going on?

175
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,310
Listen. Would you happen to have
a measuring tape and tweezers?

176
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,810
There's been a murder!

177
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,680
- Nadine. Nadine.
- No!

178
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,260
They need tweezers for an autopsy.

179
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,500
- Code Red! Code Red!
- No. No Code Red.

180
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,770
Don't wake Nadine up.

181
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,700
I will explain everything to
you later, I promise,Charlotte.

182
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,380
I just need these
things. Do you have them?

183
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,040
I didn't hear a gunshot, so
it must have been a knifing.

184
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,190
I saw Dr. Temperance Brennan, the
mystery writer, in first class.

185
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,270
I bet she's doing the autopsy.

186
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,890
Listen,I was awake the whole time, and anyone
who went that way, they came back again.

187
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,870
So if the victim is a passenger,
he or she is in first class.

188
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,830
Probably she,because most
murder victims are women.

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,020
Wow,you really are into
murder, aren't you? Thanks.

190
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,020
Wait.

191
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,230
Dr. Brennan will need this.

192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,450
What's that for?

193
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,840
It's a probe.

194
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,210
This is the best flight
I've ever been on.

195
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,640
Okay,sweetie, we've got a
solid link here, audiovisual,

196
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,860
so you should be able to beam
us all the digital photographs.

197
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,630
Okay,we've isolated the crime scene,and we'll try
to compromise the forensics as little as possible.

198
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Look what I got.

199
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,530
Oh,a probe! That's great.
I didn't think of that.

200
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,450
Yeah,lucky I did.

201
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,540
Hey,Booth. Good flight so far?

202
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,540
Yeah. I'm having trouble sleeping.

203
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,800
Looks like you managed to get
the remains out of the oven.

204
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah,they're,uh, they're kind of,uh...

205
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,640
Well,they-they-they've fallen
apart a little bit there.

206
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,300
Hey,Bones, did you knock
the phone off this cradle?

207
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,620
No.

208
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,990
I've informed the FAA, the NTSB and the
Chinese that we have a dead body on board.

209
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,560
Yeah,who has access to
the galley down there?

210
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,280
All of us.

211
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,170
It's kind of our getaway place.

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,620
To chill out from passengers.

213
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,810
Who's the last person who made a call
from the satellite phone down there?

214
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,670
I can get you the number called.

215
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,220
I-It was me.

216
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,660
You? Uh,what are you,
a spy or a smuggler?

217
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,160
No. She's in love, Agent Booth.

218
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,600
And her boyfriend works for this
airline at the Shanghai Airport.

219
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,710
It's against the rules.

220
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,240
So is having sex with
passengers in the bathroom.

221
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,390
Okay,I think we're all
under a lot of stress here.

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,430
I used the phone right after dinner.

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
There was no dead body
cooking in the microwave.

224
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,780
Tell you what,why don't
you two go do a seat count?

225
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,660
Tell me what passengers
are missing,okay?

226
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,730
A macro photo of the victim's follicle
suggests brown hair, maybe red.

227
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,510
I estimate her height
to be 157 centimeters.

228
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,710
Hodgins has that
meerkat look on his face.

229
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,620
What's going on with her fingernails?

230
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,420
Are you referring to the
spots around the phalanges?

231
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,230
What would cause those kinds of burns?

232
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,350
False fingernails.

233
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,320
ABS plastic and ethyl
cyanoacrylate glue.

234
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,370
Like torches.

235
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,200
So a petite, brown- or
red-haired woman with fake nails.

236
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,110
Five-foot-two,three,
small,brown,uh,red hair, fake nails.

237
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,770
Fake nails.

238
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,110
Seat 3-B,Elizabeth Jones.

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,100
3-B.

240
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,030
3-B.
3-B.

241
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,130
Buddy. Buddy. Buddy. Wake up.

242
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,680
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you.

243
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,370
But do you remember the person who
was sitting right here next to you?

244
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,950
No. I took a sleeping
pill. Are we in China?

245
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,510
Wait a second, you spend seven grand on a
flight and you sleep through the whole thing?

246
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,960
You don't even eat first?

247
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,560
- Excuse me,Agent Booth.
- Yeah.

248
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm Arthur Bilbrey. My
wife Ann is very ill.

249
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,580
I'd appreciate it if she could
get some rest before we landed.

250
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll be fine. Relax.

251
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,070
You better be really quiet,or...
I'll take you down,FBI!

252
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,510
Eli. Please. This is my son,Eli.

253
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,670
I got your back,Mom.

254
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,860
You got a name?

255
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,250
Yeah,Elizabeth Jones.
Seat 3-B,first class.

256
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,710
The sooner you can
get us a background...

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,150
check, uh,the better for us.

258
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,740
Well,now,that's just strange.

259
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,420
Um,let me,uh, let make a
call and get back to you.

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,170
Angela and Hodgins noticed a shadow
on the exposed part of the sternum.

261
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes,I saw that. I...

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,100
There is something here,
but I-I,I can't identify it.

263
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,920
Angela suggested that you take as many
photos as possible at your highest resolution.

264
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,530
All right.

265
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,890
It's not bone. It's inorganic.

266
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,530
This quick enough for you?

267
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,510
Your victim is Elizabeth Joy Jones.

268
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,190
She's a travel writer
for D.C.Voyager magazine.

269
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,940
Well,you got to get
over to that magazine.

270
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,460
Why?

271
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,220
They might know why she got murdered.

272
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,910
You got this backwards,cherie.
I am not an investigator.

273
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,140
Neither am I,and here I am taking
apart another murder victim.

274
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Look,just go talk to the boss, the
secretary,pretend they're on the stand.

275
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,130
Take Sweets with you.

276
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,520
If you want me to do this,
you have to make a good case.

277
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,490
Want you to do what?

278
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,710
If you want me to take on the Chinese government,
the State Department,the FAA and the NTSB,

279
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,230
and for all I know,the U.N., **********

280
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,320
Bones,can you turn her around
so she's not looking at us?

281
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,630
She's deceased,Booth. She can't see.

282
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,410
Oh,man.

283
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,780
I am definitely not a Squint.

284
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,260
Well,I've always known that.

285
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,630
You have no training in the
field of forensic science.

286
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,920
Really don't want any.

287
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay,to make an arrest, we need time and
cause of death, as well as something...

288
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,150
that can ID the killer.

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,210
What do you need?

290
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,400
- Magnifying lens.
- Okay. Right.

291
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,200
Sorry. Look,I,uh,I
need a magnifying glass.

292
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,260
I thought you might have one,
you know,for the fine print.

293
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,680
My eyes are perfect.

294
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,770
Is the magnifying glass for
examining the victim's corpse?

295
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,840
You don't think that,uh,
Nadine would mind if I,uh...

296
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,720
She'd be thrilled, if she were awake.

297
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,730
She sleeps like a log.

298
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,880
Now,what equipment would Dr. Brennan
normally use in this situation?

299
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,710
I don't know. I'm more
of a people person.

300
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,170
I'm using interpolation software
with a blending edge algorithm.

301
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,450
Kind of like what I'd do if
I were restoring a painting.

302
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,520
So did Roxie go to the
retreat without you?

303
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,060
Uh,no. We're gonna do something here.

304
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,770
Right.

305
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,240
Don't say it like that.

306
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,080
Like what?

307
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,990
I know. Sorry.

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,590
What do you think? Candle wax?

309
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,390
Well,judging by the burn characteristics,
some kind of thermoplastic.

310
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,730
But what is that?

311
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
- Like something reflective.
- Yeah.

312
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,770
I'll get the computer to find all the pixels that
are within a couple shades on the color wheel.

313
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,010
Cool. And just zap it to my computer.

314
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,070
Yeah.

315
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,390
Bones...

316
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,390
All right. What I want you to do is take off
your glasses, shake out your hair and say,

317
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,130
"Mr. Booth,do you know what the
penalty is for an overdue book?"

318
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,510
Why?

319
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,090
Never mind.

320
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,380
This notch mark here on the occipital
is what knocked her unconscious.

321
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,730
The hairline fractures weakened the integrity of
the cranium and caused it to burst when heated.

322
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,750
So she was hit. With what?

323
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,560
- I'll have to take an impression to find out.
- How?

324
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,580
I need denture cream. And,uh...

325
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,750
- baby powder.
- Baby powder.

326
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,240
And a butane lighter, please.

327
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,810
Is that it?

328
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,130
Uh,I think so. Yes.

329
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,830
Sorry,dear,but these
are my real choppers.

330
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,720
And Nadine's are real,too.

331
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,260
Is Dr. Brennan making
a cast of an injury?

332
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,030
That's what she'd do in her books.

333
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,470
Hit the lights.

334
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,030
Ladies and gentleman,
sorry to disturb you,

335
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,980
but Agent Booth of the FBI
would like to address you.

336
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,390
Attention,everyone,I need to requisition some
denture cream, baby powder and a butane lighter.

337
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,680
Lighters are strictly
forbidden on the aircraft.

338
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,380
So is murder.

339
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,100
- Denture cream?
- Here,sonny.

340
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,070
There you go.

341
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,950
Okay,how about some,uh,
baby powder,face powder?

342
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Anybody have any baby
powder, face powder?

343
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,950
- Anybody have any baby powder?
- There.

344
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,640
Great. Okay. How about a
lighter? Butane lighter.

345
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,990
Come on, no one has a lighter?

346
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,410
- I confiscated it.
- Obviously.

347
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:39,540
This is good. The powder contains
hydrated silica and calcium carbonate.

348
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:45,870
Come on,isn't this a lot more fun than the
Wuhan cave and the 40,000-year-old skeletons?

349
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,510
Is this gonna work?

350
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,970
- Should. This
should... - Oh,you're-

351
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,230
you're just, you're filling me
up with confidence right now.

352
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,380
There.

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,560
Now all we need to do is find the item
that matches this and we have our weapon.

354
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,550
Right. That's all,huh?

355
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,700
Well,at least we know
it's on the airplane.

356
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,230
Any luck with cause of death?

357
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,820
Yeah,someone knocked her on the head
and it exploded on the cranium thing.

358
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,300
We're looking at the margins of the
burned flesh around the rectus abdominis.

359
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,570
I just like the occlusive
nature of tissue.

360
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,920
Well,just think of it as bone wrapping.

361
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,230
From the photos, it looks as if there's
a pinkish coloration,is that correct?

362
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,240
"Pinkish" is a subjective term
and I'm not comfortable applying

363
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,630
a subjective evaluation to
evidence that's not even...

364
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,620
It's pinkish and gross... ish.

365
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,720
Okay,that indicates presence of
blood flow at the time she was cooked.

366
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,350
She was still alive in the microwave?

367
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,490
How long was she in there?

368
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,920
Since the oven temp was set at maximum,
and she was approximately 110 pounds.

369
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,220
Can you describe the breast tissue?

370
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,510
I'm not sure how to qualify
what I see in descriptive terms.

371
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,370
If she was a turkey, she
would be dry and overdone.

372
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,060
Okay,that means she had to be cooking
for about six-and-a-half hours.

373
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Giving us time of death.

374
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,360
If I were you,I'd get
some tissue samples.

375
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,390
Sometimes flesh can
be quite informative.

376
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,350
Bones...

377
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,200
I think we got a match.

378
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,320
Someone slammed her
head against the latch.

379
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,310
And shoved her in the
oven and cooked her.

380
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,680
Sick.

381
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,970
Are you sure it was Elizabeth?

382
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,450
Of course,they'll have to do a
DNA or dental match when they land,

383
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,170
but they're pretty sure,yes.

384
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,920
Man,I can't believe she's gone.

385
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,970
Elizabeth was one of the best
travel writers in the country.

386
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,020
How would you characterize
her relationships with others?

387
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,720
Uh,warm,friendly,outgoing--
not an enemy in the world.

388
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,120
Jump in any time,Dr. Sweets.

389
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,680
No,no,I'm cool.

390
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,220
Well,as long as you're cool.

391
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,730
Was Miss Jones on assignment?

392
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,610
No,no,this was a pleasure trip.

393
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,460
She had just finished a piece
for us on airline safety.

394
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,770
Ironic.

395
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,320
It was an expose on pilots that have hid
drunk driving convictions from their employers.

396
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,030
Bones,what is that?

397
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,350
Oh,tissue samples.

398
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,110
Oh,no,don't...

399
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,480
don't let people see that.

400
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,740
I need vodka.

401
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah,well,I do,too,Bones,but
you know what?We're working.

402
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,820
No,to preserve the tissue samples.

403
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,970
All they got left is bourbon and scotch.

404
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,480
Hold on.

405
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,880
Come on.

406
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,760
What?

407
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,690
Okay,hand it over.Hand
the vodka over.Come on.

408
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,600
Thought so.

409
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:18,820
Look,obviously,your mom
is sick and you love her,

410
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,430
and it's probably why
you're acting badly,

411
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,120
but what you gotta do is you gotta
think-- really think-- how to help her.

412
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,910
She's gonna die,okay?

413
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,370
What am I supposed to do about that?

414
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,010
Make her proud of you.

415
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,920
- Yeah?
- I just got a copy of Elizabeth Jones' next article.

416
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,560
It's about pilots with DUI convictions.

417
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,590
All right,is there a link
to anything on this flight?

418
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,550
I have a search team
looking for her research,

419
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,630
but I do know the airline you're on
is singled out as the worst offender.

420
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,490
And the pilot on your plane there?

421
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,940
He's got a past.

422
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,060
He's in the article.

423
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,220
****

424
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,290
You do realize that by sending my copilot
out,you broke about 40 laws,legal-wise.

425
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,090
Yeah,well,I thought
we might have a-- whoa!

426
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,980
a private man-to-man
conversation.

427
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,610
about Elizabeth Jones.

428
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,990
The name does not ring a bell.

429
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,020
So is this how you slow this plane down?

430
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,790
Please,don't touch that.

431
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,710
Don't touch anything.

432
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,390
Elizabeth Jones was a journalist.

433
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,750
- I do not know her.
- She knows you.

434
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,760
She wrote an article
about alcohol and pilots.

435
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,130
And what's that got to do with me?

436
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,130
2002 DUI,you never
reported that to the FAA.

437
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,160
You know,that is a $250,000
fine and five years in jail.

438
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,180
That DUI charge,it was the
day of my dad's funeral.

439
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,510
I know it's not stylish,but
I happen to love my old man.

440
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,970
Well,it's still a motive,legalwise.

441
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,920
I did not kill her.

442
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,360
I didn't even know she existed.

443
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,290
- I need you to slow this plane down.
- Why?

444
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,740
Well,to give us time
to find out who did,

445
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,770
unless it wassyou and in that
case,time,it doesn't matter.

446
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,690
I can report electrical
issues,maybe give you an extra hour.

447
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,350
All right,I'll take that as
a sign of cooperation,Captain.

448
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,090
It's a beautiful view.Look at that.

449
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,000
How long do I have to stay here?

450
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,000
I was interested in some of the
things you were saying earlier.

451
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,720
Hey,I answered every question
the scary woman asked me.

452
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,620
Yeah,well,the thing is,she's
a lawyer,so she's very direct.

453
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,010
- Scary.
- She has a knack for putting people into federal prison.

454
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,690
I believe she likes to do it.

455
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,230
I have a more psychological mojo.

456
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,960
You don't look like you have a mojo.

457
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,610
I'm interested in what you know
about Elizabeth Jones' personal life.

458
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,860
I did not have sex with that woman.

459
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,160
But you wanted to.

460
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,930
Yeah,but I didn't.

461
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,120
- Was she the type to have affairs?
- Yes.

462
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,530
Have you got a name?

463
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,140
I could go get Ms.Julian again,if
you you're more comfortable with her.

464
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,050
- Artie.All I know is "Artie."
- Artie,okay.

465
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,750
Well,let's talk about
Elizabeth and Artie.

466
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,270
Now,how resentful were you that
Elizabeth slept with him and not with you?

467
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,850
Well,he's married,I'm not,so,yeah,maybe
I'm a little resentful.

468
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,560
It's a Band-Aid.

469
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,450
Oh,yeah,thanks.

470
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,960
I was totally flummoxed.

471
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,170
So the clean part here
must be where it overlapped,

472
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,060
and the darker part must be where
it came in contact with the skin.

473
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,780
I'm not an expert,but I'm pretty sure even you
can't get a DNA result from a digital photograph.

474
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,610
No,but what about a finger size?

475
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,330
Right.That's kind of brilliant.

476
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,500
82 millimeters in circumference.

477
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,220
All right,well...

478
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,830
Mine's 62,so it's a pretty big guy.

479
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,290
Or overweight.

480
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,420
Look at the perforations,vertical
stretching along the pad.

481
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,660
I see it,but I have
no idea what it means.

482
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,160
It was locked in a bent position.

483
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,850
Oh,that would explain the creases.

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,030
So if I highlight the parts
where the adhesive wore off,

485
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,090
it was bent more than 90 degrees.

486
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,120
I really love...

487
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,470
working with you.

488
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,850
Me,too.

489
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,130
We're really good together...

490
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,990
at these things.

491
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,750
Yeah.

492
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,540
Gotta ask you something,Angela.

493
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,180
Yeah,I got that from
the fast double-back.

494
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,410
This thing with Roxie...

495
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,450
It's real,yeah.

496
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,590
No,I get that.

497
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,830
I see that.

498
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,880
Is that what got between us?

499
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,450
I'd love to say yes to that,because
I think it would make you feel better.

500
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,220
But you can fall in love with a man?

501
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,110
I'm sorry,but...

502
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,970
yes.

503
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,710
Ange?

504
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,900
Sweetie,God,totally
forgot you were there.

505
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,010
I guess you heard everything,huh?

506
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,960
Yes,it was fascinating.

507
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,050
Well,what do you think?

508
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,840
Well,the only joint that will bend over 90 degrees
is between the proximal and intermediate phalanges.

509
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,210
Right.

510
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,910
Finger stuff.

511
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,110
We're looking for a large person,probably
male,with inflammatory flexor tenosynovitis.

512
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,130
That's great,sweetie,but what
about the rest of the conversation?

513
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,380
Oh,I'm sorry,Ange,I
wasn't paying attention.

514
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,310
I need to go find a
passenger with trigger finger.

515
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,060
Thanks for the talk.

516
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,890
Excuse me,if I could have
your attention,please.

517
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,010
My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

518
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,960
The writer?

519
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:22,230
Yes.What we need to do now is find a passenger with a
laceration on their locked proximal interphalangeal joint,

520
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,250
so if everyone can look at their
neighbor's proximal interpha...

521
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,330
I tell you what,who would like a free
signed copy of Dr. Brennan's new book?

522
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,520
Raise your hands.Look at that,huh?

523
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:40,080
All right,so keep your hands up nice and high so
Dr. Brennan can count the number of books we need.

524
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,680
Hey,does anyone have a...

525
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,120
a question for Dr. Brennan?

526
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,810
Are you working on anything
right now,Dr. Brennan?

527
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,930
Yes.Keep your hands up.

528
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,200
What is that delicious smell?

529
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,220
Roast pork.

530
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,350
Oh,no,that delicious smell is the
difference between first class and coach.

531
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,010
How we doing there,Bones?

532
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,080
Booth...

533
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,870
- Hold that.
- Over here.

534
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,580
Hi.

535
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,730
- Booth?
- Yeah.

536
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,380
What's your name?

537
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,070
Just sign it to "Awesome Nick Devito."

538
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,250
What is the big deal?

539
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,950
I just got a little trigger finger.

540
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,340
I injured my tendon.

541
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,490
You like shooting a lot?

542
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,770
Yeah,I love shooting.

543
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,570
Doesn't mean I'm not a reader.

544
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,310
Okay,tell you what,come with us?

545
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,510
I don't know anybody
named Elizabeth Jones,no.

546
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,350
Hey,Sweets,are you still
with Elizabeth Jones' editor?

547
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,740
Yes,and I have...Okay,ask him if he
knows someone by the name of Nick Devito.

548
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,620
Is this like a question
to get my free book?

549
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,770
Where's your Band-Aid?

550
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,020
Do you know Nick Devito?

551
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,630
It must've come off while I was asleep.

552
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,310
I twitch...I'm twitchy.

553
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,670
I had lunch once with Danny Devito.

554
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,790
He says no.

555
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,910
I have information.

556
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,540
Elizabeth Jones was having an affair
with a man known only as "Artie."

557
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,490
The relationship's been
going on for over a year,

558
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,350
but it went bad in the last month or so.

559
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,270
He's married.His wife is sick
and his kid is a pain in the ass.

560
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,200
You know what,Sweets?You're
the man of the hour.

561
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,130
I owe you a beer and
a rye chaser,my friend.

562
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,430
That sounds like it would make me sick.

563
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,380
You can go back to your seat.

564
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,610
Why?

565
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,860
Well,we have a much better suspect.

566
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,540
I think you know why I'm here.

567
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,010
Look,I'm sorry about
my son--he's a teenager.

568
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,550
His mother's very ill.

569
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,840
It's not about your son,Artie.

570
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,080
It's about Elizabeth Jones.

571
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,300
My wife doesn't know about E.J.

572
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,750
I would like to keep it that way.

573
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,370
Did Elizabeth Jones ask
you to leave your wife?

574
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,140
From the very beginning,I told
Elizabeth that would never happen.

575
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,990
You see the shape that Ann's in?

576
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,970
My first priority right now is to
be a good husband and a good father.

577
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,800
By dragging a dying woman to China?

578
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,720
No,to stand on the Great Wall of China has
been Ann's dream since she was a little girl.

579
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,900
Our last chance to do something
amazing as a family together.

580
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,230
So Elizabeth Jones followed you?

581
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,790
Obviously.

582
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,940
And you killed her.

583
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Of course not.

584
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,480
Excuse me.

585
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,410
I am a lawyer.

586
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,290
Your wife didn't know about her?

587
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,690
She knows that there was someone.

588
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,160
Did you talk to Elizabeth?

589
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,050
Yes.I begged her to leave us alone.

590
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,580
Ann was asleep.

591
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,200
As I said,Agent Booth,I'm an attorney.

592
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,290
You have no evidence and very little
time before we land in Shanghai.

593
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,930
If you want to find out who killed E.J.

594
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,570
I suggest you not waste
any more time on me.

595
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,520
I enhanced the
photographs of the sternum.

596
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,730
Light was reflected
off of this area here.

597
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,110
Skin wouldn't do that.

598
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,770
There were tiny metal
shards embedded in the bone.

599
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,990
And silicon melted into it as well.

600
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,340
Fake boobs?How does that help?

601
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,170
Silicon,not silicone.

602
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,240
It was a chip of some kind-- a SIM card
from a phone,memory chip from a camera.

603
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,370
But we need to see it
to make a positive I.D.

604
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,730
How did it go with Bilbrey?

605
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,920
He's an attorney-- he's
not saying much of anything.

606
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,590
And the gun nut,Devito?

607
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,260
Most likely,his Band-Aid was
stuck to the wheel of a food cart.

608
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,440
Find me the smoking gun,cherie,or that killer
disappears into a billion people when you land.

609
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,970
129 billion.

610
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,200
Approximately.Are you pressuring us?

611
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,830
Have a lovely flight.

612
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,220
I was just contacted by
Shanghai International.

613
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,960
They've arrested a man named Felix Clossen,a
Dutch national who works for the airline.

614
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,030
He was passing stolen
credit card numbers.

615
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,590
That's fascinating,but we're more interested
in solving a murder investigation right now.

616
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,610
All the credit card numbers were
from passengers on this plane.

617
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,160
And Clossen is our flight
attendant's boyfriend.

618
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,040
Ming.

619
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,580
Your call to Clossen was made within minutes
of the victim being placed in the oven.

620
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,040
- Minutes.
- I got the credit card numbers off the computer and called them in to my boyfriend.

621
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,490
And Elizabeth Jones caught you?

622
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,640
Yes.

623
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,640
I mean,no.

624
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,770
Well,which one is it?

625
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,470
I didn't know who it was.

626
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,950
I heard them coming and figured it was
Kate,so I hid in the aeronautics compartment.

627
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,990
I couldn't hear because of the
engine noise in the compartment.

628
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,170
All I could see was their feet.

629
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,500
Well,male or female?

630
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,180
Uh,what kind of shoes?

631
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,420
They were wearing slippers,the
ones we give out in first class.

632
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,760
They're all the same.

633
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,210
They walked by me,and I ran upstairs.

634
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,190
I didn't kill anyone.

635
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,960
Whoever killed her has to have
traces of blood on their slippers.

636
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,950
That could cause the gun
to smoke for Caroline.

637
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,500
Look,Bones,you're
gonna need an ALS light.

638
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,890
Not even those dotty old mystery
buffs carry that in their giant purses.

639
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,580
We can make one.

640
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,490
- How are you gonna make one?  - I hope you can
do it fast--we're gonna be landing very soon.

641
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,580
No,no-- you're not landing this plane
until I tell you you land this plane,okay?

642
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,050
Remember,you're still a suspect.

643
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,170
It's not about
me or you--

644
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,620
Okay,Booth,we need the blue lamp
out of the overhead projector.

645
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,070
Do you,by any chance,have any
yellow-tinted shooting glasses?

646
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,780
Sure.What do you need--
daylight,artificial light or,uh,moonlight?

647
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,180
Let's see.

648
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,840
These will do.

649
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,570
Thanks.

650
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,810
This is brilliant-- they're
making an ALS emitter.

651
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,240
What's that for?

652
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,850
To find blood.

653
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,390
Ready?

654
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,490
- Got 'em.
- Hit the lights.

655
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,990
Easy,Bones.

656
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,950
Do you see anything?

657
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,180
No.

658
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,670
No.

659
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,020
Nothing.

660
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,040
What about over here?

661
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,120
- Right there.
- Mm-mm,nothing.

662
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,420
Oh,geez.

663
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,180
- Booth.
- Yeah?

664
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,900
Over there.

665
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,760
You got something?

666
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,660
Yes,there.

667
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,860
Are you sure?

668
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,920
Yes,Booth.

669
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,990
Turn the lights on.

670
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,680
What is going on,please?

671
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,290
Your son killed Elizabeth Jones.

672
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,290
Hey,how long till we land?

673
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,870
We're on our final descent.

674
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,100
Eli?That's impossible.

675
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,700
Oh,why?You can't think of a
motive,like maybe he loves his mother?

676
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,800
He wants to keep his family together?

677
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,790
You probably just think
he's some dumb-ass kid.

678
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,810
I beg your pardon?

679
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,030
Hey,listen,Caroline,I'm
ready to make an arrest.

680
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,130
You're more than
sure,right,cherie,you're damn sure?

681
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,020
Well,it's circumstantial,but
it's compelling.

682
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,320
- So,do you have a warrant to sign?
- Yes.

683
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,650
Well,sign it so I can make the arrest.

684
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,890
Just a minute,please.

685
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,540
That's the lawyer,right?

686
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,430
You can always tell a damn lawyer.

687
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,830
I represent my son,who is
also a minor,incidentally.

688
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,590
Minor?

689
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,710
A minor murderer.

690
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,790
Ladies and gentlemen,we are making our final
descent into Shanghai International Airport.

691
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,790
Please return your seats to the upright
position and turn off all electronic devices.

692
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,420
Booth,you're cutting
it pretty close there.

693
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,310
Yeah,I know.

694
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,050
What's going on?

695
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,530
We know you killed Elizabeth Jones.

696
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,310
Probably why you wanted
to get so drunk,huh,Eli?

697
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,040
Don't say a word,Eli,not a word.

698
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,770
You're making this arrest on the strength
of blood stains on the bottom of a slipper

699
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,380
that could belong to
anyone in first class.

700
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,870
- Booth?
- Okay,motive: the father was cheating on the dying wife with the victim.

701
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,620
Arthur...

702
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,170
You thought the family was safe
by getting away from the woman.

703
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,130
Booth,we're really close to the ground.

704
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,050
She shows up on the plane infirst class.

705
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,920
Not a word,Eli.

706
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,040
Booth,I can see people.

707
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,720
We have less than 30 seconds.

708
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,580
Booth!

709
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
Caroline,you gotta trust me on this.

710
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,800
Make the case,Agent Booth--
something more than motive.

711
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,220
- Bones...Yeah?
- Booth???

712
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,060
If this missing video game turns out to be the
computer chip embedded in the victim's sternum...

713
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,970
Where'd you lose the cartridge,Eli?

714
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,490
We got forensic corroboration.

715
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,270
"If"!She said "if"!

716
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,340
The moment this plane Sign it!

717
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,620
touches down,I lose jurisdiction.

718
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,650
This better be a good...

719
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,110
Sign the warrant.

720
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,070
Please.

721
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,750
Okay,make the arrest.

722
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,510
Eli Bilbrey,I am placing you under
arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Jones.

723
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,820
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law,

724
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,200
because this is the
United States of America.

725
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,490
Thank you.

726
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,160
Thank you very much.

727
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,220
Thank you.

728
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,040
Thank you.

729
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,050
Thank you.

730
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,330
Bones,the applause is for the landing.

731
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,600
Yes.I always wondered
why people did that.

732
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,630
Did you catch the murderer?

733
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,050
Yep.

734
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,120
That's great.

735
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,360
It's not great?

736
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,350
He was 16.

737
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,240
Dying mom,cheating father.

738
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,140
He just wanted to make it stop.

739
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,750
I'm sorry.

740
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,010
That counts as a crappy day.

741
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,190
You should probably just
go home and draw a bath.

742
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,380
I want you to come with me and stay.

743
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,730
Of course I'll stay.

744
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,840
I mean,I-I want you to...

745
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,490
move in with me.

746
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,850
- That isn't just because you've had a bad day,right?Because...
- No.It isn't.

747
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,890
You've never done that before,asked
someone to move in with you?

748
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,030
No.

749
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,200
You've...

750
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,200
lived with people at their place.

751
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,830
With my bag packed by
the front door,yeah.

752
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,340
Why aren't you saying anything?

753
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,420
Right.

754
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,680
Because you're gonna say no.

755
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,220
Yeah,I am.

756
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,450
I'm saying,"No,thanks."

757
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
Why?

758
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,240
It's too soon.

759
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,760
You aren't ready.

760
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,370
I'm not ready either.

761
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,900
Let's just see how things unfold,okay?

762
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,230
Okay.

763
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,700
What?

764
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,450
I'm always the one to say that.

765
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,090
Look what I found,huh?

766
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,100
There's that smile.

767
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,850
Thank you.

768
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,070
We don't even get to get off the plane?

769
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,650
No.They're refueling and
finding us another pilot,and...

770
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,730
go back home.

771
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,680
What about his parents?

772
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,230
They gotta fly back on their own dime.

773
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,450
Eli is in Federal custody now.

774
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,180
You want to get off the plane
to see those old Chinese bones.

775
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,060
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,720
It's not your fault.

777
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,960
Yeah,it is.'Cause I'm the one who
dragged you out of pure science and...

778
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,210
pulled you into murder-solving.

779
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,350
That's not how I remember it.

780
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,790
Really?

781
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,120
Yes.Well,as I recall,I had to
force you to take me into the field.

782
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,090
Really?

783
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,930
Yes.

784
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,610
You didn't want to,remember?

785
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,370
This is all my fault.

786
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,810
are you two gonna make out?

787
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,290
Hey,quiet-- you lost
your right to talk.

788
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,930
Why do people always
think we're gonna make out?

789
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,610
I say we let him sit back there
the entire trip back by himself.

790
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,550
He did kill someone.

791
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,450
And he ruined my dig.

792
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,500
Plus,you know he's gonna try
to drink all the champagne.

793
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,620
We're gonna need some for later.

794
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,260
To us.
