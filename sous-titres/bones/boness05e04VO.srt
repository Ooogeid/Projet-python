1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,284
<i>Everybody,
I've got fresh pineapples!</i>

2
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,505
Back off, sailor.

3
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,768
Grabbing the gay guy's
coconut boob... real cool, Dad.

4
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,493
Your old man is cool.

5
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,530
- Right, Nate?
- Massively cool, you're a glacier.

6
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,206
Aren't any of these nonalcoholic?

7
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,342
Do you some good to have
a couple drinks, loosen up a little.

8
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:44,668
All due respect,

9
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,630
I don't even understand
why gays even want to get married.

10
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,644
The same reason we do: family, kids,

11
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,296
the American Dream.

12
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:54,160
Exactly.
Thank you, Paula.

13
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,447
Our house has been
on the market for ten months.

14
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,832
Nobody wants the
American Dream anymore.

15
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,394
You're gonna love the'burbs once
we have a couple kids.

16
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,513
What's goin' on?

17
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,732
That's coming from the luau pit.

18
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,151
Trey, what's that noise?

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,772
For God's sake, Bob,
He's a gardener, not a servant.

20
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,994
He works for the
Homeowner's Association,

21
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,118
which means he works for us.
Am I wrong?

22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,536
Maybe the, pig's eyeballs
explode when it's done.

23
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,530
It shouldn't be done
for a couple more hours.

24
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,791
We should check and make sure
it's not burning.

25
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,253
<i>All right, stand back.</i>

26
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,630
<i>All right, look out, get back.</i>

27
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,215
<i>This is kosher, right?</i>

28
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:35,346
Elliot, will you get
the meat thermometer?

29
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:38,425
What, hon?

30
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:47,440
Is that a person?

31
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,533
That's a person!

32
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,402
He's been cooked!

33
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,632
Why are you standing there
like a security guard?

34
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:00,648
The remains we've been called to examine
were apparently barbecued.

35
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:03,289
- Would you like to see?
- Totally!

36
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,454
A person did not get barbecued.
Did they?

37
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,746
Yes. In a luau pit,

38
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,128
which is why I'm surprised
you'd bring Parker along.

39
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,769
Rebecca and her boyfriend
won a night at the Greenbrier,

40
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,695
so little kid's with me.
I got him.

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,218
- Let's go see the cooked person!
- You know our deal.

42
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,497
- What's your deal?
- We're not allowed to talk about

43
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,639
the bad parts of Dad's work
until I've armpit hair.

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,601
You don't have armpit hair last time
I checked. Not for a long time.

45
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,787
Angela, would you mind...?

46
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,398
No, sure.
I get the situation here.

47
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,901
- You're with me, Parker.
- I want to see the body.

48
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,561
Well, I agree
that does sound awesome,

49
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,782
but I have face paints that your dad
will never be able to get off,

50
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,440
No matter how hard he scrubs.
They're basically tattoos.

51
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,535
I'm with you.

52
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,488
You have a good time.
I'll pick you up in a little bit, OK?

53
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:46,540
Have fun...
with the face paints, kid.

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,115
That's not true about
the face paint, is it?

55
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,128
You're with me, Baby Booth.

56
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,209
Ethnographic studies of the suburbs
indicate a cultural impulsion

57
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,261
toward overt displays of status.

58
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,652
Of course, this competitive paradigm

59
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:04,475
can often result in
aggression and violence.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,938
There was this guy on my street
who cut his lawn on the diagonal.

61
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,895
The neighbors got angry.
Someone set his garage on fire.

62
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:14,031
I mean, yards, sidewalks,

63
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,447
you know, clean streets,
birds flying by.

64
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,280
A dead body in the barbecue pit.

65
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,305
I'm gonna go talk to the neighbors,

66
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,078
to see if anyone who cut their
lawn diagonally is missing.

67
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,444
I think those are reflective lenses

68
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,057
that have fused
to the supra-orbital margin.

69
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,226
The luau pit came with the house.

70
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:36,257
We installed a lockable cover.
We don't want kids falling in.

71
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,682
We're good neighbors.

72
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,973
- Who has a key?
- Just us.

73
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:42,290
And there's one
with the Neighborhood Watch.

74
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,098
Okay, who put the pig in the pit?

75
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,684
Me, Nate and Trey
at 9:00 this morning.

76
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,894
- Trey?
- Trey Jordan.

77
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,568
He's the gardener/handyman
for the Homeowner's Association.

78
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:55,442
- Stop staring at him.
- You were just talking about him...

79
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,611
Guys.
When you put the pig in...

80
00:03:57,914 --> 00:04:00,501
We didn't notice anything
down there but hot coals.

81
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,824
48 degrees Celsius.
That's, what, an hour after

82
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,744
they drenched everything
with a garden hose?

83
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,473
- Wish they hadn't done that.
- Well, it's human nature.

84
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,609
You see someone on fire,
you put 'em out.

85
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,902
Prominent brow points to a male.

86
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:15,629
Wear on his mandibular
teeth puts his age at about

87
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,631
30 to 35.

88
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:21,183
We should remove the remains
and then let Hodgins get down here.

89
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,073
We have the luau every year.

90
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:34,023
- The pit was dug maybe...
- Four years ago. July.

91
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,151
Same time we planted our hydrangeas.
That reminds me, we should spray.

92
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:41,155
Yeah, we all helped with the pit.
It's, four feet deep

93
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,405
and lined with brick;
you burn the wood to embers.

94
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,263
- You cheat with charcoal.
- Don't call your dad a cheater, Paige.

95
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,870
Anyway, tons of embers going,

96
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,041
then you throw down
a layer of wet burlap,

97
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,874
then wet leaves, then wet burlap,

98
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,418
chicken wire, then you
lower the pig in and voila.

99
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,880
- You're forgetting one thing there.
- I don't think so. Burlap, leaves...

100
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,049
He means the dead guy
under the pig, Dad.

101
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,777
Smart one in the family there.

102
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,053
So, what made you
crack open the pit early?

103
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,972
We heard little explosions,
like fireworks going off.

104
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:09,196
We found these in the pit.

105
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,117
Reflective aviators.

106
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,377
Those look like
Mr. Bessette's glasses.

107
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:16,398
- Oh, my God.
- That's Kurt?

108
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,610
- You must be mistaken.
- Everybody, looks like it was Kurt.

109
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,091
Who's Kurt?

110
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,811
He and his wife live over there.

111
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,356
That was creepy.

112
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,066
I warned you about the suburbs.

113
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,547

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

116
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,769
And you're certain it's Kurt?

117
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,126
I'm afraid so, Ms. Bessette.

118
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,212
His teeth match the X-rays
your dentist provided.

119
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,491
God...

120
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,792
Well, I already told the FBI guy

121
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,770
and the scary lady everything
I know, so I don't know what...

122
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,305
You mentioned that you and your husband
didn't really fit in

123
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:32,515
- with the neighborhood.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,534
Kurt put up a solar panel

125
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,392
and a wind turbine,
and it made everybody mad.

126
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,785
They thought they were pretty ugly.
They said they ruined the neighborhood.

127
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,757
But he just wanted to save the planet.
There's nothing wrong with that.

128
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,442
No, it's quite a noble cause.

129
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,282
But it can kind of rub people
the wrong way sometimes.

130
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:51,118
When the gay couple's dog
peed on the wind turbine,

131
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:55,080
Kurt gave the dog a laxative
that nearly killed him.

132
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:00,085
That... that's not quite so noble.

133
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,854
Neighbors don't forget
a thing like that.

134
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,341
We got shunned.

135
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,385
Found out what caused
the mini explosions.

136
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,797
Would it have anything to do with
the pebbles embedded in the remains?

137
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:20,083
If by pebbles, you mean
the rudaceous sedimentary

138
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,024
stratified clast fragments,
then yes.

139
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,687
Now, based on the amount of pyrites,

140
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,775
I'd estimate the porosity
at approximately 25%.

141
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,382
That's ideal for
moisture saturation.

142
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,661
Meaning the pebbles
exploded when they got hot.

143
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,718
The pebbles, as you so
quaintly call them,

144
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,553
were all found on the same
strata as the human remains.

145
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,537
Most likely dragged
from the murder site.

146
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,797
Which explains why they were
embedded.

147
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,383
All consistent in size and color.

148
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,338
Decorative, perhaps?

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,517
I'll call you back.

150
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,353
These bones are not human.

151
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,854
I assume they're pig.

152
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,641
- Time for prayers?
- Yes, but I have a couple of minutes.

153
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:07,778
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

154
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,740
As a Muslim, I imagine you consider
this work unclean.

155
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,451
Yes, well, as a Christian,
I imagine you feel the same way.

156
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,370
Four femurs, 12 phalanges,

157
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,435
dozens of teeth, 12 canines.

158
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,967
Luau custom says throw the pig bones
back in the pit.

159
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:24,586
- Sorry, sorry. Pig bones.
- I'm fine, Dr. Saroyan.

160
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,865
Perhaps the killer assumed
his victim's remains

161
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,924
would never be noticed
amongst the pig bones.

162
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,346
- There's no reason for you...
- I appreciate your concern,

163
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:32,450
but I'm fine.

164
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,888
Most of us aren't devout here,
and I respect your religion.

165
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,186
"He hath forbidden you
the flesh of swine,

166
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,351
"but if one is forced by necessity,

167
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,311
"without willful disobedience,

168
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:44,106
nor transgressing due limits,
then is he guiltless."

169
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,317
- Point is, you shouldn't feel forced...
- I'm a scientist, like the rest of you.

170
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,102
I can deal. So please just back off
and let me do my job like anyone else.

171
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,661
I apologize for my outburst.

172
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,164
You aren't even gonna try
to un-ring that bell?

173
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,972
I have to pray.

174
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,034
I found the rudaceous sedimentary

175
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,177
stratified clast fragment
mother lode.

176
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,264
Yeah, any signs
of a struggle in the pebbles?

177
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,564
I call do-over.

178
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,287
They're covered in blood.

179
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,274
Lots of blood.

180
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,422
My friend's dad
just got a new girlfriend.

181
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,476
He goes with his dad to her place
all the time to swim.

182
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,205
So he likes her.

183
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:41,872
Well, that's good.

184
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,841
Do you have a boyfriend?

185
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,816
No, I'm on a celibacy kick.

186
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,877
It's been five months and nine days,

187
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:52,216
which in celibacy time is 400 years.

188
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,177
- What does celibacy mean?
- It's...

189
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,931
- I don't have a boyfriend, no.
- How about my dad?

190
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,851
- I don't think he has a boyfriend
- No, he really needs a girlfriend.

191
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,871
Really.

192
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,229
- Why?
- To sex up.

193
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:09,191
- That's very succinctly put.
- Could Dad sex you up?

194
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,199
Don't think I haven't considered that,
I'm sort of on the sidelines for now.

195
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,073
But thank you for thinking of me.

196
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:19,346
Okay. Ready?

197
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,690
- Done.
- Cool.

198
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,395
- How'd you do that?
- I'm good.

199
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:32,804
- How much blood did Hodgins find?
- Plenty. He estimates a fatal amount.

200
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,008
Can you compare the blood
with the cooked guy ?

201
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,499
He's pretty cooked, but we'll try.

202
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,801
Hodgins also I.D.'d
morning glory pollen

203
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:42,015
between the victim's eyeballs
and his sunglasses.

204
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,184
- How is that relevant?
<i>- He said morning</i>

205
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,894
<i> glories only bloom after sunup.</i>

206
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,319
Sunrise was 5:47 a.m.,
so we're close to a time of death.

207
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:52,609
Were you guys aware that Arastoo
doesn't really have an accent?

208
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,152
Yeah, he does.

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,618
It's thicker than
Achmed the rug merchant.

210
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,949
Was that racist?
It sounded racist.

211
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,368
<i>I knew that despite
the fact that Arastoo said</i>

212
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,204
he was Iranian,
his accent was Jordanian.

213
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:08,250
Don't you find it odd that he was faking
an Arab accent of any kind?

214
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,252
Iranian isn't actually Arab.

215
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,004
What? Bones, it's weird!

216
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,922
Now how is it any more odd
than, say,

217
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,510
shaving your face
or putting on makeup?

218
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:20,262
I'm not hanging up because I don't have
an answer to that, I'm just hanging up.

219
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,750
But... I had questions about
the morning glories.

220
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,647
So, we understand that you
and the deceased had an altercation

221
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,783
over your dog?

222
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,470
You think that we cooked him
because he poisoned our dog?

223
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,142
- Kurt did not poison our dog.
- Yes, he did

224
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:41,532
Rocky peed on his stupid windmill,
and he gave our dog chocolate laxatives.

225
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,994
Dogs don't react to that
the way people do.

226
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,181
It's very difficult to overdose
on laxatives.

227
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,601
- All that will happen is...
- Rocky died from cancer.

228
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,667
Maybe.
We'll never know

229
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,836
because someone wouldn't
pay for the autopsy.

230
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,965
Oh, my God.
You won't let that go,

231
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,092
even though the FBI thinks that
we killed Kurt for poisoning our dog.

232
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,803
- We don't think that he poisoned him.
- He does.

233
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,453
Now that I think about it...

234
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,433
Rocky totally died of cancer.

235
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:13,470
Can you see anything that would explain
copious blood loss?

236
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:16,128
Not so far.
As you can see, here and here...

237
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,306
Can it, bub.
It's just you and me here.

238
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:23,367
This mark here on the scapula
suggests a puncture wound.

239
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,070
- And it's barely a poke, right?
- It would've been painful,

240
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,675
but no way it kills the guy.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,831
Here we see a bone laceration

242
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,793
on the victim's proximal humerus
adjacent to the greater tubercle.

243
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,170
Staining suggests that the injury
occurred before he died.

244
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,964
- Is that bone splintering?
- Yes, micro-fragments.

245
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,502
I believe the laceration's
the result of a blow

246
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,302
from a reciprocating-type weapon.

247
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:44,262
- Like?
- A saw.

248
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,901
I asked Dr. Hodgins
to swab for particulates

249
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,100
that may have been
transferred from the blade.

250
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:50,936
Here...

251
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,264
is the stab wound.

252
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:56,400
And the laceration from the saw.

253
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,945
Neither blow's anywhere near
a major vein or artery.

254
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,977
Neither blow explains
the amount of blood on the pebbles.

255
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:05,158
I ran a metal detector through the crap
we found at the bottom of the pit.

256
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:06,829
- Crap?!
- Yeah.

257
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:08,547
Technical term.

258
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,581
Bullet.
Is that a .44 caliber?

259
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,793
This seems to suggest,
rather convincingly,

260
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,152
the reason for all the blood.

261
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:29,144
Wait a second.
You and Parker discussed my sex life?

262
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:31,309
Well, we discussed your
lack of sex life.

263
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:35,147
Angela, neither you nor him,
know anything about my sex life.

264
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,608
Well, he knows that daddy ain't
getting any, and he's concerned.

265
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,778
He thinks you need
a girlfriend... to have sex.

266
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,158
- He said that?
- His exact words were, "To sex up."

267
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,994
I think you need to talk to him
honestly about your love life.

268
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,914
You kidding me? No offense,
but I'm not talking about that.

269
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,828
Want to run our 
neighborhood suburbanites

270
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,676
through the National
Gun Permit Database,

271
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,253
See if any of them own a. 44?
Hodgins found that in the pit.

272
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,023
Do you have a boyfriend?

273
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,843
- It's exactly how it started with me.
- Come on. Let's go.

274
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,518
I gotta get you back home,
or your mom's gonna kill me.

275
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,985
Let me see this stuff.
Does this stuff come off?

276
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,690
Seriously.
That's your big worry right now?

277
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:21,613
I hate Verbena Court.
Every last thing about it.

278
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:25,155
It's artificial, soulless...
that's why I'm trying to sell out.

279
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,407
It's ennui, Agent Booth,
do you understand that?

280
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
Looks kind of nice to me.
It's good for kids.

281
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,621
They call it a cul-de-sac,
but what it is is a dead end.

282
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,875
- So, why'd you move there?
- Wife wants kids; kids want lawns.

283
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,955
- Here. I got snookered in the math.
- Right. Thanks.

284
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,899
Snookered enough...

285
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,590
to snap?

286
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:48,220
So I own a handgun. So what?
I have a license, it's registered.

287
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,888
We found this bullet in the pit
with Bessette's body.

288
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,972
We checked out his bank records.

289
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:57,020
You wired $5,000
into his account last month?

290
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,019
Verbena Court was built with a
limited amount of phone lines.

291
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:02,901
Bessette bought them all.
I wanted to put in a second line.

292
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,820
Your neighbor charged you $5,000
for a phone line?

293
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,795
Yup.

294
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,534
Then he spent the five grand
on putting up the damn windmill.

295
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,037
Okay, so he rips you off for five grand,
you snap and you shoot him.

296
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,026
No.

297
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,976
I should've shot him.

298
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,377
It wasn't Kurt I shot, though.
I shot the pig.

299
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,004
- The luau pig.
- Excuse me?

300
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,974
Bob Sayles and I found
a farm in North Carolina

301
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:27,926
and paid to hunt our own pig.

302
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,469
With a handgun?

303
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,465
I'll give you the name of the farm.

304
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:35,495
Porky walked right up to us.
I popped him one between the eyes.

305
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,310
I barfed, Bob cried.

306
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,881
Suburban hunters.

307
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,275
That's an oxymoron, my friend.

308
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,817
It's an oxymoron.

309
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,211
No, no,
you can't just walk in here...

310
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:54,411
Arastoo Vaziri, our Muslim intern,
he's been faking his accent.

311
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:57,581
At first I go where everyone
else goes, you know, terrorist.

312
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,153
Wouldn't a terrorist fake
not having an accent?

313
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:03,593
Is it crazy or just weird?
Weird, I can deal with, but crazy...

314
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,630
- Wait. What do you want me to do?
- Crazy is your department.

315
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,050
They went to a farm
and shot an innocent pig in the head?

316
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:16,150
It's not a Federal offense, Bones.
There's nothing we can do about it now.

317
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,169
So let's just focus
on the murdered human.

318
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:19,909
Okay, so far, we have...

319
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,804
a nick on the scapula,
suggesting stabbing,

320
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,212
and splintering on the humerus,
which suggests sawing.

321
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,260
But neither explains bleeding out.

322
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,733
Sweets says he has something
he'd like to share with us.

323
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,229
Why does he have to say "share"?
Why can't he just say "show"?

324
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,743
- What do you have?
- Hey.

325
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,816
Suburbanites tend to put
too much emphasis

326
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:39,956
on their outward accomplishments.
Now, this creates a sense of detachment.

327
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,919
- Ennui.
- Very insightful.

328
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,558
- That's right.
- All right.

329
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:44,878
The inherent uniformity

330
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,173
and shared ideals of a planned
community suggest that the neighborhood

331
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,317
can be psychologically analyzed
as a single, dysfunctional personality.

332
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,346
You mean you can look at it
anthropologically?

333
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,099
- You're gonna Shanghai my discipline?
- You're tapping into what we call

334
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,810
"lines of influence,
dominance and suasion."

335
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,954
Go on, Sweets.
Just let him go on.

336
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,294
So we can look at the community

337
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,496
as a single dysfunctional
personality,

338
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,653
dealing with sexual infidelity,

339
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,946
- indebtedness, resentment...
- That's what I said.

340
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,491
It's murder.
We're either dealing with money or sex.

341
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,338
That's what I said.
And this is...

342
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:19,162
where psychology can provide an insight
that anthropology cannot.

343
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,652
- I doubt that.
- Well, suburbanites

344
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:24,672
will not only lie to outsiders,
they'll lie to each other

345
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,378
- and to themselves.
- What he means

346
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,423
is that societal norms endemic
to the suburban acculturation

347
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,219
dichotomize exterior postures
and clandestine protocols.

348
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,471
Give me one thing
to help me catch the murderer.

349
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,848
All right, deal with these people

350
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,189
as separate elements

351
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:44,193
of one big collective personality.

352
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,514
Identify the threat
that Kurt Bessette posed

353
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,901
to their psychological equanimity,
and the killer will emerge.

354
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,154
- I agree.
- It doesn't help me one bit.

355
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:54,920
Why?

356
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,450
- You seriously believe all that hoo-ha?
- It's anthropology, so, yes.

357
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,315
Wrong "ology." Keep your grubby
anthro hands off my psych.

358
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,712
Bones, I'll meet you down in the car
in five minutes.

359
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,163
What?

360
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:08,701
Five minutes.

361
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,425
What?

362
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,173
Okay, look...

363
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:16,928
Parker has been asking
all the women that I work with

364
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,304
to be my girlfriend.

365
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,882
- The women you work with are beautiful.
- Don't turn this

366
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,634
into a conversation about sex.
My kid is eight years old here.

367
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,062
Parker's pre-adolescent,
but he's concerned with sex.

368
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,064
What he's concerned about are shoes.

369
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,194
There are five stages of
psychosexual development:

370
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,695
oral, anal, phallic,

371
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,494
latent and genital.

372
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,389
Now Parker's transitioning
from latent to genital.

373
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,701
At the genital stage,

374
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,896
he's learning to identify with
his gender parent. That's you.

375
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,143
He's looking at you
to see his sexual future.

376
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:46,332
How do I stop this?

377
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,210
My advice is to let him see you
interact with a woman.

378
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,017
- Easy!
- No, not sexually. Socially.

379
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:55,294
Show him you're comfortable with women
so he can learn to be the same way.

380
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,218
- Okay.
- Okay? Just like that?

381
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,221
- You're taking my advice?
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.

382
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:04,306
Wait.
This isn't my office.

383
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,214
What are you doing?

384
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:49,065
"Alibis."

385
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,038
It's very organized.

386
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,116
"At the time of the murder,

387
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:56,444
"Mary Kay Sayles was biking
with James Perry and Elliot Lindbergh."

388
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,085
I'm thinking gay guy
and 'burb hater are out biking

389
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:00,532
with church lady.

390
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,175
So you're thinking
they're a sexual threesome?

391
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,146
What? No. I was just thinking

392
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,031
that one of these cyclists
was having sex with Kurt Bessette.

393
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,044
So we should find out where
churchy lady's husband and gay guy's

394
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,666
boyfriend and 'burb hater's wife
were at that time.

395
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,139
If this turns out to be some

396
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,225
suburban-key-party-
threesome-revenge-slaying,

397
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,469
it's gonna get
complicated and I'm gonna get...

398
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:24,795
So I finally got through
the particulates left behind by the saw.

399
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,227
Three different
organic remnants on the cut:

400
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,519
a hooked thorn from
the Bougainvillea glabra,

401
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,461
a haw from a hybrid
Crataegus monogyna

402
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:35,052
and nectar from a Syringa
protolaciniata.

403
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:38,636
- Each plant was from a different yard.
- But all on the same reciprocating saw.

404
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:39,643
Yeah.

405
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,791
So, my question is,
did you kill Kurt Bessette

406
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,626
on your own volition

407
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:56,643
- or did his wife talk you into it?
- What?

408
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,874
Bessette was attacked
with your hedge trimmer.

409
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:01,551
Come on.
Young hot suburban gardener,

410
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,637
- bored suburban housewives.
- You're an ethnological trope.

411
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,224
- What?
- Iced tea is not the only perk here.

412
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,518
Look, I had nothing going
with Kurt Bessette's wife.

413
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,881
Let me make this a little easier
for you, shall we?

414
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,514
Which one of these people did
you have something going with?

415
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:27,725
Paige Sayles.

416
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,815
The church lady's daughter.

417
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,779
She's 18, she's legal.

418
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,709
And, plus, it was her idea.

419
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:36,294
And?

420
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:42,506
Paula Lindbergh, I think
she was trying to get pregnant

421
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,674
so her husband would
stay in the suburbs.

422
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,638
So, you mind being used
as a stud horse?

423
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:50,433
- Would you?
- Do these women know about each other?

424
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,810
- Not from me.
- Then from who?

425
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,185
Mr. Bessette caught me

426
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,148
and Mrs. Lindbergh
sloshing up her hot tub.

427
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,444
Where were you between the hours
of 5:00 am and 8:00 am

428
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,175
the morning of the luau?

429
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:06,366
I've got a girlfriend.
I mean, back in my neighborhood.

430
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,785
A real one who I love.
I was with her.

431
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,548
That cul-de-sac is like a sex camp.

432
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:18,506
- What? There's a sex camp?
- No, no, no. Listen,

433
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:23,104
- what were your anthropological lines?
- Influence, dominance and suasion.

434
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:26,446
We both know that the murder victim
wasn't above shaking someone down

435
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:28,429
for a phone line,
so maybe he finds out

436
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,976
that Paula Lindbergh is
trying to make babies with the gardener,

437
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,481
he puts the squeeze on her,

438
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:35,269
she kills him and Casanova
gardener boy helps out.

439
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,980
Definitely fits the paradigm.

440
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,980
I was afraid this would come up
when I heard you took Trey

441
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,251
- for questioning.
- You were right. So start talking.

442
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,696
I should never have made
Elliot move to the suburbs.

443
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:47,615
In a way, I emasculated him.

444
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,035
Oh, God. She's a therapist.
She talks like a therapist.

445
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:54,872
What? You remove a man from an
environment where he flourishes

446
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,875
to a place where he feels impotent,
he actually becomes impotent.

447
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,712
If you wanted a baby so bad,
why didn't you move back to the city?

448
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:03,737
We owe more on this
house than it's worth.

449
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,551
And even if Elliot could sell it,
we're stuck financially.

450
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,385
What happened when Kurt Bessette
found you with the gardener?

451
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,180
Nothing. He smirked.

452
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:15,977
Did Kurt threaten to tell
your husband or blackmail you?

453
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:18,271
- No. He wouldn't dare.
- Why not?

454
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,181
Wait, you think that
Kurt told my husband

455
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:23,401
about the gardener, and
so Elliot killed him?

456
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:28,197
Elliot puked when he shot a pig.
Please.

457
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,250
Interlocking lines of suasion
between members of the collective

458
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,490
result in multiple duplicities.

459
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:36,372
My God. She's an anthropologist.
She talks like an anthropologist.

460
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,053
- Just answer the question.
- Why wouldn't Kurt Bessette dare

461
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:42,193
- tell your husband about the gardener?
- I'm a trained therapist.

462
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,910
I looked at Kurt and Paige
talking on the street.

463
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,487
I knew immediately that their
relationship was clandestine.

464
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:48,634
Probably sexual.

465
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,846
Kurt Bessette was sleeping
with that 18-year-old girl.

466
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,135
I used that knowledge to ask
for our five grand back for the phone.

467
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,066
Kurt wouldn't have agreed
if it weren't true.

468
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,031
If I were you, I'd be looking at
Paige's father for this murder,

469
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,983
not my Elliot.

470
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,161
Okay, yeah, Kurt and I hooked up.

471
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:18,664
I'm of age. He didn't break any laws
sleeping with me.

472
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,083
What did you see in him?

473
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,367
Kurt wasn't like the other guys
from here.

474
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:24,579
He wasn't just cute,

475
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:28,376
he was committed to the environment,
saving our planet.

476
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:32,261
People hated him because he made them
feel ashamed they weren't doing more.

477
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,722
I think what they
hated was the windmill.

478
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,100
You know, it's possible having
sex with you killed him.

479
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:39,519
No, Kurt was in awesome shape.

480
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,163
No, I didn't mean that
you gave him a heart attack.

481
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:44,690
What I meant was,
it's possible that someone

482
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,151
who cares about you killed him.

483
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,154
Like my Dad, you mean?

484
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,031
Or Trey the gardener.

485
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,452
But they didn't even
know about Kurt.

486
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,510
What if they did?

487
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,506
Is this an official
FBI investigation?

488
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,309
Do I need some kind
of representation?

489
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:14,262
Yeah, the whole accent thing
it's kind of out in the world.

490
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,705
I figured.

491
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:20,850
This place, the Jeffersonian...

492
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:23,563
they see things
in very black-and-white terms.

493
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,051
Comes with the gig.

494
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,678
- We're scientists.
- Yes,

495
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,527
but unlike any of them,
you're religious.

496
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,082
- Muslim.
- Now...

497
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:33,322
this man I see
in front of me right now,

498
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:36,512
rational, pragmatic,
highly intelligent,

499
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,794
that man might have to explain

500
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,317
his religion to people like that
every single day.

501
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:45,401
Whereas a kid from the sticks of Iran,
newly arrived in the West,

502
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:47,837
it's no wonder he clings to
his cultural superstitions.

503
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,466
There you go. Frustrating enough
to drive a guy to fake an accent.

504
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:53,926
Which, in my professional
opinion, is not crazy.

505
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,132
You're a pretty smart guy.

506
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:59,568
But I don't need a scientist
to tell me who or what I am.

507
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,656
And neither should you, Mr. Vaziri.

508
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,100
- Thanks for coming by.
- Thank you.

509
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:10,283
Tox screen came back positive
for potassium nitrate,

510
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:12,945
which can be prescribed
for high blood pressure...

511
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,281
<i>... but Kurt Bessette
was in very good shape.</i>

512
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,783
Yes, we heard that from
his teenage girlfriend.

513
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,561
<i>- Enough to kill the guy?</i>
- Nope.

514
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:23,080
He might have some muscle weakness,
but otherwise saltpeter is harmless.

515
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,833
Saltpeter is not harmless, okay?
I went to Catholic school.

516
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,501
That's a total myth, Booth.

517
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,712
No, he did actually
go to a Catholic school.

518
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,631
<i>No, the nuns used to put saltpeter</i>

519
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,870
in all the boys' milk at lunch
so that we couldn't get...

520
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,470
<i>So we could concentrate without...</i>

521
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:38,738
You know!

522
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,007
Ping?

523
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,808
How could you tell that it was
in the boys' milk and not the girls'?

524
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,478
- 'Cause it was always frothier.
- And did it work?

525
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,856
- Not on me.
- It didn't work on anyone, Booth.

526
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,691
<i>Why people insist upon believing</i>

527
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,873
that old wives' tale in the face
of all evidence, I'll never understand.

528
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,821
Saltpeter acts as a blood thinner.

529
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,990
See? Thin blood could stop a guy...

530
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,150
We've been saying
that the two wounds

531
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:03,079
we found on the victim's body
wouldn't be enough for him to bleed out.

532
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,200
But with saltpeter,
he could have bled internally

533
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,501
from even minor soft tissue damage.

534
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,836
We'd never have seen
that evidence after he cooked.

535
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,546
We got a probable cause of death.

536
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,591
Now we just need to find out who
fed Kurt Bessette the saltpeter.

537
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,386
I think you'll want to talk
to the cheating bastard's wife.

538
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:22,771
I begged Kurt
to stop cheating on me.

539
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:25,296
I did everything I could
in the bedroom to make him stay.

540
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,333
I changed my hair.
I went to the gym.

541
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,518
But when I went to work, it was a
"cat's away, mice play" situation.

542
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:33,109
Where did you get the saltpeter?

543
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,989
Nate and James have stump remover.

544
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,199
And that's 98% saltpeter.

545
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,661
I figured that might be enough
to remove Kurt's stump from her garden.

546
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,332
Who else knew he was cheating?

547
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,464
Nobody.

548
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:52,169
- Unless her husband found out.
- Husband?

549
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,714
Kurt Bessette was sleeping
with the church lady.

550
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:57,675
Do you think her husband
is capable of murder?

551
00:27:58,091 --> 00:27:58,968
Bob? No.

552
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:03,014
He's just a big dumb-ass knob
who thinks Verbena Court is Heaven.

553
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,162
That was before he knew the neighbor

554
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,019
was having sex with both
his wife and his daughter.

555
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,438
I don't care how big of
a dumb-ass Bob Sayles is.

556
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,898
He finds out, he's going
to want to kill her husband.

557
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:21,782
How did you find out about Kurt?

558
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,290
Only the two of us knew
and Kurt's dead.

559
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,371
You were not the only person
that Kurt was sleeping with.

560
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:29,915
Aside from his wife?

561
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:33,813
So I wasn't his only...

562
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:37,298
Who? Who else?

563
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,760
He was sleeping with your daughter.

564
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,600
You can understand why
you were a suspect.

565
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:52,536
People kill out of jealousy.

566
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,649
I guess it won't matter
if I deny it.

567
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,745
But you're not our prime suspect.
You see, you have an alibi.

568
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,031
You were out biking with James
Perry and Elliot Lindbergh.

569
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:06,702
So you think Kelly found out
and killed her own husband?

570
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:12,989
My God, she's only 18.

571
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:19,659
You think my Bob found out
and killed Kurt?

572
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,547
I found evidence
of a homogenous mixture

573
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:37,135
of oily and waxy long-chain,
which are non-polar hydrocarbons

574
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,984
in this fracture of the skull.

575
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,612
Can't you say lubricant?
Isn't that much quicker?

576
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,129
Arastoo must be finished looking at
the mini-fractures in that area.

577
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,132
- Where is he?
- Sorry.

578
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:49,286
I just finished morning prayers.

579
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:54,561
Skull fracture is located
high on the frontal bone,

580
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,877
right on the midline.

581
00:29:58,716 --> 00:29:59,755
Who are you?

582
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:04,969
I don't have an accent.
I was faking it.

583
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:07,871
But I am devout.
I do pray five times a day.

584
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,810
Now can we get back to work, please?

585
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,582
Definitely not.

586
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,230
- How do we know you're not faking?
- Does Brennan know about this?

587
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:17,898
She doesn't care.

588
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:20,401
She doesn't.

589
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,028
The midline fracture...

590
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,142
Things will go a lot
faster if you just explain.

591
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,016
When I speak as I just got off,
people accept my religious convictions.

592
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,747
Plus, fewer terrorist jokes.

593
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,583
- Don't know why.
- They're afraid.

594
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:38,186
You are so going to pay for this.

595
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,588
I have no doubt.

596
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,507
Now, this wound has a distinctive

597
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,958
curve shape to it.

598
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,719
It doesn't look very severe.

599
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,904
Corresponding microfractures

600
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,614
to the posterior cranium
indicate that Kurt was hit

601
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,601
while resting his head
on a hard surface.

602
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,729
A weak blow that was delivered
when Kurt was already on the ground?

603
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:59,106
There's a concrete base
on the wind turbine.

604
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,858
Bob Sayles is a big burly man.

605
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,652
- But he's a decent guy.
- What does that have to do?

606
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:07,281
 They have a harder time hitting
a guy when they're already down.

607
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:09,283
Not a weak blow, a half-hearted one?

608
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,784
This mark here

609
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,828
could be congruent with a golf club.

610
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,915
It's curved and metallic.
I could run up an image.

611
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:19,088
Most clubs have brazing composition
to secure the titanium alloy

612
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,961
that's on the club head.
I can check.

613
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,653
So a reciprocating saw,

614
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:24,741
a golf-club with some lubricant.

615
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,635
That just leaves the
puncture weapon unidentified.

616
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,782
- It takes a village.
- I beg your pardon?

617
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:35,005
A village to raise a kid properly.


618
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,704
Metaphorically it doesn't mean

619
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,207
we all must grow up
in hamlets of 800 people or less.

620
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:41,690
Will you be my village?

621
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,319
I need Parker to know that I
lead a full and rewarding life.

622
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:47,367
- But you don't.
- What? Yes, I do.

623
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:49,920
You work too much,
you don't socialize,

624
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,234
which prevents you
from having a full sex life.

625
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,203
Please, let's just take a hint

626
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,775
from the suburbs
and just make it look good.

627
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,060
You want to know if
I'll help you fool your son

628
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,098
into thinking your
life is gratifying?

629
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,893
- Will you do it?
- How?

630
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,714
Come to dinner with us.
Have fun. Laugh at my jokes.

631
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,314
That might actually
turn out to be fun,

632
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,427
thus becoming
a self-fulfilling desire.

633
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:11,929
Right. You'll do it?

634
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,266
I will be your hamlet
of 800 people or less.

635
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:16,559
My village.

636
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:19,520
I was being amusing.
You should laugh at my jokes, too.

637
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,855
- I am on the inside.
- So I just told

638
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,451
Bob Sayles that both
his wife and daughter

639
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,068
were having sex with Bessette.

640
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,487
- Was he shocked?
- And he wasn't faking it.

641
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:31,076
You shouldn't say
that like it's a fact.

642
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:33,926
In my opinion,
his dismay was genuine.

643
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:36,566
However, it's difficult
to say whether the shock

644
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,408
was due to the sexual revelations

645
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,976
or if we discovered information
he was keeping secret.

646
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,777
- I appreciate the distinction.
- Hold on to that for a second.

647
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,539
You do the best you can.

648
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:51,151
You go to work, you bring home
the bacon, you raise a daughter.

649
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,749
Have you got daughters?

650
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,015
That's the trip, man...
Daughters.

651
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,575
I was so worried about Paige
and that gardener,

652
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,648
I didn't see what
was happening with Kurt.

653
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,479
What do you do, preach abstinence?

654
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:05,189
Doesn't work in Alaska, why
would it on Verbena Court?

655
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,735
Did you suspect anything
about your wife?

656
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:09,937
I gotta confess...

657
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,369
If I'd have known that,

658
00:33:12,494 --> 00:33:14,681
I'd have killed the son of a bitch,
bare hands.

659
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,702
There's not a jury
that would convict me,

660
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:18,415
That is untrue.

661
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,706
They most certainly
would have convicted you.

662
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,333
You have an alibi?

663
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,176
I was home alone, sleeping in,

664
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:27,088
after getting that pig pit
all dug and ready and lit.

665
00:33:28,402 --> 00:33:29,996
Why would Mary do this to me?

666
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,009
I've been a good husband,
good provider.

667
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:33,594
I took two jobs.

668
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:34,887
Two jobs?

669
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,598
We only have you down
as a CPA for an airline.

670
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,772
Me and Kurt

671
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,268
started a side business
on the Internet.

672
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:43,979
You and Kurt Bessette
had a business together?

673
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:46,607
It was good.

674
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,053
Can you continue
the business without him?

675
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,110
No way.

676
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:51,947
He was the entrepreneur.

677
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,405
I just handled the books.

678
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,657
What kind was it?

679
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,000
The only kind
that's recession-proof.

680
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:02,790
Sex toys.

681
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,440
Guy goes into the sex toy
business with another guy,

682
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:13,133
who commences to nail
his wife... and daughter.

683
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:19,848
Probably using some
of the merchandise here

684
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,482
to double the fun?

685
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,938
Looks like we found

686
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,306
the lubricant.

687
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:33,678
Oh... my God.

688
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,292
Tell me this has
something to do with the case.

689
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,566
This comprises the contents
of the Sayles' family garage.

690
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,370
Brennan asked me and Arastoo to
look for murder weapons.

691
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,753
We find the lube.

692
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,707
Enough to make
the neighborhood smile.

693
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:47,292
And there's

694
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:48,603
this.

695
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,061
That looks...

696
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,992
- scary.
- Wasn't a golf club.

697
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:54,492
No brazing agent or titanium.

698
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,544
Could it have been this?

699
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,605
What about this lubricant?

700
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,452
It's not the right.

701
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,392
The lubricant contains hexane

702
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,136
silicone, mineral oil
and propellant.

703
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,438
Used for a bicycle chain.

704
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:14,139
I think I found the weapon.

705
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,424
This point matches
the puncture wound.

706
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,161
Those signs are
on every lawn on the cul-de-sac.

707
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,192
He was the head
of the Neighborhood Watch.

708
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,898
He distributed the signs.

709
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:25,259
You're gonna need
to luminol every sign.

710
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,458
You tell me to stop looking
through all of this.

711
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:28,792
I'm afraid so.

712
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:32,689
- I'll go tell Booth about the lube.
- Spoilsport.

713
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,794
Finding likely murder
weapons way too fast.

714
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:45,365
Any blood?

715
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,032
Nothing?

716
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,304
Positive for blood here.

717
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,306
Someone stabbed him
with his own sign.

718
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,020
Curved,

719
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,147
metallic object
I thought might be a golf club?

720
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:34,816
Her shoes.

721
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,610
Silicone lubricant.

722
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,025
You kicked Kurt Bessette in the head

723
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,697
while he was lying in the pebbles.

724
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,492
You were with James and
Elliot that morning.

725
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,955
The three of you
each gave him a separate blow.

726
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:51,332
Any one of you could
have taken the saw

727
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,896
from the gardener's truck.

728
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:54,752
- And the sign.
- We have alibis.

729
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,462
You're each other's alibis.

730
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,840
All three of you were
together at the time of death.

731
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,259
Your alibi just turned into
an anti-alibi.

732
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:07,793
Take these
three into custody, please.

733
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,487
- Yes, sir!
- Got it!

734
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,728
Hands behind your back now.

735
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,190
Right now!
Let's go!

736
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,912
Three separate injuries
to the body and...

737
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:30,121
- three suspects.
- Access to the luau pit.

738
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:33,349
The evidence indicates that
we caught the murderers.

739
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,543
I believe you did
catch the right people.

740
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:36,878
What's your problem?

741
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:38,379
Motive.

742
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,299
James was angry that Kurt
poisoned the dog.

743
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,302
Elliot Lindbergh
was ripped off for $5,000.

744
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,225
My problem is, all these motives

745
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,889
were a long time cooking.

746
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,181
These weapons...

747
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,289
a sign, the hedge trimmers,

748
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:53,521
kicking him, all suggest...

749
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:56,063
Heat of the moment, right?
Not premeditation.

750
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,274
You want to know why they
snapped at that moment.

751
00:37:58,536 --> 00:37:59,793
Now, picture it:

752
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:00,918
It's dawn,

753
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,988
three cyclists are heading out.

754
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,073
They spot Kurt.
They approach him for some reason.

755
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,243
They argue,

756
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,925
and then, with all this pent-up rage,
they attack.

757
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:12,492
One slice, one jab, one kick.

758
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:15,033
They didn't know that he
was full of the blood thinner,

759
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:16,584
that he would die.

760
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,459
Why is this matter?
We already have the responsible.

761
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,541
'Cause it's knowledge.

762
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,216
It's insight into humans.
It's why I do what I do.

763
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:26,093
It's a good answer.

764
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,426
It was a good answer.

765
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:32,099
Fine.
Okay, Kurt must have

766
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,144
violated some ethos of the suburbs.

767
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,647
Like cheating on his wife
or ripping off his neighbors.

768
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,524
Those are all accepted derivations
of the suburban ethos.

769
00:38:41,383 --> 00:38:44,426
Cam said that one of her neighbors
had his garage burned down

770
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:46,684
for cutting his lawn
on the diagonal.

771
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,459
- The windmill.
- It was the last straw.

772
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,326
It's ugly, makes a horrible sound,
destroys home values...

773
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,649
It's the diagonal
lawn of Verbena Court.

774
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:08,159
This is basically vodka

775
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:10,847
with a very, very
subtle hint of pepper.

776
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:14,807
- None for me.
- It's technically illegal moonshine,

777
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:17,478
but we are scientists
honing our craft.

778
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,147
- I don't drink alcohol.
- OK, let's have it.

779
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:21,892
- What?
- How do you balance

780
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,685
an archaic religious belief

781
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,529
with a life devoted to science?

782
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,947
This is exactly
what I hoped to avoid.

783
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,726

You let the accent slip.

784
00:39:30,755 --> 00:39:32,858
There's no conflict
between Allah and science.

785
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,680
Allah created the mystery
of the world, and science

786
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:37,928
struggles, and mostly fails
to explain.

787
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:39,801
The search for truth is honorable,

788
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:42,003
and I honor Allah
through the search for truth.

789
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:43,323
I get that.

790
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,673
But what's with
the "Kill the infidel" routine?

791
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,676
It's times I wish I drank alcohol.

792
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,053
"Fight and slay the unbeliever."

793
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:53,973
I prefer the other option, which
is to enslave the unbeliever.

794
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:57,970
It's a joke.

795
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,661
That was funny.

796
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,225
Is this done?

797
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,617
Not quite.
I have one more question.

798
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,025
If you took the
greatest Celtics players

799
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,032
and put them against the greatest
Lakers, who win?

800
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,241
Including when the Lakers
played in Minneapolis?

801
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,744
- The Celtics.
- Okay, I got one.

802
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:18,205
Pit the greatest Christians
against the greatest Muslims.

803
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,753
You just got smote.

804
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:30,004
This is fun.
Isn't it?

805
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:32,460
Yes. I'm having fun.
Is he?

806
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:34,013
You can ask him.

807
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:36,944
Are you having fun?

808
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:40,478
Milk shakes are fun, I'm having one,
so, I'm having fun.

809
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:44,024
- That's an excellent syllogism.
- She thinks I'm silly?

810
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,901
What's wrong?

811
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,752
He needs a girlfriend.

812
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:51,426
- Why doesn't he have one?
- I don't know.

813
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,408
That's another thing we can't talk about
until I have hair under my arms.

814
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,659
What do you say we all go bowling?


815
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,204
Couldn't you?

816
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:00,793
- You gotta quit that.
- That would be inappropriate.

817
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:02,834
- Why?
- Because...

818
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:07,172
- We work together.
- That's a stupid reason.

819
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,966
I'm really not comfortable with
the questions you're asking.

820
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,718
Can you trust me for a second,

821
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,376
I can say the right thing.

822
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:16,825
In the time that I've been with you,
I've learned how to deal with people.

823
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,159
Your father is very,
very good with people.

824
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:22,187
Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?

825
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,521
And we're off.

826
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:25,925
Okay. All right.

827
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:27,944
Can I ask you a question?

828
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:30,695
Why do you think{\ your father
needs a girlfriend so much} that?

829
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:33,115
Look, there's a whole
gender-parent dealy-bob

830
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,592
thing going on here.

831
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,117
You're going to confuse him.

832
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,659
I can have a pool.

833
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:41,080
- He doesn't sound confused.
- A pool?

834
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:43,582
Lasky's dad got a pool
with his girlfriend.

835
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,892
You mean Lasky with

836
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:48,344
- third nostril?
- Lasky's dad got a girlfriend.

837
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,422
They married and moved
to a house with a pool.

838
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,258
Maybe, if you got married,
you'd move

839
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:54,718
to a house with a pool
that I could swim in.

840
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,526
He seems extremely clear on why
he wants you to get a girlfriend.

841
00:41:57,651 --> 00:41:59,223
Why you didn't just ask him?

842
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,925
The whole reason

843
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,793
you wanted me to get a girlfriend
was so that you could have a pool?

844
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:07,747
Why else would I care?

845
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,325
There is a pool

846
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:11,027
in my building...

847
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,820
That the two of you can use

848
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,073
as my guests anytime.

849
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,365
Awesome, right?

850
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:17,575
Not awesome.

851
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,203
Simple Socratic method
of solving a problem.

852
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:23,497
Parker is right.
You're awesome.

853
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,868
I'm awesome.

854
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,990
Cheers.
