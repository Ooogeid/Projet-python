1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:04,327
It's clear as a photograph.
You don't see anything in the cheese?

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:06,776
You don't see anything?

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,426
Seeing patterns where none exist
is a symptom of schizophrenia.

4
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,688
- Why, what do you see?
- Michael Jackson doing his...

5
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:19,284
- I don't know what that is.
- Come on, you don't see anything?

6
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:21,345
It's like when a kid
looks up at the sky

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,882
- and sees the clouds...
- I get it.

8
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,859
Your mind forms patterns
from random information.

9
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:30,153
Booth, I have... a lot of work.

10
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,783
Right, no. I just wanted to...
bring by the pizza so you could eat.

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,743
It's important that you eat.
I will...

12
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:41,794
... see you Monday?

13
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,751
Nothing? Come on.
King of Pop?

14
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,711
<i>This Is It?</i>
"Thriller?" No?

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,604
All right, I'll see you Monday.

16
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:49,602
Bye, Booth.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,056
Strange question,
I know, but I got to ask.

18
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:59,212
Are you by any chance pregnant?

19
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:02,728
No, I haven't had sexual intercourse
in quite some time.

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,190
- Do you want to know why I'm asking?
- You're holding a home pregnancy test,

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,550
I assume it's positive...
and you're worried about losing

22
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,569
the most important person
in this lab.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,678
Very modest.

24
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,617
I'm asking because
Michelle was here earlier

25
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:19,745
this afternoon,
and the only other two people,

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,040
besides me, that use that bathroom
are you and Angela.

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,626
- Angela is currently sexually active.
- Very true.

28
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,334
- With Wendell.
- Very active.

29
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,005
And even if they used condoms,
Wendell is young.

30
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,293
His sperm is likely to be
extremely motile.

31
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,718
You are so cheering me up right now.

32
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:40,950
Dr. Saroyan, I was hoping
I could pick up those,

33
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,662
strength deployment
inventory results from you.

34
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,398
- You didn't hand them out.
- I was going to, but there was...

35
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:50,484
real work that needed doing.
Next week, for sure.

36
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,487
Okay, but these aptitude tests
will help you as an administrator to put

37
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,197
the right people in key positions...

38
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,408
- You're not listening to me?
- No offense intended.

39
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,443
Angela, quick question.

40
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:08,109
Is this your home pregnancy test?

41
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,212
I beg your pardon?

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,465
Are you pregnant?
Please say yes.

43
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:19,680
Don't look at me.

44
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,432
I'm so sorry.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,866
I... thought we were alone.

46
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:27,021
You know, you don't have
to keep it a secret from me.

47
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,856
If, you know, you're pregnant,

48
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,431
I mean, I can be happy
for you and Wendell.

49
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,319
Wait a minute.
Why are you asking me?

50
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:35,863
Well, it isn't mine,

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,213
and Dr. Brennan
doesn't make life choices

52
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,702
without a Boolean flowchart,
so I hoped it might be you.

53
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,049
I'm not crazy.

54
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,861
I'm not... crazy.

55
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,129
What was that all about?

56
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,215
Well, what makes Cam crazy?

57
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,008
- When I do experiments.
- And...

58
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,134
Michelle?

59
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:00,596
Sixteen.

60
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,477
Really? Cam, these guys
won't let me leave.

61
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,306
What's going on?

62
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,818
Everyone in this facility
is confined to this facility.

63
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,644
I'm in charge of this facility.

64
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,519
Not tonight, Dr. Saroyan.

65
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,230
Please secure the exits.

66
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,473
- Who are you guys?
- I am Mr. White

67
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,626
from the General
Services Administration.

68
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,391
The people we order
paper cups and pencils from?

69
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,263
What's going on?

70
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:45,599
Hello.

71
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:49,904
Your government requires you
to figure out...

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,191
how this person died.

73
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,236
Until you do,

74
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,959
we are all locked in here together
as a matter of national security.

75
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:01,960
Even me?

76
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,085
He's just an FBI psychologist.

77
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:07,909
No one in, no one out,
by order of the federal government.

78
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,333
Now, you have till dawn tomorrow
to fulfill this task.

79
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:15,796
What possible incentive do these people
have to comply with your orders?

80
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,382
Perhaps the fact that you're all paid
by the federal government.

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,378
Threats aren't gonna work
for you tonight.

82
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:21,927
Fine.
How about patriotism?

83
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,063
Professionalism.

84
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:26,390
Scientific curiosity.
Take your pick.

85
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,658
But the sooner you people figure
out what killed this individual,

86
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,437
the sooner life gets back to normal.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,238
Bones - Season 05 Episode 12
"The Proof in the Pudding"

Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

90
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,231
<i>What do you want, Sweets?
Working out, building up a sweat.</i>

91
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,776
I'm in the lab.

92
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,362
- Why are you whispering?
<i>- A bunch of government guys came in.</i>

93
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,030
They sealed the place up.

94
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,080
They brought in a body.

95
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,701
- They won't let anyone come or leave.
<i>- What... Slow down.</i>

96
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,382
What government guys?

97
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,956
They said they're from the General
Services Administration.

98
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,815
They're in charge of promoting
efficient government operations,

99
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,159
like leasing office space
and buying paper in bulk.

100
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,236
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Who else is there?

101
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,675
<i>Doctors Brennan, Saroyan, Hodgins,</i>

102
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,705
Angela, me.

103
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,095
They knew to come when the techs
were gone for the weekend.

104
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,555
Why won't they let me leave?
I'm a psychologist.

105
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,901
- Look, I'll look into it.
- What should I do?

106
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,257
No destructive testing is allowed,

107
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:03,332
not even the smallest sample.

108
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,156
These remains will leave

109
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,577
in exactly the condition
in which they arrived.

110
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:11,434
My men and I will observe,
and no one

111
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,711
enters or leaves the premises.

112
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,742
Now that you've kidnapped my lab
and my people,  you could tell me why.

113
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,210
You have not been kidnapped.

114
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,089
You've been seconded by your
government to do your patriotic duty.

115
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:24,925
Your "no samples" restriction will

116
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,094
severely limit our insights.

117
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,762
We want only cause of death.

118
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,059
There're a number of sample
in here which you may examine.

119
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,979
But they, too, must not be harmed.

120
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,527
Identification of these remains
is priority zero.

121
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,418
Excuse me.

122
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,819
Is there any way I could just...
persuade you to...

123
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,702
look at these
and guess cause of death?

124
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:00,794
Guess?

125
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,294
I need to get home to kill Michelle.

126
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,270
So any of you guys, you like hockey?

127
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,164
Knitting.
Modern dance?

128
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:25,498
Ultimate fighting?

129
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,339
Saw a flicker from you, pal.
I got you pegged.

130
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,991
Mr. Ultimate Fighter here.
Look at this. It's the chief.

131
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,205
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

132
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,833
Right. I showed you mine.
You want to show me yours?

133
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,845
- You can call me Mr. White.
- Right, from the GSA.

134
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,070
So why'd you lock up my people?

135
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,008
That information's classified.

136
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,095
And... they're not...
actually your people.

137
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,196
- I want to go inside.
- That's not gonna happen.

138
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,443
You timed this, didn't you?
So I wasn't in there.

139
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,814
Do you need help getting home?

140
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,452
This guy, look at him.

141
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,445
Definitely water polo.

142
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:20,915
Thanks for that.

143
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,272
- Booth, you find out anything?
- Listen, can you talk?

144
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,392
- Is anyone else there?
- Only the good guys.

145
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,102
All right, put me on speaker.

146
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:44,881
This is weird.

147
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:48,458
- How do we know they aren't terrorists?
- Look, they're not terrorists, okay?

148
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,528
They're standard
federal issue agents.

149
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,239
Why would the General Services
Administration bring in a body?

150
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,559
Standard federal issue cover-up.

151
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:59,036
This is the first time I have ever been
as paranoid as Hodgins.

152
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,005
You're FBI property. If anyone's gonna
lock you up, it's gonna be me.

153
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,050
Why are they
letting us use cell phones?

154
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,492
Why? Because whatever they're doing,
these guys think they're untouchable.

155
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,447
Male, from the subpubic angle.

156
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:21,833
Last phase development
at costochondral junctions.

157
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,312
Older than 39 at the time of death.

158
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,207
This L4 vertebra

159
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,733
shows evidence of having
been badly compressed.

160
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:32,554
Not even two-thirds normal size.
Poor guy was in agony.

161
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,114
Spinal degeneration, osteoporosis.

162
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,909
Disease, steroids...

163
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,328
hard to tell what caused it
without doing a bone sample.

164
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:41,771
Bone graft.

165
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:44,762
Looks like,
a repair to a screw hole.

166
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:52,632
I count three.

167
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:53,734
Metal plates.

168
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,216
Indicating multiple
corrective surgeries.

169
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,913
Which could help us
positively identify these remains.

170
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:03,026
No, Mr. White told us to regard
identification as a zero priority.

171
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,645
I'm not as good as you are
at doing what I'm told.

172
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,439
Thank you.
We can't check DNA

173
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:12,286
or take bone scrapings
for mass spec.

174
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,697
Samples, particulates...
these should go to Hodgins.

175
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,407
Fire in the hole.

176
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,329
You said "fire in the hole" to

177
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:26,165
warn me that you intended on
startling those men.

178
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:28,292
I'm not really
the good soldier type.

179
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:31,295
Calcification on the left radius.

180
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,422
Could I suggest that cause of death

181
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:37,260
probably won't be found in
the extremities. Check out this skull.

182
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,931
- That would certainly be fatal.
- Blunt-force trauma?

183
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,806
Or high-velocity gunshot.

184
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,483
Was that you?

185
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,309
Who knew you could yell like that?

186
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:48,354
- She scared the guards.
- I find that so hot.

187
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:50,273
That's all for you.

188
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:55,611
There are very distinctive marks
on the remaining frontal bone.

189
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,742
Like a metal grid scratched
across it postmortem.

190
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,202
No tests that degrade the samples.

191
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,041
- I'm too young to be a grandmother.
- In some cultures,

192
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,152
you're old enough
to be a great-grandmother.

193
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,710
But not this one.

194
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:14,172
I've been cogitating
on the problem of how to...

195
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,133
date these bones
without compromising them.

196
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,289
I'll take one and
compare it to dated bones.

197
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,859
- Where are you going?
- To bone storage.

198
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,234
It's in the basement.

199
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,637
So, this guy's GSA ID
said, "Mr. White. "

200
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,787
- That's it.
- You recognize him?

201
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,122
- I hate these covert guys.
- Right. I'm going in.

202
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:50,457
- You aren't.
- Why?

203
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:53,044
It's unprofessional in terms
of interagency cooperation.

204
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,796
- I wasn't serious.
- You're going to help me?

205
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,673
- What? Are you serious?
- Why?

206
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,034
Not stopping you is not
the same as helping you.

207
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,596
But I'll help after, when you're in some
nonexistent CIA prison, whatever.

208
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:04,930
Thanks for the support.

209
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,976
There's a reason I'm the boss when
you're plainly the better FBI agent.

210
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,020
- I'll note that.
- I'll look for answers.

211
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,843
- If I can muddy the water a little bit.
- OK. Thanks, boss.

212
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,318
Why it's so important
you get in there?

213
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:18,861
They're my people.

214
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,573
Now you're going to prove
that you're a better man than I am?

215
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,933
That you care more
about your people?

216
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,424
How am I going to get anywhere
with Temperance

217
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,579
if you keep making me look bad
in comparison?

218
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,673
<i>Hodgins says they're listening
to everything we say.</i>

219
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,210
<i>- Is that true?</i>
- Forget that.

220
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:35,795
Just ignore it?
Talk normally?

221
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,671
Go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

222
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,866
I made some observations.

223
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:41,998
The big guys barely glance
at each other,

224
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:43,969
but they're ready
to respond as a unit easily.

225
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,198
<i>They've either been
partnered up for years,</i>

226
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,868
<i>or they've been through some pretty
hairy situations together.</i>

227
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,562
Right.
So it's an active unit.

228
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,573
Also, they don't respect Mr. White.

229
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:55,189
When he's not looking,
they flick their eyes toward each other.

230
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,441
- They don't like working for him.
- Exactly.

231
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,403
But they treatvthe body
on the gurney with great deference.

232
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:01,904
Fallen comrade.

233
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,740
- That was my first thought.
- Attaboy, Sweets.

234
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,219
Who do you think we've got here?
Jimmy Hoffa?

235
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,055
There. Another cloth fiber.

236
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,445
It could be, like, D.B. Cooper,
that hijacker.

237
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,715
But we're not supposed to conjecture
about the identity of the victim.

238
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,574
We're not supposed to investigate.
This is America, baby.

239
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,268
We can conjecture all we want.

240
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:43,517
He does have a good brow line
and nice, strong jaw.

241
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,322
Whoever he was, he was good-looking.

242
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:47,594
You should do a reconstruction.

243
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,159
Hair.
It's probably human.

244
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:52,906
They're going
to know what I'm doing?

245
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,292
So what? Just tell them we need
to see what the,

246
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,418
victim's skull
looked like before the damage.

247
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,287
Did you find anything?

248
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:19,582
The victim died within months
of the Limited Test Ban Treaty.

249
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,651
That was in 1963.

250
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,904
You look like you're
about to explode.

251
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,246
Is there, by any chance,

252
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:36,559
a nick on a right rib

253
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,792
somewhere near the third
thoracic vertebra?

254
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,724
Most likely caused
by a transiting bullet.

255
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,965
Hodgins, you're vibrating.

256
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,854
One of the fiber samples
turned out to be pink wool.

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,100
The bad back.

258
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:57,645
A nick from a transiting bullet?

259
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,319
Wait.

260
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:07,530
Pink wool, as in Chanel?

261
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:10,616
She never left his side.

262
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,667
Severe head wound.

263
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,896
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,414
This...

265
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,917
is President John F. Kennedy.

266
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:31,107
Why would they bring us JFK's remains
after all these years?

267
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,338
Because people have
a thirst for the truth.

268
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:36,865
And other people want to make sure
that truth is never proclaimed.

269
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:39,271
- Which are these?
- I've been considering.

270
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,716
In what kind of casket
was the president buried?

271
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,977
- Mahogany.
- That's a good casket.

272
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,778
How could his remains
be completely skeletonized?

273
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,429
If the casket was compromised
and allowed in oxygen and moisture,

274
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:52,466
skeletonization could have occurred.

275
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,854
It's naive of us to imagine that
Kennedy's remains were actually

276
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,831
ever interred at Arlington.

277
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,100
The hair I found?

278
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,779
No cuticle or cortex.
It's synthetic.

279
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,154
As it happens, after JFK was shot,

280
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,775
the funeral home
tried a cosmetic fix

281
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,135
with wig hair, wax, and a metal
mesh holding it in place.

282
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:14,007
The mesh would explain

283
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,219
the crisscross patterns
on the skull.

284
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,690
I can't confront Michelle about
something this big over the telephone?

285
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,085
What? The fact that you may be
investigating the murder

286
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,986
of the president
of the United States?

287
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,947
The fact that she's pregnant.

288
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:56,908
Are you all right?

289
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,965
You know, I can tell you.
Those are a couple of big guys.

290
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,771
Did you figure out
who that guy is yet?

291
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,399
Hodgins and Cam are convinced
that it's John F. Kennedy.

292
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,861
The 35th president
of the United States who was

293
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,427
assassinated on November 22, 1963.

294
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:13,972
I know who JFK is.

295
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,889
Also, Cam is certain
that Michelle is pregnant.

296
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:20,442
Usually, that would be big news.
But right now, it's not so much.

297
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:21,873
It's JFK?

298
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,669
Wait. Was Hodgins the first
to say that it was JFK?

299
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,838
- Then it's not JFK.
- Hodgins is an excellent scientist.

300
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,299
Mr. White.

301
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,212
- How'd you get past the guards?
- Sniper training.

302
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,013
It trained me how to walk
really, really quietly.

303
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,744
You are now restricted
to the building, of course.

304
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:40,725
Damn.

305
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,602
Who saw that coming?

306
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:59,160
Awkward. Awkward.

307
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:00,798
Very.

308
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:02,622
- What's awkward?
- About Michelle...

309
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,767
I'm going to call her right now,

310
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:08,211
and tell her that I need to talk to her
as soon as I get out of here.

311
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,463
- About the pregnancy test?
- She lied to me.

312
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,176
She told me to my face

313
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,968
that she wasn't having sex
with that boy. She lied to my face.

314
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:17,804
It's my pregnancy test.

315
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:22,434
I'm sorry, Cam.
I would have told you sooner.

316
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,646
But Hodgins was in the room, and...

317
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,930
Thank God.

318
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,386
- No. I mean...
- It's okay.

319
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,717
You all right?

320
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,619
I'm a... I'm a bit in shock.

321
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,447
Does Wendell know?

322
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,401
No, no. Only you and I know.

323
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:41,244
And, I mean, really, shouldn't
Wendell be the first to know?

324
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,656
But I figured that you...
you need to know.

325
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,332
Because I was freaking out
about Michelle. Thank you.

326
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,532
- Any luck finding out what's going on?
- Nobody knows anything.

327
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:12,484
It's locked down pretty tight.
You know who these guys are?

328
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,459
<i>They took me down in a classic
Secret Service protocol.</i>

329
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,655
<i>Secret Service?
Do yourself a favor.</i>

330
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:21,312
Don't tell any Reagan jokes or
mention the Bush shoe incident.

331
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:22,619
They get mad.

332
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,430
You've contacts
inside the White House?

333
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:26,039
<i>Of course I do.
</i>

334
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,118
I'm insulted
you even asked that question.

335
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,562
Do I have any contacts
in the White House?

336
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,190
So, Wendell should be
the first to know, but

337
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:54,901
you should be the second
and since I told Cam,

338
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,162
I should tell you.

339
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,822
Do I say, "Congratulations"?

340
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,415
I don't know.

341
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,201
I mean, it's not the right time.

342
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,663
- It's not the right guy.
- Well, you know, Wendell, he...

343
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,557
He might rise to the occasion,
you know, he's a good guy.

344
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,167
No, I didn't mean that. I mean...

345
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,946
A baby.

346
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,548
I mean, you're linked to that person
for the rest of your life.

347
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,470
Like, way more than
if you're married.

348
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,745
I mean, you're linked
through another human being.

349
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:22,656
A soul.

350
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:32,215
I'm gonna say: "Congratulations".

351
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:35,191
Not for today.

352
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,508
But for how you're gonna
feel about this later on.

353
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:40,535
Well, I might not even keep it.

354
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,310
You're going to keep it, Angela.

355
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,850
You always wanted kids.

356
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:48,608
Lots of 'em.

357
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,707
I'm gonna go get the others.

358
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,638
That is not JFK.

359
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:09,017
Kennedy was on steroids
to treat Addison's disease.

360
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,727
Wrecked his back and adrenals.

361
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,855
Well, that would create
a more Cushingoid appearance.

362
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,900
You are not permitted
to identify the victim.

363
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,161
In order to recreate
what happened to the skull,

364
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:21,029
we need to encase it in flesh.

365
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,167
It's totally nondescript,
as you can see.

366
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,813
You know who I kind of see?

367
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,715
Ricky Martin.

368
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,077
Alex Trebek.

369
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,329
James Garner.

370
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,580
I see Booth.

371
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,790
- You think that looks like me?
- Yes, I do.

372
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,793
I'll be in the bone room,
looking at the skull.

373
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:44,979
If it was JFK, Angela's facial
reconstruction would have shown us this?

374
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,826
No. Facial reconstructions
are not photographs, Booth.

375
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:51,059
There's a wide latitude
for interpretation.

376
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,181
There.
This could be the point of entry.

377
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,270
The semicircle is beveled,

378
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,204
- wider on the inside than the outside.
- That was the entry?

379
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,125
If the victim was shot
from the rear, yes.

380
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,350
The beveling is usually like an arrow,
pointing toward the shooter.

381
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:08,603
As to the exit,
we're missing some skull fragments.

382
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,947
- Maybe they were held back on purpose.
- Possibly,

383
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:13,416
but it's much more
likely they were pulverized

384
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,792
and scattered by the bullet impact.

385
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,920
Forensic techniques in the early '60s
were relatively primitive.

386
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,101
Check above the right temple
on the skull or a fragment from there.

387
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,287
Suddenly you're an
expert on ballistic?

388
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,011
That's where JFK's exit wound was.

389
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,383
Why do you know so much
about the Kennedy assassination?

390
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,849
I'm a trained sniper.
How quickly you forget.

391
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,977
Well, you were right about the exit.

392
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,232
It doesn't mean it's the president.

393
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:38,102
People get shot in the head
all the time.

394
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,377
That's true.
Or perhaps Angela can re-create

395
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,524
the situation
under which this wound occurred.

396
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,848
Or she could re-create JFK's shooting
so we can rule him out.

397
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,513
I requested this animation
from the Justice Department.

398
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:57,589
I found a right-rear entry with an exit
in the right parietal region.

399
00:22:57,714 --> 00:23:00,795
- Kennedy wounds exactly.
- Right. So his head

400
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:02,684
went back and to the left.

401
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,842
Look, heads do all sorts
of crazy things when you shoot 'em.

402
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,802
Since this is based
on the official record,

403
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,267
I can't believe it.

404
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:10,914
Here we go.

405
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,396
You think there's no way

406
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:15,852
the president of the
United States gets murdered

407
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:19,355
in public in broad daylight
and the truth gets covered up?

408
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,645
That's right.
It doesn't happen. This is America.

409
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,111
The highest form of patriotism is
to be skeptical of the official truth.

410
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,779
That is why the First Amendment,

411
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,867
free speech, is first in a Constitution
you would die to protect.

412
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,871
The lone gunman version isn't possible.
The guy in front, Connolly, gets shot

413
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,706
1.6 seconds after Kennedy

414
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,666
- Piece of cake.
- With a World War II

415
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,086
Italian rifle that was older
than Lee Harvey Oswald? Come on.

416
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,464
I'm sorry,
but have you ever shot a rifle?

417
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,925
If I had one of those guns right now,
I'd show you right now.

418
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,661
- You're on.
- No one is allowed

419
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:52,480
- to leave the Jeffersonian.
- No, we don't have to leave.

420
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:56,059
I know exactly where to find
an exact replica of the rifle

421
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,143
- here, at the Jeffersonian.
- Great.

422
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:13,096
Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle
is in the Jeffersonian?

423
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:16,887
No, no, but the FBI used
an exact replica

424
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:19,707
to re-create the assassination.
We've got that down in storage.

425
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,740
They said we have
to stay in the library.

426
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:23,679
The janitor's closet
<i>is</i> in the library.

427
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,787
All right,
a couple years ago, right,

428
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,091
I check out the claims
of this conspiracy group

429
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,718
that says that the Jeffersonian
was a Masonic construction.

430
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,720
They said that there
was a passageway.

431
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:36,099
It turns out to be true.
Check this out.

432
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,976
There's a fake wall
in the janitor's closet,

433
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,229
- covers a ladder.
- So, what,

434
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,856
we just sneak in one by one,
hope they don't see us?

435
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,484
- You got a better idea?
- Sounds good to me.

436
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,777
So I used the fact

437
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:32,159
that Mr. White was
eavesdropping on us

438
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,559
to sow the seeds of discord.

439
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,954
What?

440
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,833
You know, I lodged

441
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,288
in his subconscious that his men

442
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,887
- don't respect him.
- These guys are pros.

443
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:44,834
You didn't lodge anything
or sow any seeds.

444
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,301
Hope Hodgins' map is accurate.

445
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,470
Okay, so the JFK investigation stuff
is over there.

446
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,610
I'm gonna say something
that's gonna make you think

447
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,270
that I'm as paranoid as Hodgins.

448
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,442
- This feels like a test to me.
- Who's being tested?

449
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,561
I don't know.
The men in black suits?

450
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,529
Dr. Brennan, Dr. Saroyan, you.

451
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,615
- Me?
- Yeah, maybe even me.

452
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,161
It just feels like a test.

453
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:19,702
I can't be more specific.
Is that it?

454
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,522
"01033." This is it.

455
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,222
There it is.

456
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,345
Is that the actual weapon?

457
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,372
It's a perfect
replica made by the FBI.

458
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,010
Perhaps the most hated weapon
in United States history.

459
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:41,224
Yeah, I've done all I can do,
so I'm gonna leave the premises.

460
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,642
Sorry. That's impossible.

461
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:46,730
You can't stop me because
I'm an American. So, I've got rights.

462
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,960
I'd rather not hurt you.

463
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,702
Nice job with Bush and
the whole flying shoe incident.

464
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,725
I want to
compliment you on that one.

465
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,325
You want to try me instead
of some bigmouth scientist?

466
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,151
I thought so. Come on.

467
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,183
That Bush comment to him?

468
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:12,296
You're lucky he didn't
paralyze you for life.

469
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,052
Easy.

470
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,587
Here's the entry wound close up.

471
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:22,056
A little circumcircular geometry.

472
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:24,934
Perpendicular bisectors
reveal the center.

473
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,806
And our diameter is...

474
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:29,188
6.5 millimeters.

475
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,349
Same caliber as Oswald's rifle.

476
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,440
Guys, guys, listen.

477
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,487
I'm gonna need some science
jibber-jabber to distract these guys.

478
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,489
You know who can do jibber-jabber?

479
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,371
Who?

480
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:41,701
- Me.
- Perfect. My lucky day. Come on.

481
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:47,380
You want my permission
to shoot a cantaloupe?

482
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:49,000
- Yes.
- With my sidearm?

483
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:51,252
You took away Agent Booth's firearm.

484
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,672
You want our best work?
This is what we do.

485
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,826
This experiment is essential
to cause of death?

486
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,921
Because you have forbidden us
from taking samples

487
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,354
in order to estimate
the osteoconductivity

488
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,474
of the oblique taphonomic remodeling

489
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,518
pertaining
to the mid-sagittal plane,

490
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,241
encelphalametric transaction
or translation, if you will,

491
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,399
of the intermatrix can be deduced

492
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,822
by correlating
the force-displacement values

493
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:19,715
with the osteogenic-
and geogenic-hydrogel-nanocomposite

494
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,365
we placed inside the surrogate.

495
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:23,271
Which is the cantaloupe.

496
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,453
You understand me perfectly.

497
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:27,666
- How many bullets?
- Just one.

498
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,527
- We'll be watching.
- Bring your popcorn.

499
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,140
Good work.

500
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,078
I placed the rifle
where Booth could get it.

501
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:57,187
The president's limo was traveling
approximately 4.5 meters per second.

502
00:28:57,577 --> 00:29:00,315
- How fast is that?
- Ten, eleven miles per hour.

503
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,165
When the lights flash green,
it'll be the correct speed,

504
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,420
and Booth can fire.

505
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,834
Ready?

506
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,128
Go!

507
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,201
20 minutes after
this operation ends,

508
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,412
your career in the federal law
enforcement is over.

509
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,886
Hey, Mr. White, enough.

510
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,499
None of your results will survive.

511
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,000
All this was for nothing.

512
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:04,301
1.6 seconds exactly.

513
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:06,118
Case closed.
Oswald made the shot.

514
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:08,139
He was a lousy shot.
You're one of the best.

515
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:11,021
With none of the nerves
an actual assassin would experience.

516
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:14,353
In the lab, no wind,
no distractions,

517
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,356
aiming at fruit. I mean, come on.
You barely made the shot.

518
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,943
I hate to admit this, Booth,
but he's making a pretty good point.

519
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,616
All he's proving is he made up his mind.
Oswald shot Kennedy.

520
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,913
We just proved that.

521
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,530
Simple entry wound here.

522
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,705
If you look closer,
there are microfractures radiating

523
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,283
from the exit wound which suggests,

524
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,293
it wasn't an exit but an entrance.

525
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,502
Reverse beveling.

526
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,087
I'm sorry, it's true.

527
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,424
If this is another entry from

528
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,523
a completely different angle,

529
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,636
then logically,
there was a second gunman.

530
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:05,016
Two shooters.

531
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,948
You know what that proves to me?

532
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,469
Only that there were two shooters.

533
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,380
Those remains
are not John F. Kennedy.

534
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:17,915
Why is it so important to you
that this not be President Kennedy?

535
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,864
If it was him,

536
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,671
he was killed by two gunman.

537
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,923
Yes.

538
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,565
And if he was killed by two gunmen,
the government lied; they covered it up.

539
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,615
Throughout history,
governments have lied with impunity

540
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,043
to other governments
and to their own citizens.

541
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:34,433
Booth, does,

542
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:37,396
does this have anything
to do with the fact your ancestor

543
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:38,896
was a famous assassin?

544
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,807
John Wilkes Booth who killed...

545
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,693
You promised
you'd never mention that.

546
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,361
No, you told me not to!
I never promised!

547
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,489
But I promise now! I promise now!

548
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,493
Did you find anything?

549
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,953
Did you hear about this committee
that's trying to exhume JFK?

550
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,247
- Why would anybody want to do that?
- <i>To see if modern</i>

551
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,667
forensic methods can tell us anything
about the circumstances of his death.

552
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,753
He believed in the Warren Commission
all the way up to the day he died.

553
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,115
And Bobby Kennedy was suspicious
right up until the day he was killed.

554
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,509
What does that have to do
with our friends here?

555
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,511
<i>All I was able
to find out, are parties</i>

556
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,814
very interested in the outcome
of that congressional hearing.

557
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,684
Booth, are you being held
against your will?

558
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:19,812
- I can get out if I wanted to.
- <i>That's not the question I asked you.</i>

559
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,326
I asked you is an agent
of the FBI being held

560
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:24,567
by persons unknown against his will?

561
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,989
Yeah, we all are.

562
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,945
<i>Then I find, on behalf of the FBI,</i>

563
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,738
I'm annoyed by their arrogance.

564
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:42,459
I'll have Brennan's analysis
of the entry angles up in one second.

565
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,340
You're gonna have this baby.

566
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,980
I don't know that yet.

567
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,301
When you do, I've been thinking.

568
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,471
You're gonna try to raise
this kid on your own.

569
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:56,827
Wendell is a very decent guy.

570
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:58,726
- He's a great guy.
- I know.

571
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,395
But he's a struggling grad student,
and you're gonna minimize

572
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,460
his responsibilities
for his own good.

573
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:06,288
Geez.

574
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,703
Regular Nostradamus there, Hodgins?

575
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,154
Predicting the future?

576
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:13,062
Says the woman
who consults a psychic.

577
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:14,658
My point is,

578
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,971
I'm your guy.

579
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,839
What?

580
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,124
I'm your guy.

581
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:23,678
I love you.

582
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,436
I love you.

583
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,332
And I want to help you
in whatever way I can.

584
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,509
If you want to move in together,
if you want to get married...

585
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,304
I'm here for you,

586
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,362
and for the baby.

587
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:40,041
In whatever role you need.

588
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,615
There's calcification
on the left radius.

589
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,519
You keep returning
to the victim's arm.

590
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,793
The victim didn't die
from a little calcification.

591
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:02,623
Even I can tell that two bullets
to the head probably did him in.

592
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,822
You two don't understand:
Booth is a very patriotic man.

593
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,170
He believes this is
the greatest country ever.

594
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,898
Being the best doesn't mean
being perfect.

595
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:12,137
It's naive to think

596
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:15,224
that a country the size
and influence of the U.S.

597
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,147
doesn't pursue secret agendas.

598
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,398
The Kennedy assassination
wasn't a secret agenda.

599
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:20,766
It was a black stain.

600
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,226
A dark moment in history.

601
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,145
Do you know how many people
Booth has shot for his country?

602
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:26,730
Approximately 50.

603
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,358
That's a lot of blood
to have on your hands.

604
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,444
It's the kind of thing
that would keep a person awake at night.

605
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:34,806
And Booth did that

606
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,574
because he trusted that it was right.
And who did he trust?

607
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,119
The government.

608
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:45,211
If they lied about the murder of
a president they can lie about anything.

609
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:51,213
Your work is done. Thank you.

610
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,271
- We're not finished.
- The good news is,

611
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:57,302
- you all get to go home.
- Our results are inconclusive at best.

612
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,623
There's still unexplained
calcification on a radius bone.

613
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,600
In an hour,
you'll find that this never happened.

614
00:35:04,522 --> 00:35:06,629
But if you didn't want
the truth, then,

615
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,813
- what was this all for?
- I have no idea.

616
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,358
Wait.

617
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,861
One more piece of analysis
and we get the whole truth.

618
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,571
The whole truth isn't the point.

619
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:18,866
Please, pack the remains up
for transportation.

620
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,931
For future reference,
you might want to inform your bosses

621
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,479
we don't do half-truth here.

622
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,300
What is this?

623
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,254
You aren't pregnant.

624
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:59,472
When I thought it was Michelle,
I retested the sample.

625
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,402
I just got the results.
It's a false positive.

626
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:06,176
Thank you for this.

627
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,759
So, you found cause of death.
You think it's Kennedy. What's left?

628
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,720
- There are loose ends.
- How long to tidy up them here?

629
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:25,296
The big man always comes through.
Always.

630
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:28,477
- Those remains ready for transport?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

631
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,854
I'm gonna give you time
in order to find out the truth.

632
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:33,505
Mr. White. How are you?

633
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,048
What are you doing?

634
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,280
Your job is to protect the president.
My job is to solve murders.

635
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:08,908
What have you got, feeb?

636
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:12,919
Good old American classic
on that one, pal.

637
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:16,771
Oh, my God.

638
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,961
Man, you Butch Cassidy'd 'em.

639
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,146
That was totally ninja.

640
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,782
Maybe some anger issues there,
but you kicked ass.

641
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,534
<i>Stand down and drop your weapons.</i>

642
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,334
<i>This facility is officially
under the jurisdiction</i>

643
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,454
<i>of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.</i>

644
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:35,544
Oh, man.

645
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,257
10 sec earlier,
I would have been the hero.

646
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:53,059
- Is that pudding?
- Yes.

647
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,789
I adjusted the specific gravity
with a thickening agent

648
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:59,359
- to assure the test's efficacy.
- But pudding?

649
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,946
Something happened.

650
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:06,355
One of these bones sank
and the other one floated.

651
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,473
In the pudding?

652
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,453
Yes. The heavy bone is healthy.

653
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:12,956
The one that's still floating
is riddled with osteomyelitis.

654
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:16,793
President John F. Kennedy
never had osteomyelitis.

655
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:18,904
Come here.

656
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,007
You really didn't want
this to be JFK.

657
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,526
You know,
you kept looking because of me.

658
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,225
Thanks, Bones.

659
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,521
I've been speaking with Mr. White

660
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,774
from the General Services
Administration,

661
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:42,774
and we've come to the conclusion
that any reports we all write

662
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,279
should be carefully worded.

663
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,782
As in,
there shouldn't be any words in there.

664
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,158
No words.

665
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,398
No words.

666
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:54,827
Hi, Temperance. You look great.

667
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,793
Thank you, Andrew.
It's nice to see you again.

668
00:38:58,108 --> 00:38:59,460
Did Booth describe to you

669
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:02,089
how I came crashing in through
the front doors to rescue you?

670
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,594
No. I would have liked
to have seen that.

671
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:15,779
I was able to take those guys down
because they were not working as a team.

672
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:19,481
Because Sweets here was able
to put a worm of doubt in White's brain.

673
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,064
Thank you, Booth.
But I'm pretty sure that the whole thing

674
00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:23,612
was part of some kind of test.

675
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:25,738
- Who was being tested?
- It wasn't a test.

676
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,859
It was the government
trying to figure out

677
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:31,721
if modern forensic analysis could
solve the greatest mystery of all time.

678
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:34,851
Yeah, but the victim turned out
not to be Kennedy.

679
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,452
What if the only part of Kennedy that
wasn't Kennedy was that floating bone?

680
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,841
Maybe I was being tested, you know,

681
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:43,046
after my brain surgery.

682
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:44,589
- Or me.
- Come on.

683
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,067
If they were testing anybody, it's me.
They think I'm a conspiracy theorist.

684
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:49,727
Or maybe they were testing me

685
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:52,733
to see if I could run a lab
in a professional manner.

686
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,893
Well, you do realize
that all these tests...

687
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:57,519
everybody failed.

688
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,843
Not me.
I figured out the truth.

689
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:07,219
There's a congressional committee
suggesting that Kennedy be exhumed.

690
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,240
You mean we were
some sort of dry run?

691
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,718
And that's why we couldn't
mark the bones.

692
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,037
Except they weren't Kennedy's bones.

693
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,895
They weren't Kennedy's bones.

694
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,603
So, can I get you a cab?

695
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,774
I'm not pregnant.

696
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:36,854
It was...

697
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:38,894
a false positive.

698
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,968
That must be a big relief.

699
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,352
Everything goes back to normal.

700
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:51,725
How it was before.

701
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:58,173
I want to thank you for...

702
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:00,514
Forget it.

703
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:03,081
I'll never forget it.

704
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:25,120
Were you aware that JFK
had scarlet fever in childhood?

705
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:28,693
Hodgins informed me
of that fact, yes.

706
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:31,905
Scarlet fever can
cause osteomyelitis.

707
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,327
It's very rare, Cam.

708
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:37,773
It can happen in approximately
one in a hundred cases.

709
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,219
It's statistically unlikely
that it was Kennedy.

710
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,994
You're a good person.

711
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:51,383
I will never forget
what you did for him.

712
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,609
I'm oddly energized.

713
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:01,393
I should be exhausted,
physically and emotionally,

714
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,770
but I feel like
I could work all day.

715
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:07,399
Right, you should get home
and get to sleep before you fall over.

716
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,712
- Head to the pillow.
- I forgot where I parked my car.

717
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:11,842
Shall we?

718
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,614
We shall.

719
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:17,282
You know, you must think I'm crazy
for being so happy that it wasn't JFK.

720
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:19,961
I'm very impressed.

721
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,197
You wanted the truth,
even if it was going to hurt you.

722
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,190
I learned that from you.

723
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:28,335
Really?

724
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,202
I mean, sometimes you have to

725
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:33,406
go with your brain over your gut.

726
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:36,069
That's nice.

727
00:42:36,194 --> 00:42:39,250
But I prefer that you <i>always</i> go
with your brain over your gut

728
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,141
because your gut cannot think.

729
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,263
Your brain can't digest
a breakfast burrito.

730
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:45,677
Just saying, to each their own.

731
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,688
- To each their own?
- Yep.

732
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:58,201
