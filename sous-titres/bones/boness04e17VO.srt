1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,129
Operations says we got
a black ice alert on the bridges.

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,171
Weather guys are like psychics, man.
They don't know squat.

3
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:08,549
I went to a psychic once,
talked to my mother.

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:10,874
Mom even bothered me dead.

5
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,970
- All of the bridges?
- All of 'em.

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,488
Okay. Fill me up.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,410
- What's up?
- Something in the salt.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,945
- What is it?
- You know that Bible story

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,697
about the woman who turns into salt?

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,321
Lot's wife?

11
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:35,296
I think maybe we found her.

12
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,271
Yes, it's cold. What's your procedure
when the road freezes up?

13
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,536
The weather's been warm
for the past six weeks...

14
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,639
so they
haven't had to use rock salt.

15
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,677
The dermis is extremely desiccated.

16
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,514
- The salt quick-dried the tissues.
- Looks like a really big apple doll.

17
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:58,252
Teenage girl.

18
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,059
Very tall.

19
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,352
Six feet.

20
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:04,271
Looks like she's been dead
for about 100 years.

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,107
In fact, less than a month.
The salt is hygroscopic.

22
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:09,582
It draws moisture
from its surroundings and

23
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:11,150
replaces it with crystal.

24
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:13,489
You know what?
I suddenly got a potato chip craving.

25
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,311
Cats are so disdainful.

26
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:21,448
They're independent
and self-assured.

27
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:22,540
Like you.

28
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:23,975
Dog.

29
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:25,773
Cat.

30
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,315
Which you gonna pick?

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,540
This is a lion eating a gazelle.

32
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,350
What's with the sudden pet desire?

33
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:35,553
- We're not even living together.
- Yet.

34
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:37,272
Look at him, Rox.

35
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,500
Look at his warm, brown eyes.

36
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,086
He's going to do this
five times a day.

37
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,068
Mr. Vaziri is Iranian.
He's an observant Muslim.

38
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,481
Bright side: we'll always know
which way is east.

39
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,034
I don't know if this is going
to work out, Dr. Saroyan.

40
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,658
This country was founded
on the notion of religious tolerance.

41
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,581
I am not discriminating
because he is a Muslim.

42
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,125
I find all religions
equally irrational.

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,710
Thanks for your patience.

44
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,671
I had no choice.
Apparently, it's a Constitutional issue.

45
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,342
Trauma to the temporal and

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,053
sphenoid region, with buckling
on the outer edges.

47
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,904
Probably from being dropped
from the bin.

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,058
Bonk.

49
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,935
- I see some red fibers.
- That's me.

50
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,715
Mr. Vaziri, do you see
the ante-mortem skeletal trauma?

51
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,566
Significant remodeling of the

52
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,151
metacarpophalangeal joint

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,486
on the right thumb.

54
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:36,655
A snap.
An old fracture to the little finger.

55
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,823
Crack.

56
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,110
And...

57
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,077
a bone chip at the dorsal radial portion
of the left wrist.

58
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:43,395
Pop?

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,692
I have seen this before
in cases of abuse.

60
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,628
A girl who was
handcuffed to a radiator

61
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,418
in order to preserve her virginity.

62
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,711
Well, it turns out,

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,706
there aren't that many
16-year-old girls

64
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,216
who are six feet tall
on the missing persons list.

65
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:56,998
Ashley Clark.

66
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:59,595
Missing three weeks.

67
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:04,225
So, Roxie and I are

68
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,035
getting a dog.

69
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,896
I had Roxie pegged as a cat person.

70
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm Angela.

71
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:13,848
Arastoo Vaziri.

72
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:17,495
Your boyfriend's name is "Rocky"?
Like,

73
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,156
pow? Like the famous boxer?

74
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,724
Angela's boyfriend is a girl.

75
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:26,043
Perhaps your religion
won't allow you to accept that.

76
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,875
Blood chemistry shows
unusually high levels of relaxin.

77
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,644
Relaxin?

78
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,921
Sounds like something you could
get arrested for taking.

79
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,289
It's a naturally occurring hormone

80
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:38,092
secreted during pregnancy.

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,360
So, if she was handcuffed
to protect her virginity,

82
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:42,888
didn't work out so well.

83
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,168
Bones - Season 4 Episode 17
"The Salt in the Wounds"

84
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,403
Synchro: Reborn, ShalimarFox

85
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,092
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

86
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:24,062
We last saw actually the afternoon
before her high school dance.

87
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:26,326
It was the End of Winter Dance.

88
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:27,808
I remember because

89
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,269
we made a bunch of jam that day, and

90
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,314
Ashley was worried
that she'd smell like raspberries.

91
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,191
Ashley never made it to the dance?

92
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,778
We had to wait 24 hours
before she was officially missing.

93
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,960
Were there any major developments

94
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:45,075
in your daughter's life
in the weeks leading up to her death?

95
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:46,773
He means drugs.

96
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,354
Was Ashley doing drugs?

97
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,198
- We don't mean drugs.
- No, no drugs.

98
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:55,122
Were you aware
that your daughter was pregnant?

99
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,170
Approximately

100
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,922
- 12 weeks.
- Pregnant?

101
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,633
Ashley couldn't have been pregnant.

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,110
She was.

103
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,303
Do you have any idea
who might be the father?

104
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,932
Is that who you think killed her?
The father of her child?

105
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,435
- We'd like to talk to him.
- My daughter and I were very close,

106
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,389
and it simply isn't possible
that she wouldn't tell me she was.

107
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,402
I would appreciate some insight into

108
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:20,402
the high number of injuries
your daughter sustained

109
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,609
since puberty.

110
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,073
So now you're saying that
we abused our daughter?

111
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,391
It's all right. They have to ask.

112
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,463
My daughter was an athlete.

113
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,372
She grew almost two feet
over the last four years.

114
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,306
You can confirm this
with her chiropractor.

115
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,209
We are very sorry
for your loss, sir.

116
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,462
Then you shouldn't say
such terrible things.

117
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:44,677
Ashley wasn't a victim of abuse.

118
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,805
She was the victim of athleticism
and a competitive disposition.

119
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,932
See, this remodeling of the
right thumb,

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,643
the little finger,
the dorsal radial portion of her wrist?

121
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,915
- Volleyball, of course.
- That's right.  Very good.

122
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,188
Patellar tendonitis.

123
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,477
Jumper's knee.

124
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,566
- How did you know that?
- Athlete, Bones.

125
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:00,939
Thanks, Dr. Fitts.

126
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:02,764
We appreciate your help.

127
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,276
Thanks.

128
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,699
Were you aware
that Ashley Clark was pregnant?

129
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,921
No. Her last appointment
was about six weeks ago.

130
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,259
She didn't mention it.

131
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,697
Despite the fact that you aren't
a real medical doctor,

132
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:16,333
you have been quite helpful.

133
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,398
Thanks.

134
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:18,950
Oh, you're welcome.

135
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,045
By the way...

136
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,087
you aren't
a real medical doctor, either.

137
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,593
Ouch.

138
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,442
No hematoma, meaning the skull
was fractured post-mortem,

139
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,910
probably when the body tumbled out
of the overhead bin.

140
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:45,863
Clunk.

141
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:48,949
Very descriptively put.

142
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,828
It's been pointed out to me
that I tend towards onomatopoeia.

143
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:54,288
Dr. Saroyan,

144
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,749
why hasn't the body been defleshed?

145
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,587
- I'm still conducting the autopsy.
- If I can't remove the flesh,

146
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,028
- then I can't find cause of death.
- If you remove the flesh,

147
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,464
I can't find cause of death.

148
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,133
What flesh?
The body is completely desiccated.

149
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,733
Any remaing indicators
are going to come from the bones.

150
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,471
Not if I can rehydrate the tissue.

151
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,183
Paleontologists have used Ruffer's
solution successfully on mummies.

152
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,893
But shush.

153
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,368
The salt arrested bacterial development.
There's no decomp.

154
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:21,534
If I can rehydrate,
I can do a proper autopsy.

155
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:22,858
It will take too long

156
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,735
and a positive result is debatable.

157
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,029
Lucky for me, I'm the boss.

158
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:31,408
- I claim one of my freebies.
- I claim one of my freebie declines.

159
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,149
Come on in.

160
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,820
What can I do for you,

161
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:51,945
Mr. Clark?

162
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,683
I... wanted to tell you that I

163
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,558
suspected my daughter was pregnant.

164
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:58,685
Have a seat.

165
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,853
And you...

166
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,457
didn't want to say anything

167
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,066
in front of your wife?

168
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,081
I found a pregnancy test
in the wastebasket in the bathroom.

169
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,322
Your wife is still young enough
to have children.

170
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:14,915
Sexual intercourse has not been
a part of our marriage in

171
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,412
several years.

172
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,095
Did you...

173
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,897
talk to Ashley
about the pregnancy test?

174
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:22,549
Yes.

175
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:25,754
But she denied that it was hers.
She said it was a friend's.

176
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,640
She asked me not to tell my wife.

177
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:29,967
She called it
a father/daughter secret.

178
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:32,585
Was there...

179
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:35,180
a boy in Ashley's life?

180
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:39,226
Ashley argued about a boy
with her friend Becca.

181
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,019
I overheard it on the phone.

182
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:43,105
Didn't get a name.

183
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:45,103
I see.

184
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,608
I'll look into it.

185
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:53,490
I hope my wife doesn't have to find out
that I kept this huge secret from her.

186
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,742
- I don't think she'd forgive me.
- Forgive you?

187
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,953
Considering how it turned out.

188
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,933
His name is Donatello,

189
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,454
and he's a rescue.

190
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:10,924
He needs a good home.

191
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,805
One caveat, though.

192
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,955
He's afraid of the wind.

193
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,349
You really don't want
this dog, do you?

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,728
Is it because Donatello
is a stupid name?

195
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,861
You're breaking up with me.

196
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,074
You don't have to say anything, Rox.
It's okay.

197
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,576
I do want to say something.

198
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:40,820
Ange, you live in the moment,
I know that, but

199
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,483
moments are fleeting.

200
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,608
They pass.

201
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,543
Yeah, but we decide
when the moments pass.

202
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,989
This one has passed.

203
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,176
I've got to think about the future.

204
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,014
You gotta be kidding me.

205
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,258
- Excuse me. Agent Booth?
- Yeah?

206
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,271
I'm Becca Hedgepeth.

207
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:17,122
They told me I could find you here.

208
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,077
Ashley Clark's friend?

209
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:31,279
So, you heard that Ashley
was murdered on the news, right?

210
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,382
It's my job to find out who did it.

211
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:37,386
I hope you do.

212
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,118
According to her father,

213
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:43,308
he said the two of you got into a fight
and you stopped coming to the house.

214
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:47,771
That's just because Ashley
went behind my back with my boyfriend.

215
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:49,537
What's your boyfriend's name?

216
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:50,812
Ex-boyfriend.

217
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:52,442
Rory Davis.

218
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,945
Wait.

219
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:58,974
Do you think that I was jealous enough
to kill my best friend?

220
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,785
Or are you saying Rory did it?

221
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,871
You're pregnant.
Emotions run high during that situation.

222
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,688
Me and Ashley
would've gotten past it

223
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,340
because she broke up with Rory, too.

224
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,089
Looks like I'm going to have to talk to
"love-'em-andleave-'em" Rory.

225
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,258
Okay, very careful.

226
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,040
The tissue is fragile.

227
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,181
All right, ready?
On my count.

228
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,179
One...

229
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
two...

230
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:26,059
We're going to completely submerge her
in a bath of sodium carbonate,

231
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,438
aqueous formalin and ethyl alcohol.
Good.

232
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,565
And somewhere
between 24 and 48 hours from now,

233
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,429
she should look practically human again.
Ready?

234
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:35,749
And...

235
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,458
go.

236
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:41,700
I got the trace back on those red fibers
you found in her hair.

237
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,974
They're tri-lobal.

238
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,287
Two red strands,
one blue strand woven together.

239
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,165
Given the length and texture,
they definitely came from an automobile.

240
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,829
But the killer must have transported
her body from wherever she was killed

241
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:53,097
into the salt pile.

242
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,203
Can you narrow down
what kind of car?

243
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:58,338
I'm running the fibers through FACID.
That should be able to give Booth

244
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:00,163
make and model and year.

245
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,782
Time-out for Allah.

246
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,770
- Hey, Arastoo.
- Hello, Angela.

247
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,672
Listen,
do you need me anymore here today?

248
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:18,466
'Cause I could really use...

249
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,324
- What's the matter?
- Roxie and I...

250
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,076
broke up and I...

251
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,411
I'm going to take Angela
for a cup of coffee, OK?

252
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,579
Sure, yeah, go.

253
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,624
This is a simple murder;
solves itself.

254
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,924
Okay, Rory Davis?

255
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,286
Yeah.

256
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,595
A little warning, dude.
I'm only the Hulk when I get pissed.

257
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,640
Listen, we'd like to talk to you about,
Ashley Clark.

258
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,157
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't you who what?

259
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,939
Becca texted me, saying that you think
I killed Ashley. But I didn't.

260
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,090
You want to give me a moment here?
I'd like to talk to him alone.

261
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,319
Dude, you're a murder suspect.
That's awesome!

262
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,284
Becca said that you and Ashley
connected sexually.

263
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,454
Yeah, her exact words were:
"got all over."

264
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,123
This is completely not fair.

265
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,750
That you had sex with two girls
and they got pregnant?

266
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,085
We didn't have sex.

267
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,671
Pregnancy is unlikely
without intercourse.

268
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,297
Right, thanks for the tip.

269
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,424
No, we didn't have intercourse.

270
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:22,650
I'm a Christian.

271
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,903
I'm not gonna have intercourse
until I'm married.

272
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,818
OK, so you got 2 girls pregnant, but

273
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:29,162
you didn't have sex
with either one of them?

274
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:32,135
Well, I think some of, my...

275
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:37,232
you know, stuff
may have found its way in there.

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,528
I mean, the way Ashley
came after me,

277
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,044
it's like she was really,
really trying...

278
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,364
To get your sperm?

279
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,846
Yeah, well, if it wasn't
for my faith in Jesus,

280
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:49,149
there would have been
sexual intercourse.

281
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,774
- How did your relationship end?
- Bad.

282
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,417
Ashley was mad at me.
Becca was mad at me.

283
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,554
I did everything right,
and it turned out all wrong.

284
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,841
Did Ashley have any arguments
with anyone else?

285
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,914
Or try to get their sperm?

286
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,403
She had some sort of fight
with Mr. Hawthorne.

287
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,057
- I heard it from the weight room.
- Who's Mr. Hawthorne?

288
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,601
He's the volleyball coach.

289
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,816
Where would he be?

290
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,238
That was great.

291
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,350
Like I told you,

292
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,495
I'll always be there for you
when you need comforting.

293
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,622
I didn't need comfort.

294
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,580
But I need a good tumble.

295
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,969
"Potatoh, Potahto."

296
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,875
I'm fine about Roxie.

297
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,134
People come and go in life.

298
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,836
What did she say?

299
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,847
Aside from "so long"?

300
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,759
Basically, she said
she wants somebody who

301
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:56,588
doesn't just live in the moment,
but who considers the future.

302
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,393
- What's wrong with the moment?
- Nothing.

303
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,444
- But?
- But it's

304
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,931
nice every once in a while
to think about the future.

305
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,664
So, let me get this straight.
To be together...

306
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,119
then, it has to be
all about the future?

307
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:21,648
Yeah.

308
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,379
So, this, right now,

309
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,223
this isn't together?

310
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,758
It was a moment.

311
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:32,103
A great moment.

312
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,058
But like all great moments,

313
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,710
it passed.

314
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,950
Well, we heard that you got into
a loud argument with Ashley.

315
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:59,070
- With shouting.
- That's true. Two fights, in fact.

316
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:01,617
First one was when
she failed to seduce me;

317
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,819
and the second,
a couple of months later,

318
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:06,460
when she threatened to name me
as the father of her child

319
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:09,798
- if I didn't give her five grand.
- She tried to seduce you?

320
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,649
All right, seduce isn't the right word.
Look, that girl came at me like...

321
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,426
Ashley Clark tried to blackmail you?

322
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,312
If you're thinking
that drove me to murder,

323
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,573
you can check with the principal.
I reported it.

324
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:21,396
What with the way things are,
I figured that was the smartest move.

325
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,899
- The way things are?
- Half my volleyball team got pregnant.

326
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,742
We're gonna need a team roster.

327
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,036
If you want to talk to them,
go to the multipurpose room.

328
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,217
They're having another baby shower.

329
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:48,165
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
This school ever hear of sex education?

330
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,688
Well, if so, there's gaps
in the curriculum.

331
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:51,843
That's for sure.

332
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,011
- These people are...
- Okay.

333
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,819
- There's Becca.
- Hello.

334
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,321
Hi, I'm Alyssa Howland.

335
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,810
You guys have already
spoken to Becca and Rory, so

336
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,974
I imagine you're here
about Ashley Clark.

337
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,289
This texting thing
is way out of control.

338
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:08,612
Were you by any chance the captain
of the volleyball team?

339
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,573
Alyssa was the captain
of all our teams.

340
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,490
Yeah, and I'm also valedictorian
and student body president

341
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,735
or I was until people decided
that I was a bad example.

342
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,412
Well, as alpha female,
you are a bad example.

343
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,901
I'm sorry but in this day
and age of available contraception

344
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,834
and easily accessed information,

345
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:28,128
for a teen girl to become pregnant
is clearly a lapse in judgment.

346
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,715
Okay, girls, you do realize
this is a murder investigation?

347
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,927
Yeah, we understand that.
Yeah, we're quite intelligent.

348
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,555
Right. So, Rory Davis
was not the father of your child.

349
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,857
I never said he was.

350
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:42,394
And he wasn't the father
of Ashley's baby either, was he?

351
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,312
No, no. As a matter of fact,

352
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,682
the same guy is the father
of my baby and Becca's.

353
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,442
- And Ashley's.
- What about the rest of them?

354
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,444
- Jenny?
- Yeah, her.

355
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,703
And the others got pregnant by
their boyfriends and what not.

356
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,035
So, one boy
is the father of four babies?

357
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,123
Okay, and who would this stud be?

358
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,834
- It's Clinton.
- Oh, President Bill Clinton?

359
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,373
No.
Clinton Gilmour.

360
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,383
The cute one
in the yellow sweatshirt.

361
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,177
The one in the yellow?

362
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,170
- Clinton.
- What?

363
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:31,288
Alyssa Howland says that you had sex
with the entire

364
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:32,694
volleyball team.

365
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,823
The girls volleyball team.
Not all of them.

366
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,499
I don't like to boast.

367
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,300
- A gentleman does not kiss and tell.
- How old are you?

368
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,413
Sixteen.
My personality is completely formed.

369
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,950
How'd you get those
4 girls pregnant?

370
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,345
You want pictures?
Check the Internet.

371
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,412
- That's what I did.
- Right. You know, I show no disrespect.

372
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:54,215
I went to high school,
and high school has not changed.

373
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:55,628
The fact is,

374
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,721
from what I remember, guys like you

375
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,766
can't get that many girls.
You know what I'm saying?

376
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:05,207
Wait, you can't lift that.

377
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,262
All right, see,
the point is, I can do that,

378
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:19,121
but I didn't get girls like that
in high school.

379
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,068
So, what you're saying happened

380
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,370
really didn't happen?

381
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:25,997
Like a conspiracy.

382
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,084
The conspiracy is that they like me.

383
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,796
I'll tell you something else.
More than one of them told me that

384
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,422
I'm actually very considerate
and sweet in the bed department.

385
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,317
Ashley is dead.

386
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,554
She was murdered.
The prime suspect

387
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,721
would be the person
who knocked her up.

388
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,808
I need to know the person
who did that deed.

389
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,462
It was me.
The sex deed part.

390
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,687
The killing part
was definitely somebody else.

391
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,459
You know what I think?
I think those girls are up to something,

392
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,821
and they're using you as a cover.

393
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:56,915
It's okay.

394
00:19:57,474 --> 00:20:00,737
We'll just do a DNA test,
and the truth will come out.

395
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,991
All right?

396
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:08,206
Take my DNA, and,
you'll find out the truth.

397
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,335
I am the "MacDaddy Supremo Baby Daddy"
of GeoDub High School.

398
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,404
The Ruffer's solution is working.

399
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:25,237
I find myself wondering
if the rate of tissue reclamation

400
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:29,276
will accelerate over time,
decelerate, or hold steady.

401
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:32,793
You're worried about
what to tell Dr. Brennan.

402
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,440
And if Dr. Brennan asks,

403
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,882
when do you think
we will have access to the bones?

404
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:40,253
Tell Dr. Brennan that unless she can
think of a way to examine the bones

405
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,615
while leaving the flesh intact,
you're both out of luck.

406
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:53,751
During the investigation into the death
of high school sophomore Ashley Clark,

407
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:57,488
it was discovered the presumed murder
victim was part of a group of girls

408
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:00,955
who made a pact to get pregnant
and raise their children together.

409
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,124
There is no proof
that there was a pact.

410
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:07,454
See, this is what happens
when all you worry about is the future.

411
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,118
Pregnant teenagers.

412
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,287
I would argue
that most pregnant teenagers

413
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,396
get that way by becoming
involved in the moment.

414
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,799
Yeah, true.

415
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,317
Are you all right?

416
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,404
Oh, yeah, totally.

417
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:20,987
It was so worth it.

418
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,448
Will you be able to remain BBFs?

419
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,193
BFFs.

420
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,286
Best Friends Forever.

421
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:33,333
Will you resume
a sexual relationship with Hodgins?

422
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,793
I already did.

423
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,164
Good.

424
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:40,489
Yeah, but he can't keep it casual.

425
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,091
He's the marrying kind.

426
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,970
I'm comfortable giving you
advice in this area.

427
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:47,305
Shoot.

428
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,974
I think you live
your life very well.

429
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,162
Thank you.

430
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,646
You are not afraid to change your mind
when conditions change.

431
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,106
- Conditions always change.
- The successful organism

432
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,691
is the organism that adapts.

433
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,487
This is one area where
we are very similar.

434
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,633
I was with you until there.

435
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,283
Like me, you are not swept away
by your emotions.

436
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,702
You remain rational.
You use your brain

437
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,239
to pick someone for sex
and companionship.

438
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,291
A minor correction there:
I use my heart.

439
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:18,544
- That is not...
- Metaphoric heart, sweetie.

440
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,829
Stay with me here, right?

441
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:23,830
Love, like art,

442
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:28,503
comes from the moments
where two people become one.

443
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,500
Minor correction:
Love comes from a confluence

444
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,893
of chemicals and hormones
in the pineal gland.

445
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,272
Right, but all beauty
is transient and of the moment.

446
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:40,047
Like a sunset is beautiful.

447
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:43,695
It sounds like we're in agreement,
which is worrying me just a little bit.

448
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,098
Hodgins says he found pectin

449
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:51,119
in the scratches
he swabbed on the victim's arm.

450
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,785
How did he find scratches?
The victim looked like beef jerky.

451
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,074
Well, apparently, Cam had

452
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,444
some limited success
in rehydrating the body.

453
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,838
It's impressive.

454
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Yes.

455
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,961
Pectin is used
in making preserves, right?

456
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,346
Sure, I remember that from growing up
a farmgirl in Amish country.

457
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,474
Sarcasm, Brennan.

458
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,892
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:18,688
Victim and her mother were making jam
the afternoon before she disappeared.

460
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,649
Have you ever noticed that a sunset

461
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,444
looks more beautiful when you share it
with somebody that you care about?

462
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,442
No, I haven't.

463
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,533
But I'll pay
better attention next time.

464
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,418
So, we have evidence that you scratched
your daughter shortly before she died.

465
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:43,087
I grabbed her arm is all.

466
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,508
Hard enough to leave marks.

467
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,023
Was it because you found out
she was pregnant?

468
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:52,220
No.

469
00:23:52,345 --> 00:23:55,350
I still find that hard to believe.
Ashley and I talked about everything.

470
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,061
Why can't this woman face the facts?

471
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,979
Perhaps because
the facts are so painful.

472
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,607
You suspect the father of incest?

473
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,412
It would explain
the mother's behavior.

474
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:08,835
I didn't know about the pregnancy.
I was angry because...

475
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,303
You wrote your daughter
a check for $5,000?

476
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:17,747
No, she forged my signature.

477
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,092
I caught her before
she could cash it.

478
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:22,668
- Why did Ashley need $5,000?
- I don't know.

479
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,836
She wouldn't say.
She just...

480
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:27,298
was always hanging around Becca

481
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,973
and the rest of that team, and

482
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:31,594
suddenly I didn't exist.

483
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:34,884
Now the news is saying that
she had some kind of pact.

484
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,317
Booth, I have a theory.

485
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,730
Can you excuse me for a moment there,
Mrs. Clark? Thanks.

486
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:47,001
- What do you got?
- Okay, it's possible that Ashley Clark

487
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:49,571
was killed by the pact
for not coming up with $5,000.

488
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,322
So you think this
pact thing is true?

489
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,949
There have been many instances

490
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,701
in history where women group
together to raise their children

491
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,122
and the men become nothing more
to them than sperm donors.

492
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,375
The "walking marriages" of the Mosuo
in the Himalayas, for example.

493
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:06,865
Right, okay, so you think
that the Himalayan Momos just

494
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,673
killed each other
when things got dicey?

495
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,762
Killing is a more male response.

496
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,665
Women tend more toward shunning.

497
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,292
I might be able to figure out the nature
of the girls' relationship.

498
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:17,598
- How?
- Let me at the alpha girl.

499
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,643
Psychologically, I mean.

500
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:28,425
Mr. Vaziri, do you have any idea
where all the monitors

501
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,732
on the forensic platform have gone?

502
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,588
I appropriated them.
I sent you an e-mail.

503
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:36,676
I didn't have a monitor
to check my e-mail. You've...

504
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,995
created a virtual skeleton.

505
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,747
- It was your idea, Dr. Saroyan.
- Now, I don't recall...

506
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,995
In speaking of Dr. Brennan,
you said to me,

507
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,252
"Tell her that unless
she can think of a way

508
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,114
"to examine the bones while
leaving the flesh intact,

509
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,558
you're both out of luck."

510
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,468
I'll make sure you get the credit
for this with Dr. Brennan.

511
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,275
- You don't want credit?
- No, I would rather not be the person

512
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,565
to point out to Dr. Brennan
that she was incorrect

513
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,351
about retaing the soft tissue
at the expense of exposing the skeleton.

514
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,866
- Meaning you found something?
- I would never have seen this

515
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:08,733
on the actual bone, but when
I blew up the digital X-ray...

516
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,635
Here, in the middle ear,

517
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,181
there is a hairline fracture
on the stapes.

518
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,951
What does that suggest to you?

519
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,139
Violence, Dr. Saroyan.

520
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,646
Ms. Montenegro?

521
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:29,545
Yeah.

522
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,397
Hi, Arastoo, how are you?

523
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:34,130
I would like to pass on to you
my condolences

524
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:35,968
that your heart has been broken.

525
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:39,000
Here we go.

526
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:43,017
- Are you gonna quote the Koran?
- No, no.

527
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,806
I put together a CD with some songs

528
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,105
that I have found to be carthartic.

529
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,812
"Hope There's Someone"
by Mr. Antony and the Johnsons,

530
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:58,072
"Breathe Me" by Sia, "Heartbeats"

531
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,493
by Mr. José Gonzalez,

532
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,616
"Fade Into You"

533
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:04,163
by Mazzy Star.

534
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,666
This is not a person but a band.

535
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,743
"Lullaby of Loneliness" by

536
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,397
Aaron English, and of course,

537
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:14,296
the finest of the melancholy songs,

538
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,176
"Dust in the Wind."

539
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,303
Very melancholy that.

540
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:22,390
I wish you peace, Ms. Montenegro,

541
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:24,308
and I wish that you find love again.

542
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,509
Thank you, Arastoo.

543
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:28,938
Thanks very much.

544
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:46,238
Dr. Saroyan.

545
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:49,500
Tell Dr. Brennan
she cannot have the remains yet.

546
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,711
Hovering will not make
this go any faster.

547
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:54,211
Dr. Brennan required me to hover.

548
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:57,320
How's about you go bank a prayer?
Give me a little breathing space.

549
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,387
I apologize.
I quip sometimes.

550
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,490
Believe me, it is nothing
compared to the 1st Battalion,

551
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:07,393
9th Marine Regiment,
Regimental Combat Team One.

552
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,582
Glycerine, please?

553
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,073
What are you going to do?

554
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:23,633
Ruffer's only gets us so far.

555
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:27,188
So I'm going to inject some glycerine
around the soft tissue of the ear.

556
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:30,255
To see if there's any tissue damage

557
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,837
which might explain
the fractured stapes.

558
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:40,383
A pact?

559
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,220
There's no pact.
The papers totally made that up.

560
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:45,139
Okay, but you are very close.

561
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,559
Yeah! We played on this team together
since we were freshmen.

562
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,228
We've traveled a lot, too.
We've been through a lot together.

563
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,355
Boys...

564
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,732
Boys come and go,

565
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,235
you know, but your friends, that's who
you can really count on, right?

566
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,429
Count on?

567
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,546
Yeah, they don't pressure you
like boys.

568
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,074
Like parents.

569
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:04,617
Pressure?

570
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:06,535
Pressure to succeed, yeah.

571
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,746
Well, you're a very high achiever,
Ms. Howard.

572
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,707
Student body president,
valedictorian,

573
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,875
a full scholarship to Amherst,

574
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,119
all of which went away
when you got pregnant.

575
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:19,090
Yeah, that's okay.
I'm totally cool with being a mother.

576
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,136
Is it a coincidence
that once you got pregnant,

577
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,803
seven of the others
on the volleyball team did the same?

578
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:27,551
It's not my fault
that people want to be like me.

579
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,058
I'm a natural leader.

580
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:32,019
They look to you as an example.

581
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,599
It was my idea
that we all get a house together.

582
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,274
Help each other raise our kids.

583
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,793
- Where would the money come from?
- I mean, we all put in.

584
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,534
- I'd figured out how much we'd need.
- $5,000 each?

585
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:45,896
That's right.
Wait. How did you know?

586
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:47,898
You said it wasn't a pact?

587
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:52,081
Then how do you explain that four
of you got pregnant from the same boy?

588
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,870
He seems an unlikely choice.

589
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:55,613
Clinton wasn't a choice.

590
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,388
I didn't plan the baby.

591
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:58,820
I'd...

592
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,003
just found out
I'd won the scholarship,

593
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:04,176
and my parents started
to plan my whole life.

594
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,596
I just went to the park.
I couldn't...

595
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,572
breathe, I couldn't think.

596
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:13,498
Too much pressure?

597
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,999
Yeah.

598
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:19,956
And Clinton was there,
and I was crying and I just,

599
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,902
I felt like I was being banished.

600
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,864
You know, I mean,
nobody asked me what I wanted.

601
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,082
And Clinton understood.
And...

602
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:30,171
he held my hand
and he let me cry and,

603
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,497
you know, one thing led to another.

604
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,136
And he's been great.

605
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:36,959
- Great how?
- He's a kid,

606
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,129
You know, he doesn't really want
to raise kids.

607
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:43,799
Right. Maybe that's why the other girls
chose him to get them pregnant.

608
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,259
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,386
And it's going to be great.

610
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,098
We all are gonna have these cute kids,
and we'll all be there for each other.

611
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:52,564
Except Ashley.

612
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,729
Yeah.

613
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:00,457
What exactly are we doing?

614
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:03,465
I couldn't see any contusions
around the ear, but

615
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,163
perimortem bruising is often only
visible under certain light wavelengths.

616
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:09,724
- You're using colorimetrics?
- That's right.

617
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:13,775
I read an article in a forensic journal.
Japanese scientist published his study.

618
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,540
We read the same article.
Could you turn on the UV light?

619
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:19,794
Look at that.

620
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,414
Are you switching teams, Mr. Vaziri?

621
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,464
No, no.

622
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,583
My preference
is forensic anthropology, but

623
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,927
Dr. Saroyan's use of colorimetrics
was thrilling.

624
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,644
Look at the monitor.

625
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,831
Assuming sufficient force,

626
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,770
that perimortem bruising
explains your stapes fracture.

627
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,773
The bruise is directly
on top of the vagus nerve.

628
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,285
- And...?
- Cowabunga!

629
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,136
What?

630
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:47,762
When the vagus nerve
is triggered with enough force,

631
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,449
the victim will go into
cardiac arrest and die.

632
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:53,869
You have discovered
the cause of death.

633
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:04,987
The tissue damage
is distributed evenly.

634
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:07,967
- What does that indicate?
- That it was a single blow.

635
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,803
Whatever did this
is completely flat and round.

636
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,210
Some kind of hammer?

637
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:14,355
Anyone interested
in our mysterious red fiber?

638
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,928
You identified the vehicle?

639
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:19,366
Late-model German sedan,
Mercedes or BMW.

640
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:20,953
Let Booth know.

641
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,194
And, just so you know,
Arastoo is praying again.

642
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:28,823
Either that, or he's doing
a very repetitive yoga move.

643
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:30,698
Is that appropriate in the lab?

644
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,451
Some of us take coffee breaks.
Some of us take smoke breaks.

645
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,286
Mr. Vaziri takes a spiritual break.

646
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,404
- Who smokes?
- Nobody.

647
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,459
Not very often anyway.
Just...

648
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,710
very rarely
in times of great stress.

649
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:46,270
If you had released
the remains to me when I'd asked,

650
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:48,865
and Mr. Vaziri
had removed the flesh,

651
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,759
then we'd never have found
cause of death.

652
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,816
- Thank you.
- Why are you thanking me?

653
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,475
- I'm simply stating a fact.
- I'm thanking you for stating the fact

654
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,682
that you were wrong.

655
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,103
You're welcome.

656
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:03,151
The odds of hitting the vagus nerve
by accident are very slight.

657
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:06,031
Do you think this was done by someone
who knew what they were doing?

658
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:06,901
Yes.

659
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,653
Someone who's very familiar
with human anatomy.

660
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,989
Like a physiologist or a doctor...

661
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,909
or a chiropractor.

662
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:16,827
Let's check out
the victim's chiropractor's ride.

663
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,595
So, Dr. Fitts drives
a 2007 BMW sedan.

664
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,894
So, you got a warrant?

665
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:26,283
There are 1,208 BMW sedans in D.C.

666
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,713
You didn't get a warrant?

667
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,799
But how many of those drivers knew
how to kill using the vagus nerve?

668
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,938
And how many of those drivers
had access to the victim?

669
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:37,765
And own chiropractic tools we might be
able to match with the murder weapon?

670
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,899
Guys, no warrant.

671
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,801
If Booth and I hadn't
questioned Dr. Fitts,

672
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:44,188
we could mount one of our
clever undercover operations.

673
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,208
Not me, but I do have a great idea.

674
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,912
How long have we been married?

675
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,275
Just concentrate on your symptoms.
That's all he's going to ask about.

676
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:05,793
I'll look for this thing here.

677
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,261
Brennan says it's the murder weapon.

678
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:11,111
So, you heard about me and Roxie?

679
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:12,722
Yeah, I'm sorry.

680
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,594
Oh, no, really,
it's absolutely fine.

681
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,612
I also had a little afternoon

682
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,350
delight with Hodgins, but

683
00:34:21,703 --> 00:34:24,324
but let's just say
it's not really his thing.

684
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:26,105
Again, I'm sorry.

685
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,273
No, it's totally fine.

686
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,686
Then, why are you telling me?

687
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:34,196
Brennan approves of the way
that I conduct my love life.

688
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:37,425
Yeah.

689
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,536
What's wrong
with living in the moment?

690
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:44,147
Nothing, nothing.

691
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:46,750
- As long as it's working for you.
- Oh, it is. Definitely.

692
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:48,627
- If it weren't...
- No, it is.

693
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,754
- Well, if it weren't...
- No, it is.

694
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,222
If it weren't, I'd suggest to you...

695
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,239
What?

696
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:00,139
You won't like it.

697
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:03,308
Oh, no, I'm...
I'm happy living in the moment.

698
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,395
What you say is merely interesting.

699
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:10,065
Well, what I would advise you to do
is remove sex from the situation.

700
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,154
I don't like that.

701
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,755
You're a beautiful woman.

702
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,116
You're confident in your sexuality,
which is laudable,

703
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:22,375
but you need to connect with people
on another level.

704
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:24,945
- Why?
- Why? Because

705
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,876
sexual attraction is only one facet
of the human romantic experience.

706
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,494
So, don't have sex?

707
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:34,048
I... I'd suggest you be celibate for

708
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,467
say, six months.

709
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:39,677
Oh, my...
Six months?

710
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,139
Why not ten years?

711
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:45,479
You asked my opinion, and that's it.

712
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:48,714
Forgo sex in favor
of other connections.

713
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,522
Shouldn't we have,
like, a cover story

714
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,737
in order to reassure the chiropractor
that we're married?

715
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:57,759
- Mr. Sweets?
- Yeah.

716
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:01,777
Okay, honey, we're up.

717
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:05,162
This is us,
a happily married couple.

718
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:08,860
Help me, please.

719
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,711
You've had some discomfort
in your lower back?

720
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,256
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,633
As a fireman,
I often have to carry heavy...

722
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:20,052
Oh, it's very tight.
It's very tight

723
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,513
Oh, what are you... Oh, God!
What are you doing?

724
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:25,415
Frankly, these knots I feel in
your lumbar region are more congruent

725
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,136
with sitting hunched
over a desk than

726
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,542
they are pulling people
from a burning building.

727
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,315
He's not a fireman yet, Dr. Fitts.
He's just training.

728
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,234
Yeah, almost, another week.

729
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,570
Spends a little too much time on
the Internet, if you know what I mean.

730
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,782
I feel knots in your lumbar region.

731
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,493
I'm going to give you
a minor adjustment.

732
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,776
This won't hurt.

733
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,249
But you will feel some pressure.

734
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:55,921
Not as much as you.

735
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:19,725
Ashley needed $5,000 to leave home
and raise her baby,

736
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,841
so she tries to blackmail her coach.

737
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,050
But it didn't work,
he'd never had sex with her.

738
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,721
She has to go
and seduce the chiropractor

739
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,850
and threatens him with statutory rape
if he doesn't pay up.

740
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,764
And he killed her.

741
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:40,651
So, are the rest of the girls
still renting a house together?

742
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,382
Right, you know what I don't get?
How is it that 8 beautiful girls could

743
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:47,074
give up their whole lives
during high school?

744
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:49,701
- It's a rational decision.
- On what planet?

745
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,496
- Earth.
- Earth?

746
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,290
Given the current environment,

747
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,317
the paradigm within which

748
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:58,377
a group of girls band together
to raise their offspring has merit.

749
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,913
Without their fathers?

750
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,851
Anthropologically speaking,
those girls have grown up

751
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:06,917
in a culture that reinforces
the sad truism that

752
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,054
women cannot count on men.

753
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,496
Don't say "men" like that.

754
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:12,689
Men do not like a world
without responsibility.

755
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:17,513
That boy whom these young girls
chose as their sperm donor,

756
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:21,233
he seemed more than happy
with the arrangement.

757
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:29,609
You're right.

758
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,742
I know.

759
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:32,932
Who you calling?

760
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:37,457
Clinton, listen, it's Agent Booth.
I need to talk to you.

761
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,470
The kid?

762
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:41,461
Listen, meet me at the Royal Diner,
in 20 minutes.

763
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,259
Yeah, just get there, okay?
Thanks. I'm buying.

764
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:47,509
Look, I know you want
to come along and all, but...

765
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,827
No, I get it.

766
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:50,459
Go on, it's a...

767
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,347
guy-to-guy thing.

768
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:54,229
Thanks.

769
00:39:57,991 --> 00:39:59,768
Why did the chiropractor
kill Ashley?

770
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,649
Well, Ashley seduced him, you know,
and, tried to blackmail him.

771
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,150
So he murdered her?

772
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:06,486
- Dude.
- Yeah.

773
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:09,614
You know, Ashley needed money to,
raise her baby.

774
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:10,991
Your baby.

775
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,531
You didn't think those girls
would have sex with me

776
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,203
because I can't bench-press enough.

777
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,340
You know what?

778
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:20,625
DNA tests,
they prove that I was wrong,

779
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,711
so... yeah.

780
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,123
I owe you an apology.

781
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:26,126
- I did... I told you.
- Yeah, you know what?

782
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,716
- You're a smart kid.
- I know.

783
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,284
But you're also
a real smart-ass kid.

784
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,929
Okay... there's something
I want you to think about.

785
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,265
Sex is never free and easy.

786
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,142
- I beg to differ.
- Because the fact is,

787
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:41,119
any one of these girls,
they could change their mind,

788
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:44,900
and you would be paying child support
for the rest of your life.

789
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,427
Wait, what?

790
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,030
You see these four girls right here?

791
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:56,555
You are responsible for bringing
their children into the world.

792
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:02,615
Whether they think so or not,

793
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:05,003
they're your responsibility.

794
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,800
Your children, your responsibility.
Do you understand?

795
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,526
And what you do about that will define
what kind of man you are.

796
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,727
- Hold on a second.
- But if you ignore that...

797
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,483
ignore your children,

798
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:26,308
that's exactly
what you're going to become.

799
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:29,378
A loser, a deadbeat.

800
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,441
For the rest of your life.

801
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:35,424
You know, there's something else
that you should think about.

802
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:37,744
Ashley Clark.

803
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:45,001
She was going to have your baby.

804
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:52,115
According to our pathologist,
it was going to be a boy.

805
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:56,928
A boy?

806
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:00,434
A son.

807
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:10,193
Who died...

808
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:14,906
with his mother.

809
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:19,624
What did you have to tell me
all that for?

810
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,460
Because you need to hear it.

811
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:29,773
Do you understand?

812
00:42:32,873 --> 00:42:33,899
Yes.

813
00:43:04,946 --> 00:43:07,800
