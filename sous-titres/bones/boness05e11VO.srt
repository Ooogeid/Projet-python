1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,796
I can't hear you...
The reception's bad out here.

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:05,838
Aliens? I told you, baby,
I'm done hunting aliens.

3
00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:08,132
I... am on the road.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,925
Yeah, in Florida.

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,385
What? No, I'm in my hotel room
working late.

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,974
You're just gonna have to trust me.

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:19,431
Yeah. Well... I'm sorry
that's the way you feel.

8
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,031
A souvenir from Florida.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,570
Babe, I can't take a...
like, a list right now.

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,366
Well, there are no pens...

11
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,893
Or pads in this hotel.

12
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,808
Oh, my god!

13
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,320
Babe! I found one.

14
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,689
No, not a pen...

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,899
An alien.

16
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,459
A real one.

17
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,003
Oh, my god, I gotta
get a picture of this.

18
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:08,893
What's that?!

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,030
Baby... There's more of 'em.

20
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,672
I come in peace.

21
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:23,897
I'm... Marvin Breekman,
but you can call me Marvin.

22
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:25,864
Or Marv.

23
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,368
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

24
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,414
I made reservations at the club.

25
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:48,141
Deejay Spider tonight,
then, back to my place?

26
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,611
I'm not sure
if I can wait for tonight.

27
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,088
Okay, I was fine
until you just said that.

28
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,363
You know, I have a key
to the Egyptian storage room.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,411
Not on campus, not at work.

30
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,073
Come on, are you really
as virtuous as you seem?

31
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,798
I can be very bad
when the time is right.

32
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,125
We do geta generous lunch break,

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,510
and there's a little hotel
a few blocks from here.

34
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:20,473
Dr. Saroyan,
I was just asking Angela

35
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,635
if she could do
some 3-d modeling of a...

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,977
shattered femur that I was given
by the archeology DPT.

37
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:29,011
Save it, Mr. Bray. You think you have
the big secret, but you don't.

38
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,987
I thought we were being subtle.

39
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,255
Man, do you think Hodgins knows?

40
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:48,166
Can you imagine if we found
an alien... A real one?

41
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,879
You mean someone who slipped illegally
into the country from Mexico or Canada?

42
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,940
Come on, you don't believe that there're
other real life-forms out there?

43
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,426
Well, the probability is very high,

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,504
but any aliens visiting this planet
would have sufficient intelligence

45
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,306
not to die
in the middle of the desert.

46
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:04,892
FBI special agent Seeley Booth.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,390
This is Dr. Temperance
Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

48
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:10,732
Sheriff Jerry Bonds, but you probably
got that from my shiny badge,

49
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,792
my imposing gun, and my big hat.

50
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,852
- Right.
- Remains are over there.

51
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:19,458
<i>They're right over there.
Been there for a while.</i>

52
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,851
Looks like an alien to me.

53
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:26,484
Judging by the pelvic inlet
and the pubic symphysis...

54
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,916
Female, maybe 30 years old.

55
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,209
Earth female?

56
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,338
Body moisture was trapped
by this silver coat

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,149
she's wearing, turning some
of her fat into adipocere.

58
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,552
I have no idea why it's so hard.

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,471
Didn't even dig a shallow grave.
Just left her here to be eaten.

60
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:45,700
Which is the smartest possible
way to get rid of human remains.

61
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,810
- What the hell is going on here now?
- Easy.

62
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,604
- FBI. Put the shotgun down, ma'am.
- This is my land.

63
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,314
I've got a right to protect my land.

64
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,234
Yeah, Marsha,
but we got a dead body.

65
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,155
- A woman, seems like.
- Great.

66
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,492
- Now I've got dead people.
- You don't know anything about this?

67
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,663
I want the remains brought back
to the Jeffersonian for examination.

68
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,063
Not going to happen. My jurisdiction,
my body. She stays here.

69
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,169
No, FBI has got jurisdiction on
this case. You want it, right?

70
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,968
The FBI will keep you apprised.

71
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,923
FBI's got jurisdiction
only if I agree.

72
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,676
Otherwise, you need to jump
through several legal hoops,

73
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,762
which will take some time,
during which the victim stays in town.

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,620
- Then why did you call us?
- I could use the help,

75
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,031
but I'm not going to take
the heat when people scream

76
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:32,142
I sent an alien off to
Washington for secret testing.

77
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:33,981
I've been through that before.

78
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,317
These remains are
not extraterrestrial.

79
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:45,784
- It's a cell phone.
- You hope.

80
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,280
Bones - Season 5 Episode 11
"The X in the File"

81
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,465
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Dark_Chii

00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,154
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

83
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,405
I trace the cell phone
to the guy who found the remains.

84
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,577
I'm holding him
on trespassing charges.

85
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,785
This is part of our hospital
that got shut down.

86
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,848
It's a perfect place
to examine the remains.

87
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:34,914
I need to send samples
back to the lab.

88
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,190
Yeah, but the,
the big body part stays here.

89
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,749
Now, the remains are in here,
and, Mr. Breekman's at my office

90
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,756
if you want to come with me,
agent Booth.

91
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:43,204
Ma'am.

92
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,443
You're going to be okay here
all alone in this spooky hospital

93
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,223
with a dead alien body?

94
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:53,833
Right... That would be me
who wouldn't want that.

95
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,875
The remains are encased
in adipocere.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,483
If it's OK with sheriff Lobo,
maybe you could send me some.

97
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,503
It appears to be petrified.

98
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,627
A coat alone doesn't account
for that.

99
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:09,214
I'll send the coat to Hodgins,
see what he can discern from it.

100
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:13,295
Her skeletal robusticity and large areas
of muscle attachment suggest

101
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:14,873
extremely good health.

102
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,215
A couple weeks in the desert,
and no critters got at these remains?

103
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,505
Perhaps the result of green radiation
from alien hyperdrive systems?

104
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,554
Or something not crazy.

105
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,853
The man who found them remarked
that he saw several sets of orange eyes

106
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,681
staring at him from the darkness.

107
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,174
Orange-eyeballed aliens?

108
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,912
<i>Tapetum lucidum</i> of the american
coyote glows orange

109
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:40,607
when light strikes the retina.

110
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:44,590
What he saw were likely coyotes,
not orange-eyeballed aliens.

111
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,028
You were being facetious.
That's funny.

112
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,704
Wearing your earpiece,
he can't hear me,

113
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,622
so I can help you
with your interrogation.

114
00:06:56,178 --> 00:07:00,158
Some people who chase UFOS
believe in alien abductions.

115
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,254
Now, these people tend to be

116
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,004
<i>dreamy, highly suggestible,</i>

117
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:08,216
<i>and possess a strong belief
that there is something</i>

118
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,596
<i>larger than them out there,</i>

119
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,461
<i>something that they can't control.</i>

120
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,642
I only found the body.
I didn't make it dead.

121
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,270
<i>Okay, that's
very dissociative language:</i>

122
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,738
<i>"make it dead. "</i>

123
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,316
So, you were abducted
by aliens 5 years ago?

124
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,570
If the aliens are so advanced,
why would they need probes?

125
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,098
I think they like it.

126
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,904
Why would you hook up with aliens
if they like to anally probe you?

127
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,911
There are two races of aliens
and they do not see eye to eye.

128
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:38,791
Right.

129
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,471
I know things.

130
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:44,827
I get laughed at, but I persist
because I know things.

131
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:48,423
It just seems like maybe I deserve
a little respect for that.

132
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,593
All right, of course.
I apologize.

133
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,264
Okay, then, can I go home?

134
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,765
Why were you in the desert
last night?

135
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:59,060
I was looking for UFOS.

136
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,352
No, I mean to that specific area.

137
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:04,522
What are the chances
of you stumbling across a body in the...

138
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:05,484
dark...

139
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,610
<i>the vastness...</i>

140
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,324
... vastness of, of the desert?

141
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,112
You really want me to believe that's
some kind of big coincidence?

142
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,003
Yes, it, it was a coincidence.

143
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,300
I don't believe you.
I think you're lying.

144
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,825
<i>Sometimes I think you just pull me
into these interrogations to show off.</i>

145
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>Wait, booth, I...</i>

146
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,821
Until you tell the truth,
you know what?

147
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,546
You're not going home.

148
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,231
You have something on your mind?

149
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,936
This thing
that we have going here...

150
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,916
You're worried about Cam knowing?

151
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,910
I'm worried about
Hodgins not knowing.

152
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:01,736
Listen...

153
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:08,015
Hodgins and I are in the past.

154
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,649
I mean, if you were really,
totally in the past,

155
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,885
we wouldn't be keeping
this a secret from him.

156
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,535
- Do you want me to tell Hodgins?
- If you don't mind, I'd like to do it.

157
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:19,308
He's my friend.

158
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:23,187
A man-to-man, look-him-
In-the-eye kind of thing?

159
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:25,147
Yeah, something like that.

160
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,330
Let's do it your way.

161
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:37,242
You mean talk to Hodgins or...?

162
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,009
You're the worst.

163
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,134
Both.

164
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,619
Consider this a do-over.

165
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,343
- Do you know who I am?
- No, do you know who I am?

166
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,512
FBI?

167
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:59,253
Military intelligence?
That's an oxymoron,

168
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,885
a term that contradicts itself.
I'm Delmy Polanco.

169
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,468
I'm the most important
UFO blogger in the world.

170
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,728
"Important blogger"...
Talk about an oxymoron.

171
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,660
What can you tell me
about the alien body?

172
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:10,192
I don't know anything it.

173
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,066
Definitely FBI.

174
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,317
I can practically smell the suit.

175
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:16,365
I don't wear a suit
all the time, you know.

176
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,863
I see you've met Delmy.

177
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:20,798
I'm looking for info into a foil
wrapped body with alien features,

178
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:24,539
pieces of which have already been sent
to the Jeffersonian institution.

179
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:30,305
I'm invoking
the freedom of information act,

180
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,130
you've to tell me
what I want to know.

181
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,581
The freedom of information act
is not a magic spell, Delmy.

182
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:38,595
It merely gives a citizen the
right to request information.

183
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,191
I'm gonna post all this
on my blog tonight,

184
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:46,060
and by tomorrow morning, this whole town
will be swarming with UFO nuts.

185
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:47,957
Trespassing again?

186
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,827
Well, this facility is clearly
marked private property.

187
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,868
Good... You got here
for the good stuff.

188
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,523
- What good stuff?
- MRI.

189
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,009
It's an older model,
but entirely serviceable.

190
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:08,053
For future reference,
that's not the good stuff.

191
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:11,464
Sure it is... Look at all those
remodeled lateral malleolus fractures.

192
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,840
Also, signs of inflammation
to the tannin fibers here

193
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,425
and damaged...

194
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,256
I won't say anything about the scream
if you don't say anything about the gun.

195
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,403
Those terms are satisfactory. Right.

196
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,594
That's five.

197
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,742
Too big to be buckshot.

198
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,282
Photos you sent of the first one show
to be a ball bearing approximately

199
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,707
7.5 millimeters.

200
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,425
This makes number six.

201
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,667
Certainly enough metal
to generate the magnetism

202
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,757
to raise the remains
when exposed to the MRI.

203
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,857
When I receive them, I might be able to
i. d. the manufacturer and intended use,

204
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,763
which I imagine was not murder.

205
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,806
I finished the facial reconstruction
off the MRI...

206
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,185
I'm emailing it now.

207
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,221
Sorry... It is not an alien.

208
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:13,106
I noticed on the MRI that the victim's
patellas were fractured.

209
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,202
<i>Well, I'll swab the area,</i>

210
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,861
and send the samples
with the ball bearings.

211
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,953
Well, there's no striations on the ball
bearings in this photo you sent,

212
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,256
so there's no evidence
that they were shot.

213
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,369
Shotgun, maybe?
Full of ball bearings?

214
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:29,206
Well, the owner of the ranch
threatened us with a shotgun.

215
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,845
Not so fast, dr. Brennan.
I know you dislike flesh,

216
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,284
but you need to remove the adipocere
and organs to send them to me.

217
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,925
- Dr. Brennan dealing with flesh.
- Like a cat dealing with water.

218
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,593
Flesh is not my strength.

219
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,304
You're going to need a hair dryer
and some cooking spray.

220
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:55,344
Yep, I've caught her trespassing
on my ranch a bunch of times.

221
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,389
That's el crazerita.

222
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,403
El crazerita.
You know her real name?

223
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,102
Nope. I don't make
friends with these nuts.

224
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,922
Sheriff says you've been charged
with misdemeanor assault with a firearm

225
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:05,951
about 3 times.

226
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:08,542
Someone cut through this fence,
agent Booth.

227
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,581
They were trespassers.
Which is why I was never convicted.

228
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,667
- Even though you shot at them?
- Salt.

229
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:15,636
- Salt?
- Salt.

230
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,961
Rock salt.

231
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,549
Stings like a sumbitch.
Discourages trespassing.

232
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,843
You ever use ball bearings
instead of salt?

233
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,347
Ball bearings?!

234
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,680
That'd rip somebody apart.

235
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:30,100
Like when you took a shot at,
ol'el crazerita?

236
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,478
You think I killed her?
You think I'm dumb enough

237
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,029
to spend my life in prison
for killing some alienhead nut

238
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,234
who spent all her time
shooting stupid videos?

239
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,694
Videos? Videos of what?

240
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,435
Videos of everything.

241
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,110
Looking for spacemen.

242
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,631
You want to know about her?
Ask Blaine Miller

243
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,456
at the space place cafe.

244
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:52,812
She was always hanging out
at his diner with the other fruitcakes.

245
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,655
Sure. I'll take a look at your shotgun
there and run some tests.

246
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,590
You know, just to make sure.

247
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,309
- I did it!
<i>- Very good, Dr. Brennan.</i>

248
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,685
Yes, it was.

249
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,479
Now remove the stomach.

250
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,207
She was covered in ethyl
parathion and aldicarb.

251
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,442
<i>It was all over
her space-age outerwear.</i>

252
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,406
<i>It's an insecticide.
It's extremely illegal in the u. s.,</i>

253
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,530
but it's still sold
south of the border.

254
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,827
It explains why the
adipocere dried so quickly.

255
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,497
<i>So, our victim was using
a dangerous insecticide.</i>

256
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:37,747
Not unusual for someone who's a couple
of tacos short of a combo plate.

257
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,522
- Nice metaphor.
- Thanks.

258
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>I found something!</i>

259
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,336
It's a memory card...

260
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,224
Tied to a string.

261
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:50,138
It appears to be dental floss.

262
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,926
Check her teeth. Any evidence
of floss still on her teeth?

263
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:01,191
There's a fragment tied
to the left second premolar.

264
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,027
She was hiding the card.
It's an old prison trick.

265
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:06,154
She tied one end of the floss
to her tooth,

266
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,603
<i>the other end to the memory card,
so if she needed it,</i>

267
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:10,408
<i>she could use the floss
to pull it up.</i>

268
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,141
I'll overnight the card to Angela.

269
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:16,439
Whatever is on it
was important enough to hide.

270
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:19,459
My guess, it's important enough
to kill for.

271
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,347
Man, did you hear?

272
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,141
Brennan's sending the victim's
sd card from Roswell.

273
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:39,053
Probably video on there the government
wanted suppressed, because at area 51...

274
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,687
Look, do you have a second?

275
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:42,862
Sure, yeah.

276
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:45,277
Something wrong?

277
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,047
We're friends, right?

278
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,409
I don't lie or keep things
from my friends.

279
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,202
Okay, all right.

280
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,611
Angela and I...

281
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,071
You're kidding, right?

282
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,254
Go ahead, kid...
Knock yourself out.

283
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:05,788
Good luck with that.

284
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:09,259
What I'm trying to tell you
is that my luck has already been good.

285
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,978
I would never want
you to think that I...

286
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:16,903
Wendell, stop, stop, stop.

287
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:19,232
It's been over between
her and me for a long time.

288
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,492
I have moved on.

289
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:22,803
And you know what?
I'm happy for you, you know?

290
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:23,898
And for her.

291
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,737
- Really?
- Yes, really.

292
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,738
You're both my friends.
Why wouldn't I be happy for you?

293
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,370
I don't...

294
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:35,299
Thanks, man.

295
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,438
Of course.
I'll tell you what,

296
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,413
why don't the three of us
grab lunch together?

297
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,336
This is a good thing, Wendell,
this should not be weird for us.

298
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,130
Yeah, yeah, sure, lunch.
That sounds great, man.

299
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,132
Great, good, good.

300
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,265
Stomach acid ate away at the card,
but Angela says she should be able

301
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,696
to pull something off of it.

302
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,989
Vinton said el crazerita
shot a lot of video.

303
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:00,685
Maybe she filmed the real thing.

304
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,771
What, an extraterrestrial?

305
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,278
You said it was possible, all right?
But they have big eyes and big heads,

306
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,340
you know, for the super-smart brain.

307
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,501
That's far more logical
if they had the eyes of flies

308
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,448
and the exoskeleton of a cockroach.

309
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,816
Insect people?

310
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:16,951
Insects can't fly a spaceship.

311
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,863
Well, the cockroach
is an evolutionary marvel.

312
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:21,653
They can withstand radiation,

313
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:25,391
live without breathing for almost
an hour, go without eating for weeks.

314
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:27,759
Imagine that combined
with an intelligence

315
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,506
that evolved over many millennia.

316
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,257
Plus, they do have extra arms.

317
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,973
Would you look at this place?

318
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:46,192
This is so cool.

319
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:50,527
"UFO museum research center. "

320
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,692
Check this out.
Look at those guns.

321
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,927
No way, Bones! Look at this.
<i>Rocketship 7.</i>

322
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,908
I used to watch that
when I was a little boy.

323
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,159
The sweetlees, and there was
Mr. Beeper and Promo the robot.

324
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:02,644
Well, the way
this craft is designed,

325
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:04,955
it could never leave
the earth's atmosphere.

326
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,315
Yeah, but according to
Dave Thomas and <i>rocketship 7,</i>

327
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,326
you would go on
adventures like no other.

328
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,828
You two looking for aliens?
The name's Blaine Miller.

329
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,400
Not exactly.

330
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,365
You hear about that body they found up
at Vinton's place?

331
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,388
We never mentioned a body,
mr. Miller.

332
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,714
Nothing travels faster than the speed
of light than gossip in a small town.

333
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,824
Excuse me, sir?
Why are all these radios on?

334
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:28,287
This is some of the original equipment
that picked up the signal from the craft

335
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,199
that landed right here in Roswell.

336
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:33,956
Dave, these are the radios
that heard the aliens.

337
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,406
But that's absurd.
Why would she believe you?

338
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:40,232
They travel all the way to Roswell to
believe in aliens, like everybody else.

339
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:42,370
Do you recognize this woman,
mr. Miller?

340
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,638
Sure. This is Ursula Lapine.
She's a regular.

341
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:47,646
She the one who's dead?

342
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:50,242
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Maybe a month ago.

343
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,379
She was having an argument with a woman.
I had to tell her to keep it down.

344
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,315
- And who was this woman?
- I don't know; I never saw her before.

345
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,397
African-american, good-looking.
In a suit.

346
00:18:58,522 --> 00:18:59,971
Ursula, she live around here?

347
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,411
Outside of town.

348
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,725
She's in one of those shiny,
spaceship-type trailers.

349
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,570
I think I hear something.

350
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,479
I think I hear a spaceship.

351
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,360
She was serious?

352
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,240
This must be the place...
Spacey-looking trailer.

353
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,120
- One of the windows is broken.
- All right.

354
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,124
Stay behind me, Bones.

355
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,128
- Bones, I think you need to see this.
- And you need to see this.

356
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,222
There's blood on it.

357
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,124
Could have been
what busted her knees.

358
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:07,194
You got to check this out.

359
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,335
She seems very thorough.

360
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:15,447
The word loony come to mind?

361
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,674
This is a remarkably well-researched

362
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,629
wall for a crazerita.

363
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:22,136
Crazerita is right.
What about this here? Look.

364
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,403
Check this out.

365
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,723
- Something was taken.
- Maybe that's why she was killed.

366
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,214
This cinder block
was obviously used in an assault.

367
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:29,787
We have to analyze the blood.

368
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:31,371
You know what?
Maybe...

369
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,612
we can pull a print
off the block like this.

370
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,618
All right.
Watch this.

371
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,075
This...

372
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,054
That...

373
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,167
is magic.

374
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:53,751
Science.

375
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,396
Did you have any luck?

376
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,834
- Was the data damaged?
- A bit.

377
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,983
There might still be
a few corrupted frames.

378
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,284
So it's video.

379
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:06,943
But I think it's gonna play.

380
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:13,450
My God, is that what I think it is?

381
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,106
And are those...?

382
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:19,444
Impossible.
This was doctored.

383
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:21,423
No... it isn't.

384
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,365
This was verified by the scanning
software at a pixel level.

385
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,204
Are you saying our victim might
have stumbled on a real ufo?

386
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:44,344
Assuming that the figures
in the Hazmat suits are of

387
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,370
<i>average height,
then this structure here must be</i>

388
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:49,189
<i>about four to five meters tall.</i>

389
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:50,598
Why is the ground glowing?

390
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,269
The light seems to be
emitting from a spilled liquid.

391
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:54,874
UFO fuel.

392
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:58,107
What are those two
humanoid shapes there,

393
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,280
between the Hazmat-suited
humans and the craft?

394
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,655
<i>I'm gonna keep
working on this footage,</i>

395
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>but you guys have to
admit that this makes</i>

396
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,534
<i>the hairs on your arm
stand on end, right?</i>

397
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:11,984
The hairs on my arm
are not reacting in any way.

398
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,188
But thanks.

399
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,939
It's not a spaceship.

400
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:18,294
If it smells like a duck,
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...

401
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:21,070
But then it would be a duck,
not a spaceship,

402
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:23,603
- so your point escapes me.
- It's a metaphor...

403
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,052
- Have you decided to let me go?
- We have questions.

404
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,429
You ever been out to
Ursula Lapine's trailer?

405
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,349
We have evidence that you're lying.

406
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,892
You fell into that one.

407
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,395
We have your fingerprints
on a cinder block

408
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,286
that was used
to break into her trailer.

409
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:38,606
Also, blood.

410
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,606
And you took something off her wall.

411
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:46,280
If I give it to you, will you drop
the trespassing charges and let me go?

412
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,724
If you don't hand it over, I'll just
charge you with obstructing justice,

413
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,328
he'll charge you with interfering
with a Federal investigation...

414
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,871
Maybe even murder...

415
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,790
and you will pray
for the good old days,

416
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,348
where all you were worrying about
were those silly little

417
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,211
trespassing and burglary charges.

418
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,790
I find he's very useful
in certain situations.

419
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,855
Very useful.
So, gonna hand 'em over?

420
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:13,846
Holy cow.

421
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:16,788
Pay dirt.

422
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:19,538
I gotta get better at frisking.

423
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:22,946
Wait a minute.
This is Ursula with Marvin.

424
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,856
I'm gonna need a copy
for my article:

425
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,352
"UFO-Obsessed Woman
Dies in Alien Encounter."

426
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,001
So the swab from the
victim's damaged patellas

427
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,483
show traces of sediment,
but it's not cement.

428
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,475
What hit her knees
wasn't cinder block?

429
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,422
No, the sediment is gypsum,

430
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:47,490
dating back to the Pleistocene
and Holocene eras.

431
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:50,303
It's probably from the Tularosa
or Estancia Basins.

432
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,474
Mexico?!

433
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,932
Northern Mexico is the closest
occurrence of this rock.

434
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,032
It's an interesting
conjunction of possibilities:

435
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:59,145
the insecticide that she was soaked in,
it's called "Tres Pasitos."

436
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,471
- Not available in the United States.
- Is it available in Mexico?

437
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:04,583
- Readily.
- Excellent.

438
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,069
So I took the information
that you gave me,

439
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,728
and it looks as though
the projectiles

440
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:13,910
first impacted next to
the juncture between

441
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,118
the frontal and parietal bones.

442
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:19,290
The bearings entered beneath her chin,
then ricocheted around in her skull?

443
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,292
Yeah, that seems
to make the most sense.

444
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,426
But I've never heard
of any projectiles

445
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:26,422
that would enter at that range
and not fracture the skull.

446
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,632
What about, like,
slow-moving projectiles?

447
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,052
Maybe a paintball gun?

448
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:34,277
A little more powerful
than that, but not much.

449
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:36,776
Time for lunch.

450
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:40,144
To prove we're all fine?

451
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,831
You guys can hold
hands, if you want.

452
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,206
Eat off each other's plates...

453
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,866
Any and all of that kind of

454
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,712
gooey romanticism is
completely fine by me.

455
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,822
We know, Hodgins.

456
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:12,009
I'm not really the public
display kind of guy.

457
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,512
I'm just saying you don't need
to be afraid or...

458
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:23,886
There. See?

459
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,711
My head did not explode.

460
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:28,824
I'm not really okay
with being kissed

461
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:30,319
when it's not about me.

462
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:31,694
Sorry.

463
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,906
Panicked,
but everything's fine, right?

464
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:35,575
Everything's fine.

465
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,201
Everything's not fine.

466
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,872
This is a fraught situation.

467
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,751
It's important
to face these things head-on.

468
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,405
There's nothing to face, okay?

469
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:52,800
We can see why you'd think that, but

470
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:54,896
we're all fine.

471
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,470
I am... I'm fine.

472
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:03,235
Lance, your order's ready.

473
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,559
Thanks.

474
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:14,004
Why are we here?

475
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:17,186
We want to know what brought you out
here the night you found Ursula's body.

476
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,277
I told you, I was out UFO spotting.

477
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:21,544
I don't believe
in that big of a coincidence.

478
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:24,290
How long were you and Ursula lovers?
Go ahead. Take a look.

479
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:29,003
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,870
Ursula understood.

481
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:34,545
She believed.

482
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,886
My wife thought I was crazy.

483
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,196
What makes this patch of desert
any different to you

484
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:41,072
than any other patch of desert?

485
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,227
This is where we were
when we first saw the lights.

486
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,853
Where did you see the lights?

487
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,503
Beyond those hills.
Hot spheres, very clear.

488
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,653
- Ursula and I saw them together.
- How far?

489
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:56,340
Maybe two kilometers.

490
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,157
That would be Mexico.

491
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:01,383
We were going to check it out together
next time I came through town.

492
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,412
We'd meet every few weeks.

493
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:06,328
- You and Ursula were true believers.
- Not really.

494
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:09,892
Ursula... she was convinced
that if she could find proof

495
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:12,665
of alien visitation,
it would make her rich.

496
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,630
What happened to her, Marvin?

497
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:15,967
Really.

498
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,885
What do you think?

499
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:22,565
I think she came out here
without me.

500
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:26,185
Maybe she thought
I wanted half her money.

501
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,927
She maybe saw the lights
and crossed over,

502
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,449
and they took her...

503
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:33,549
and experimented on her,

504
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:37,312
and then they dumped her in the desert,
like the heartless scientists they are.

505
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:50,566
The footage was pretty rough,
as you saw, so I ran an application

506
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:53,394
to counteract the motion of the
camera with opposite movement.

507
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:56,215
Then I translated each pixel
of the infrared spectrum

508
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:59,093
into a pixel
of the visible color spectrum.

509
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:00,780
Let's see it.

510
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:14,608
That's a lot more terrestrial
than I expected.

511
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:17,486
Two tanker trucks,
some sort of digger.

512
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,116
And this is a hose.
What do you think, three inches?

513
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,559
That's the source
of the glowing liquid.

514
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,373
But what about the alien things?

515
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,374
<i>Fremontodendron mexicanum.</i>

516
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,251
It's Mexican flannelbush.

517
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,510
Weird, glowing liquid
in the Mexican desert,

518
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:36,065
Hazmat suits.

519
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:40,276
They must've been
dumping chemicals illegally.

520
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,885
She fell.

521
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,054
That must've been where
she fractured her knees.

522
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,058
But she still managed to get away.

523
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,628
You guys see what happened?

524
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:52,188
She was out looking for UFOS,
but found this instead.

525
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,606
These guys killed her.

526
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:56,774
You know, I think I liked this
all better when it was aliens.

527
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,555
I was able to clarify the
chemiluminescent signature

528
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,871
of the materials being
dumped in the video.

529
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,416
Manganese and sodium borohydride.
Used in the manufacture of batteries.

530
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,884
Can you get a specific
manufacturer from that?

531
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:16,009
I did.

532
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,307
Innatron.

533
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:20,087
Mexican flannelbush is on
the verge of extinction, right?

534
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,896
Innatron has a plant located
smack-dab in the middle

535
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,054
of the last remaining
flannelbush population...

536
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,499
here in Juarez...

537
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:29,308
and they use manganese
and sodium borohydride.

538
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,583
Dr. Hodgins, I'm kind of
in the middle of...

539
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,395
You were right, Sweets.

540
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,139
Everything is not fine.

541
00:30:00,057 --> 00:30:01,391
It's not fine at all.

542
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,319
This is a good time.

543
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,996
Don't know if I want to crawl
into a hole and die or...

544
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:10,176
run over Wendell and Angela
with a truck.

545
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:13,210
You know, it's natural
to have those feelings.

546
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:14,847
But I'm a better man than this.

547
00:30:14,972 --> 00:30:17,350
I mean, I...
I want to be happy for them.

548
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:19,118
You know, I really do.

549
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,520
It's easier for us
to accept loneliness,

550
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:23,733
as long as the person
we were once with

551
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,281
is also alone.

552
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,505
When she finds happiness
with someone else,

553
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,862
man, it's like being stabbed
in the heart.

554
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,364
It's the human condition.

555
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,566
You know, it's why there
are so many movies

556
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,458
and plays and songs and poems.

557
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,971
Yeah, yeah... art, art.
I get it.

558
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,212
What do I do?

559
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:43,409
Well, first, you need
to figure out what you want.

560
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:47,941
I want to not be filled
with anger and-and...

561
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,613
pain and resentment.

562
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,485
I don't want to be jealous.

563
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:54,602
Do you want Angela back?

564
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,824
I don't think you're jealous.
I think that you're grieving

565
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,575
what you've lost.

566
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,945
Grieving?

567
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:06,745
As in grief?

568
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,418
The only thing
that cures grief is time.

569
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,738
Unless you're recommending
a lot of alcohol.

570
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,241
I can't really recommend alcohol.

571
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,762
Man, that'd be great
if you could, though, right?

572
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,976
I recommend time.

573
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:24,077
So, just...
smile and act like a good guy?

574
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:26,993
You are a good guy.

575
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,683
There was a time

576
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,575
that I thought that Angela and I
would be together forever.

577
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:44,273
- Can I just sit here for a minute?
- Yeah, take all the time you need.

578
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,851
There is nothing
in this video that indicates

579
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,086
what kind of weapon
was used to kill the victim.

580
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,321
Yeah. It's true.

581
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:04,423
I doesn't look like anybody's armed.

582
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:07,675
Now, I was able to salvage
some of the audio track.

583
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,132
- That's just white noise.
- I know, but

584
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,934
I scrubbed the background and separated
the different frequencies,

585
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,271
and then I amplified
the resulting file.

586
00:32:19,926 --> 00:32:21,057
<i>Yo estoy encargada.</i>

587
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,274
<i>Y si no lo terminas
antes del amanecer</i>

588
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,742
<i>te arrepentirás.</i>

589
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,946
- That's Spanish.
- Yeah. I know.

590
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,696
We need a translator.

591
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,718
I was a cop and coroner in New
York City, so I speak some.

592
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,696
Can you play that back?

593
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,254
<i>Yo estoy encargada.</i>

594
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:38,624
<i>Y si no lo terminas antes
del amanecer</i> <i>te arrepentirás.</i>

595
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:41,632
"I'm in charge.
If you don't get this done

596
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,586
before sunrise, you'll regret it."

597
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:46,213
<i>Yo estoy encargada.</i>

598
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,927
- She's not from Mexico, though.
- You can tell that?

599
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,921
The way she says "estoy"
and "arrepentirás."

600
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:55,389
The Puerto Rican cops used to laugh
when I pronounced my "T"s like that.

601
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,682
You think that...

602
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:00,227
The speaker is definitely American.

603
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,384
<i><i>Ursula thought she was filming
a UFO crash site?</i></i>

604
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,102
But she ended up with footage
of an American dumping toxic waste

605
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:11,113
in the Mexican desert.

606
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,180
- Rachel Adams.
- American?

607
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,295
She's an Innatron executive,
in charge of waste management.

608
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,454
She's based in Juarez, Mexico.

609
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,899
African-American.

610
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:22,668
The owner of the diner said
that the victim was seen arguing

611
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,936
with an African-American
businesswoman.

612
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,839
We put together a range of weapons
which might fire ball bearings

613
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:35,014
at a velocity congruent
with the damage done

614
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,854
to the inside of our victim's skull.

615
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,019
We have a paintball gun,

616
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,022
an air rifle, a BB gun,
and a PVC pipe zip gun.

617
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,355
Each modified

618
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,499
to fire six 17.5-millimeter
ball bearings.

619
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,486
Melons lined with paraffin
and filled with

620
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,072
dense agar gelatin,
which mimics skull and brain matter.

621
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,937
What's with the faces?

622
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:02,585
Well, I guess, I...
kind of got inspired.

623
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,500
Inspired?

624
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,700
All right, goggles, everyone.

625
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Ready?

626
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,977
All right. Okay.

627
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:20,192
So, the paintball gun ball bearing

628
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:22,393
didn't have enough force
to get through my skull.

629
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,644
That's too bad.

630
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:25,652
I'm next.

631
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:27,295
I'll shoot you.

632
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,897
That was way too much damage.

633
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:37,893
That blew your head clear off.

634
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,537
I don't know if anyone should
enjoy their work this much.

635
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,135
You and Dr. Saroyan are
still in the running.

636
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,155
I got it.

637
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:01,472
Not enough force to
kill Dr. Saroyan.

638
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:07,938
The balls are rattling,
but your head is still intact.

639
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,392
Call that thing by my name
one more time.

640
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,601
I dare you.

641
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,820
- It was a zip gun.
- A perfect,

642
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,553
untraceable, cheap weapon,
easily homemade.

643
00:35:18,147 --> 00:35:19,256
That was fun.

644
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:21,076
Boys.

645
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,703
You got that right.

646
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:33,903
Want to do it again?

647
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:38,771
I have an appointment,

648
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:40,971
I don't have to answer
your questions.

649
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,542
We follow all of the rules
set forth by the EPA

650
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,644
and environmental restrictions.

651
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,810
On paper.

652
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,438
- I resent that.
- We have witnesses

653
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,637
at Roswell who said that they saw
you arguing with the witness

654
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,753
on the day that she was murdered.

655
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:57,237
Did your witness tell you
what we were arguing about?

656
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:06,298
You were trying to buy video
footage Ursula had taken of you

657
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:08,373
illegally dumping toxic waste.

658
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,436
She thought she had
real footage of a UFO,

659
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,628
unfortunately for you,
she didn't give it up.

660
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:19,078
I work for a major corporation

661
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:22,081
that's just signed a billion-
dollar deal with the Mexicans.

662
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,177
You think you can extradite me?

663
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:26,975
Take your best shot.

664
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:39,112
- Here comes something.
- What's it say?

665
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:41,705
It says that Innatron

666
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,035
contracts its waste disposal
to an independent contractor.

667
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,753
Is it owned by a shell company?

668
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:48,253
Norte Domesticas.

669
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:50,031
We'll get D.C. on it,

670
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:52,960
but I'm going to tell you right now, I
already know who owns that company.

671
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:54,419
Rachel Adams?

672
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,987
Innatron pays the shell company
thousands of dollars

673
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:59,189
to get rid of the waste,
and her and her crew...

674
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:01,510
dump it in the desert
and they pocket the money.

675
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,193
Ursula Lapine thinks

676
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,529
she's photographing
extraterrestrial contact,

677
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,850
they catch her, she ends up dead.

678
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,344
Why would she turn down
the money in the diner,

679
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:12,521
then agree to meet
out in the desert?

680
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,482
Perhaps that's where they agreed
to swap the video for the money.

681
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I guess.

682
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,951
You say,
"Yeah, I guess," but you mean,

683
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:21,363
"I don't think so."

684
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:22,913
Rachel lives in Juarez.

685
00:37:23,038 --> 00:37:26,229
I mean, she could get herself
an untraceable gun,

686
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:27,947
what, in like 15 minutes?

687
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:30,163
Instead, she shows up
with a homemade zip gun?

688
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,450
That doesn't make sense.
Right?

689
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,764
It's not me.

690
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:41,425
- It's Booth.
- Listen.

691
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,385
Could we just focus
on the ball bearings?

692
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,622
What about them?

693
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:46,487
Could you trace them to Innatron?

694
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,558
- How can you be so sure?
- Because they're obsolete.

695
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,019
They were manufactured
in the '40s and the '50s.

696
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,061
For what?

697
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,189
Roller skates, fishing reels,
yo-yos, turntables.

698
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,357
Toys?!

699
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,952
I'm just closing up.

700
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,857
I turned off
about a half an hour ago.

701
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,926
We're not here to eat, Blaine.

702
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,861
Any of these work back here?

703
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,602
The disruptor there
from Gamma-Gamma Six.

704
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:15,833
Why isn't this solar system working?

705
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,602
'Cause it's 60 years old.
What is with you people?

706
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,437
You overheard Rachel

707
00:38:20,562 --> 00:38:22,773
offering Ursula payoff money,
didn't you, Blaine?

708
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,118
What? No. I didn't.

709
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:27,387
You told us you had to ask them
to keep it down.

710
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,992
- How come you don't interrupt Bones?
- I'm a gentlemen.

711
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,849
- How much...
- How much did Rachel offer?

712
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,083
Ten grand? 20?

713
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,686
But Ursula thought

714
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,550
that she had proof of alien life.

715
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,732
How much did she ask for?
A million bucks?

716
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,565
You can't just take stuff like that.
You need a warrant.

717
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,133
- I'll get a warrant.
- We don't need a warrant.

718
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:45,906
We're just playing.

719
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,533
Like the sign says.
I figure what happens is you told her

720
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,911
- you could get her millions.
- You arranged...

721
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,414
You arranged to meet out, told her to
bring the video, you'd bring the buyer.

722
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,429
- He'staking your credit.
- He's talkative.

723
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:59,127
Can you hand me those ball
bearings there, will you?

724
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,213
Look at that.

725
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,507
- They seem to fit perfectly.
- Come on,

726
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,132
that's just a toy... you couldn't
hurt a flea with that.

727
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,557
That would be the murder weapon.

728
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:15,993
I got my rights.

729
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,197
You got the right to shut
the hell up.

730
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,998
Killing that poor crazy woman
for her video.

731
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,666
By the way, that video,

732
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,397
it was hid down her throat
on a thread of dental floss,

733
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,071
you moron.

734
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:29,866
He is a moron.
You are definitely a moron!

735
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,810
Not literally, figuratively.

736
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,813
It's very satisfying to use
an insulting colloquialism

737
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,374
even when it isn't accurate.

738
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,751
It's better when they resist
and you get to hit them.

739
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,809
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I think so.

740
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:50,486
Do you feel better?

741
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,363
Being open about our relationship?

742
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:54,491
You bet.

743
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,318
You know, it's over
between Hodgins and me.

744
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:59,670
I mean, you believe that now, right?

745
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,025
I think everything is always
more complicated than it looks.

746
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:07,344
I am telling you, mister, it's not.

747
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:10,781
Like Dr. Brennan says:

748
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:14,509
no use jumping to conclusions
before all the evidence is in.

749
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:39,672
Quite a show?

750
00:40:39,797 --> 00:40:41,730
Shouldn't we get going home?

751
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,715
How many times do you get a chance
to check out a desert sky?

752
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,818
I've been in the desert many times.

753
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,753
Though, usually
I'm digging in the ground,

754
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,208
not looking up.

755
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,057
Now's your chance to look up.

756
00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:55,386
So, look up.

757
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,321
But it's ridiculous to think
there's anything on this planet

758
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:02,856
worth seeing which merits crossing

759
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:05,617
what are literally
astronomical distances.

760
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:12,200
Maybe aliens are anthropologists?

761
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,746
Maybe they just want to
study our religion

762
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:19,097
and sex and... love

763
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,270
and our funny languages
and line dancing?

764
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,389
That's an interesting
possibility I hadn't considered.

765
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,225
Living creatures, they
like to reach out, Bones.

766
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,814
Living creatures like to
reach out and eat each other.

767
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:32,429
So what are you saying,

768
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:34,709
that the aliens just
want to come down here

769
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,451
and drink our spinal fluid?

770
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,614
If the aliens are advanced enough

771
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,228
to fly faster than light,

772
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:44,308
then they can probably
make spinal fluid.

773
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,419
You just said that aliens are nice.

774
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:48,296
I did not.

775
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,965
You just basically said
that aliens are nice anthropologists.

776
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,167
I don't think so.

777
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,380
You think

778
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:56,784
the aliens are you.

779
00:41:58,562 --> 00:41:59,603
You got me.

780
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,225
You know, I'm one of them.

781
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,171
I knew it.
I was sent down as an advance scout.

782
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:05,214
I knew it.

783
00:42:06,702 --> 00:42:08,131
No probing.
No probing!

784
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:11,134
Probing is a valuable way
to gather information.

785
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:14,375
We know how you people
like to probe... right.

786
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,269
Did you hear that?

787
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:22,080
What was it?

788
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,760
