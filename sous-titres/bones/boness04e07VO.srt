1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,446
I'm so toasted.

2
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,305
Yeah, me, too.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,024
Hey.

4
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:16,570
What?

5
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,380
Early morning.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,215
Shouldn't it be foggy?

7
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:24,263
Global warming.

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,781
But it's all good.

9
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,285
No, not really.

10
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,369
I don't want to be negative,
but it's not all good.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,496
Just ask a penguin, man.

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,605
Global warming sucks.

13
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:38,208
What's that?

14
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:41,461
Global warming is when some
kind of carbon gasses get built up...

15
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:42,921
No, what's that?

16
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:46,840
Just trash.

17
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:49,909
No, man.

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,889
Oh! Look at that!, thank God,
somebody got murdered.

19
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:35,879
Let's go.

20
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,351
You're supposed to turn your phones
off during our sessions.

21
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:39,811
Not just vibrate.

22
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:43,315
It's a matter of respect.

23
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:49,694
Hi, guys.

24
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,641
Oh, hey. Dr. Brennan.

25
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,723
Mr. Nigel-Murray,
what are you doing here?

26
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:59,034
We decided to utilize
some of your brighter grad students

27
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,499
until we find a full-time
forensic anthropologist, remember?

28
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,919
Do you consider yourself one of
my brighter grad students?

29
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,902
Yes. And so do you, Dr. Brennan.

30
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:10,106
I am not calling this kid
Mr. Nigel... anything.

31
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:13,678
Vincent. Or Vince.
Or Vinnie, Vin, Vincenzo.

32
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,781
Actually, I had this girlfriend

33
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,225
once who used to call me
Vino Delectable because of how my...

34
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:22,425
You don't... need to know that.

35
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:26,274
- What do you need me to do first?
- I need you to go back to the lab.

36
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,872
I thought perhaps
you might want Vin... cent

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,279
to shadow you,
get a real sense of what you do.

38
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,901
Little known forensic fact:

39
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,533
tongue prints are as distinctive
as fingerprints, so...

40
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:37,327
I can be useful in the field.

41
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,911
I need a forensic anthropologist
in the lab

42
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,689
so I can spend my time aiming
Agent Booth in the right direction.

43
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:45,335
"Aiming Agent Booth"?
What, like a hose?

44
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, here.

45
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:48,836
Take my car.

46
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:50,891
I'll get a ride with Booth.

47
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,511
How were these remains found?

48
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:57,552
Well, let me aim you
in this direction, okay, Bones?

49
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,175
Two... let's call them hippies,

50
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,478
found these remains this morning.

51
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:04,604
Deadheads.

52
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:07,666
Oh, I sold veggie burritos and
followed Phish one whole summer

53
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:08,787
It was fantastic.

54
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,884
I'm not able to ascertain sex
without a pelvic bone.

55
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:15,118
Well, if this scrap of cloth
is a bathing suit, then probably female.

56
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,743
Are you good at estimating
time of death for submerged corpses?

57
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,079
Heavily degraded by crab and fish.

58
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,885
Two to three weeks?

59
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,444
That could be a breast implant.

60
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,275
Breasts, that's mydepartment, okay?

61
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,920
You give me a serial number,
my guys will be able to track that down.

62
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:31,451
Why is there only half a skeleton?

63
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,217
Because the spine has been severed.

64
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:35,510
So, severed spine equals foul play.

65
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,178
No, not necessarily.

66
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,930
Then it was an accident.

67
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,224
- No, it was foul play.
- I just said that.

68
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,227
This hand has sustained trauma.

69
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:45,603
Shark attack.

70
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,481
No. The fingers got smashed
from what looks like multiple blows.

71
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,524
That suggests foul play and...
not by a shark.

72
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,899
We'll have Hodgins take a close
look for particulates.

73
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,447
- Great, so what do we do next?
- Find the other half.

74
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,618
Bones - Season 04 Episode 07
"The He in the She"

75
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,255
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

76
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:34,152
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

77
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,333
What do you see, Mr. Nigel-Murray?

78
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:41,649
Eye sockets.

79
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,771
Anything special
about these sockets?

80
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,914
There are no eyeballs in them?

81
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,971
We already have Agent Booth
to make lame jokes.

82
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:49,442
Let's stick to facts.

83
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,087
The rods in the human eye
are sensitive enough to detect

84
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,098
the light emitted
by a struck match from

85
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,924
as much as a mile away
on a clear night.

86
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,468
Okay, let's stick to relevant facts.

87
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,435
The sockets have been ground down.

88
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,096
Okay, that could be useful.

89
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,603
- Especially if you have an explanation.
- Plastic surgery.

90
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,520
She had, fake boobs, too.

91
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,532
"Sockets," "eyeballs," "boobs".

92
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,304
I wouldn't use these words
when conferring with Dr. Brennan.

93
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:15,875
I know. With her, it's all

94
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,529
"supraorbital limbus"
and "mammary implants."

95
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,406
But you seemed
a more colloquial sort.

96
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:23,243
Well, in that case,
what about the backbone?

97
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,775
A clean transection between
the L1 and L2 vertebrae.

98
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:28,509
Obviously,
that would have been fatal

99
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,796
if it had happened while
the victim were still alive.

100
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,967
This conk to the parietal bone

101
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,464
would not have been fatal.

102
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:39,384
And these abrasions are puzzling.

103
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:43,596
Postmortem scraping from the remains
being washed up on a stony beach.

104
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,556
Uh... should I have known that?

105
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,110
Point is, you do now.

106
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,109
The remains show traces
of freshwater and

107
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,105
pelagic sediment common
to Chesapeake Bay.

108
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,981
- Grad student?
- He's done very well so far.

109
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,609
- He'll disappoint.
- Why?

110
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:01,129
I've discovered microscopic tooth
shards from the Alosa sapidissima,

111
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:03,700
also known as the American shad,
on what flesh there is.

112
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,328
In the 1700s, the shad
was especially valued as a delicacy.

113
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:08,698
Yeah. Fascinating.

114
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,874
Based on currents, shad populations
and sheer guesswork...

115
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:13,520
Don't tell him you're guessing.

116
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,038
The victim died in the same body
of water in which she was found,

117
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,130
within 6 miles.

118
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,330
I got a serial number
off the breast implant.

119
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,758
The FBI's tracking it down.

120
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,529
Traces of copolymer
on the vertebrae, nearly microscopic.

121
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,805
I'm chasing that down.

122
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,815
I... won't disappoint.

123
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,629
I graduated with first-class honors
from Leeds.

124
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,238
Also, I have a retentive memory.

125
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,833
That would explain the...

126
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,774
informative tangents.

127
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,069
Does Brennan put "Mister"
in front of your name?

128
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:41,173
Yes.

129
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,823
It's her very subtle way
of saying you're not a doctor.

130
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,409
Don't tell him that.

131
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,496
Do you know what large-breasted
women and fish remind me of?

132
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,624
Be very careful what you say next,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

133
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:57,795
Topless saleswomen are legal
in Liverpool, England, but...

134
00:06:58,146 --> 00:06:59,505
only in tropical fish stores.

135
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,238
Tangents, Mr. Nigel-Murray,
tangents and diversions.

136
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,849
Perhaps we could keep
those to a minimum.

137
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:08,639
The FBI's traced the breast implant
to a Baltimore plastic surgeon.

138
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,392
He replaced a leaking implant
for this woman.

139
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,316
So, her name is Patricia Ludmuller,

140
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,587
RR #1, Maylor Island, Maryland.

141
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,372
Yeah, reported missing
three weeks ago.

142
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,031
Presumed drowned after she didn't
come back from her morning swim.

143
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,266
Very striking facial features.

144
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,452
Yeah, well, according to your
Mr. what's his name?

145
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:30,948
- Nigel-Murray?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,955
Those were mostly artificial, too.

147
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,280
- How many people live on Maylor Island?
- I'd say about a couple thousand,

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,420
that's one of those end-of-the-world
places where the weirdoes flock.

149
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,415
Why go to this much trouble
to make yourself look beautiful

150
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,159
and then move
to the end of the world?

151
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,303
Well, the background check on her
turned up suspiciously little.

152
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:50,324
All right? There's no credit cards,
no driver's license.

153
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,517
Officially, she didn't exist
before five years ago.

154
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,269
- Witness protection?
- No.

155
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,188
Marshals say she's not one of theirs.
But, you know, sometimes they lie.

156
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:01,484
If you really wanted to hide,
you wouldn't make yourself beautiful.

157
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:04,362
If you want to hide, Bones, you'd change
your looks as much as you can.

158
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:06,823
Talk about low profile.

159
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,513
It's very peaceful.

160
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,889
Yeah, well, these peaceful places,
they usually have a seething underbelly.

161
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:12,787
Really?

162
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:15,289
What do I know? I'm from Philly,
where the underbelly's on top.

163
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,615
Just focus. Look, our victim's home.

164
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:21,671
This is a very spiritual person,
catholic in her tastes.

165
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,151
- What, you can tell she's Catholic?
- Not Catholic, catholic.

166
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,802
Encompassing, universal.

167
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,144
She has a lot of religious books,

168
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,932
but they cover a wide range
of dogmas and philosophies.

169
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,577
She herself seems to be Protestant.

170
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:38,938
There's crosses, no crucifixes.

171
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,803
She's a pastor. Yeah.

172
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,137
Looks like one of those grassroots
community churches.

173
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,595
She was preparing for a sermon.

174
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,836
A pastor with breast augmentation
and veneers?

175
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:54,808
So?

176
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,914
A spiritual leader
shouldn't be so vain.

177
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:00,293
The Pope sits on a throne; he wears
robes worth thousands of dollars.

178
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,752
Isn't that vanity?

179
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,421
Oh. Really?!

180
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,707
You're going after the Pope now?

181
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,774
One pastor gets her teeth whitened,
and the other drinks wine

182
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:11,072
on Sunday mornings
and tells everyone that

183
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:13,431
it's been miraculously
transformed into blood.

184
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,793
Which of those is more outlandish?

185
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,192
You have one new message.

186
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,248
Hey. It's JP again.

187
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,166
I'm sorry. I miss you.

188
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,323
I need to see you, it's important.

189
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,740
I really need you, Patty.
Please call.

190
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,750
Please.

191
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,532
Sounds like a lost sheep
in need of religious counseling.

192
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,206
Sounds more
like a desperate boyfriend.

193
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:42,084
Oh. Nothing here.
It's just caller ID's blocked.

194
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,169
Hold on.

195
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:44,837
Booth.

196
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:47,006
Yeah? Where?

197
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,446
Bones.

198
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:51,504
Bones. They found
a pelvis and legs in the water

199
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,721
about 8 miles from here
in the Virginia bay.

200
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,933
- They should take it to the lab.
- Okay, send it over to the lab, now.

201
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,757
There's more tissue on this half.

202
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,124
And just because we have the top
of a body and the bottom

203
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,087
doesn't mean it's all the same body.

204
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,072
This half starts where
the other half ends, at the L2 vertebra.

205
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:13,283
Coincidence? I think not.

206
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,243
Based on the lack
of hemorrhagic tissue,

207
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,495
this victim was already dead
when cut in half.

208
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,057
He's in the water...

209
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,637
drowning, maybe, or
or he was pushed from a boat.

210
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,002
When he reaches for the boat,
his fingers are smashed.

211
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:28,392
He drowns, and then is cut
in half later in some

212
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,882
maritime mishap.

213
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:31,132
He?

214
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,470
Triangular pubis.
No evidence of a ventral arc.

215
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,600
The pelvic bone speaks,
it says, "I be male."

216
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,879
The pelvic bone can say
whatever it wants to say this part here

217
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,346
says female.

218
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:45,106
- What part's that?
- It's called a vagina.

219
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:51,320
Did you know that women
blink twice as often as men?

220
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,058
Which might be useful information

221
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,349
if the fish hadn't eaten
our victim's eyelids.

222
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,405
Relevance.

223
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:01,860
Well, I can do a DNA
comparison to find out

224
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,499
if these two sets of human remains
come from the same victim.

225
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,901
The measurements
of the vertebrae match perfectly.

226
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:09,561
I'm nearly positive
that it's all one victim.

227
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:10,944
Who is...?

228
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,905
- Male.
- And female.

229
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,280
We have one victim

230
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:20,327
with two sexes.

231
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:30,175
- A transgender?
- Post-op. She had female sex organs.

232
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,742
So if she had sexual
reassignment surgery,

233
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,195
she would be a transsexual.

234
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:39,244
Whew! How do they do that?

235
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,287
They split the penis,
and then turn it inside out,

236
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:44,441
carefully,
so as not to damage the nerves.

237
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,272
And then they use the glans
to create a nerve cluster

238
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,410
dense enough to achieve orgasm.

239
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,797
Okay, new rule.
No surgical details, all right?

240
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:54,272
Generally, transgendered people feel

241
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,297
that they're the victim
of a cosmic mistake.

242
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,305
They're certain, from a young age,
that they were born into the wrong body.

243
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,434
Surgery and hormone treatments are a way
to correct that biological mistake.

244
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,777
Which is why Patricia Ludmuller's
past only went back five years.

245
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:10,358
Are pastors allowed to think that God
makes those kind of mistakes?

246
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,402
Do you think God makes
that kind of mistake?

247
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:18,574
I think that God expects us
to overcome certain things.

248
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:22,242
The term "trans" conveys
a meaning of "beyond the cross."

249
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:25,022
Moving further.
There's a very spiritual component.

250
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,123
Let's say some
hyperreligious fundamentalist

251
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:30,476
finds out that Sister Patricia
used to be Father Paul...

252
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,299
And murders her.

253
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,297
Okay, you mentioned that
there was an intense message

254
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,399
on Patricia Ludmuller's
answering machine, right?

255
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,719
- Yes.
- If, say,

256
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,344
she had sex with a man,

257
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:42,748
and then informed him
that she was transgender,

258
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,184
isn't that a more
likely motive for murder?

259
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,785
Anthropologically speaking,

260
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,712
a male's status in a society
is closely connected with

261
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:52,149
what he perceives to be
his outward maleness.

262
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,361
Look, there's no way the guy on
that answering machine knew that he...

263
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,105
she... he...

264
00:12:57,354 --> 00:12:58,388
knew that she...

265
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,033
he... was transgender.

266
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,096
- How do you know?
- `Cause I know an

267
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,768
"ain't too proud to beg" phone call
when I hear one, all right?

268
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,748
He had no idea
that she wasn't a real woman.

269
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:10,418
- That's very insightful.
- Thank you. Insightful. See?

270
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,665
Except for the "real woman" slip.

271
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:15,997
Have you made many of these "ain't too
proud to beg" calls in the past?

272
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,217
What do you say
we just stay focused here?

273
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,879
Okay, have you ruled out completely

274
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,551
that Patricia Ludmuller's murder

275
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:25,574
might be because of something
that happened before he became a woman?

276
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:28,708
I put a request in to find out
his previous identity before

277
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,660
he was a woman.
That's the best I could do.

278
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,898
Okay, from now on,
he is always a she.

279
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,352
She was a he when she died,
so she deserves the respect due to

280
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,440
him or her...

281
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:39,947
Okay, person!

282
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:42,762
Okay...

283
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,744
I'm a genius and I'm confused.

284
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,707
Pastor Patricia was our center.

285
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,836
Like the best leaders, she drew us
together without even trying.

286
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,451
Did you release identity?

287
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:58,443
Their pastor went for a swim
and never came back. All right?

288
00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,824
The body washed up.

289
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,033
Intuitive leap.

290
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,179
Right.

291
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,217
Let's pray together.

292
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,850
Let's pray that whatever
happened to Patricia

293
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,455
out there alone came peacefully.

294
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:11,940
That God embraced her
as His daughter.

295
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:15,698
That there was no pain,
only God's great serenity.

296
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:19,320
A moment of silence
for the pastor we loved

297
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:21,050
so much.

298
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,474
- What are you doing?
- I'm praying.

299
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,042
Would you keep your voice down?

300
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,997
- Sorry. You're not a member.
- It's not a gym, Bones.

301
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,663
Excuse me, Mr...

302
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,016
Wade Schmidt. You're FBI?

303
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:49,518
How did you know that Patricia Ludmuller
was the victim found in the bay?

304
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,229
She's a member of our community,
and she's gone, we feel her loss.

305
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,075
We're right, aren't we?

306
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,200
Yes.

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,944
Is there a vice pastor?
Somebody else we can talk to?

308
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:02,238
Not really.
I take care of the finances.

309
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:06,443
Chuck, over there, he acted as kind
of an unofficial assistant to Patricia.

310
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,327
What will happen to the church now?

311
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,666
To be honest, I'm not optimistic that
we'll survive Patricia's loss.

312
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:17,419
Why? You're a community of people
with a common superstition.

313
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,005
The shared illusion should be
enough to bind you.

314
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,090
Bones.

315
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,218
Patricia would like you.

316
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,929
She'd say, "That's the one
that will keep us honest."

317
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,266
- See? She would have liked me.
- She keeps everyone honest. This one.

318
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,685
Hey, Chuck, you got a moment?

319
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,406
These people are from the FBI.

320
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,548
I thought Patricia drowned.

321
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,233
We don't know the cause of death yet.

322
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:41,650
She went for a swim
on a foggy morning.

323
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,198
She got cut in half
by a yacht propeller

324
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,408
or a destroyer returning
to Norfolk, okay?

325
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,446
We don't know
how the body was disarticulated.

326
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:53,451
- What the hell do you know?
- We know what we don't know,

327
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,891
Mr. Kennedy, that's why
we're asking questions.

328
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,969
Yeah, we do have a few felons
in our congregation,

329
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,462
former addicts.

330
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,685
Not to mention
the less serious sins,

331
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,589
lying, vanity, sloth, greed.

332
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,779
I, myself, had a meth problem.

333
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,307
Would you like to arrest me?

334
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,309
Is that a confession, Chuck?

335
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,415
Yeah.

336
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:16,622
Yeah, I'm confessing to a past.

337
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,647
I have a past, like everybody else.

338
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,662
I bet even you do.

339
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,994
Of course,
God absolved me of my past.

340
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:27,364
How about you?

341
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:35,289
- See you around.
- He's taking it hard.

342
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,387
The way Chuck sees it,
Patricia introduced him to God,

343
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:40,536
and God saved his life.
Gave him focus,

344
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,004
made him part of a community.

345
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,548
Do you have a congregant called JP?

346
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,468
- Yes.
- Could you point him out to us, please?

347
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,260
It's still hard to believe
the pastor's gone.

348
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,399
I understand
she was one hell of a swimmer.

349
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,143
Hey, Booth, I'm looking
at these pictures you gave me,

350
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,446
and body language
and facial expressions

351
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,254
tell some very interesting stories.

352
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:12,267
- Why don't you give me your insights?
- She swam every single day. Yeah.

353
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,622
But you don't need me
for that insight.

354
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,221
Ask anybody.

355
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:19,083
He holds himself separate
from the congregation.

356
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:20,376
What that means?

357
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:22,716
How long have you been
a member of the Inclusion Church?

358
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,588
Well, I joined about six months ago.

359
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,884
He's a latecomer to the church?
That's a good one.

360
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,435
Thank you.

361
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:32,388
For sharing that.

362
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,932
Why would anybody lie
about when they joined a church?

363
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:36,600
So what brought you to the church?

364
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,613
I had a drinking problem, which

365
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,648
gave me problems with the law,
which gave me marital problems.

366
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,108
You served two years
less a day for assault.

367
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,857
When I got out of jail,
I wanted my wife back.

368
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,071
I wanted my life back.

369
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,908
It doesn't look like things
are going so great with the wife.

370
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,243
Are you living with your wife again?

371
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:59,690
I got a ways to go before Rita
trusts me whole hog, you know?

372
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,086
Plus, she's not that excited
about the religious aspect.

373
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,214
Why is the FBI
interested in a pastor drowning?

374
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,384
Well, there's more than one
way for a person to drown.

375
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,555
- Did you always call her "pastor"?
- What else would I call her?

376
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:16,854
Hey,

377
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:18,353
it's JP again.

378
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,056
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,438
I... I miss you. I need to see you.

380
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:23,714
It's important.

381
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,565
I really need you, Patty.
Please call.

382
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:27,728
Please.

383
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,613
You got it all wrong.
That call is not what you're thinking.

384
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,891
I was calling the pastor about Rita.

385
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,369
Hold on a minute.
Look at the last photo.

386
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:38,579
He knew.

387
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,289
You can't tell that from a photo.

388
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,583
- I beg your pardon?
- I can.

389
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,460
He knew that she used to be a man.

390
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,712
It doesn't show in the photographs.

391
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:50,716
- You know what I'm saying?
- About what Patricia was before?

392
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,009
I told you he knew.

393
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,345
What was your reaction when you
found out that she wasn't a real woman?

394
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,015
Don't say Patty wasn't a real woman.
It makes you sound ignorant.

395
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,768
The pastor came between you
and your wife, but she was living a lie.

396
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:03,750
You lost your manhood and
your religion all in one go. Or what?

397
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,272
Did prison widen your tastes?

398
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,776
You're just pretending to be a jerk
to get a rise out of this guy, right?

399
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:11,685
I didn't want to develop feelings
for Patricia, but I did,

400
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:14,100
and that didn't change when
she told me who she used to be.

401
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,242
- Who did she used to be?
- What do you want a name?

402
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,389
I never asked.

403
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:20,329
Can't you look it up on some
legal name change form?

404
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,601
If you'd have ever met Patty,
you'd know what I know.

405
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:24,475
What God knows. What she knew.

406
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,502
She was not a man.

407
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,375
Yeah, I'm with him
on this point, Booth

408
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,183
Bone marrow and liver
remnants contain high concentrations

409
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:44,269
of ethinyl estradiol,
medroxyprogesterone acetate

410
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,396
and spironolactone,
which is an anti-androgen.

411
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:49,486
- Hormone replacement therapy.
- Very healthy bone mass.

412
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,029
High percentages
of calcium and vitamin D.

413
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,988
- Which indicates...
- A health nut.

414
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:59,579
Tox screen shows Stamaril,
Havrix Monodose and Engerix-B.

415
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,216
Vaccinations?

416
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,330
Yellow fever, Hep A and Hep B.

417
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,531
All necessary
for traveling to the Far East.

418
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,897
Did you know that only
20% of Americans have passports?

419
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:13,592
That's not irrelevant.

420
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,385
Perhaps that's why there's
no record of this guy...

421
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,967
woman... having a sex change.

422
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,922
It could have happened in,
you know, Thailand.

423
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:26,061
Very good, Mr. Nigel-Murray.

424
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:30,023
Though conjecture is not
really what we do here in the lab.

425
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,183
So...

426
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:38,162
But very good, Mr. Nigel-Murray.

427
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,121
Can I ask you something?

428
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,165
Is there any way to say no?

429
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,585
Whatever happened to whoever
it was who used to work here before me?

430
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,010
He joined forces with a serial killer

431
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,378
who was the last in a long line
of cannibalistic murderers

432
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,746
specializing in knocking off
members of secret societies

433
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,927
and building skeletons out
of their body parts.

434
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:04,975
I hope that doesn't happen to me.

435
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,647
So he's not coming back?

436
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:11,481
No.

437
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,372
He's locked up
for the rest of his life.

438
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:16,737
But we all still like him.

439
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,238
Excuse me.

440
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:20,449
Hmm. Hello, hello, hello.

441
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,411
Are you familiar with the expression,
"That's way too much car for you"?

442
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:27,831
I believe that's one of ours,
actually, sir. Yes.

443
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,219
I want to show you something.

444
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,379
I want to show you something.

445
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,133
Vroom, vroom, kid.

446
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,175
You're already in my rearview mirror.

447
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:43,050
Booth said the FBI couldn't find any
record of an official name change,

448
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,307
or anything showing
who Patricia Ludmuller was

449
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,184
before the sex change operation.

450
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,770
It's possible she had her
surgery done in the Far East.

451
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,892
In England, the Speaker of
the House is not allowed to speak.

452
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,403
Anyway, what I did was...

453
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:00,928
here she is as a woman.

454
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,780
Hmm, not bad.

455
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:04,845
I mean, I mean the sketch...

456
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:06,228
Okay.

457
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,638
Here I made her more masculine.

458
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,251
I made the bony prominences more robust,
increased the size

459
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:16,036
of the mastoid processes
and the nuchal crests.

460
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:17,992
Seldom seen bigger nuchal crests.

461
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,384
It doesn't look
like anybody you recognize?

462
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,553
Should it?

463
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,223
I also added facial hair.

464
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:28,225
Do you recognize him now?

465
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,578
It's that guy.

466
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:32,020
"Oh, evil spirits, come out."

467
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,057
That's exactly what I thought.

468
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:37,025
Yes, God makes demands of us!

469
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:41,321
This money belongs to God...

470
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:42,738
Not me!

471
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:45,957
Who will join me in giving God

472
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,120
what is rightfully His?!

473
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,655
He is asking you now,
at this moment.

474
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,607
What is your answer?

475
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:57,713
What is your answer to
God when He calls your name?!

476
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,590
Will you deny Him?!

477
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,558
Pastor Patrick Stephenson.

478
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,184
Disappeared six years ago.

479
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,431
Oh, wow, I got it right.

480
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:12,144
He disappeared from Vietnam
or Thailand, one of those places.

481
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,902
Yeah, on a world tour.

482
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,557
His followers said he was the first
of many who'd be

483
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,150
taken up in the Rapture.

484
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,624
So that guy went from that

485
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:24,133
to being a woman pastor
in a cottage on Chesapeake Bay?

486
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,241
Some people would call that heaven.

487
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,711
Amazing job, Angela.

488
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,163
Yeah, well, check this out.

489
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:39,582
She had a wife and son
before she gave up being a he.

490
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:49,306
The Thai federal police were certain
that Patrick had been robbed and killed.

491
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,268
It's a lot to absorb.

492
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:58,797
A sex-change operation in Bangkok,
Thailand costs about $25,000.

493
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,434
You want me to believe
that Patrick stole money

494
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:06,601
and then had himself transformed
into a woman?

495
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,060
- It's a scenario.
- Patrick was a religious man.

496
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,079
He would never
offend God in this blatant manner.

497
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,414
The theft, you mean,
because it's a sin?

498
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,496
A sex-change operation.

499
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,171
We are made in God's image,
Dr. Brennan.

500
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,505
Who are we to alter that image?

501
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:25,205
Obviously, you dye your hair,
there's evidence of plastic surgery.

502
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:26,385
That's different.

503
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:27,556
- Bones.
- How?

504
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,806
It's augmenting God's work,
not undoing it completely.

505
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,767
How about that, Bones?

506
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,763
We have a DNA match
between your husband

507
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:42,563
and the deceased female found
in the Chesapeake Bay.

508
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,171
Do these people believe in DNA?

509
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,489
Look, it seems as though
your husband sent a check

510
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,199
made out to the church every month.

511
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,751
A hundred dollars a month?

512
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,955
So Patrick was repaying us
for the money he took?

513
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:58,208
Actually, it's more accurate
to say that Patricia

514
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,940
was repaying you for the money
that Patrick took.

515
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,563
During these intervening years,
did your husband try to contact you?

516
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,759
No. I believed the Thai police
when they declared Patrick dead.

517
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,827
And your son?

518
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:11,344
Ryan would definitely have
told me if he'd heard from his father.

519
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:13,373
Oh, we're gonna have to talk to him.

520
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:15,225
The last I heard,
he was in California.

521
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:23,215
After his father vanished,

522
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,278
Ryan took over preaching
the Word of God to our flock...

523
00:25:27,804 --> 00:25:28,939
for about a year.

524
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,366
Then he had
a crisis of faith and left.

525
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:33,785
Ryan is still in the throes
of that crisis.

526
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,978
I have faith
that in the fullness of time,

527
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,331
God will lead Ryan back to us.

528
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:40,625
- Before your husband...
- Became a woman?

529
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:46,131
... disappeared, did he have
any reason to fear for his life?

530
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:50,343
A man named Arthur Ford was
arrested for assaulting Patrick.

531
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:53,063
- Why did he assault your husband?
- He had a son.

532
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,129
The boy donated his entire
trust fund to the church.

533
00:25:57,377 --> 00:26:01,229
His father thought that we'd
brainwashed him or some such nonsense.

534
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:02,985
Did you give the money back?

535
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,948
The boy wasn't brainwashed,
Dr. Brennan.

536
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:08,663
The Lord touched him.

537
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:12,574
Exactly how much money
did the Lord touch him for?

538
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:15,362
$5 million?

539
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:16,640
Great, thank you.

540
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:20,832
$5 million is a ton of moolah,
but Arthur Ford is not a good suspect.

541
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,377
Why? What with
the ton of moolah they

542
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:25,170
practically stole from his son?

543
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,632
That phone call I just had,

544
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,840
Arthur Ford died of pancreatic cancer
three years ago.

545
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:30,698
- Oh.
- Yeah, "Oh."

546
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,679
- Do you think she loved her husband?
- Who?

547
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,007
Mrs. Stephenson.

548
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,006
I don't know.

549
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,683
She was plenty angry at him.

550
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:40,519
For getting a sex-change operation?

551
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,929
No, no, no, before that.

552
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,418
She only called him by his given name
or referred to him as Ryan's father.

553
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,275
Never, you know, "my husband."

554
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:50,606
I call you "Booth,"
and I like you just fine.

555
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,440
Thank you, but we're not married.

556
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,452
One angry father might be dead,
but, uh, maybe there are more.

557
00:26:57,612 --> 00:27:01,004
Patrick Stephenson wasn't murdered,
Patricia Ludmuller was.

558
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:03,309
You think the moment Patricia Ludmuller
came to exist,

559
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:05,252
Patrick Stephenson stopped?

560
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:08,505
When the butterfly emerges,
does the caterpillar cease to exist?

561
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:11,258
Okay, what are you,
like some kind of kung fu master?

562
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,718
Why don't we just figure out
who killed

563
00:27:13,878 --> 00:27:17,336
Why don't we just figure out who
killed this guy... gal, person, okay?

564
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:21,309
Would you like me just as much
if I were a man?

565
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:22,733
Oh, yeah, much better.

566
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,730
I wouldn't have to be
so polite and accommodating.

567
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,567
How about you? Would you like me
better if I was a woman?

568
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:29,901
No, I would not.

569
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:30,986
Why?

570
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:34,656
I'd be jealous that you
might be prettier than I am.

571
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:37,033
I would be, too.
I'd be hot.

572
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,577
Smoking hot.

573
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,701
They're not gay,

574
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,169
they're not homosexual.

575
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:51,240
They are abominations unto the Lord.

576
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:53,216
They are sodomites.

577
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:56,241
This kid
is Patrick Stephenson's son?

578
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:59,681
It would explain why Patrick Stephenson
chose to disappear the way he did.

579
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:02,724
Unashamed, they perform deeds

580
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:05,186
that led them into
the hands of an angry God.

581
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:08,898
Now this is a fairly well-known moment,
even though it was never televised.

582
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,703
It is this ignorance to the
light of God that led to their doom.

583
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:20,256
I can't do this anymore.

584
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,426
I can't.

585
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:26,708
I preach against sins,
sins I hate

586
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:29,117
but other sins such as greed...

587
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:32,486
Greed.

588
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:38,155
This is a palace, and I am a prince.

589
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:41,598
I am not like my father...

590
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,666
and I am not like my mother.

591
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:49,105
I just want to do God's work,

592
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,880
not perform on television...

593
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:56,398
bilk you for your money.

594
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,064
God bless us all.

595
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,433
God forgive us all.

596
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:12,379
Ironically,
he wasjust like his father.

597
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,714
You think he switched sexes, too?

598
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:16,503
No, no, they both

599
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:19,511
turned their backs on
this kind of commercial worship.

600
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:22,097
They both went out into
the world looking for redemption.

601
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:24,272
I assume you're gonna search out
Ryan Stephenson?

602
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:26,619
I work at the FBI.
That's what we do.

603
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,561
It's a big country, and we'll try.

604
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:32,278
Well, concentrate your search
in hospitals, halfway houses,

605
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:34,067
rehab centers, jails.

606
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:36,194
You think things have gone
that badly for him?

607
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,589
No, no,
he's not an inmate or a patient.

608
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,866
Ryan Stephenson is literally
atoning for the sins of his father.

609
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:44,588
He left the palace for the street.

610
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:46,621
He's following
the teachings of Jesus.

611
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,310
- His mother says he's in California.
- No, she's wrong.

612
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,684
This kid, he's the prodigal son.

613
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,390
I'll bet he's within 20 miles of that
giant church

614
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,214
he fled as a confused adolescent.

615
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:57,507
I'll take that bet.

616
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,592
- All right, how much?
- 20 bucks.

617
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,183
- Deal.
- Deal.

618
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,927
20 dollars.

619
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:05,868
- Thank you.
- There you go.

620
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:06,988
Thank you.

621
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:10,874
If you're making the wager,
how come I get the money?

622
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:13,227
- You're the bank.
- You're the bank, lady.

623
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:18,194
This comminuted fracture
on the pelvis

624
00:30:18,354 --> 00:30:20,452
is very similar
to the blow to the skull.

625
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:24,117
Both blows were inflicted while
Patricia Ludmuller was still alive.

626
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,704
She was swimming,
she was struck on the head, she drowned.

627
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:31,249
Then how were her fingers
damaged and how was she cut in half?

628
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:35,210
Wow, you ask extremely
difficult questions.

629
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,506
The particulates found in both
the skull wound and the pelvis

630
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,800
are fiber-reinforced polymers
and hydrocarbon secretion

631
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,626
of coniferous trees.

632
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:44,345
Which is what, exactly?

633
00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:46,657
Fiberglass and resin.

634
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:49,999
Okay, she was struck by a boat,
the keel of a boat.

635
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,813
Now we're getting somewhere.

636
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,646
Anything on the metacarpals?

637
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,888
You mean, could I tell
what hit her fingers? No.

638
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:57,741
It was something
that didn't leave traces

639
00:30:57,861 --> 00:30:59,652
or the water rubbed away
all the evidence.

640
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:01,905
- We'll show these images to Brennan.
- Why?

641
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,148
She'll see something you missed.

642
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,286
- So that's Ryan Stephenson?
- Yep.

643
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,348
Found him in a detox center
in Silver Spring.

644
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,308
- A patient?
- Nope, counselor.

645
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,200
- You called it.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

646
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,537
Get it from Bones.

647
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,481
Are you sure it was my father?

648
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,186
Yes, I'm positive.

649
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,695
They told me Dad died in Thailand.

650
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,072
Well, he, uh...

651
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:48,670
well, she seemed to have
found peace up there on the island.

652
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:51,610
Named his church "Inclusion"?

653
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,751
He welcomed drug addicts,
prostitutes, homosexuals.

654
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,925
According to her congregation,
who loved her,

655
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:01,839
your father welcomed everyone.

656
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,594
What?

657
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:08,692
You afraid
your father's gonna burn in hell?

658
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,343
No.

659
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:14,921
No, I just wish I had the...

660
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,730
chance to know the new him...

661
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,370
Her.

662
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:24,543
I'm a suspect?

663
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,657
You thought perhaps
I found out my father

664
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:30,743
was a fraud who had a sex change
and that God asked me to kill him?

665
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:34,287
Did God tell you to kill your dad?

666
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:41,342
I've changed.

667
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:45,133
Do you believe in redemption?

668
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,178
Yes, I do.

669
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,798
One of God's challenges
to us is to see past the surface.

670
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:03,727
To the deeper, essential nature

671
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:05,653
which lies right beneath.

672
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,864
You believe our bodies
are like dustcovers?

673
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:11,022
That's exactly
what I think, Agent Booth.

674
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,331
Rip them off
and see what's underneath.

675
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:17,665
You see, all this time I
thought my father was killed or...

676
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,920
had abandoned me,
and that's just not what happened.

677
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:23,447
He didn't want to shake my faith.

678
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,135
He was protecting me from the truth.

679
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,155
He didn't want me to have to choose
between him and God,

680
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,713
and I love my father for that.

681
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:36,599
I just hope God can forgive
me for making him feel that way.

682
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:43,858
Do you think
I could have my father's Bible?

683
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,211
I'm afraid it's still evidence.

684
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,976
But, hey, we figure out
who killed your father,

685
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,185
we'll make sure you get that.

686
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:54,077
Thank you.

687
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,913
You ever consider returning
to the ministry, Ryan?

688
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:11,696
Okay, so we know Patricia
Ludmuller was run over by a boat.

689
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,760
The boat struck her in two places--

690
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,822
the skull and the pelvic bone.

691
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:18,685
We found traces of enamel paint
and stain filler, specifically

692
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:21,729
Silver Neptune Mahogany
and Lead Red Primer.

693
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,821
It was a foggy day,
she was out there swimming alone.

694
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,194
- This death could have been accidental.
- Or hit-and-run.

695
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:29,888
No. It was murder.

696
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:32,699
Only one percent
of deaths are murders.

697
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:34,826
Hodgins, you found pieces

698
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:37,888
of splintered wood from the keel,
both in the skull and the pelvic bone.

699
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:41,074
Yeah, from a wooden-
keeled, shallow-hulled speedboat.

700
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:45,002
The splinters are embedded
in the skull from this direction.

701
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:46,504
Struck from behind.

702
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:50,091
And in the pelvic bone from
this direction, at a 90-degree angle.

703
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:52,552
The boat hit her skull

704
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:54,887
from behind, while she was facedown
in the water.

705
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:59,010
The second blow hit her from the side,
and she was on her back in the water.

706
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,395
She was struck once, then the boat
turned around to make sure she was dead.

707
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,394
Then hurt, disoriented, she...

708
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:08,263
reached up to clasp the gunwale?

709
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,820
Someone smashed her fingers,
forcing her to let go.

710
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,677
Then she floated on her back.

711
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:14,857
The boat left,
then turned around and...

712
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,243
... struck her again.

713
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,301
We know exactly how Patricia
Ludmuller was murdered.

714
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:34,624
- Excuse me, Dr. Saroyan.
- Yes, Vincent.

715
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:37,819
Is there a way to quit working here

716
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,566
without losing Dr. Brennan
as my grad supervisor?

717
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:43,351
Ah. I see. You'd like
to quit this internship

718
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,581
without losing
your academic standing.

719
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,720
Can I ask why?

720
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,610
It's absolutely impossible
to kiss your own elbow.

721
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,278
And how is that relevant?

722
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:55,004
It isn't, Dr. Saroyan, but, um...

723
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,171
I'm someone
who loves knowledge, and...

724
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,626
all of you
are very narrowly focused.

725
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,497
It's a good focus,

726
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:05,372
I know, catching murderers, but,

727
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:09,305
all in all, I'd rather be
like me than like you,

728
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,047
so if you can help me out...

729
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,587
I'll take care of it
with Dr. Brennan.

730
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:16,177
We'll move on to another intern.

731
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,591
Did you know that over 98% of people

732
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,378
will respond with "Thank you"

733
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:23,142
if you say, "You're welcome"?

734
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:25,504
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

735
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:28,898
Vino Delectable.

736
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:41,953
Based on

737
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:45,540
size, wood grain and shape
of the keel, Hodgins

738
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,066
and Angela narrowed our search
down to two models.

739
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,473
It's a Lee Shore Island
and a Bow Wave Runabout.

740
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:52,938
Okay?

741
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:54,499
So...

742
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:56,134
How'd she end up split in two?

743
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,940
You mean, how did a man become a woman?

744
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,720
No, Bones, her spine was severed.

745
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:03,975
Oh, the polymer Hodgins found
was probably fishing line, so she...

746
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:06,185
sinks, decomposes

747
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:09,272
and the fishing line severs
the spinal column.

748
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:11,858
Oh, some fisherman thinks
a big one got away.

749
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:14,994
You think it means anything?

750
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:18,823
She lived her life split in two,
then in death, split in two again.

751
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:23,703
- No. I don't think it means anything.
- I didn't think you would.

752
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,057
Hey, Dr. Hodgins, over here.

753
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,543
Over here.

754
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,457
- What have you got?
- You think maybe it's him?

755
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,112
That's JP's?

756
00:37:58,272 --> 00:38:01,351
- Why is the church group in a tizzy?
- That's JP's boat.

757
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:12,034
Wow, JP,
this here is one fine vessel.

758
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:13,169
Isn't it, Bones?

759
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,741
- Yes.
- Look at that, huh?

760
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:17,148
Flush mount,
single lever control box.

761
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:18,758
Check this out, Bones, huh?

762
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,052
He's got a wiring harness
under there.

763
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:23,210
Bench seats
with marine vinyl seat cushions.

764
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,681
This is just classic.
How long have you had this for?

765
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:29,310
Years. I only started restoring
it after I joined the church.

766
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,357
The pastor
said it'd be a good project for me.

767
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,726
Did you take it out the day
Patricia Ludmuller disappeared?

768
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:34,590
No.

769
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,945
This is definitely the boat
that struck Patricia Ludmuller.

770
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,065
What?

771
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,030
- Twice.
- Couldn't deal with the rejection, JP?

772
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,615
Our psychological expert says

773
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,867
that many men freak out
when they find out the woman

774
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:46,818
they've been sleeping
with used to be a man.

775
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,204
We never slept together.

776
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,393
I wanted to.

777
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,343
- I wanted her.
- She wanted me.

778
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:53,626
- But she refused.
- I'm still married.

779
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:55,127
That why you ran her down?

780
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,213
This is where you smashed her hand.

781
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,335
No!
Will you stop saying these things?!

782
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:02,218
She must have been in a lot of pain
when she grabbed the side of the boat.

783
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:06,180
I'm sure we'll find what he used to
smash her fingers here in the boat.

784
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:09,770
My guess is this.

785
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,354
- Bones, these seats--
- they aren't adjustable.

786
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,322
How tall do you think JP is?

787
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:18,776
- 190 to 195 centimeters.
- Just give me a simple height.

788
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,820
Uh... six three or four?

789
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,279
How about his wife?

790
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:23,990
Oh, perhaps 100 and...

791
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,024
- Five foot two.
- That's all I need. Thanks.

792
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,745
JP, you didn't restore
this boat for yourself, did you?

793
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:33,290
Pastor Patricia said I should
do something for someone else.

794
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,959
Someone I love.

795
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,169
Then you should have built it for her.

796
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,569
I waited for you
to get out of prison,

797
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,759
and I waited for you to get sober.

798
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:47,427
And I waited for you to
get tired of this stupid church.

799
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:50,224
And all you did was fall
in love with another woman.

800
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:52,059
I never slept with her, Rita.

801
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:53,659
I don't believe that.

802
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,147
I'll never believe that.

803
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:03,746
Rita Gratton,

804
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,779
I'm placing you under arrest...

805
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:10,119
... for the murder
of Patricia Ludmuller.

806
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:25,072
I think I should begin my first sermon
to you as kind of an introduction.

807
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,212
My name is Ryan Stephenson.

808
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,858
I'm a child of man.

809
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:31,731
I'm a child of woman.

810
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:34,217
But more importantly,
I'm a child of God,

811
00:40:34,337 --> 00:40:36,590
and as I look around
I see others like me.

812
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,904
We don't look alike.

813
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,955
None of us look alike.

814
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:43,819
On the outside,
we are gay and straight,

815
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,861
black and white, fat and thin,

816
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,041
man and woman,

817
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,974
saint and sinner.

818
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:54,038
Should I keep going,
or do you guys catch my drift?

819
00:40:55,524 --> 00:40:56,832
But inside...

820
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:00,440
... inside we are all the same.

821
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:02,296
That is completely incorrect.

822
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,466
Not now, Bones.

823
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,050
Our skeletons are wildly
different or I wouldn't have a job.

824
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,468
Shh! Just listen.

825
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:11,307
I am sorry
that I didn't get to know my father--

826
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,640
Patricia.

827
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,073
But I hope I will find him...

828
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:17,717
her...

829
00:41:18,962 --> 00:41:21,048
that redeemed human being...

830
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,152
both in her old Bible

831
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:28,539
and, more importantly, in you

832
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:33,117
the people who she loved
and who loved her back.

833
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,720
Redemption through transformation.

834
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,665
I get it.

835
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,667
What do you believe in, Bones?

836
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:43,295
I believe in always
swimming with a buddy.

837
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:44,456
What?

838
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:47,287
You gather your wisdom,
I gather mine.

839
00:41:47,522 --> 00:41:48,425
Okay.

840
