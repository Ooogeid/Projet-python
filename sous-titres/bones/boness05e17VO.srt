1
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,859
This is my favorite spot.

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,030
- I've only been here with boys before.
- Me, too.

3
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:16,932
But I love that Katy Perry song so much.
It speaks to me, you know?

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,610
Totally.

5
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:23,914
So...

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,629
Okay, just kissing.
No touching things or anything.

7
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:30,946
No, just the stuff
that's in the song.

8
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:38,879
I hear something.

9
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:40,898
It's your heart beating.

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,949
No, really.

11
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,634
There's something out there.

12
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,729
I can't believe
you grew up in this area.

13
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:11,877
Yes, I'm an alumna
of Burtonsville High.

14
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,875
Did you ever bring a boy
out here and...?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,814
And touch his genitalia? No.

16
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:18,629
Okay, I was just thinking
maybe just a little smooching.

17
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,936
I used to come out here
to find animals to dissect.

18
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,664
- I didn't have a boyfriend.
- Maybe because you were cutting up

19
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,692
little woodland creatures, maybe?

20
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:28,713
I'm Sheriff Rebecca Conway.
You federal backup?

21
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,381
FBI Special Agent Seely Booth.

22
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,843
Nice wheels.
Nice face... and bod.

23
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,177
Very nice.

24
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:39,223
- Thank you.
- We know each other.

25
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,892
Becky, right?
I'm, I'm Temperance.

26
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,811
Have I arrested you before?

27
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:47,314
You were my lab partner
in chemistry at Burtonsville High.

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,536
Are you absolutely sure?

29
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,997
- I have an excellent memory.
- Positive.

30
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:54,655
Though you are thinner now,
which is better for your

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,533
cardiovascular system. In high school,
you were quite overweight,

32
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,744
hence the derision
from the other students.

33
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:02,663
Yeah, I remember you now.
The creepy girl.

34
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,376
So you're in town for the reunion?

35
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,546
Reunion...

36
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,423
I need a date... if you're free.

37
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:15,426
We're just here
to inspect the remains.

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,837
No surprise there.

39
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,298
Two girls were out here
rolling around.

40
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,323
Two girls?

41
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,715
Yeah, it's the 21st century,
sweetheart.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,390
Get with the program.

43
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:29,322
Anyway, that critter
ran into them right there,

44
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:30,900
with the skull on its head.

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,611
It was probably eating
the brains and eyes.

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,364
- Often, scavengers...
- Don't need the details, Morticia.

47
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,534
I'm keeping this quiet
until I know what we're dealing with.

48
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,120
Female...

49
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,915
age indeterminate.

50
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,253
Judging by the lack of staining,

51
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:50,085
the victim's head was severed
postmortem.

52
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:53,082
Not cut up...

53
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,359
Well, I'm glad you kept
this quiet, Becky.

54
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,732
There are probably more remains
in the area.

55
00:02:57,857 --> 00:03:01,055
We're gonna need to search
the bushes for more people parts, Lou.

56
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,804
- I don't want the remains compromised.
- Don't compromise them.

57
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,434
She was a careless lab partner.

58
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,229
You gotta go to your reunion.
We already flew out here.

59
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,597
I'm not going.

60
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,510
High school was not a happy time.
For some reason,

61
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,270
people didn't seem to like me.

62
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,362
Which is exactly why
you have to go now.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,291
Reunions are made for you to smear
your success into people's faces.

64
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,200
Your accomplishments
are gonna kill them.

65
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,768
I found something!

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,011
Lou! Stay right here!

67
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,293
Where are the ribs?

68
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:34,563
According to the legend,
they've been cooked and eaten.

69
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:35,631
What legend?

70
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,108
They say a spirit lives
in these woods.

71
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,054
He takes over over a person,
makes them kill.

72
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,015
In my senior year,
a classmate was murdered

73
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:46,892
and dismembered just like this.

74
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,279
Ribs gone.

75
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:50,312
They never found the killer.

76
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,297
The Butcher of Burtonsville High.

77
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,085
He's back.

78
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,482
Bones - Season 5 Episode 17
"The Death of the Queen Bee"

79
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,663
Synchro: ShalimarFox, JoJo13,
Dark_Chii

80
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,311
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

81
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,921
The "Butcher of Burtonsville"?

82
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:36,406
<i>That's what we called him.</i>

83
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:40,332
Insect activity puts time of death
at approximately ten days ago.

84
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:44,031
You'd swab the dismemberment points.
There could be evidence from a blade.

85
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:47,139
You know, you get very bossy
when you don't have flesh to play with.

86
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:48,576
I <i>am</i> the boss.

87
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,822
And he removes
his victims' ribs because...?

88
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,450
He eats them. Barbecue.

89
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:58,200
- You don't actually believe that?
- There's no evidence of cannibalism.

90
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,798
It's merely an urban legend.

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,718
But they never found out who
killed the girl in your class?

92
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,316
Sarah Tidwyler.

93
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,210
Booth is getting the old case
files to find links.

94
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,519
The stumps on the victim's ribs show
evidence of hemorrhagic staining.

95
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,954
So two ribs <i>weren't</i> sawed off.

96
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,983
Fractured and then snapped off,
it appears.

97
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,904
So, your high school
is famous, sweetie.

98
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,562
"The earliest recorded mention

99
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,493
"of the Butcher of Burtonsville
was in 1956.

100
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:29,409
"Young people were warned

101
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:31,747
"to avoid secluded locations
at night

102
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:33,624
"as there was a lunatic

103
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,043
"who killed and dismembered
his victims,

104
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,337
and then barbecued and ate
their ribs. "

105
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:42,556
Yet, until Sarah's murder,
it was just an urban legend;

106
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,650
society's attempt
to control behavior

107
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,387
through a fear-based myth.

108
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,515
This is <i>very</i> teenage slasher
movie-ish.

109
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,481
<i>Whatever blade was used</i>

110
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,618
<i>left very clean and precise cuts.</i>

111
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,399
It's always a tad creepy
when you admire the killer's handiwork.

112
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,321
Now, this first victim, Sarah Tidwyler,
was a member of the class of '94.

113
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,460
And the second victim was killed just
before the reunion of the same class.

114
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,034
It doesn't a coincidence.

115
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,117
<i>Cops here agreed
to keep everything quiet</i>

116
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,205
<i>until we I.D. the victim
and catalog the evidence.</i>

117
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,418
And this, Ray Buxley
was a prime suspect in '94?

118
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,408
He was high school custodian,
but they didn't have enough to hold him.

119
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,339
<i>Lives alone, low-status job,</i>

120
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,675
obsession with gruesome
crime stories,

121
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,467
surrounded by teenage girls.

122
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:27,720
Very creepy.

123
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,304
It's like Freddy-creepy.

124
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,138
OK, I'm gonna go check him out.

125
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:35,250
Since you're trying to keep the town
from another wave of collective hysteria

126
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,230
I wouldn't suggest announcing
your FBI status.

127
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,690
We go undercover!

128
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,123
Exactly.

129
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,818
Since Bones was already invited
to the reunion,

130
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:47,823
we get more information
if she is seen as an alumni.

131
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,908
<i>- "Alumna. " Yes.
- Yeah, great.</i>

132
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,037
You know, correcting my Latin,
not the best way to make friends.

133
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,080
<i>- Sorry.</i>
- Great. See you later

134
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,415
Wait, Agent Booth.

135
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,208
Yes, Dr. Sweets?

136
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,794
You and Dr. Brennan
are in the same motel?

137
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,006
Yeah, but they're not
adjoining rooms,

138
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,668
<i>okay, Sweets?
Look, they do not join.</i>

139
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,361
<i>You can see...
it's the bathroom...</i>

140
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,599
- And I'm closer to the ice machine.
<i>- No, I'm just merely asking</i>

141
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,348
<i>because of your feelings for her.</i>

142
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,809
I get it, all right.
I respect that, but you know what?

143
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:20,266
I've moved on. I already even
have a date for next week.

144
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:21,940
Really? Who might that be?

145
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,609
Thanks. Take care.

146
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:25,985
Who might that be, Booth?

147
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,852
Who might that be...?

148
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,146
There appear to be some
metal flakes embedded

149
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,001
in the margins of the bones.

150
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,536
Come to the king.

151
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,706
Man, social pressures,
sports, sexual psychodramas;

152
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,398
I'm surprised there aren't
more murders in high school.

153
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:43,045
Your high school sounds
a lot more exciting than mine.

154
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,629
It's a pretty tough place...
a lot of violence, a lot of drugs,

155
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,007
a lot of pregnancies.

156
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,343
So you've been through
the baby-daddy scare before?

157
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:51,470
Before?

158
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,389
Before what?

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,402
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I had no idea you hadn't told him.

160
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,420
- Big mouth, and I am sorry.
- Big mouth what?

161
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,999
You were pregnant?

162
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,797
I was just gonna leave,
but you're kind of in my...

163
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,680
You know, I'm gonna go around.

164
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,969
No, I was not pregnant.

165
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,887
But you thought
you might be pregnant?

166
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,431
Very briefly, Wendell.

167
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,268
Why didn't you tell me? I'm
pretty sure I'm the only possibility.

168
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,936
Yes, yes, of course.

169
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:46,632
Do you think that we could talk
about this later and...

170
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:49,984
- Maybe not here.
- Of course. I'm sorry.

171
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,071
I was just...

172
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,993
We can absolutely discuss
this later.

173
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,749
How well do you know
this, custodian?

174
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:06,428
Very well. He used to find dead animals
for me to dissect.

175
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:08,881
We used to have
long discussions about death.

176
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,133
Mr. Buxley would say
it was a "natural process. "

177
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,434
You were Wednesday Adams.

178
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,436
I don't know
what you're talking about.

179
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:18,817
Well, you had a creepy custodian
as a, as a best friend.

180
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:22,308
- Bet you had a pet rat, too.
- No, I had a mouse and a snake

181
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:23,645
and some spiders.

182
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,848
And you weren't popular.
That's amazing.

183
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,354
I am so sorry.
My nerves are totally fried.

184
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,203
I haven't slept in days
because of this damn reunion.

185
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:33,428
Julie Coyle?

186
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,450
- Yes. Do we know each other?
- Temperance Brennan.

187
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,706
You... liked dead things.

188
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,124
I thought that was you.

189
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,462
The years have been
very kind to you, Temperance. Very.

190
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:51,924
Not <i>that</i> very.
She liked death things, Brad.

191
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,384
Yes, but now I'm a wealthy author

192
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,970
and a successful scientist.
Did I do that right?

193
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,582
I'm, her husband, Bobby Kent.

194
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,474
Temperance's lesser half.

195
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,895
Brad Benson, Julie Coyle.

196
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,731
Youhave any kids?

197
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,096
No, not yet,
but we want a houseful, right?

198
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,402
Yes, we have intercourse
every chance we get.

199
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,780
Yeah, all over the place.

200
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,242
Well, we have a gym to decorate,
so...

201
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,893
Evelyn is gonna be so happy to see you,
Temperance.

202
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:24,039
- Bygones are bygones, she always says.
- You married Evelyn Simms?

203
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,686
We were all so jealous.

204
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:28,460
Evelyn's off saving
some unpronounceable country.

205
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,836
Nicaragua.

206
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:33,548
See? So prom king Brad here's
been giving me a hand.

207
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,258
Evie's gonna flying back for
the reunion, we'll see you there.

208
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,015
- Good to meet you, Bobby.
- Yeah.

209
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,778
Bygones will be bygones?

210
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,907
What did Brad mean? What's going on
between you? Something happen?

211
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:46,227
It's not important. We were children.
We should go see Mr. Buxley.

212
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,900
I knew I wasn't pregnant,

213
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,092
so I...

214
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,820
I saw no reason to bring it up.

215
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,388
What you're saying would make
perfect sense to Dr. Brennan, but it

216
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,521
feels wrong, you know?

217
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,111
Maybe I should have told you.

218
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,974
I don't know.
I...

219
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:08,525
I just thought it was gonna bring up
a bunch of questions that

220
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,002
we weren't ready for.

221
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:12,129
I can answer those questions.

222
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:13,630
What do you mean?

223
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,216
If you got pregnant,
it's your decision what to do.

224
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,359
Yeah, I know it is.

225
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,678
I get that, but

226
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,043
if you decided to keep the baby,
I would do the right thing.

227
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:26,893
You would?

228
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,766
I absolutely would.

229
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,668
I'd bear my share of the consequences.
I mean, more than my fair share.

230
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,485
I'd marry you,
if that's what you wanted.

231
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,764
I would do the right thing.

232
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,078
I'm sorry, Wendell.

233
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:44,828
I should have told you.

234
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,411
That's cute.

235
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,052
Mr. Buxley?

236
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,708
I have so many fond memories
of this place.

237
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,739
Gee, can't imagine
why this guy was a suspect.

238
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:27,681
Mr. Buxley?

239
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,279
It's good to see you.

240
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,958
And you.

241
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,366
You grew up good.

242
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:45,534
Thank you.

243
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,480
- This is...
- Her husband,

244
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,851
My husband Bobby.

245
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,499
Lucky man.

246
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:55,648
You care for some ribs?

247
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,095
Succulent.

248
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,232
Juicy.

249
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,602
I'm fine. And I'm full.
I already ate.

250
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,063
You have quite the collection
of blades around here.

251
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:12,663
A man never knows
when he might need to cut.

252
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,007
That's...

253
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,859
quite a motto, right.

254
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,031
I was just

255
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,011
telling my husband

256
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,851
about Sarah Tidwyler.

257
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,124
- Do you remember her?
- Yeah...

258
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,550
folks here thought I killed her.

259
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:27,931
Well, not me.

260
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,564
No, not you.

261
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,914
I could always count on you.

262
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,668
Say, you know,

263
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,574
I might have me
a dead rabbit around here.

264
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,379
Like to cut it open?

265
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,098
- That is so sweet.
- No, that's not sweet.

266
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:45,504
Not now,

267
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,176
probably because
Mr. Buxley here has to

268
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,883
get the campus ready
for the big reunion.

269
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,915
- I suppose.
- Yeah, I'm sure you've been working

270
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,934
long hours late into the night.

271
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,711
Probably even weekends, right?

272
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:01,089
Maybe even the weekend before last.
Were you working then?

273
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,489
Why'd you want to ask me about
the particular weekend?

274
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,778
You know what? Just tell him
or he'll keep asking. He can't help it.

275
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:10,307
He's a newspaperman.

276
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:13,163
Well, that weekend I was away.

277
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,469
I...

278
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,230
went and bought this.

279
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,439
First edition!

280
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,107
My first novel.

281
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,920
You named the killer after me.

282
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,873
I'd have shed a tear if my,

283
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,456
my duct worked proper.

284
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:39,588
I thought you might be coming
to the reunion. Maybe you could

285
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,419
put your pen to it for me?
Pretty please?

286
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:43,882
With pleasure.

287
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,325
Here, use my pen.

288
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,423
Thanks, sweetie.

289
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,221
To the real

290
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:50,803
Ray Buxley,

291
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,490
who taught me

292
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,888
about...

293
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:58,021
death.

294
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,913
You said the skull's ready for me.

295
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,221
What about casts
of the blade injuries?

296
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:10,389
- Still working on them.
- Hey, sweetie.

297
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,079
- That is a crappy motel room.
- The bed has Magic Fingers.

298
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,665
I'm gonna drive by that one.

299
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,041
How's the reunion?

300
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,847
I find I am with people
who disliked me in high school.

301
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,007
<i>You're pressed for an I.D. I'll try to
be quick with the facial reconstruction.</i>

302
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,715
Turns out our victim
has a remodeled mandibular fracture.

303
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,434
- So that should narrow down the search.
- <i> Let me look at that.</i>

304
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,426
<i>Can you put it under the medio-cam?</i>

305
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,270
Is there a problem?

306
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,940
This fracture was made
by a blunt object striking

307
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,818
<i>her face at an</i>
almost 90-degree angle.

308
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,947
That's in my notes. And the remodeling
gave us an approximate age... about 30.

309
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,574
<i>33. She was 33.</i>

310
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,033
How you know that?

311
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,138
<i>Because I'm the one
who broke her jaw...</i>

312
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,888
<i>with a tennis racket.</i>

313
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,717
This is one of my classmates...

314
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:00,875
Evelyn Simms.

315
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,379
<i>So this</i>

316
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,700
<i>is Evelyn Simms.</i>

317
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,871
<i>Homecoming queen,
cheerleading captain,</i>

318
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,197
president
of the Girl's Service Club.

319
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,313
A girl like this, she wouldn't
have given me the time of day.

320
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,588
Which, of course,
makes her that much hotter.

321
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,109
I'm sure you really didn't want
to say that, right?

322
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,611
It slipped out.

323
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,212
Everybody loved Evelyn.

324
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,485
A lot of people hated her,
too, for being popular.

325
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,366
Youdecked her with a tennis racket.

326
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,852
I never enjoyed playing doubles.
Someone is always in your way.

327
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,331
Although my classmates thought
I hit her on purpose.

328
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,716
Perhaps subconsciously you did.
I mean,

329
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,502
a girl like yourself
with marginal social standing,

330
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:47,226
<i>takes out her hostility</i>
by striking the popular girl.

331
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:48,527
It is quite common.

332
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,128
That sounded clinical,
but felt very insulting.

333
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,970
What do you hope to find
in 15-year-old memorabilia?

334
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,305
Basic victimology.

335
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,421
Now, we already know that there is
a similarity in the method of killing.

336
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,928
They were in the same class. Perhaps
there's an interpersonal connection.

337
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:07,084
<i>Hold it right there! There you are.
It's your high school picture.</i>

338
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,569
- <i>Why aren't you smiling?</i>
- <i>I wasn't amused by anything!</i>

339
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,830
<i>None of this is pertinent
to the investigation.</i>

340
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,657
Reunions can rekindle old

341
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,794
old feelings of resentment.
If a classmate's

342
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,079
life hasn't worked out, they might

343
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,866
see Evelyn's happiness
as a personal threat.

344
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,841
<i>This is the girl that was murdered
in 1994.</i>

345
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,118
<i>Yes, Sarah Tidwyler.</i>

346
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:28,333
Physically,
she appears nothing like Evelyn.

347
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,090
No apparent interests in common.

348
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,403
Look at that.
Look who has his arm <i>around her.</i>

349
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:33,967
<i>That's Evelyn's husband Brad.</i>

350
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,304
Yes, Brad was dating Sarah
when she was murdered.

351
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,112
And now he's married
to the most recent victim.

352
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:41,877
That's a pretty strong connection.

353
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,111
This is a cross-section of the victim's
distal femur. As you can see,

354
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,897
the kerf wall is smooth,
indicating whatever blade was used

355
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,949
the size of its teeth was small.

356
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,005
But it did have teeth.
So we're looking for a saw of some type.

357
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,205
Judging by the bone loss from the cuts,
a saw blade about

358
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,874
two-millimeters thick. I can't determine
what type of blade yet.

359
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,459
Let me know when you can.

360
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,165
Hold on.
Show-and-tell is not over yet.

361
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,938
We have got two particulates
transferred during dismemberment.

362
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:16,172
It's a pretty messy process
what with all that blood squirting

363
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,976
- and muscles and sinews tearing...
- We get it.

364
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,141
- What'd you find?
- After much effort and

365
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,309
expertise,

366
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,601
I found

367
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:27,522
I found calcium sulfate
and flecks of grade 3003-

368
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,060
H14 aluminum.

369
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,493
How are either of those in any way
cooler than discovering the saw?

370
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,239
I'll let Dr. Brennan know that

371
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,439
we are looking
for a saw which can cut through metal.

372
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,064
And you don't have to fight,
you both did well.

373
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,794
I run a kindergarten.

374
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,774
<i>Wendell was so sweet, you know?</i>

375
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:57,138
<i>He had the stiff upper lip, and he kept
telling me that he'd do the right thing,</i>

376
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,271
<i>and his jaw was all</i>

377
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:00,889
<i>tightened and manly.</i>

378
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,986
Wendell does seems to live
by a very strong sense

379
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,643
of morality and ethics.

380
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:07,783
He's probably
the best guy I've ever met.

381
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:10,104
He's good-hearted and

382
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:11,756
he's honest.

383
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,429
You're saying good things,
but your tone indicates you have doubts.

384
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:18,249
'Cause when Hodgins thought
I was pregnant, he said,

385
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:19,878
"I'm your guy. "

386
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,069
Wendell talked about bearing
the consequences and

387
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:24,871
"doing the right thing. "

388
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:26,890
<i>anthropologically speaking,</i>

389
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:28,958
<i>males "doing their duty" formed</i>

390
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,671
- <i>the bedrock of civilization.</i>
- It's not very poetic.

391
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,214
<i>Because males tended
to find</i> those duties onerous,

392
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,343
they took every opportunity
to avoid them,

393
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,167
mostly through
geographic exploration,

394
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,204
meaningless conquests and war.

395
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,688
Hodgins wanted to be with me
and the baby.

396
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:45,950
Which, I guess, means that

397
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:49,700
he's less likely than Wendell
to go off and start a war, right?

398
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:57,607
Brad was always the golden boy,

399
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,423
always got what he wanted.

400
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,826
Rumor is his business
isn't doing very good.

401
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,662
Booth, you-you can't give this credence.
It's gossip,

402
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,455
which, by definition, is a form

403
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,302
of entertainment, not information.

404
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,084
And her grammar is appalling.

405
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:14,170
It is a miracle that you
have any life whatsoever.

406
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,964
You cheated off
my test in chemistry.

407
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,549
I could supply you
a fun while you're here,

408
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:21,844
- 'cause you're probably dying with her.
- We're talking about Brad Benson?

409
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,228
Right.

410
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,821
Brad has his own auto body shop,
and rumor is,

411
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,814
he's losing money big-time.

412
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:32,817
Owning his own auto body shop, he would
have access to a saw that cuts metal.

413
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,548
I'll just get an agent,
check out his financials. Anything else?

414
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:38,898
I'm gonna go in the gym,
and see if they need help setting up.

415
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:41,335
But if you need anything, holler.

416
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,894
If I had covered my paper,
she would still be taking that class.

417
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,468
Andy Pfleuger.

418
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,029
He used to have a crush on me.

419
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,817
You're right, Booth,

420
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,528
it's nice to be back.

421
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:26,239
I found stab marks on the posterior
and right lateral side.

422
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:28,477
Posterior iliac spine,

423
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:29,954
L-1

424
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,879
and

425
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:32,624
T-10 vertebrae,

426
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,473
and here on the inferior angle
of the scapula.

427
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,242
Cause of death, Mr. Bray?

428
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,234
All the stab wounds terminate in bone,
so they wouldn't have been fatal,

429
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,886
except for this one.

430
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,533
The weapon could have passed through
the eighth intercostal space,

431
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,924
perforating the lung,
causing her to bleed to death.

432
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,519
The victim's husband had an auto body
shop, right? Take a look at this.

433
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,686
Looks like transfer
from the murder weapon...

434
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,982
thin flecks of iridescent metal.

435
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:01,402
Could be the kind that they use
to coat a paint job on a car.

436
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,863
So the weapon is found
in an auto body shop?

437
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,032
I haven't ID'D the weapon yet,

438
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,992
but check out the microtomography.

439
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,570
The blade

440
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,477
was double-edged
with an identical taper on both sides.

441
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,334
Somebody killed her
with a sharp piece of pie.

442
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,793
Angela has the photos Dr. Brennan

443
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:22,048
uploaded of potential weapons
from the reunion.

444
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,659
Weapons.
Yes, we didn't have those at my reunion.

445
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:29,175
So this is the class of '94.

446
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,530
My high school is looking good.

447
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,595
I think Brennan was the normal one.

448
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,198
You see anything
that could match the marks?

449
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,648
No, the cleaver
has a totally different blade profile.

450
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,416
Right. We're looking for a piece of pie,
right?

451
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:42,986
Look at her.

452
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:46,109
Zoom in on those tools on the table.

453
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,159
There.

454
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,161
Can you give me
the angle of that taper?

455
00:22:57,782 --> 00:22:58,895
48 degrees.

456
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,087
Compare that
to the marks on the bones.

457
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:03,313
It's pretty close.

458
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,961
This ice carving tool could
definitely be the murder weapon.

459
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:08,821
Carrie is a sweetie pie.

460
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,610
She made the cake for my birthday.

461
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,142
Carrie isn't here.
Where did she go?

462
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:16,686
I don't know.
You're the genius.

463
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,646
Any bad blood between her
and Evelyn?

464
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,519
Evelyn is on the city council.
She gave Carrie her cateng contract

465
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:25,437
for city functions, school lunches.

466
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,093
She took it away, too.

467
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:30,725
They had a big blowout.
Now Carrie's looking for work.

468
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,850
What's going on?

469
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,806
- Leaving me out of the gossip?
- No. I love to gossip.

470
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,336
Remember when you were locked out of
the locker room in your underwear,

471
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,649
and the boys took pictures
and they put it all over school?

472
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,677
I can't believe you'd bring that up.

473
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,481
That's not gossip, honey.
That's embarrassing.

474
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,332
You're as clueless as ever.

475
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,319
There's Carrie.

476
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,813
I can't believe it'd be her.

477
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,346
Her cakes are so light and fluffy.

478
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,149
You're breaking up with me?

479
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,828
Because I would've done
the right thing by you?

480
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:17,914
I'm not a duty, Wendell.

481
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:20,772
You didn't do anything wrong.

482
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,866
In fact, it's the opposite.

483
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,463
You're the best.

484
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,874
But you can't tell me that in the back
of your heart, you aren't thinking

485
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,733
that another upcoming duty
might be to let me down

486
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,502
as gently as you can.

487
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,083
I really, really like you, Angela.

488
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:46,528
I really like you, too.

489
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,106
You're sexy and...

490
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,780
smart and...

491
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,281
good.

492
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,768
You're, like, "saint" good.

493
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,053
I'm a sexy saint.

494
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:01,915
Do not knock that.

495
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,704
It's a rare and hot combo.

496
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,880
You have somebody out there
who isn't a duty.

497
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:13,159
So do you.

498
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,589
I think we both know who.

499
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,569
You have to question her,
you know, as her old friend.

500
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,692
She didn't like me then.
No one did.

501
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,263
And they still don't.
I obviously had no social skills.

502
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,408
They're not gonna suspect a thing,
all right?

503
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,699
- Because you're an alumni.
- Alumna.

504
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:39,036
- Why can't I hang out with Mr. Buxley?
- I'm gonna be right here next to you.

505
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,997
You just go up to
her and you say, "Hi.

506
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:44,625
"How are you?" And then you just,
you know, spark up a conversation.

507
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,673
Hi, Carrie, how have you been?

508
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:48,754
Hello, Andy.

509
00:25:49,135 --> 00:25:51,217
Hello, Temperance.
I'm the shop teacher now.

510
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:53,551
In charge
of the entire shop program.

511
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,428
You look really good.

512
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:56,451
Really.

513
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:59,056
There two seconds, he trying
to get into my pants.

514
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,825
I'm her husband Bobby Kent.

515
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,603
Is the marriage working out?
Because, statistically...

516
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,229
Are you serious?

517
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:07,193
Go inflate a doll, Andy.

518
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,951
Thanks for the rescue.

519
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:15,706
So, you actually look normal now.

520
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,385
Thank you.
I heard Evelyn ruined your career.

521
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,786
- But you're not, are you?
- My wife just meant

522
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,246
how difficult it must be

523
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,692
with this economy
and trying to find work.

524
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,500
I know how terrible Temperance felt.

525
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,963
- Isn't that right, sweetheart?
- Sure.

526
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,087
It is hard.

527
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:31,558
I lost everything.

528
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:35,218
Maybe it wasn't Evie's fault, but I had
to go live with my parents in Florida

529
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,760
till I find something else.

530
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,412
Almost didn't make it back
for the reunion.

531
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:42,225
So you weren't here
this past weekend?

532
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,635
I was buying diapers for my dad.

533
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,332
- Hodgins.
- You might have to excuse us.

534
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,399
- That cake looks great, by the way.
- Your cake isn't bad either.

535
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,902
Are you sure you and Morticia
are working out?

536
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:54,879
Slow down.

537
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:58,749
What do you have?

538
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,575
So the calcium sulfate...
it was plain old chalk.

539
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,382
And the particles in the stab marks
were clear coat varnish.

540
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:07,692
Chalk and varnish.

541
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,378
Have you anything
on the weapon or the saw?

542
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,922
The negative hook angle
and the striations

543
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,501
on the bones indicate a band saw.

544
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,969
- Band saw.
- Bingo.

545
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,316
- Bingo based on what?
- Bingo bango.

546
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,407
Where else are you going to
find a band saw and chalk?

547
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:25,224
Shop class.

548
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,938
No offense, but, you know,
I hate your school.

549
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:31,082
Temperance should, too.

550
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,484
They never treated her
good enough here.

551
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:35,027
Hello, Mr. Buxley.

552
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,255
Careful in the dark, kids.

553
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:40,573
The saw.

554
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:46,951
Careful, Bones.

555
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:16,208
Do you like it?

556
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,394
You're one of my girls now,
Temperance. 

557
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,695
Do you like it?

558
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,070
Just a token of my affection.

559
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:32,846
- It's for you Temperance.
- Thank you Andy.

560
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:35,535
No thank you, Andy.
She's married.

561
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,008
- Things happen.
- We know.

562
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,385
You asked Sarah to Prom didn't you?

563
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:44,638
I think she would have
went with me too, if she'd a lived.

564
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:47,786
Then did you think that Evelyn
would leave Brad for you?

565
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:50,290
I've heard Brad
has had business trouble.

566
00:28:50,415 --> 00:28:53,689
I mean, you know, she deserves
somebody who can provide her stability.

567
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,317
- I smell bleach, honey.
- I know.

568
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,049
I came in here week before last,
and the place was really spic-and-span.

569
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:02,531
You know, Ray doesn't usually do
such a good job.

570
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:03,886
Wasn't me.

571
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,078
Do you always just appear?

572
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:08,912
Bleach cleans blood.

573
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,355
Maybe somebody cut theirselves.

574
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:14,585
Bad.

575
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:17,046
You are good, Mr. Buxley.

576
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,565
You are very good.

577
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,135
- I've missed you.
- Did you want something, Mr. Buxley?

578
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,545
Oh, right.

579
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:26,793
Julie asked me
to get y'all upstairs.

580
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:28,724
Party's starting.

581
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,768
- Coming.
- We'll be right there.

582
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,232
I want to show Bobby

583
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:34,300
the picture of me in
the science cabinet.

584
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,412
That would be great.
Where is that again?

585
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,275
It's down the hall.

586
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,770
Hurry up.

587
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,862
Maybe Angela and Wendell

588
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,894
can match the saw blade from photos.

589
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,280
What if this whole
place was bleached?

590
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,994
There's going to be a lot of blood.

591
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,960
If Evelyn was dismembered here,
even if the room was cleaned,

592
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,333
the killer may have left
some evidence.

593
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,876
I'll go look for a weapon.

594
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:58,337
- Pie-shaped point.
- Right... pie-shaped point.

595
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,916
The saw would have created
a lot of bone dust.

596
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:09,890
Some of the dust could have traveled
into this computer vent.

597
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,611
I'm getting a text.

598
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,979
Found some.

599
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,001
This might be bone dust.

600
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,214
Turns out Brad had a large
life insurance policy on Evelyn.

601
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:23,237
He definitely knows his way
around shop tools.

602
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,381
The evidence sure points to Brad.

603
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:30,953
What do you got?

604
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,179
Bone dust.

605
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,266
It's none of my business
if you broke up with Angela.

606
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:52,751
It's your business
because we're friends,

607
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,641
and it's kind of a big deal for me.

608
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,751
Right. I'm sorry.
Of course.

609
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,630
You know what?
You need to...

610
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,331
go out and get drunk, you know?

611
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:06,019
Pick a fight, steal a car.
Come on. I got your back.

612
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:09,492
What I need is for you to know
that I did my best concerning Angela.

613
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,952
Yeah, I know that already.

614
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:13,937
I haven't told you about it.

615
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:15,231
You don't have to.

616
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:16,790
I know you.

617
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,976
Someday, maybe we can talk
about what kind of woman Angela is.

618
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:27,154
Someday. Yeah.

619
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,630
I guess...

620
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,567
somewhere, I always knew
she was just on loan.

621
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:36,220
She is awesome, isn't she?

622
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,906
She's totally worth it, man.
I mean...

623
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:40,643
I know.

624
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:42,913
I know you know.

625
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,072
Let me talk
to your supervisor's supervisor.

626
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:05,047
Sheriff said that Brad is upset.

627
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:07,353
You know, Evelyn
should be here by now.

628
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:10,323
You know, a lot of people
thought I killed Sarah.

629
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:12,304
I think that's why
they're so cold to me.

630
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,206
But I was fine, you know.

631
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,767
I had science and history.

632
00:32:17,054 --> 00:32:18,264
And Mr. Buxley.

633
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:33,534
I'll hold for the 50th time.

634
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:36,282
"The Electric Slide"
was my favorite dance.

635
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:37,407
It is...

636
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,422
You know, I never understood
why my classmates

637
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,795
didn't appreciate
my dance moves more.

638
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,319
Did we get any more information
from the squints on the murder weapon?

639
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,645
The ice carving tool was close,
but not an exact match.

640
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:04,544
- All right. Let's get some punch.
- Can we dance, Booth?

641
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:05,649
It's Seal.

642
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,526
It's a slow song.

643
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:09,882
I'm sorry,
is that too difficult for you?

644
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:12,418
I just don't want any
misunderstandings here.

645
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:14,307
That's all, Bones.
I mean, you know...

646
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:17,620
We opened up a door there that
neither one of us wants to walk through.

647
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,610
I know. I just was asking to dance.

648
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,437
Because I remember the song.
I'm sorry.

649
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:26,211
No, you know what?

650
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,484
It's just a dance.

651
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,424
It's your reunion.
Okay, let's do it. Let's dance.

652
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,592
Come on.

653
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,175
Why are you so far away?

654
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,471
Just keeping room
for the Holy Spirit. That's all.

655
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,853
Why are you always so
suspicious of Mr. Buxley?

656
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,221
Because, he's psycho.

657
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:50,778
He has access to the shop
and he has a huge knife.

658
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,344
That is so cool.

659
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:13,592
Bones, you're tearing up.

660
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,808
This is the prom
I never got to go to. 

661
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,424
Could be the shop teacher, right?
Evelyn turns him down,

662
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:02,536
and he freaks out because
he's running out of time

663
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,120
to lose his virginity.

664
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,773
You still haven't confirmed

665
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,403
that Carrie was in Florida.

666
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:09,565
Pie?

667
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:11,608
Sure. That's great.
I'd love pie.

668
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,027
Can't believe
Evelyn missed the reunion.

669
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,261
If she never comes back,

670
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:18,741
then you might get
your catering contract back.

671
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:24,246
- Could be the murder weapon.
- The angle's wrong.

672
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:26,328
Andy asked me to prom

673
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:28,117
after Sarah was murdered.

674
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:30,697
I should have said yes.
This is fun.

675
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,379
Except for the murder.

676
00:35:37,993 --> 00:35:40,482
- They're beautiful, aren't they?
- Oh, it's great.

677
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,651
The points are about 48 degrees.

678
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,272
- Just like Angela's estimate.
- What are you doing?

679
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,611
Excuse me.

680
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:53,317
What are you doing, Bones?

681
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:58,300
Look at her.
She is still weird.

682
00:35:58,586 --> 00:35:59,948
Hands off, Morticia!

683
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,279
Just hold that.

684
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,327
Just hold up the star
and smile, sweetheart.

685
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,421
They're a freaking love story,
and I'm feeding cats.

686
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:23,222
So, the star points have
a 52-degree taper.

687
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:28,290
An exact match for the
injuries found on the bones.

688
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:30,519
Yeah, and the edging
shows that the stars

689
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,440
were cut by the same saw
that was used to dismember the body.

690
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,134
But there are multiple wounds.

691
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,606
And it's hard to believe
that she was stabbed repeatedly

692
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:39,410
with a star until she was killed.

693
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,949
Can you show us the placement
of all the bone injuries?

694
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:49,311
Stab wounds are usually localized.

695
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,251
Maybe there were multiple stars.

696
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,962
There, look...
the picture from shop class.

697
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:59,701
This is the drying rack.

698
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:03,202
This is where they placed
the stars when the varnish was drying.

699
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:06,378
So let's see if the points line up.

700
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:10,569
The wounds are so deep.
Falling on them wouldn't kill her.

701
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:13,298
Unless somebody
shoved her onto them.

702
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:16,304
That explains the two ribs
that were broken and not cut.

703
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:19,528
They were fractured when the murderer
threw Evelyn onto the stars.

704
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,598
Digging the stars into her bones

705
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:24,158
and puncturing the plural cavity,
killing her.

706
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:26,741
Somebody really hated her.

707
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:36,410
Okay, thanks, Cam.

708
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:40,616
The stars are the murder weapon.

709
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,142
They were on the same band saw
that dismembered Evelyn.

710
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:44,638
Who made the stars?

711
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:47,932
I'll ask.

712
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:58,433
You're not here for the reunion,
are you, Miss Temperance?

713
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:01,845
No, Mr. Buxley.

714
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,356
Couldn't imagine that.

715
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:08,647
So, who's dead?

716
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:11,631
Evelyn.

717
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:14,864
These stars were made

718
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:16,752
here in the shop.

719
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,546
The stars killed her?

720
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,533
Do you know who made them?

721
00:38:22,564 --> 00:38:23,564
Julie.

722
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,740
She made all the decorations.

723
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:28,067
She's a regular Martha Stewart.

724
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,556
Julie?

725
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,912
Don't surprise me, though.

726
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,733
One look at her, you
can tell, she's off.

727
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,229
Them smiley ones...

728
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:39,608
they always give me the willies.

729
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:47,236
What was wrong?

730
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:49,582
Brad just got off the phone.

731
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,794
Evie never got to Nicaragua.

732
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,080
Where could she be?

733
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:56,118
She would have called, right?

734
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,534
Oh, honey.

735
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,887
It was her, Booth.

736
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,310
It was Julie.

737
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:10,346
Brad was mine.

738
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:11,975
It was my turn to have him.

739
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,508
I beg your pardon?

740
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,187
Evelyn and I made a pact
in high school.

741
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,697
We got rid of Sarah
so we could share Brad.

742
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:19,930
We had a pact.

743
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:22,651
Evelyn and you killed Sarah?

744
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,626
She was sleeping with Brad.

745
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,231
He was ours.

746
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:28,699
Evie had him first, and now
it was my turn to have him.

747
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,403
She wouldn't give him up.

748
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:32,082
Where is Brad, anyway?

749
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:34,345
Someone should tell him
that I'm here.

750
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:36,371
He's going to be worried about me.

751
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:38,417
Just get comfy.

752
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,031
Watch the hair.

753
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:04,609
Did Wendell tell you?

754
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:07,987
Of course he did.

755
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,656
You're friends.

756
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:11,074
You okay?

757
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Yes, I am.

758
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,414
As you know, I have
some experience in this area.

759
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,650
I'd like to know
if Wendell's all right.

760
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,990
He's doing much better
than I did after we broke up.

761
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,908
I don't want to be the kind of
person who leaves this

762
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:32,929
string of good-hearted guys
behind her, you know?

763
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,198
Ange, we broke up, you know?

764
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:37,894
You did not dump me.

765
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,522
And Wendell is fine.

766
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:41,756
I got to tell you.

767
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:43,706
I think you left him

768
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:45,851
in better shape than you found him.

769
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,583
I don't know about that.

770
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,405
I mean, I'm pretty sure
he was born that way.

771
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,739
Still,

772
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:55,202
he is better for having
known you, Angela.

773
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,000
- And how can you be sure?
- Because I've been there.

774
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:07,756
Even ten or 15 years later,

775
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,402
you put the same people
in the same environments,

776
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:12,725
and the exact same
interpersonal relationships

777
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,667
will pick up where they left off.

778
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,028
When the Wall fell,

779
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:18,111
the majority of KGB agents
kept their positions

780
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:20,268
when the organization turned
to other endeavors.

781
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,686
Are you saying that high
school is like the KGB?

782
00:41:23,096 --> 00:41:25,770
Clandestine meetings,
secret pacts, murder.

783
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:27,192
It sounds like her's.

784
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,195
I tried to change
their perception of me

785
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,072
by telling them how successful
I'd become, but they didn't like me.

786
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,825
- Why would you tell them that?
- She didn't do it right.

787
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:38,140
- You told her to do that?
- Look, it had to be subtle.

788
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,289
I am so never going
to my high school reunion ever.

789
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,667
I think it'd be fun to see
how everybody turned out.

790
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,562
Heck, yeah. I'd like to see
how Suzanne Dowell turned out.

791
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:48,785
Oh, man.
She used to wear these jeans.

792
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,911
Must have been painted on.

793
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:53,136
Stephanie Roberts and
her little pink shirt.

794
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,304
Dr. Sweets, are you still with us?

795
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,775
Sorry.

796
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,336
They didn't dislike you.
They just didn't understand you.

797
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,231
- big difference.
- It didn't bother me.

798
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:06,404
I found the reunion
to be quite educational,

799
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,753
and you were right.

800
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,913
It was good to go back.

801
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:14,242
It made me see
how lucky I am... now.

802
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,160
This is what friendship
looks like, this table.

803
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:22,080
I am very lucky.

804
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:24,416
Cheers.

805
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:28,369
Salud.
