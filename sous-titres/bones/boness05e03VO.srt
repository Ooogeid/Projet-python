1
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:14,165
OK, so the guy here says he was out
doing routine track maintenance

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,335
and saw the bones,
he thought it was a deer.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,700
Human dentition is
completely different.

4
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,919
Another example of our country's
deplorable educational system.

5
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,644
Until every kid becomes a dentist,

6
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,501
we've some psycho throwing a hacked-up
body out of a speeding train.

7
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,220
These bones were under the train.

8
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:30,285
If body parts had been
thrown out a window,

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,281
they'd be scattered
in nearby foliage.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,784
Level of decomp suggests

11
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,871
the remains have been exposed
to the elements for at least two months.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,934
- Drunk? Suicide?
- Conjecture.

13
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,001
There's evidence of sharp-force trauma
on the sternum.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,087
- Stabbed.
- More conjecture.

15
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,753
- Beaten.
- Would you please stop that?

16
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,549
Come on.
It's a beautiful day.

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,451
- We must enjoy conjecture.
- There's a distinct lack of hemorrhage.

18
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:56,171
This victim was dead before
being hit by the train.

19
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,441
So, someone killed him,
dumped him on the tracks

20
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,544
in hopes of trying to make it
look like a suicide.

21
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:03,773
I can't determine motive, but I can say
the train dragged the victim,

22
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,320
and his body broke up as it smashed
against the rails and ties.

23
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,315
We're saying the bones and the body gunk
were scattered along the track here?

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,531
Yeah. For miles.

25
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:17,118
Trains should be diverted from this
track until we locate the remains.

26
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,534
But do you know how much chaos
that's going to cause Amtrak?

27
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,809
I told you, Booth.
I'm not interested in conjecture.

28
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,702
When I was a kid, Bones,
I always wanted to be a hobo.

29
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:31,939
I wanted to ride the rails,
play the guitar...

30
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:34,471
Be malnourished, riddled
with preventable disease.

31
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,499
You know what?
You could make Santa Claus cry.

32
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,709
You really could.

33
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:40,248
You're wearing
your belt buckle again, Cocky.

34
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,702
Ever since the whole coma thing,

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,976
I just kept staring at it,
thinking to myself,

36
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:47,857
"Why would I wear
something like this?"

37
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,881
- 'Cause you love it. You always have.
- Yeah, that's what I landed on.

38
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,113
I'm glad you did. I like it.
It's... it's Boothy.

39
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:56,824
There's a bone cyst on this femur.

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,783
The result of the parasite
Echinococcus granulosus.

41
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,787
It's extremely uncommon in the U.S.

42
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,653
Immigrant, illegal.
Sorry. No conjecting.

43
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm just being Boothy.

44
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:08,198
So, what do you got there?

45
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,843
Pelvis is male.

46
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,992
Partial epiphyseal fusion

47
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:25,519
indicates the victim
to be in his teens.

48
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,005
He was just a kid.

49
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,254
The markers on these bones are
anomalous, even for an immigrant.

50
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,703
I'd like to get them back
to the lab to run some tests.

51
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,315
- Hold on, Bones.
- FBI Forensics can continue the search.

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,985
- I'll send Clark to supervise.
- Bones, time-out. Hold on.

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,285
You might want
to take the skull back there

54
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,037
that my people are holding.

55
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,283
So, you and Perry going to get something
to eat after the library?

56
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,543
- Probably.
- OK. But promise me you're going...

57
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:56,527
- Call if I'm going to be late, I know.
- Sorry. New mom.

58
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,652
It's okay.

59
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,237
I wanted to ask you,
you know that dance this weekend?

60
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,535
The... formal?

61
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,861
Yeah. Perry and I thought it
might be fun to, you know,

62
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,306
make a whole night of it.

63
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:10,472
Like, we'd rent a limo and go to
breakfast in the morning and...

64
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,800
The whole night?
Where would you sleep?

65
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,443
We wouldn't.
That's the point.

66
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,881
So, you and Perry would be

67
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,573
spending the night together,
not sleeping?

68
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,494
- Why do you say it like that?
- Just thinking it through. That's all.

69
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,853
Here's Perry.
I thought you liked him.

70
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,604
- Well, I do, but...
- You feel... You'll think about it?

71
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,927
- Dr. Saroyan.
- Cam, Perry. Call me Cam.

72
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,814
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

73
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,018
Flora!
Clark, you shouldn't have.

74
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:10,457
- I presume that is for me.
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

75
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,203
Brennan said she found a skull,
so... I can give you a face.

76
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:15,967
Yeah. It's right here.

77
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,424
Complete with perimortem
fractures on the parietal.

78
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,976
Looks like the victim
was badly beaten.

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,179
Brennan said this
was a teenager, right?

80
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,247
Yeah. These clothing scraps
look hand-stitched.

81
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,038
Like his mom made them.

82
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,336
That makes it sadder somehow.

83
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,903
- Where's Dr. Brennan?
- She's doing an isotope analysis.

84
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,253
She thinks the victim might
be from another country.

85
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,929
That makes sense.

86
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:41,994
His cavities suggest that his drinking
water wasn't fluoridated.

87
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,950
- When do teenagers start having sex?
- Hello!

88
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,995
If they could, they'd start
in the morning and go until they drop.

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,915
- Please tell me this is about the case.
- This is about Michelle?

90
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,881
- Is she having sex?
- Working here is like

91
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,084
- being on <i>The View.</i>
- No. I meant "what age?"

92
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,334
Dr. Saroyan, may I be excused

93
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,632
to attend to something more...
case-related?

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,372
Dr. Brennan already
requested that you suit up

95
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:05,095
to supervise the FBI techs'
retrieval of the remains

96
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,763
at the train tracks.

97
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:10,643
She wants me to put on a jumpsuit
and walk along a railroad track?

98
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,312
That is not a good
look on a brother.

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,776
I bet you were an early starter,
weren't you, Clark?

100
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,210
A prodigy, maybe?

101
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,000
In case you haven't heard,
Miss Montenegro, I have,

102
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,975
work to do.
So, excuse me.

103
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,826
No pesticides.
No evidence of processed foods.

104
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,201
- The kid's from the boonies.
- No, it's more significant than that.

105
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:39,302
Our victim grew up with no bone markers
that indicate modern life.

106
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:43,070
No evidence of contact
with electricity or petrochemicals.

107
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,345
Fine. Then we're back to an immigrant.
Maybe a developing nation.

108
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,366
Isotopic analysis of his bone

109
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:53,433
matches the geology
of the Mid-Atlantic states.

110
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,187
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

111
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,691
Our victim was a teenage boy
who died about two months ago,

112
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,236
but according to the data,
he grew up in the early 1800s.

113
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,269
Bones - Season 5 Episode 03

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

116
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,346
I... discovered the origins
of our victim's markers.

117
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,530
What? Discovered what?
Markers. Great.

118
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,222
He wasn't from the 19th century.

119
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:52,327
I took dual X-ray absorpitometry scans
of the pelvic bone and then computed...

120
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,492
I trust your methods, Dr. Brennan.
You can just skip to the conclusion.

121
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,833
Our dead teenager was Amish.

122
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,489
Amish, like buggies and hats Amish?

123
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,344
Let's call Booth. Maybe something
will turn up on Missing Persons.

124
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,572
He's already checking.
I'm going to meet him.

125
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,012
Is that a cartoon rendering
of a penis in your book?

126
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,058
Why, I guess it is.
Look at that.

127
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,667
- Why is it talking?
- Isn't Booth expecting you?

128
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:17,792
It's cute.

129
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:27,303
Levi Yoder's parents filed a missing
persons report about two months ago.

130
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:30,352
- Kid's a ringer for Angela's sketch.
- He was probably on his rumspringa.

131
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,284
That would explain the DMV photo.

132
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,453
- What do you mean?
- Amish don't drive

133
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,080
while living in their community.

134
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,873
No, I mean, rum... rum what?

135
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,091
Rumspringa.

136
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:42,512
It's the period when Amish youth
are encouraged to...

137
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:46,090
explore the outside world.
It translates to "running around."

138
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,986
- That's crazy.
- No more crazy than your religion.

139
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,594
Look, we reject Satan, and...

140
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,718
They reject buttons.

141
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:56,809
Rumspringa is a quite rational way
to help teens make an informed decision

142
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,686
as to whether or not to be baptized
into the Amish faith as adults.

143
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,978
Take a bunch of sheltered kids
and set them loose recipe for disaster,

144
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:05,150
- if you ask me.
- Actually, over 85%

145
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,695
of Amish teens return and become
full members of their church community.

146
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,822
Really?

147
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,068
How many baptized Catholics are still
practicing their faith in adulthood?

148
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,782
Here we go with the Catholics again.
You know what? I don't want to hear

149
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,383
about the Pope's hat... again.

150
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,550
He's got to wear it
just like, you know,

151
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,835
the guys in front
of Buckingham Palace have to.

152
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,280
It's quite ornate
for a vow of poverty.

153
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,705
Don't you think?

154
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:34,680
We're sorry for your loss.

155
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,124
I tried to protect him.

156
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:41,843
I told him the English world
was dangerous and seductive.

157
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,273
- Where did he go?
- Washington.

158
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,121
He went with another boy,
Josef Beachy.

159
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:50,112
- So, then, he wasn't really missing.
- Not at first.

160
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,018
He promised to call us
once a week to check in.

161
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:56,201
There's an English family down the road
that let us use their phone.

162
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,156
Then the phone calls stopped.

163
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:00,043
I spoke to Josef's parents.

164
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:02,255
Josef told them that he and Levi

165
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,756
hadn't been living together
for quite some time.

166
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,477
We contacted the police

167
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:08,287
and filed a missing persons report.

168
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,156
The last time you spoke to your son,

169
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,843
did he seem disappointed
or sad about anything?

170
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:14,754
He sounded alive.

171
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:16,555
Happy.

172
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,976
Would it be all right
if we took a look in his room?

173
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:25,264
Thank you.

174
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:31,458
The good news
is that this span of track

175
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,630
only uses southbound trains,

176
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:36,174
which means the body most
likely came from the north.

177
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,520
And the bad news?

178
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,152
Well, we're still missing
a lot of body parts.

179
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:44,144
And north of this section, there are
multiple switch points where the tracks

180
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,043
branch out into dozens
of other lines.

181
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:49,370
Clark's looking at
a lot of hot hours under the sun.

182
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,375
Send him the routes
he has to search.

183
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,954
What's going on with Michelle?

184
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,973
- Michelle has this boyfriend, Perry...
- I met him. He's a hottie.

185
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,956
- Who's a hottie?
- Perry. Michelle's boyfriend.

186
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,812
Yeah, sure. If you like athletic,
confident, young...

187
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,266
- Studly.
- Let's not say "studly", please.

188
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:12,098
- Do you have something for me?
- That vine on the bones... it's kudzu.

189
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:14,074
The growth rate suggests
the body parts

190
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,990
had been undisturbed
for approximately two months.

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,465
The victim must have died shortly after
the last time he spoke to his parents.

192
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,239
Perry's a senior, isn't he?

193
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:25,718
That might be why he's pressuring
Michelle to have sex.

194
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,625
Why do you think
he is pressuring her?

195
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,479
Women want sex just as much as men.

196
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:31,816
Yeah, she's a child.
She still has stuffed animals.

197
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,841
Well, I did, too, at 16.
And I also had Brian.

198
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,159
All you can do is tell her to respect
herself and use protection.

199
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:41,223
During the Crusades, knights used
to lock up their wives and daughters.

200
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:43,892
How helpful.
Anything else, Hodgins?

201
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,436
And let's try something
case-related this time.

202
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:47,646
Yes. May I?

203
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,454
So, the victim's bones...

204
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,227
they were covered
in a sedimentary rock dust

205
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,947
comprised of carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur,

206
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,564
so as indicated, he was most likely
hooked beneath a coal car.

207
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,912
That eliminates the need for me
to search for passenger-only trains.

208
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,145
Which means I can focus
on which lines used coal cars.

209
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,628
Listen, Cam, every teenager
goes through this.

210
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,731
Think about what you went through.

211
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,256
Me? Oh, God!

212
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:17,092
What am I gonna do?

213
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,456
Well, there's no posters,
there's no video games.

214
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:25,058
Tell you what, if I was a teenager,
I'd want out of this place, too.

215
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,852
Nice quilt, though.

216
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:32,891
What do we have here?

217
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,303
What is this,
some kind of an Amish thing?

218
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,197
Rock collection.

219
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,408
I don't, I don't think so.

220
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:44,333
Mrs. Yoder, do you have any idea

221
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,416
why your son would keep these
under his bed?

222
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,314
- I've never seen those before.
- OK. We should get these to Sweets.

223
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,738
- Take a look at.
- Why? Hodgins would be the one

224
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,286
to know if stones would have
any evidentiary value.

225
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,402
A kid hides rocks
underneath his bed.

226
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,026
They're gonna mean something.
Not to Hodgins. Here.

227
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:04,389
That photograph of Levi,
is it possible for me to keep it?

228
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,950
The Amish don't use cameras.

229
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,645
She probably doesn't have any
other pictures of her son.

230
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,645
Yeah.

231
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,640
Of course.
Here you go.

232
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,091
OK, that's great.
Thanks.

233
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,311
So, listen, the FBI
is tracking down the address

234
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:37,089
for this Josef kid.
We'll have it in a few.

235
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:42,719
Hello there.

236
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:46,431
Are you here about Levi?

237
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,582
Were you two friends?

238
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:51,789
Sarah.

239
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:54,439
You're needed at home.

240
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,582
Clearly she's busy right now.

241
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:59,528
No, please, it's okay.
It's my brother.

242
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,699
I have to go.

243
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,771
Excuse me. Listen.
If you need anything, here's my card.

244
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,330
You can call me any time.

245
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,758
Sarah, now!

246
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,308
The males are clearly dominant.

247
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,131
Yeah, clearly. Look.

248
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,356
So we got the address
for Josef Beachy.

249
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,574
Here we go.

250
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,974
FBI! Open up!

251
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,342
Seriously, I yelled "FBI,"
and you opened up the door holding that?

252
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,418
You were...
There's nothing going on here, Officer.

253
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,195
You're holding a bong!

254
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,749
- Josef Beachy?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,849
You're coming with us.
Come on!

256
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,662
This is not in the proper spirit
of rumspringa!

257
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,638
Levi moved out a few months ago.
I haven't seen him since.

258
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,488
Well, we were told you were going
through your rumspringa together.

259
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,542
- Why would he leave?
- Parties weren't his thing.

260
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,576
That's kind of
what rumspringa's for, right?

261
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,537
Cut loose, go a little crazy.

262
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,365
- Getting busted for smoking weed.
- It's supposed to be

263
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,375
a time to contemplate
your future faith.

264
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,297
Well, yeah. I was seeing
how in the future

265
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,063
I wouldn't want to smoke weed.

266
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,444
Maybe Levi threatened
to tell your parents that you were

267
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,094
a stoner, and you had to stop him.

268
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,682
Look, man, Levi had his own secrets.
No way he'd risk telling on me.

269
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,162
- What kind of secrets?
- I don't know,

270
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,356
but he used to disappear for hours,
never tell anyone where he was going.

271
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,441
Even back home, there
were times he'd tell

272
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,258
his folks he was at work, but I
knew that that wasn't true.

273
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,446
Do you know where Levi
went after he moved out?

274
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,698
Like I said,
we didn't really keep in touch.

275
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:11,732
You know, I know...

276
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,420
I will end up
going back to the church.

277
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,435
I just got to get all the wild out,
but Levi...

278
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,246
He always seemed
like he had other plans.

279
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,463
Are those the rocks
from the victim's room?

280
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,448
Yup. Just finishing up now.

281
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,070
What are you doing?

282
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,097
Booth asked me to take a look.

283
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:44,300
At rocks?

284
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,611
- That is so my domain.
- Meaning you found something?

285
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:50,111
Depends how you define something.

286
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:53,201
I mean, all rocks are
a tangible representation of the

287
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,080
awe-inspiring passage of time
on this tiny planet that we call...

288
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:00,431
They're your basic

289
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,669
Paleozoic era metamorphic rocks.

290
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,229
They're rocks that you clear away
when you're plowing a field,

291
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,465
so there's nothing distinguishing
about them,

292
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,709
except for the awe-inspiring
passage of time thing.

293
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,272
- What about the feathers?
- Eastern bluebird.

294
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,076
They're a pretty common songbird.

295
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,683
I think I know what these are.

296
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,852
There are 88 of these.

297
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,687
52 relatively light in color.

298
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,902
36 dark.

299
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,598
Piano.

300
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,192
You think this is a piano?

301
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,816
For Fred Flinstone, maybe.

302
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:29,529
No. Like a practice keyboard.

303
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,990
You've seen them.
I used to use one when I took lessons.

304
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,768
Plus, the songbird feathers
are further signifiers of music.

305
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,927
He kept it hidden under his bed
because Levi was ashamed.

306
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,457
The Amish aren't supposed
to play musical instruments.

307
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,664
So then, where does a kid
like Levi learn about pianos?

308
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,664
Booth said
that he had a job in town.

309
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,881
Every small town has
at least one piano teacher.

310
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,264
I'll tell Booth.

311
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,216
What are you doing?

312
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,029
Playing the theme to <i>Titanic.</i>

313
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,539
Even not hearing it,
I hate that song.

314
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,507
Not the way I play it.

315
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,056
Were you able to get some photos
of brake rigging?

316
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:15,243
Yeah, I got them.

317
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,702
I got the photos, got
the bones, I got bit

318
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,932
by God knows what kind
of bugs out there.

319
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:21,998
Perhaps Hodgins can
identify them for you.

320
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:25,794
Trauma is consistent
with his body lying face up as

321
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,676
an exposed gear lever hooked him
in the sternum.

322
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,488
Have you found
the cause of death yet?

323
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,032
Not yet. There's evidence
of perimortem fractures,

324
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:35,688
but until I get more bones,
I won't be able to see a pattern.

325
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,100
Dr. Bernard covered all
the tracks between the bridge

326
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,558
and the switch point.

327
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,797
We're still missing
over 60% of the vertebrae.

328
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,399
Not to mention a number
of extremities.

329
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,527
Animal scavengers must have made off
with the rest of the bones.

330
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,863
You have to regroup the tech
team and start another search,

331
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,706
this time focusing
on secluded brush areas

332
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:58,910
within 50 yards
on either side of the tracks,

333
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,413
where animal feeding sites
would likely appear.

334
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,593
Actually, I'm more
of a lab rat, Dr. Brennan.

335
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,843
Perhaps somebody
more outdoorsy would be better.

336
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,174
If there's spinal damage
that corresponds to the compression

337
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,717
fractures on the lung bones,
we could have cause of death.

338
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,052
I need those bones.
You're the most qualified.

339
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,555
Don't scratch your neck
with the gloves.

340
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,888
Well, is it all right
if I get a drink of water, boss?

341
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:25,529
You know, it's awful hot out there,

342
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:27,699
and them tools is mighty heavy.

343
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,399
Of course you can get water.

344
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,910
- Why are you talking like that?
- Never mind.

345
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,232
I'm going.

346
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,741
I'm going.

347
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,413
What are you doing here?

348
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,749
We got out early
for an assembly, so...

349
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,209
Come in. Sit down.

350
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:49,677
Thanks.

351
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:52,964
I was wondering.

352
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,842
Have you think about the dance?

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,469
Michelle, are you having sex?

354
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:58,938
Excuse me?

355
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:02,850
It's no big deal.
I just... Well, no, it is a big deal.

356
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,851
It's a really, really big deal.

357
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,978
- This is none of your business.
- It is.

358
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,605
I'm your legal guardian.

359
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,109
So you can just boss me
around any way you want?

360
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,319
No. I think I'm understanding,
but sex... sex is...

361
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,110
Well, when two people have sex,
when the body is secreting hormones...

362
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,001
When men and women and sex are...

363
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,800
Some people believe
that God will smite you.

364
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,527
Just a thought.

365
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:32,581
You're not my mother.

366
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:34,894
I know, Michelle.

367
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,468
I love you, and I don't want
to see you get hurt.

368
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,960
Your only job was keeping
me out of foster care

369
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,181
after my father died,
and you did that.

370
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,098
So don't pretend there's anything more.
I've got homework.

371
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,822
That was only his third lesson.
He was playing Handel by ear.

372
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,753
I had to record it.
I was so flabbergasted.

373
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,813
So, Mrs. Tuner, you said
that Levi worked for your husband?

374
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:19,217
In construction, yes.

375
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:22,906
Levi brought some receipts
to our home a couple years ago,

376
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,937
and I was with a student,
and she was practicing <i>Fur Elise.</i>

377
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,395
Beethoven. I took a few piano
lessons, but, you know,

378
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,941
all thumbs, so couldn't
quite work it out.

379
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,509
Levi was fascinated,
so I invited him to watch.

380
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:42,037
And after my student left,
I suggested Levi touch a few keys.

381
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:43,741
He was shy.

382
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,557
But once he sat down,

383
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:48,413
- the boy was a natural.
- You started giving him lessons?

384
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,588
I never charged him.

385
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:53,605
He was a prodigy.

386
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,076
Mrs. Turner, during
these secret lessons,

387
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,857
did you notice if he
was conflicted at all?

388
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,925
Oh, my, yes.

389
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,497
I encouraged him
to use his rumspringa

390
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,723
to decide whether his love
of music was strong enough

391
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,059
for him to consider
leaving his faith.

392
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:13,271
- Did you keep in contact with him?
- For a while.

393
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,317
Then I never heard from him anymore.

394
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:20,528
This was the last thing
Levi sent me.

395
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:25,456
He wanted me to know
that he had made friends.

396
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:28,501
They were helping him to audition
for the National Conservatory

397
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,282
and he seemed so excited.

398
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,719
It's just not fair that he's gone.

399
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,781
Such a gift.

400
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,371
Okay, we know he was in D.C.,

401
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,274
but it would be helpful to have
an area of town to focus on.

402
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,908
Okay, I'll see if I can locate

403
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,243
any architectural
markers outside the windows.

404
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,050
<i>Karen, let's switch.</i>

405
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:25,884
<i>Tony, do the Mozart.</i>

406
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,095
<i>- Mozart?
- Yeah.</i>

407
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,400
You can hear them call
each other Karen and Tony.

408
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,822
These are some talented kids.

409
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:45,518
These buildings have Queen Anne
detail like a corbeled cornice.

410
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,700
Most of the older neighborhoods
have these. I'm gonna need more.

411
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,940
<i>Okay, Levi, do your audition piece.</i>

412
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,628
He's adorable.

413
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:08,469
Did you hear that?
That noise in the background?

414
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:12,140
Maybe we don't need
architectural markers.

415
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:17,155
The train.

416
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:21,190
Architecturally, these buildings
could be in one of six neighborhoods.

417
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,069
But this building here is the only one
that's right next to the train track.

418
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,273
I'll triangulate the structures
outside the windows and...

419
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:29,992
bingo,

420
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,039
there's the apartment building.

421
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,502
It's so sad.

422
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:52,580
Poor kid.

423
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,029
So, that's, your apartment
in the video, isn't it?

424
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,293
Levi lived in some party place.

425
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:12,309
I had room.
My building's not the greatest

426
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,368
but it was better than
where he was living.

427
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,454
- How did you two know Levi?
- It was about...

428
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,156
six months ago, Karen and I were

429
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,226
walking by one of the practice rooms
of the conservatory.

430
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:25,254
We heard this piano,
it was so beautiful.

431
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,173
Levi, he'd snuck in to play.

432
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,760
One thing just led to another,
and we sort of adopted him.

433
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,386
I had this gold medal,

434
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,307
not real gold, just
something I'd won

435
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:37,238
at a music competition
when I was a kid.

436
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:40,228
But to Levi, it was the
most beautiful thing ever.

437
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:43,189
So, I gave it to him for good luck.

438
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,486
I guess it didn't work very well.

439
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:48,779
How come you didn't file a missing
person's report when he disappeared?

440
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,373
We just figured he'd changed
his mind about the conservatory

441
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:52,904
and gone back to his family.

442
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,342
Why would you think that?

443
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,168
His dad had come to see him

444
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,289
and probably convinced
him to come home.

445
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,041
- Amish don't approve of playing music.
- Hold on. His dad was there?

446
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,963
A few days before Levi
was supposed to audition,

447
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,397
I went to the apartment
and when I left, I saw

448
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:13,303
a full-on Amish guy heading
towards the building.

449
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,721
And I tried to introduce myself,
but he just...

450
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:17,262
ignored me.

451
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,392
He seemed pretty pissed,
to be honest.

452
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:27,024
How dare you accuse me
of harming my own son?!

453
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,593
- Mr. Yoder...
- I would never raise a hand to my boy!

454
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:34,532
- Even if your livelihood was at stake?
- Levi was your only child.

455
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,536
I can see the arthritis in
your metacarpals and phalanges.

456
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,164
You needed a son's help
to keep this farm going.

457
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,723
You found out about the
audition, you and Levi fought,

458
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:45,065
there was an accident.

459
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,546
- You took his body to the tracks...
- How can you say those things to me?

460
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,237
You think this farm is more
important to me than my own son?

461
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,380
He was my son!

462
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,225
My husband hasn't left
this farm in over two years.

463
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:01,147
What are you talking about?

464
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:04,693
- What audition?
- For the National Conservatory.

465
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:06,673
A conservatory?

466
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,805
Your son was an extraordinarily
gifted classical musician.

467
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,736
No.

468
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:13,887
There are no instruments here.

469
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:16,168
That's why your son had
to sneak into town for lessons.

470
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,168
We would've known
something like that.

471
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,293
Not if he knew you'd disapprove.

472
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:25,909
So he ran away

473
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:28,674
because he couldn't trust us?

474
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:43,643
I don't believe he is involved.

475
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,090
- What, your gut again?
- I'm a father, he's a father.

476
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,606
Okay, it's something
you just wouldn't understand.

477
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,777
Would you advise Parker that
sexual intercourse at age 16

478
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,800
- is a wise decision?
- What?

479
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:57,815
How did you know that?
Wait, what are we talking about?

480
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,376
- Cam is afraid Michelle is having sex.
- No, that's not good.

481
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,352
You just said that you were having sex
when you were 16!

482
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:06,666
- That's different.
- So there's a double standard?

483
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,793
Of course.
Cam needs to shut that down.

484
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,308
I said that Michelle should wait
until she's at least 17-and-a-half.

485
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:13,745
Is that how old you were?

486
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,634
- No, I was 22.
- 22?

487
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,324
- Well, why do you sound shocked?
- No, it's just...

488
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,511
That's a good age. 22?

489
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,142
It was an important decision.
I gave it a lot of thought. I finally...

490
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,333
found a man who could provide
a skillful introduction and...

491
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,872
Okay, you make it t sound ke
it was a class that you took.

492
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:36,779
All right, you know,
the first time you should be in love.

493
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,341
You know, totally...

494
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,143
"goo-goo" for the other person.

495
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:44,587
- Were you when you were 16?
- Well, part of me was.

496
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,623
And if Michelle feels this way,
do you think she should be having sex?

497
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,377
No, Michelle should not be
having sex until she's 22.

498
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:54,964
- Yeah?
<i>- There's someone here to see you.</i>

499
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,480
She just spent hours
on a bus by herself.

500
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,554
Says she only wants to talk to you.

501
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,140
Levi and I,

502
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:05,524
were in love.

503
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,833
A few months
before he left Lancaster,

504
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,563
we started courting.

505
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,690
Did you know why
he was going to D.C.?

506
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,827
Music.

507
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:17,339
It was important he get it
out of his system before we married.

508
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,596
Did you stay in touch
while he was there?

509
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,449
He wrote me letters.

510
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:24,369
He talked about going
to the conservatory.

511
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:27,634
I began to worry I'd lost him.

512
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:30,847
I shared my fears
with my brother, Amos.

513
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,893
I'm afraid now that was a mistake.

514
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:36,047
Your brother has a temper?

515
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:38,871
It's been a struggle for him.

516
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:41,218
Did he get upset when
you talked about Levi?

517
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:46,682
- I told him how close we'd been.
- Sexually?

518
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,178
Levi and I, we didn't do that.

519
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,789
But I don't think Amos believed me.

520
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,112
About two months ago,

521
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:01,730
he left for the day.
Said he had some business to do.

522
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:04,748
- Do you think he was going after Levi?
- I'm not sure.

523
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:06,602
But shortly after that,

524
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,077
Amos told me that

525
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,666
I should try to forget about Levi.

526
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,456
That he might never come back.

527
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,629
And then when I didn't hear
from Levi again, I just...

528
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,283
It's okay.

529
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,552
I love my brother.

530
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:27,007
I hate to suspect him
of something so awful.

531
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:29,804
But I had to tell someone.

532
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:41,382
Why are there two massive train wheels
blocking the loading dock?

533
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:43,682
They're filled with dried,
mangled body bits and bones.

534
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,380
Dr. Brennan wants me to examine
them for defensive wounds.

535
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:48,489
Only she didn't ask 
to bring in the whole train.

536
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:49,954
We may have cause of death.

537
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,894
Karen Lin's apartment is on
the fourth floor of the building.

538
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,776
Underneath the balcony
in the alley is a Dumpster.

539
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,348
I swabbed the perimortem fractures
on the victim's skull.

540
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:00,924
I found a powder coating

541
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,962
similar to the type used
on industrial-strength Dumpsters.

542
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:07,148
I identified the perimortem ring
fracture on the base of the skull

543
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,932
as well as the corresponding damage
on the top of the spinal column.

544
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,898
Those injuries indicate that the victim
fell from Karen Lin's balcony

545
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,987
and then landed headfirst
into the lid of the Dumpster,

546
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:18,976
thereby severing his spine.

547
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:21,318
FBI techs confirm
that the Dumpster has

548
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,779
a dent consistent with
our scenario, as well as

549
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,487
residue of dried blood on the steel,
which matches Levi Yoder.

550
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:30,177
Anything linking the assault
to Karen Lin or her boyfriend?

551
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,620
That's why I should start digging
the remains out of the train wheels.

552
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,475
Levi abandoned my sister
after courting her.

553
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,632
What kind of brother would I be
if I didn't try to intercede?

554
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,015
I told him his rumspringa was over.

555
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,180
That it was time to do the right thing
and come home to Sarah.

556
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:50,389
That's it?

557
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:53,099
He said that there was something
pulling him away.

558
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,769
He felt possessed.

559
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:58,738
- Music?
- How could he leave my sister

560
00:30:58,863 --> 00:31:00,566
for something so frivolous?

561
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,955
You wanted to hit him.

562
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,598
I shook him.

563
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:10,604
I grabbed him

564
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,703
and I shook him and it was shameful.

565
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:16,828
I apologized.

566
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,751
Then he tried to explain.

567
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,196
He played something.

568
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:24,347
I never heard anything like it.

569
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:26,383
It was called "Clair de Lune."

570
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,252
And it sounded like a...

571
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:30,688
Sunrise.

572
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:35,809
Something that beautiful, I have
to believe that it came from God.

573
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,728
- That's not what your religion says.
- I cannot pretend to know

574
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:41,600
what the Lord has planned
for any of us.

575
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,119
That's the greatest sin.

576
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,384
Speaking for God.

577
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:50,206
I told Levi that I would make sure
that Sarah was looked after.

578
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:51,997
And that's it?

579
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:02,178
He was going to be my brother.

580
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,431
I hugged him.

581
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:09,009
And then I left.

582
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,503
I didn't mean what I said.

583
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,067
I know you care.

584
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,369
It's okay.

585
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,132
I handled things badly, I guess.

586
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,663
- Can I sit?
- I think so.

587
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,538
Look, Michelle, I...

588
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,717
This is new to me, too.

589
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,177
I'm sorry if we got off
on the wrong foot.

590
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,928
My dad always wanted me
to be independent.

591
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,892
To think for myself, you know?

592
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:01,581
And you talked to him about boys?

593
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:04,493
Are you kidding?
How weird would that be?

594
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,984
- Did you talk to your dad about boys?
- God, no.

595
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:09,586
My mom told him to go bowling.

596
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,281
She knew he'd have a meltdown.
My dad still thinks I'm a...

597
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,004
His little girl.

598
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:19,624
I didn't know.
Never had a mom.

599
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,470
So, you and Perry...?

600
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,136
He wants to, but he's not
pressuring me or anything.

601
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:32,195
But I'm scared.

602
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,094
Is that weird?

603
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,269
I mean, Iit's just sex, right?
It's a a over the TV and everywhere.

604
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,433
There's no such thing as just sex.

605
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:40,741
Every time,

606
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,993
you give a bit of yourself
to the person you're with.

607
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,364
It's okay to wait.
As long as you want.

608
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,942
- But I don't want to lose Perry.
- If he doesn't understand how you feel,

609
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,058
he doesn't deserve you.

610
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:04,786
I wanted to talk to you.

611
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:06,438
I really did.

612
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,105
But I just didn't want you
to be disappointed in me.

613
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:15,868
That's what I was afraid of, too.

614
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,320
Have you found anything pertinent
on the bones in the wheels?

615
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:29,570
I'm reassembling the
fragments from the right foot,

616
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,882
but the left arm
and hand are all there.

617
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,449
The fractures on these phalanges,

618
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,910
there's barely discernible
rounding along the edges.

619
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,678
The fractures occurred
before Levi was killed.

620
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:48,275
Whatever injured him was most likely
a flat object with a straight edge.

621
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:52,135
How much force would it
take to do something like that?

622
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,678
About 120 pounds per square inch.

623
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:06,437
The keyboard lid
could've exerted that much force.

624
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:10,107
It could've happened when he was
practicing.

625
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:12,143
So, someone breaks
a piano player's hand

626
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,248
a few days before his big audition.

627
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,729
There was only one place
available at the conservatory.

628
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:20,263
Tony was already in, but Levi
was competing with Karen for the spot.

629
00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:23,577
Which means that she had motive
to try to sabotage his audition.

630
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,845
She accidentally injures him,

631
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,417
hoping that he'll
slink back to Amish Country.

632
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,461
When that doesn't work,
she kills him.

633
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:32,726
In fact, it's not conjecture.

634
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:46,810
Agents have picked up Karen Lin
and are bringing her to the FBI.

635
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:50,081
- I'll pack everything up.
- I'll go get the car.

636
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,074
<i>Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.</i>

637
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,823
Perry?
Michelle's boyfriend?

638
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,785
Michelle's with Cam.
She told me to wait here.

639
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,536
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

640
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:06,110
FBI?

641
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:08,916
Michelle's family to me.
I'm her number one uncle.

642
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:10,542
She didn't mention...

643
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,127
I'm also a trained sniper.

644
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,906
Listen, all right.

645
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:18,475
You're a red-blooded, young man,

646
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,692
and Michelle is,

647
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,826
you know, an attractive young girl.

648
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,216
I assume that you...

649
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:25,557
What?

650
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:31,211
Because Michelle deserves
your respect. You understand?

651
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,170
I do respect her.

652
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:35,058
We were going to a movie tonight.

653
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,154
And if you behave any way less
than a gentleman, I'll find you.

654
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:43,573
I think we understand
each other, right?

655
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:48,083
We were just talking about
what you were doing tonight.

656
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,916
- We're going to the movies.
- Just a movie.

657
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,217
That's all.

658
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,963
You've met Perry,

659
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,673
{\- Michelle's boyfriend.
- } Nice to see you again.

660
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,968
I heard about Princeton.
You have a very bright future ahead.

661
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:02,513
I hope so.

662
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,034
Me, too.
You have fun tonight, okay?

663
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,485
Sniper.
Good man.

664
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,160
- You were both competing for a spot.
- I wasn't.

665
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:29,315
My grandfather used to be a dean,

666
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,930
and I've been taking private
lessons there since I was six.

667
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,588
My admission had nothing
to do with the audition process.

668
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,786
You were the only pianist.

669
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:40,841
Because none of the other applicants
were good enough to get in this year.

670
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,719
Sure Levi would've gotten in.
I mean, he was better than everyone.

671
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,970
Better than me.

672
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:46,324
Did you see Levi

673
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,993
at the conservatory the day before he
disappeared when his hand got smashed?

674
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,561
His hand?
I have no idea wh...

675
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,498
Someone crushed his hand.
Didn't want him to audition.

676
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:58,108
He died at your apartment.
You were the last person to see him.

677
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,351
This is crazy!

678
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,695
He wasn't even there
the last time that I went.

679
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,364
His stuff was there,
but his money was gone.

680
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,741
How do you know that?

681
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,828
Levi didn't trust banks,
and I had this old rolltop desk

682
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,922
with a secret drawer in it and that's
where he keptit and it was gone.

683
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:14,791
His stuff was still there?

684
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,240
I figured that if
his father made him come home,

685
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:20,709
then he wanted to leave everything
from this life behind.

686
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,091
Guaranteeing you a place
at the conservatory.

687
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,927
I was trying to help him!

688
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,054
I picked his audition piece.

689
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,248
I could never hurt Levi.
I loved him.

690
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,058
You loved him?
Did he know that?

691
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,455
Right, maybe he just
liked him out of the way.

692
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,531
Tony wasn't even around the
weekend that Levi disappeared.

693
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:39,441
You can ask his parents.
He was at his grandma's funeral.

694
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:43,695
I'm not gonna say anything else.
I don't have to.

695
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,094
FBI techs found a grand piano
at the conservatory

696
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:53,732
with bits of dried flesh and
blood inside the keyboard lid.

697
00:38:53,857 --> 00:38:56,785
- What about the fingerprints?
- There were some partials on the lid

698
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,544
directly above the spot where
Levi's left hand was broken.

699
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,508
We still have Karen Lin in custody.

700
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,476
We can get her prints
for comparison.

701
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:05,342
Don't need to,
we already have a match.

702
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,986
The prints are Levi's.

703
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,811
Levi broke his own hand?

704
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:11,306
- That's what the evidence says.
- Thanks.

705
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:16,051
Levi broke his own hand?
It's not logical.

706
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:18,310
If Levi decided to move back
to his family,

707
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:21,399
he wanted to remove all temptation,
so he wouldn't change his mind.

708
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,434
You seriously think that he was
choosing his religion over his music?

709
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,009
Or maybe it was just
over this girl, Sarah.

710
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,157
- Either way it makes sense.
- It doesn't!

711
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:32,145
To destroy a gift like that
for a girl or...

712
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:34,170
religion, it's awful.

713
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,470
And it still doesn't
give us a killer.

714
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:39,353
Wait a minute.

715
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:42,587
Money, what about the money?
What if this was all about ?

716
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:44,442
- What money?
- The money.

717
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,008
Levi's cash we never found.

718
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,250
The cash and that fake gold medal
that Karen supposedly gave him.

719
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,596
- Did that ever show up?
- Not yet.

720
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,200
The cash. What if this was all
about the money? Come on.

721
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:00,204
It was a petty thief.

722
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:02,983
We arrested him in Baltimore.
Several other resident

723
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,444
in Karen Lin's building
reported missing items

724
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,315
right around the time
that Levi died.

725
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,567
Jewelry, silverware, cash.

726
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,079
It was just a robbery.

727
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,440
Well, the thief was
some stupid kid who

728
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:17,334
hocked a bunch of stolen items
about a month ago.

729
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,826
He also tried
pawning the gold medal.

730
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:27,603
He didn't know it was fake.

731
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:37,629
The kid said that's what Levi was
fighting for when he fell.

732
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,745
Levi was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

733
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:53,667
Guess that will certainly justify

734
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,844
his parents removing themselves
from the world.

735
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,519
Can't blame them now.

736
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,657
But what Levi discovered...

737
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,571
the gift he had...

738
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:07,964
would their God really want
them to deny their son that?

739
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,541
Levi planned to return.

740
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,709
We thought it was important
that you knew that.

741
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:28,009
He considered life
outside the community,

742
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,113
he wanted to come home.

743
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,240
We brought you something.

744
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:37,285
I'm sorry,

745
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,912
but we can't accept.

746
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,487
In this case,
I think God will understand.

747
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,149
If you want to get
into the conservatory,

748
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:47,688
you have to learn to perform.

749
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:49,431
- You're amazing!
- Our son.

750
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:02,248
It's so beautiful.

751
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:09,097
