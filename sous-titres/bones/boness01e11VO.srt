1
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,100
I'm telling you,
this... this is a bad idea.

2
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,268
I heard there's an 80-foot tall
black walnut tree back here.

3
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:13,520
We can get 15 grand for one tree.

4
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,439
This is government property.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,546
The road said "closed"
in big red letters.

6
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:23,689
So, we get in, we get the wood,
we get out.

7
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,483
Is this it?

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,387
What are you, a moron?

9
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:29,111
This tree is coniferous.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,574
Carnivorous? What?

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,104
It eats meat?

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,265
No, numb nuts.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,533
Needles and cones.

14
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,562
Those don't look like cones to me.

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,250
Oh my god!

16
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,108
How could you have hired him?

17
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,745
- Your father was the best candidate.
- Are you sure?

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,224
Dad is an excellent liar.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,018
He's an excellent science teacher.

20
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,392
- I called the school where he taught...
- 15 years ago.

21
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,638
And after 15 years,
they still remember him.

22
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,781
They named their lab after your dad.

23
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:09,457
- I thought you'd be pleased.
- Well, you were incorrect.

24
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:12,013
- Is there a probation period?
- Yes.

25
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,870
Well, what would please me
is if you terminated him

26
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:16,472
at the end of that time.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,054
OK, kids, everybody
put on their goggles.

28
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:20,955
Hello?

29
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:22,465
Hi, honey.

30
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,493
Okay, ready...

31
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,257
aim, fire.

32
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,676
- The light refracted.
- Yeah, now why is the light visible?

33
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,053
Because the Jell-O molecules
are close together.

34
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,159
- Yeah, but that's not magic, that's...
- Max K, the Science Way.

35
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,144
Science Squad,

36
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:47,189
meet my daughter, the world
famous anthropologist,

37
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:50,611
- I taught her everything she knows.
- Actually, I went to college.

38
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,236
I have multiple degrees.

39
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:55,239
Well, tell the kids a little
something about refraction.

40
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,052
Snell's Law states that
the angle of incidence

41
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,994
is related to the angle
of refraction,

42
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,912
where V equals the wave velocities

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,852
through the respective media
and N equals...

44
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,213
Nifty. That's very nifty.

45
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:09,354
But what was your favorite
example when you were a kid?

46
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,174
Rainbows.

47
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,504
Rainbows. I love rainbows.

48
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:16,792
Yeah, rainbows.

49
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,138
She used to make me drive her
all the way across town,

50
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:22,058
to the other side of the rainbow
because she didn't believe that

51
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,357
light came out of the bac
of a raindrop.

52
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:25,686
Yeah.

53
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,356
So, are there any questions
for our scientist?

54
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,279
- Me, me, me.
- I have to go examine

55
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:35,262
the frontal bone
of a dead person's skull.

56
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,138
Maybe another time, kids.

57
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,095
Gee, dead person's skull.

58
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:41,336
Ain't that a kick in the head.

59
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,595
Most likely a wind
deposited them there.

60
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:53,506
That seems most likely.

61
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,552
The bones didn't come
from the ground,

62
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,986
they didn't come from
the sky, that leaves the wind.

63
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,809
People over there need to clear out.

64
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,223
Those people over there
are looking for the rest of that.

65
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,106
They are right in the middle of
the masked booby migration path.

66
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,740
Masked booby?You're kidding.

67
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:09,526
The Department of Fish
and Wildlife does not kid.

68
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,315
You just have to give me a minutes,

69
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,885
and you can have your boobies
all to yourself.

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,516
What do we got?

71
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,961
This one's a portion of the sacrum.

72
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,577
Definitely human.
There's char marks.

73
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:21,827
Oh, God.

74
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,967
You know I hate when you
sniff and smell dead things.

75
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,202
Fresh burn.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,499
Days or weeks rather than months.

77
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,334
- I found a hyoid.
- He found a hyoid.

78
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,676
Dead guy's hyoid.

79
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:36,172
"Guy" as in the sexually nonspecific
urban colloquialism

80
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:39,552
or in reference to the gender normally
associated with a penis, Mr. Bray?

81
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,522
The penis.

82
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,557
Similar char marks.

83
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,475
Any fires in the last couple weeks?

84
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,428
- No.
- The body of the hyoid is fractured.

85
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,094
- Strangulation.
- This man was murdered.

86
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,983
We'll need to search
this entire area.

87
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:58,417
According to my scientists,
your boobies are out of luck.

88
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,868
Bones - Season 04 Episode 11
"The Bone that blew"

89
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,621
Synchro: ShalimarFox

90
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,518
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

91
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,610
Hey, good afternoon, Agent Booth.

92
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,922
Wish I could stay and chat,
but I gotta go pick up

93
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,783
my new employment ID.

94
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:44,328
- Guns of steel.
- You work here now? Max?

95
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:46,423
You work here now?

96
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:48,787
I can still make out the accelerant
pour pattern victim

97
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,497
must have been doused postmortem.

98
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:53,125
I'll have Hodgins run it
through the mass spec.

99
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,878
- Your dad works here now?
- Not my idea.

100
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,379
She wants me to fire him.

101
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,516
- Why?
- This is a crime lab.

102
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,804
My father is a bank robber
and an accused murderer.

103
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:05,425
Booth's killed more people
than Max has and he works here.

104
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,962
Don't bring that up.

105
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,479
In fact, Dr. Brennan,
you've also killed a person.

106
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,771
And I'll point out,
Max was never convicted.

107
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,271
So, in the eyes of the law,
he's never killed anyone.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,790
- Why are you defending him?
- Why aren't you?

109
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,069
He is your father.

110
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,904
Whose sperm hit whose egg
shouldn't determine who works here.

111
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,531
He's showing kids
arnd the museum. What can it hurt?

112
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:27,284
Let's get to work, please.

113
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,040
Nothing definitive
on cause of death.

114
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,767
We don't have a lot to work with.

115
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,332
I did find an anomaly.
The victim suffered a

116
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:41,108
compression fracture sometime between
3 and 6 months prior to his death.

117
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,530
- Why is that an anomaly?
- Compression fractures

118
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,679
are normally associated
with osteoporosis, but

119
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,765
but the sacral vertebrae haven't
even undergone final fusing.

120
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:51,892
Not even 30 years old.

121
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:54,763
The fracture must have been
the result of trauma.

122
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,481
A motor vehicle accident,
parachute jumping.

123
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,538
It would have been very painful.

124
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:02,235
20-something with a bad back.
You gotta give me something here

125
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,445
more to go on.

126
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,172
I would love to give you more,
but that would involve fantasy,

127
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:07,932
which would be futile.

128
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,702
Excellent. I'll check my e-mail.

129
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,074
It's your lucky day, Booth.
We ran the victim's bone marrow.

130
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,800
We got a hit on
the Armed Forces DNA Registry.

131
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,485
Here's your guy.

132
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,925
- Calvin Warren.
- Force Recon.

133
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,038
Marine Corps Special Ops,
toughest of the tough.

134
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:26,747
The kind that parachute out of airplanes
and get vertebral compression fractures?

135
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,887
You are a genius, okay?

136
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,931
Did the Marine Corps say
where this guy got to?

137
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,101
They don't know. Warren was honorably
discharged three years ago.

138
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,740
Marines tried to track him down,
see if he wanted to re-up,

139
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,820
checked his credit cards
and bank accounts,

140
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,774
- he's totally off the grid.
- Would his back

141
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,491
be bad enough to medicate?

142
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,306
- Yes.
- Fine, I'll just order a search

143
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,010
of the controlled substance database,
I'll see if I can get an address.

144
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,116
You guys can go back
to your bone play.

145
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:58,525
Can you believe how light
this thing is?

146
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,627
I'd say six grams.

147
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,569
No way these bones were burned
in an ordinary wood fire.

148
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,482
A wood fire burns
at 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

149
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,718
Human flesh needs 1,400 to ignite.

150
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,249
Why do you know that?

151
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,846
My uncle is a funeral director.

152
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,098
Crematorium will incinerate
a grown man down

153
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,225
- to 5 or 6 pounds.
- These weren't cremated.

154
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,765
The bones would be drier,
the flesh would be completely gone.

155
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,315
That the burn was hotter than
wood fire and cooler than a crematorium.

156
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,025
That's a thousand-degree range.

157
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,935
I may be able
to I.D. the accelerant.

158
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,321
I think we need a broader
picture of the burn conditions.

159
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,899
How are you gonna do that?

160
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,786
We could experiment.

161
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,540
Is that what you're after here?

162
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,921
You'll recall I mostly disapproved
of your experiments with Dr. Addy.

163
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,672
You didn't disapprove the results.

164
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,025
You have me there, Dr. Hodgins.

165
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,322
I can't tell if we're doing
an experiment or not.

166
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:53,243
Not.

167
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,811
See, I... I don't see
what the problem is.

168
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:01,730
It's a crime lab.
You're a convicted felon.

169
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,510
Your presence taints the evidence.

170
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,651
But I'm not gonna be
around any evidence.

171
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,957
Basically, I'm just gonna be
firing lasers through stuff.

172
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh, look, there's the doc

173
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,661
that told the jury that
I was a sociopath. Hey.

174
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,704
Please, sit down, Doc. How are you?

175
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,164
Likeable sociopath.

176
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:23,210
So, Cam wants
Hodgins to design an experiment

177
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,295
to figure out how hot a fire was.

178
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,714
Yeah. How hot a fire was
that burned a body.

179
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,896
- What body?
- The bones in the tree-murder victim.

180
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,637
Which is a crime we cannot discuss.

181
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,143
Yeah, but I know exactly
how that experiment should go.

182
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,893
You aren't adequately credentialed
to design an experiment, Dad.

183
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,604
Can I ask what's really going on
between you?

184
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,186
Tempy doesn't want me
working at the Jeffersonian.

185
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,124
Why?

186
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:48,387
It's a conflict of interest.

187
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,007
We catch criminals,
my dad is a criminal.

188
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,338
- That would be valid...
- Thank you.

189
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,885
... if it were your real reason,
but it's not.

190
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,788
- Yeah, yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

191
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,040
- Yeah, yes, it is.
- No, no.

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,989
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

193
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,993
No and this can't be resolved

194
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:10,340
between you until you confront
the real reason behind your feeling.

195
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,883
What do you say it is?

196
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,849
Well, at the time

197
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,803
you abandoned your daughter
15 years ago, you were a well-regarded

198
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,789
science teacher. Now...

199
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,482
here you are basically
in the same situation.

200
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,729
And subconsciously,
she doesn't want to risk

201
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,732
feeling that sense of abandonment
and bereavement again.

202
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,261
That is such a load of crap.

203
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,232
You are far too rational for that.

204
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,399
Exactly.

205
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,036
FBI got a hit off the controlled
substances database.

206
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:44,914
I just got off the phone with Booth.

207
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,750
Cal Warren had a prescription
for Oxycodone

208
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,298
written by a Dr. Antonia Ezralow,
office in Chevy Chase.

209
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,325
Could she provide an address?

210
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,053
Dr. Ezralow has never
heard of Calvin Warren.

211
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,905
Plus, she's a dermatologist.

212
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,604
Very rarely writes prescriptions
for pain medication.

213
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,227
So he probably stole
her prescription pad.

214
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,140
Here's his MySpace page,
and I have to say

215
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,440
he doesn't look much
like a drug dealer.

216
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,214
What a waste.

217
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,986
Tall, dark, handsome and dead.

218
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:14,905
Too bad he's blocking his address.

219
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,322
Well, let's see.

220
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,617
This is the house across the street.

221
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,203
Now, if I were
a house number, I'd be

222
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:22,942
right about here.

223
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,624
I crop it so all we got
is the reflection.

224
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,604
Reverse and resize.

225
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,190
Tweak the contrast, find some edges.

226
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,799
"3-2-9-4."

227
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:37,277
So he's across the street
from 3294, but what street?

228
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:41,723
Well, 1880-ish architecture,
square bay front.

229
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,679
Let's assume the D.C. area.

230
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,105
Check out the lamppost.

231
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,019
Yeah. It places us in one of the two
where they still use those

232
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,280
cast iron modified bishop's crook
street lamps.

233
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,236
For an artist,
you're a good detective.

234
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,308
I think you just insulted me.

235
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,660
Now, I do a search for 3294

236
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:04,538
in those two zip codes,
and I come up with...

237
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,378
Mad skills, babe.

238
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,656
The landlord said that Cal Warren
worked crazy hours,

239
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,426
you know, he kept to himself.

240
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:20,905
Every time the landlord asked him,
what he did for a living,

241
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,585
- he always dodged the question.
- Maybe he liked his privacy.

242
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,143
What? So much that he
pays his rent in cash?

243
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:30,208
I don't know, Bones,
something is weird. It's not right.

244
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,027
There's no letters,

245
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:35,110
no photographs, not even a bill.

246
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,280
So did you persuade Cam to fire Max?

247
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,616
You think my dad should be
allowed to work at the Jeffersonian?

248
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,202
What, you know, she's just,
trying to do you a favor.

249
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:47,414
- Well, I didn't ask for a favor.
- Sometimes you don't need to ask.

250
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,135
Got a passport.

251
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,498
This guy's been to countries
I haven't even heard of.

252
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,090
What is this?

253
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,430
I don't know.

254
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,055
It's something you're familiar with?

255
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,515
Foreign currency, lots of it.

256
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,792
Booth found this in tall,
dark and handsome's drawer.

257
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,050
It's an RF proximity card.

258
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,598
And that would be...?

259
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:18,093
Basically, it's a
super fancy key card.

260
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:22,424
You wave the card in front of the reader
it logs your infoand the door opens.

261
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,719
Any way to figure out
what door it opens?

262
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,747
Well, if the info on the card
isn't too heavily encrypted.

263
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,958
I heard you tried to get Hodgins
interested in doing an experiment.

264
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:34,086
Let's just say I planted the seed.

265
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,788
- What? CIA? NSA?
- No.

266
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:42,808
Dupont Circle.

267
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,024
Special Agent Booth, FBI.

268
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,345
Welcome to the Woodbury School.

269
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,235
How are you?
What's with all the security?

270
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,394
It's precautionary. Our student body
includes chdren of diplomats,

271
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,539
heads of state, CEOs.

272
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:28,044
- How old is your child?
- Parker? He's seven.

273
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:31,017
- Has he been evaluated?
- He does just fine.

274
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,292
Most applicant families engage
an educational consultant.

275
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,445
It's not a requirement,
of course, but...

276
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,988
Mr. Donnegan, I think you got this
l wrong.

277
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,508
I know it seems crazy,
but given the demand,

278
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,403
we can only accept the
most qualified applicants.

279
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,297
Parker's a great kid.

280
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:49,619
The problem is keeping him
that way, isn't it?

281
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,165
68% of our students matriculate
to Ivy League universities.

282
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,767
And it's not because of
our electron microscope or AP classes.

283
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,546
It's because of our Honor Code.

284
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,632
Any violation results
in immediate dismissal.

285
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,218
Why don't I get you
an admissions packet?

286
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,730
Actually, I'm...

287
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,806
I'm here because of
a murder investigation.

288
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:13,185
- I'm sorry?
- One of your parking access cards

289
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,480
was found in the apartment
of a victim, Cal Warren.

290
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:20,692
He's not a parent or an employee.
I would know the name.

291
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:24,071
- Maybe we can check your computer.
- Of course.

292
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,082
No one is issued a key card
without security clearance.

293
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:29,553
Thanks.

294
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:32,916
One of our fathers actually implemented
the security system.

295
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:35,576
He's deputy director of the CIA.

296
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,260
Really?

297
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,830
There he is, Calvin Warren.

298
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,883
Did he happen to work for the CIA?

299
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,385
No, actually,
he works for the president.

300
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,845
Of the United States?

301
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,504
Parents Association.

302
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,725
As a nanny.

303
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,089
A nanny?

304
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,402
28 grand a year.

305
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,429
I didn't pay that much
for 4 years of college.

306
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:09,221
If you think it's so ridiculous,
why did you save the application?

307
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,202
I didn't save it. I just didn't have
a chance to throw it out yet.

308
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,989
You don't have to be embarrassed.

309
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,706
It's perfectly normal
to want the best for Parker.

310
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,459
Public school was good enough for me,
it's good enough for my kid.

311
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,336
Of course it is. Probably.

312
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,506
What's that supposed to mean?

313
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,798
Parker is a bright,
engaged little boy.

314
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,555
I'm sure he'll do fine
in a large classroom.

315
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,848
- I did.
- Except...

316
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,298
- Except what?
- Your dad was a science teacher.

317
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:38,603
You're a scientist.

318
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,443
Yes, my education was
enriched at home.

319
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,976
That's what I got to do.
Enrich Parker at home.

320
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:50,004
In what academics
are you qualified to offer enrichment?

321
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:51,652
Well...

322
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,762
Ethe could you grab my bag, please?

323
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,341
I am on my way to the
Children First board meeting.

324
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,551
Thank you.

325
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,511
Wexler has the groomer at three.

326
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,556
- Excuse me. Elisbeth King?
- Yes?

327
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:15,932
We're the FBI.

328
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,518
Do you know a Mr. Calvin Warren?

329
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:20,228
He was my nanny.

330
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,562
- What happened?
- That's what we're investigating.

331
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,818
Cal dropped off the face
of the earth on Sunday.

332
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,154
He was an excellent nanny.

333
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:32,129
Well, how is it that
an ex-Special Ops guy

334
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:33,707
becomes a nanny?

335
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,785
My husband, Richard,
handles defense contracts.

336
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,628
The Middle East, South America.

337
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:40,546
There were kidnap threats
a couple years ago, he was concerned.

338
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,334
He offered Cal $2,500 a week.

339
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:44,461
That's very good pay for

340
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:45,822
a babysitter.

341
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,832
Cal was more like a bodyguard.

342
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,494
That's what got him killed?

343
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,217
Someone after my children?

344
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,721
Could we speak to your children?

345
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,113
Of course.

346
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,859
Okay, so what time on Sunday
did you last see Cal?

347
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,362
- Why?
- Because it's pertinent

348
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,857
to our investigation.

349
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,361
- Wei shen me ta wen zhe ge wen ti?
- Bu zhi dao.

350
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,274
- What?
- Mandarin Chinese.

351
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,618
My father says the Chinese will
run the planet in ten years.

352
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,605
He figures it'll be useful.

353
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,954
- That's very smart.
- Okay, well, here, today,

354
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,622
okay, I run the world.

355
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,166
Bun tyen-shung duh ee-dway ro.

356
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,843
He just called you a stupid,
inbred stack of meat.

357
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,099
Really?

358
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,049
I'm sorry, do you ha
something to say to me?

359
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,875
Dui bu qi. Xie xie.

360
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,014
He, he apologized.

361
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,892
Good. So, you want to tell me
what happened on Sunday?

362
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,814
Well, Cal dropped me off at
the algebra tutor around 8:00,

363
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,690
then took Lexie
to check out a new horse.

364
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,942
In the afternoon, you had
a game against All Saints.

365
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,104
Lacrosse. I got this.

366
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,398
Let's see.

367
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,739
And Cal took you
to the emergency room?

368
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,127
No. He knew one of the moms
was a doctor, so

369
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,703
he figured she'd do a better job.

370
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,663
Looks like the work
of a plastic surgeon.

371
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,126
No, dermatologist.

372
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,457
Dr. Ezralow.

373
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:06,651
Very competent.

374
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,854
The Royce boy was stitched up
by the same doctor

375
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:14,258
who said she didn't know Cal Warren.

376
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,428
I'm having her
brought in for questioning.

377
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,763
You think those kids
are better off than Parker?

378
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:20,056
Of course they are.

379
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,827
They have every advantage:
a wonderful school,

380
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,437
a successful father, mother
committed to charity work.

381
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,469
I spend more time with my houseplants
than they do with their kids.

382
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,657
Children of privilege have
always been raised by staff.

383
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:35,229
It's how the upper one percent
stays the upper one percent.

384
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:39,689
Assuming quality education
and adequate supervision,

385
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,370
parents are actually rather
irrelevant beyond a certain age.

386
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,736
- You're kidding me.
- Look at this.

387
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:47,917
They start Latin in third grade.
That's fantastic.

388
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,645
No. You know what's more important
than academic enrichment?

389
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,387
A loving environment.
You ask anyone.

390
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:56,009
Parker is a wonderful child, Booth.
You shouldn't feel inadequate.

391
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,219
I'm perfectly
capable of raising my own kid.

392
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,639
- You're being defensive.
- I am not.

393
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,401
It's because
you only have one child.

394
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,727
When you procreate in multiples,
there's less pressure.

395
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,521
Thank you. I feel much better.

396
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,701
This way.

397
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,382
Have a seat.

398
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:18,210
I apologize, Agent Booth.

399
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:21,522
When you called and asked
if I knew a Calvin Warren,

400
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,662
I just didn't put it together
with the King's nanny.

401
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,897
- So you did know him?
- Yes. But just as Cal.

402
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:30,418
My son is on the same
lacrosse team as the King boy.

403
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,279
Did you have
any more dealings with him?

404
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,910
I'm afraid not.

405
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,759
Actually, no, that's not true.
I'm sorry, again.

406
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,539
Calvin came along with us one time

407
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,846
when I took the,
King children up for a ride.

408
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:44,652
- A ride?
- I'm a pilot.

409
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:46,518
I own a Senecaive.

410
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,533
Cal got sick, and, well,

411
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,480
the boys thought that was hilarious.

412
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,536
You wouldn't happen
to know how Cal Warren

413
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,567
got a prescription
for painkillers from you?

414
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,072
Isn't that obvious?

415
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:00,570
That's why he brought Royce King
to me to be stitched up.

416
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:03,491
To steal my prescription pad.

417
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,079
I have no further questions,
so, thanks for coming in.

418
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,835
I feel stupid for not being able
to put the face with the name.

419
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,049
- I'm so sorry for wasting your time.
- No worries. Have a nice day.

420
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:22,025
So you know that thing where you insist
that all information goes through you?

421
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,415
Yes, and I'm afraid I'm
immovable on the subject.

422
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,495
And you send out little e-mails
summarizing the case so far?

423
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,415
Yes, plus I check those e-mails
to see if they've been opened.

424
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,705
- That's a very good system.
- Thank you.

425
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,524
Because if you weren't checking,
I probably never would have read

426
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,305
the e-mail that said Booth
questioned a flying dermatologist.

427
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,570
I hope you're not trying
to get some free lotion.

428
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,225
I ran the accelerant sample
through the GC mass spec.

429
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,564
There were traces
of tetra-ethyl lead.

430
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,608
- Have we changed the subject?
- No,

431
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,589
if you hadn't been
so anal about the e-mails,

432
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,710
I never would've known that I discovered
something that wasn't merely interesting

433
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,415
but vital to the investigation.

434
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,170
Which is tetra ethyl lead?

435
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,930
Tetra-ethyl lead was a common
antiknock additive in gasoline

436
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,968
that went out with catalytic
converters and unleaded gas.

437
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,333
Does the flying dermatologist
drive a vintage car?

438
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,265
Maybe. But for sure, the flying
dermatologist flies a plane.

439
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:09,017
Aviation gas?

440
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,270
The victim's remains were
incinerated by aviation gas.

441
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,155
I'll let Booth know.

442
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:17,767
Hopefully, she hasn't flown the coop
while you were getting to the point.

443
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,111
I was just trying to be nice.

444
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,977
- You lied to me.
- Yes.

445
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,371
I wrote Cal a prescription
for painkillers.

446
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:32,227
I shouldn't have.

447
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,828
- That's the truth.
- Yeah, but not this time, Doc.

448
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,075
Now that I know that
you're a world-class liar,

449
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,596
I came just a little bit
more prepared this time.

450
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:43,195
Take a look at that there.

451
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,802
My flight logs...

452
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,971
- for the past year.
- Yeah.

453
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,641
Oh, looky here, this one here.

454
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,945
Right here.

455
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,312
Yes, I took Cal flying a few times.

456
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,835
Without the kids?

457
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,380
This one here is my favorite.

458
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:01,660
This particular flight to New York.

459
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,789
You were gone the whole weekend.

460
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,598
All right.

461
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,735
All right, I'll tell you
what you want to know.

462
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,293
No, my husband didn't know I was
having an affair with the Kings'manny.

463
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,421
Would I have killed Cal to
prevent him from finding out?

464
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,007
No, I would not.

465
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:24,972
Why?

466
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,465
Because my husband doesn't
give a damn who I boff.

467
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,225
Do I know anyone else
who might wish Cal ill?

468
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,872
Yes.

469
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,311
Richard King.

470
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,690
Don't stop, this is great.
Keep going.

471
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,108
Cal told me to sell a stock.

472
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:45,205
He said he had some insider knowledge
that, this company was in trouble.

473
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,282
I took the tip, made a killing.

474
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,575
That's when I flew him to
New York to say thank you.

475
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,359
And he said "you're
welcome" all weekend.

476
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,208
What's this have to
do with Richard King?

477
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:01,212
It was Richard King's company.

478
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,668
- How's that look, Max?
- Good, looks good.

479
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,520
Never thought I'd be
doing another experiment.

480
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,327
Dad, what are you doing in here?

481
00:23:16,452 --> 00:23:18,396
Max had a great idea
for an experiment.

482
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,665
Dad, you said you
wouldn't touch evidence.

483
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,780
He's been very careful not to
touch the evidence.

484
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,779
You know, your old man, he reminded
me why I got into science.

485
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:28,855
- To catch murderers?
- No.

486
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,950
To figure stuff out in amusing ways.

487
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,015
The bones were incinerated
by aviation fuel.

488
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,914
They just need to know, uh, how
strong the wind was basic.

489
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,435
So, figure out how big
a wind blew the bones...

490
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,991
Check the weather charts.

491
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,827
Basic, that's very basic.

492
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,299
But this is the same wind tunnel you
helped me build for the science fair.

493
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,134
Right, a basic wind tunnel, honey.

494
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:50,219
You won first prize.

495
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:53,264
I made casts that weigh the same
as the bones we found in that tree.

496
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,974
All right, now...

497
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,027
we put the skull cast
into the wind tunnel

498
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:00,396
since that
was the largest artifact on the tree.

499
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,389
I didn't touch anything.

500
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:08,529
The bone begins to move at wind
speeds of 42 miles per hour.

501
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,657
Not enough net force to
achieve aerodynamic lift.

502
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,701
But crank it to 69...

503
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:23,302
I checked the National Weather Service.
There were windstorms

504
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,620
in that area last week.

505
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:28,216
A strong nor'easter hit 71
miles per hour late last Tuesday.

506
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,877
That gives us a 48-hour window
for Calvin Warren's murder.

507
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,804
We still don't know where he was
killed or where the body was dumped.

508
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,454
- Wait a minute, I can figure that out.
- Dad, you're fired.

509
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,342
What?

510
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:42,230
The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

511
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,065
The NOAA tracks surface conditions.

512
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,315
We can calculate where the bones started
out if we can plot approximate mass

513
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,510
and reverse the path
of that nor'easterly.

514
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:53,706
The heavier remains will still
be near the original dump site.

515
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:58,162
- You see, I'm helping.
- Oh, most definitely is helping.

516
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,277
I'm sorry, Dad, but you're fired.

517
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,943
You took part
in a forensic experiment.

518
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,795
You said you wouldn't, but
you did, so now you're fired.

519
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,953
He didn't touch any of the evidence.

520
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:09,238
It's okay, kid.

521
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:11,007
Never mind.

522
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,431
Nice assist, Mick.

523
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,335
Now take him out quick.

524
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,237
No, Mick!

525
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,644
Pass it! Pass it!

526
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,606
Hi, Alexa. How are you?

527
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,255
Shouldn't you be like, studying algebra,
Chinese or solving the world's problems?

528
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,820
I'm cheering for Royce.

529
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:32,673
He's the goalie.

530
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:36,737
I watch football.
It's a better sport. It's American.

531
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,505
Lacrosse was invented
by the American Indian.

532
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,095
You can't get much
more American than that.

533
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:46,669
- Oh, God, what now?
- I'm thinking about

534
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:48,254
this whole insider trading thing.

535
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,729
I told you everything.

536
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,824
I'm thinking Cal
gives you a tip on a stock,

537
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,764
you sell it,
you make $2 million,$3 million,

538
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:55,435
it raises questions in my mind.

539
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,557
How did Richard King find out
that Cal spilled insider knowledge?

540
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,975
That's right, Bones.

541
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:02,435
I don't know.

542
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,897
Well, where were you between
last Sunday and Tuesday night?

543
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:07,995
- Who is she?
- Don't get jealous, Doc.

544
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,851
Just answer the question.

545
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:11,794
I was in San Antonio

546
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,530
doing skin grafts on a firefighter
with third-degree burns.

547
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,962
- You've got your own plane.
- You had time to fly back.

548
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,238
You really want me to believe
that Richard King killed Cal.

549
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,914
Cal Warren's remains were
incinerated with aviation gas.

550
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,707
I didn't kill Cal.

551
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,840
You know what, she lies a lot.
I don't think she can help it at all.

552
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,088
- Here's my lawyer's card.
- She's decided not to cooperate.

553
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,338
No, I've decided to watch
my son play lacrosse.

554
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,973
Here's the surface
weather for Tuesday night

555
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,626
when that nor'easter blew
the bones into that tree.

556
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:48,220
Now, that red X, that's the tree.

557
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,788
The bones must have
traveled along this vector.

558
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,489
Now, given the duration of the
gust and the terrain obstacles,

559
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,043
lift off must have happened
somewhere between

560
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,786
here... and here.

561
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,435
That's on the edge of Queen
Anne's and Kent County.

562
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,955
Good job, excellent experiment.

563
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,529
Don't thank me.

564
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,316
Thank Max Brennan.

565
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,549
How's it going there, Max?

566
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,098
That's the last day with
my kids this afternoon.

567
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:23,595
I'm toast.

568
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,767
Cam fired you?

569
00:27:25,214 --> 00:27:27,055
No, no, Tempe fired me.

570
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:30,106
And don't tell me she hasn't got the
authority, because, believe me,

571
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,438
I feel fired.

572
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,252
Sorry, Max.

573
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,478
Can I ask you a question?

574
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,852
Sure.

575
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,707
You, are you...

576
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,866
- Are you sleeping with my daughter?
- No.

577
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,209
Why? Are you gay?

578
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,999
- No.
- Is she not attractive enough?

579
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,459
- Bones is beautiful.
- Is it because of me?

580
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:53,205
Because I killed one man, and
we both know he deserved it.

581
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,417
Right, just cut it out, Max.
I'll talk to her.

582
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,745
Probably ain't gonna get
anywhere with her, but...

583
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,496
- I'll talk to her.
- You're a good man.

584
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,404
And I want that for her.

585
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,896
And now I got to go blow
up some soda for some kids.

586
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,025
Okay, according to the calculations,

587
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,033
the bones must have started out

588
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:20,821
from somewhere in this vicinity.

589
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:23,883
You know something, Bones?
It's tough being a father.

590
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,635
Parker will be fine.

591
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,800
Peer groups
and random environmental factors

592
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:29,953
are far more important than family.

593
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:31,605
How's that a good thing?

594
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,710
Over here!

595
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,186
Agent Booth, over here.

596
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:42,455
This must have been where
the... body was burned.

597
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,719
You think?

598
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:45,598
Femur, pelvis...

599
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,152
sternum.

600
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,269
Gunshot trauma to the sternal angle.

601
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,187
The buckshot embedded
in the anterior surface

602
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:56,317
indicates that the murder weapon
was a 12-gauge shotgun.

603
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,105
- I thought Cal was strangled.
- He was.

604
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,251
Strangled, shot and set on fire.

605
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,560
Someone wanted to make
sure he didn't get home.

606
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,113
Hey, Bones,
look at the family crest.

607
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,942
Looks like that someone came from
king's country home.

608
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:28,891
Mr. King, we'd like to ask you a
few questions about your nanny.

609
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:32,019
I really don't see how
I can help you, Agent Booth.

610
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,275
My wife deals with the staff.

611
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,940
You own a 12-gauge shotgun?

612
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,470
Yeah, several.

613
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,805
You're welcome to examine them.

614
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,639
Two months ago, Cal gave

615
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:44,365
an investor insider knowledge
about your company.

616
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,652
- I didn't know that.
- And if you had known?

617
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,036
I suppose I would
have tried to fire him.

618
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,340
Tried?

619
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:52,627
I don't think that
Elsbeth would have allowed it.

620
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,375
Was she having an affair with him?

621
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,669
Oh, Bones, such a good one.

622
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:59,171
You two need to learn focus.

623
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,415
- Excuse me?
- Focus. Focus.

624
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,438
Either accuse me
of killing Cal because

625
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:06,220
he betrayed business secrets
or because he had sex with my wife,

626
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,140
and then once you've
chosen, then contact my lawyers.

627
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:11,265
I'd go with the business motive.

628
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,984
I'm very happily married.

629
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,160
Okay, that guy is one cool customer.

630
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,395
Cool like a murderer?

631
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,165
No. I don't know, okay?

632
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,434
I just don't see him
losing his temper

633
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,952
or taking on some
Special Forces vet, that's all.

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,558
All right, do you think that
dog comes with a saddle?

635
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,630
Follow me, Bones,
will you, for a second?

636
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,965
What's going on?

637
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:47,058
What are you doing?

638
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,600
Are you going to urinate in the
gas tank as an act of vandalism?

639
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,567
You kidding me, Bones? I would never
do something like that

640
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,828
to this fine Italian automobile.

641
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,190
Beautiful car. It's Italian, Bones.

642
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:04,361
Just remember that. Italians
make the best automobiles.

643
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,883
Yeah. There it is.

644
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:13,412
Okay, Bones, give me, one
of your little baggies.

645
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,737
- I didn't bring evidence bags.
- Thanks. Appreciate it.

646
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:18,015
We're not at a crime scene.
Why would I bring this bags?

647
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,040
You always have
evidence bags on you.

648
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:22,906
I've...

649
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,565
I've decided
I'm gonna leave the Jeffersonian.

650
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,520
Why?

651
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:27,843
Because I fired him.

652
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,472
- You can do that?
- Yeah. Believe me, she can do it.

653
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,775
Well, it's all about proximity
to forensic evidence.

654
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,251
Don't take any offense, but
that's a lot of crap.

655
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,189
It's about proximity to me. Right?

656
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,727
Well, in my opinion,

657
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,755
it isn't your father's presence
that's causing you anxiety,

658
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,241
it's the memory of his absence.

659
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,203
I can understand quantum
mechanics, but I can't understand you.

660
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,832
Well, make it easy.
I'm leaving the Jeffersonian.

661
00:31:59,114 --> 00:31:59,917
You are?

662
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,233
- But I'm staying with you.
- What? In my house?

663
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,091
No, no, no.

664
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:08,676
Why, is that an offer?

665
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,051
No. Would you...

666
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:12,203
Would you want me to offer?

667
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,931
No, but thanks for the offer.

668
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,850
It wasn't an offer.
It was a question.

669
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:18,672
He isn't saying he's
literally staying with you.

670
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:20,854
He's promising never
to abandon you again.

671
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,607
I'm sorry, but if it wasn't for that
evidence thing,

672
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:29,154
I'd let you keep your job.

673
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,475
That's simply not true.

674
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,033
Hey, it's all right.

675
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,870
We're good.

676
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,540
Nothing I say has any impact.

677
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,959
I should get back to work.

678
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,020
Oh, geez.

679
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:49,549
Did she leave any money?

680
00:32:56,177 --> 00:32:58,339
- About the fractured hyoid...
- Yes?

681
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,778
I was just remembering
about a tapeworm.

682
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,445
- I going to need more than that.
- There was a tapeworm in the line.

683
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,255
The one that went to the beer keg.

684
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,665
I was working as a
barback a couple years ago.

685
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,741
There's no flow from the tap line.
First assumption: kink in the line, OK?

686
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,451
What else could it be?

687
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,495
There was a tapeworm in the line.

688
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,895
Eight inches long.

689
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,332
- I learned something from that.
- Drink bottled beer?

690
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,110
The tap don't flow, you
assume the line's got a kink.

691
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,757
The guy's hyoid is broken, you assume
he died from getting strangled.

692
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,640
You found a tapeworm?

693
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,469
I mean, metaphorically?

694
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,425
Yeah, but I don't know
if it's a tapeworm.

695
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,677
I need Dr. Brennan.

696
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,594
I am so your most valuable player.

697
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,521
Now, this is the profile of the
accelerant we found on the bones.

698
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,650
Aviation gas.

699
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:48,817
And this is the profile of the
gas we took off Booth's tie.

700
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,404
Richard King's car runs on avgas?

701
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,805
He could have siphoned it out of his
own car to burn Cal Warren's remains.

702
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,575
And what is this anomaly?

703
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,569
C6H8O7.

704
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,355
Citric acid?

705
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,292
It's my considered belief that Agent
Booth spilled orange juice on his tie.

706
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,818
I look forward to seeing
him explain that to the jury.

707
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:09,180
Booth, it's Cam.

708
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:11,395
I think you're going to want
to getyourself a warrant

709
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,160
to arrest Richard King.

710
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,429
Fractures
on the transverse processes of the C2,

711
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,807
both sides, and the spinous process.

712
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,135
And check out the
occipital protuberance.

713
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,135
Oh, yes.

714
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,828
Maybe this will help Booth
keep Richard King in detention.

715
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:28,275
Cal wasn't strangled postmortem.

716
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,692
He was dragged.

717
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,278
Strangulation is the kink,
dragging is the tapeworm.

718
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,360
The pattern of marks
is evenly spaced as if

719
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,450
it were from a series
of connected prongs.

720
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,347
What would do that?

721
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:42,070
A choke chain.

722
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:44,293
Richard King's a big strong guy.

723
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,845
I don't see him dragging a dead
body around on a choke chain.

724
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,351
That's because he didn't.

725
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,714
The angle of the fracture
is 18 degrees.

726
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,325
Assuming a standard four-foot leash,
whoever dragged

727
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,468
 the victim is at most five-five.

728
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,690
So, you're sure you don't want
your attorney present, Mrs. King?

729
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,735
- Let's just get this over with.
- Okay, sounds good to me.

730
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,185
Here's, what I'm thinking.

731
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm thinking that,

732
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,950
your country home
is less than a mile

733
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,375
from the spot where
Cal's body was burned.

734
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,017
You had access to the
shotgun, the aviation gas...

735
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,940
You know how many people
work for us, Agent Booth?

736
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,870
Every single one of them had access.

737
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,082
Yeah, I don't think any of them really
would have cared if they found out that,

738
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:36,842
Cal Warren was trying to
destroy your husband's company.

739
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,390
You have a nice life.

740
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,521
I'm sure you got really angry when you
found out that it was all going away.

741
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,060
You don't understand.

742
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,440
It wasn't about the money.

743
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:01,824
I had to protect my family.

744
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:06,622
What do you think?

745
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:09,965
In my professional
opinion, she didn't whack him.

746
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,245
What? Come on, Cal betrayed them.

747
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,770
Come on, Sweets.
For once, you're right.

748
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,383
- Embrace the win, my friend.
- I'm sorry, but it's Kinesics 101.

749
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,630
You pushed all the right buttons,

750
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:23,764
but instead of her ego defense system
triggering a stress-response state,

751
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,953
she went straight into
a tacit confession.

752
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,685
Right, which means... she did it.

753
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,765
No, it means she didn't do it.

754
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,065
But she wants you to
believe that she did.

755
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,237
Why would she want to do that?

756
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:36,902
She's covering for someone.

757
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:40,572
The only honest thing that she said
was that she had to protect her family.

758
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,680
So we're back to square one.

759
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,617
Sort of.

760
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,230
Geez.

761
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,380
Let me ask you something.

762
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,002
I mean, you're a smart guy,
you went to private school, right?

763
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,053
Yeah. With perfect attendance
through sixth grade, might I add.

764
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:58,414
That's great.

765
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:02,323
You don't think that
I'm a lousy dad for not

766
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,304
sending my son to private school?

767
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:05,472
No,

768
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,268
but you'd be a lousy father if
you didn't torture yourself about it.

769
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:12,745
Thanks.

770
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:16,567
Hold on. Booth.

771
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:19,798
I reviewed the placement of
the shotgun pellet wounds.

772
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,927
The trajectory indicates that
whoever shot Cal

773
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,701
was significantly
shorter than Mrs. King.

774
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,668
- I don't think she did it.
- Right, thanks.

775
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:45,375
You see, we got a court order
for your cell phone and your laptop.

776
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,433
You know nothing you text
or IM is really private.

777
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,920
I knew that.

778
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:53,770
Really? Because, you know,
we checked your text messages, and,

779
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,524
we found one from a couple
weeks ago that's a little weird.

780
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,485
This one is from the
night that Cal was killed.

781
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,030
"Bring it over now.
Parents both gone."

782
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,657
- Stop this, Richard.
- No, I want to hear it.

783
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:08,994
It turns out that Alexa, here,
had a project due on Ancient Greece.

784
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,958
You spent three days
complaining about it.

785
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,183
- Why didn't you just do it?
- I didn't want to.

786
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:16,187
- It was stupid.
- Stupid?

787
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,565
- How about this one?
- "D manny will do it.

788
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,882
He can't say no. He works for me."

789
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,335
But Cal really did say no,
didn't he?

790
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,195
Because you paid a hundred bucks
to somebody else to do it for you.

791
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,723
Someone by the name
of Dakota Shearcroft.

792
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:33,935
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I think it's a stupid name, too.

793
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,355
So what happened?
Did Cal catch you?

794
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,398
He threatened to tell the school.

795
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,443
- Why wouldn't he have just told us?
- Cal said you wouldn't do anything.

796
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,671
You never do.

797
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,990
- He said I had to learn a lesson.
- What kind of lesson?

798
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,035
They would have kicked me
out of school! Zero tolerance.

799
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:54,665
My friends are at that school.

800
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,169
I got the gun out of the garage
and I shot him.

801
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,257
Mom came home and saw.

802
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,556
I drove the body to the country
house,

803
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:14,501
took it into the woods
and burned it.

804
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,488
She's my daughter,
I had to protect her.

805
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:25,320
No, you did what you always do.

806
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:27,155
Make everything bad go away.

807
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,284
It's counterproductive to raise children
in a world without consequences.

808
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,121
It looks like little Alexa here
is going to have to come face-to-face

809
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,165
 with some pretty
nasty consequences.

810
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:41,378
But not the kind of consequences
you're going to have to face, Mrs. King.

811
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:55,805
Okay, Parker, this is called
the candy mint-soda experiment.

812
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,020
You can do this
for your dad at home.

813
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:01,465
So, Mom copped to
conspiracy to avoid a trial.

814
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,075
- She'll spend some time in prison.
- How much?

815
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,820
Not enough. My opinion,
she ruined that little girl's life.

816
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,899
What about the little girl?

817
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,826
Removed from the family,
institutionalized for a couple of years.

818
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:17,520
Then it's back to ponies
and tennis lessons?

819
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,834
Well, Caroline should
charge her as an adult.

820
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,128
She's 11 years old, Bones.

821
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,047
Yeah, she's old
enough to speak Chinese.

822
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,025
They don't take that into account.

823
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,874
Man, when that little girl killed Cal
she killed the best father she had.

824
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,267
Well, sometimes it's hard
to appreciate what you've got.

825
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,595
Look at him, Parker
has never liked science before.

826
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:43,273
Are you still thinking of
sending him to Woodbury?

827
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:45,795
I torched the application.

828
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,403
I'm thinking there's something
to be said for middle class.

829
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,895
You sure he's going to be all right?

830
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:55,600
Sure. Well, probably.

831
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,858
Probably, like,
what do you mean, probably?

832
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,655
What the hell
are they doing anyways?

833
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,535
Disrupting the surface
tension of a two-liter cola.

834
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,191
Right.

835
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,755
Is that the last one?All
right, put it in the tube.

836
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,627
And then we'll both
take a step back.

837
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,835
Don't fire Max.
Let him keep his job.

838
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,515
He's a teacher, he's not a janitor.

839
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,278
I can't overlook the sanctity
of the forensic lab, Booth.

840
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,785
Yeah,
maybe you can overlook it for me.

841
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:25,732
For you?

842
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:27,931
Yeah.

843
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,110
Personal favor.

844
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:31,446
What, like a partner thing?

845
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:34,561
A partner thing.

846
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,345
I know you, Booth.

847
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,333
You're trying to do me a favor
by telling me it's a favor for you.

848
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,287
No.

849
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:47,793
No, I...
I can't afford that school.

850
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,992
I can't enrich Parker,
not with the science thing, but...

851
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,436
