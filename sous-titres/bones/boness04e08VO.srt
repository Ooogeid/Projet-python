1
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,861
My dad thinks I'm selfish,

2
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,980
so I want to steal him
some spare parts for his birthday.

3
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,489
You're a good son, man.

4
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,087
Hey, dude, I'm not moving.

5
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:33,536
Dude, your jacket is caught
on the barbed wire.

6
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:36,122
Bounce around a little bit,
and you'll come loose.

7
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:40,627
That worked great.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,941
- So, what kind of car does he have?
- Old one.

9
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:46,561
Toyota FJ-40.

10
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,679
He loves that thing.
More than me, that's for sure.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,928
Check it out!

12
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,975
Can you imagine
if I gave him that golden side mirror?

13
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,145
I could glue it on his truck.

14
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,504
Got to be gentle.

15
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,082
It's coming.

16
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,694
The car is bleeding.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,849
There's something back there.

18
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,118
Okay, look, just to be clear,

19
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:31,189
I asked you out for a drink to talk,

20
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,513
not because I'm desperate
for male company.

21
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:36,219
- You think of me as male company?
- Can I get you anything?

22
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:37,666
Vodka up, please.

23
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,972
And my grandson here
will have another of whatever that is.

24
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,607
Oh, sidecar, but no, I'm fine.

25
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,119
Okay, one more, one more.
I'm cabbing it.

26
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,526
You just got divorced
and broke up with your fiancé.

27
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,990
It's totally understandable
that you don't feel like sex.

28
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,283
I feel like sex.

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,330
Sex is what I feel like.

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,885
Now, I could jump Hodgins, but

31
00:01:58,594 --> 00:01:59,956
doesn't seem fair somehow.

32
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,183
Do you agree?

33
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:04,103
Well, what matters
is that it doesn't seem fair to you.

34
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:06,651
I hate it when shrinks do that.

35
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,759
Look, I've been alone now
for quite a while, which is not like me.

36
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,503
Yeah, well, when we open ourselves
emotionally and get hurt,

37
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:16,431
we're reluctant to allow ourselves
to be that vulnerable again.

38
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,475
It's been, like, six weeks.

39
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,727
- That's a-a...
- Long time.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,188
Yes, of course it is.

41
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,522
The longest I've gone
without since I lost my virginity.

42
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,230
At age 16.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,074
- Which is the normal age.
- Sometimes older is just fine, too.

44
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,143
I'm not promiscuous, Sweets.

45
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,163
I don't sleep with just anybody.

46
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,159
I do require
an emotional connection.

47
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:38,912
Spiritual, actually.

48
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,552
It's spiritual to me.

49
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,388
And fun, of course.

50
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,345
Who doesn't like sex, right?

51
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,755
Didn't we order these drinks
a long time ago?

52
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,298
You're right.

53
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,675
- About what?
- I have been protecting myself.

54
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:56,231
Without the risk of pain,
there can be no

55
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,599
possibility of pleasure
or joy or love.

56
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,936
Yes, yes, and regaining
that willingness to take a risk...

57
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,418
- That can take time.
- No.

58
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:06,600
- No?
- I am done protecting myself.

59
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,941
I'm ready to move on.

60
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,094
You're good.

61
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:12,256
- You really are.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,235
To love?

63
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:14,859
And joy.

64
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,524
And sex!

65
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,427
Looks like someone with a crooked nose
was trying to get rid our friend here.

66
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,766
There's no way to know that
the killer had a crooked nose.

67
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:29,045
You mean, the mob?
It was a mob hit.

68
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,839
He clearly
wasn't wearing a seat belt.

69
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,870
We need the Jaws of Life
to pry this guy out.

70
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,810
No.
That could compromise the remains.

71
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,248
It seems that any viable examination
pre-extraction is impossible,

72
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,869
unless somebody has X-ray vision.

73
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:47,300
I meant to warn you that Ms.
Wick came up in the rotation.

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,692
This time you'll be glad I'm here,
Dr. Brennan, I promise.

75
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,653
The height of the nasal root
points to a Caucasian.

76
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,613
The large brow ridges
suggest a male.

77
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,458
- We need cause of death.
- Of the Caucasian male?

78
00:03:58,578 --> 00:04:01,452
What can be seen of the temporal,
zygomatic and frontal bones

79
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,577
indicates that
they're in multiple fragments,

80
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,645
possibly from
the crushing of the car.

81
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:08,001
We have access to blood and fluids.
I'll run a tox screen.

82
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,824
Booth is checking
the records at the junkyard

83
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,320
to see who brought in the car
and when it was processed.

84
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,789
I'll use an endoscope
to retrieve any particulates

85
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,063
without disturbing the remains.

86
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:18,983
Brennan.

87
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,264
Hey, have you been seeing anybody?

88
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,003
Listen, I don't want to be rude,

89
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,143
but I just don't think
that's any of your business.

90
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,771
I haven't.

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,354
Me, either.

92
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,856
- But I'm going to start.
- Right, yeah. Me, too.

93
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,358
I mean, like, right away.

94
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,681
Sweets agrees that it's time.

95
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:35,685
Sweets?

96
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,156
We shouldn't fear
putting our hearts out there.

97
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,127
Sweets?

98
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,613
That's so beautiful.

99
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,692
And so inappropriate
over a decomposing body.

100
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:48,292
Booth found out who delivered the car
to the junkyard for crushing.

101
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,447
Invoice was made out
to B & B Enterprises.

102
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,465
This was the sixth car that was crushed
and sent back to this address.

103
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,061
So you think there might be
five more bodies?

104
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,383
You know what? If this is mob-related,
and we bring down the big boys...

105
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,921
...we will sell the movie rights
for a fortune.

106
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,738
- But what if it's not the mob?
- Come on. Do the math, Bones.

107
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,218
The math wouldn't indicate
motive or identify a suspect.

108
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:12,941
- And you haven't provided enough...
- It's a figure of speech, all right?

109
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,292
Here we are.

110
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,128
What goes first?

111
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,842
Gun goes first.

112
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,777
- That's right.
- But if you get shot?

113
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,971
Don't say things like that.
You're gonna jinx me, OK?

114
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,050
If you're relying on superstition
for safety, I should carry the gun.

115
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,628
No, you are definitely
not carrying a gun.

116
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,257
Give me some space, all right?

117
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,495
Is that legal?

118
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,756
Look, if anybody asks,
the door was open.

119
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:37,985
No, it isn't.

120
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,015
Right.

121
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,451
What the hell
are you supposed to be?

122
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,412
- What?
- Look at this.

123
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,248
- What is it?
- Blood.

124
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,856
Bones - Season 04 Episode 08
"The Skull in the Sculpture"

125
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,734
Synchro: ShalimarFox, IceFreak

126
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:59,630
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

127
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,525
The artist did a series
of six sculptures

128
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:21,260
over the past two years.

129
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:23,237
Sculptures?

130
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:27,475
These things are going for
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

131
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,718
All cultures
put a great value on art.

132
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:33,279
Yeah, art. A nice bowl of fruit,
dogs playing poker.

133
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,896
If I sold all the crap
that was in my garage, I could retire.

134
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,371
I'd make a fortune.

135
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,671
Geoffrey's work
is a brilliant examination

136
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,372
of consumerism
and the destruction of the soul.

137
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:44,759
I see twisted metal.

138
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,844
Well, you need to look
beneath the surface.

139
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:49,115
We did, and we found a dead body,

140
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,877
which is exactly why
you're not going anywhere.

141
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:53,229
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,058
The luminol is showing
evidence of blood all over the floor.

143
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:57,931
- Of course it is.
- Excuse me?

144
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,607
- Kiko was here.
- Kiko?

145
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,484
Kiko, the performance artist.

146
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,071
Pig's blood is an integral
and crucial part of her work.

147
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,275
Is that even legal?

148
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,821
We'll decide what's pig
and what isn't. Pull some samples.

149
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,798
- I've already called my lawyer.
- Great.

150
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,653
Tell him to meet you
at the FBI offices.

151
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:14,451
I didn't call him for me.

152
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,249
You see how much
these works are worth.

153
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:18,543
You are liable for any damages.

154
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,383
Damage?

155
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,755
- They're crushed cars.
- They're wrecks.

156
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:24,486
Fortunately, your ignorance

157
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:28,157
and lack of appreciation of Geoffrey's
work don't affect its value.

158
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,518
Okay, all right, guys.
Careful handling the junk.

159
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:31,854
Apparently, it is art.

160
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,002
All right?

161
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:34,891
Perhaps I could help?

162
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,311
I'm Roxie Lyon,
Geoffrey Thorne's assistant.

163
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,065
Does the artist make a habit of encasing
corpses within his sculptures?

164
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,078
Excuse me?

165
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,373
We found one of these crushed cars
and traced it back here to this address.

166
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,030
We've done the best we can without
ripping one of these things apart.

167
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,088
- No accordion-dead bodies?
- The cadaver dogs

168
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,407
can identify human blood.
They didn't find any.

169
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:53,631
Oh, my God.

170
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,123
- Helen?
- Yes?

171
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,876
Do you think Geoffrey
might have done it?

172
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:03,337
No. That was all just
depressed artist talk, Roxie.

173
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:06,299
You should know that.
You're a depressed artist yourself.

174
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,498
Hello?
Do you want to explain this to me?

175
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,845
Recently
Geoffrey's been talking about

176
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:13,639
finding a way to make himself
part of the art.

177
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:17,144
- Do you mean literally?
- The ultimate artistic act.

178
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,020
Geoffrey was depressed,

179
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,815
and he said he felt like
he'd reached his limit as an artist.

180
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,669
We'd like to show you a picture of
the remains, only if you're up for it.

181
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:27,153
I suggest
you don't look at the person,

182
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,197
but rather this distinct ring.

183
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:31,199
That's Geoffrey.

184
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,505
I know that ring.
I designed it myself.

185
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,786
- It's Geoffrey.
- Bravo, Geoffrey.

186
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,456
You are an extremely
unlikable woman.

187
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,006
Mr. Thorne have any enemies?

188
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,406
Why?
It's obvious he did this himself.

189
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:45,671
To you, perhaps,
but we actually require evidence.

190
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:46,797
Anton DeLuca.

191
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:49,973
He's an artist
and a rival of Geoffrey's.

192
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,969
They had a pretty big argument
the other night.

193
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:52,996
About what?

194
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,431
What all artists argue about...
money.

195
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,446
You know what this is?

196
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,511
Jaws of Life.

197
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,799
23,000 pounds

198
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,883
per square inch of raw prying power.

199
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,307
You really want to be
the one to use that, don't you?

200
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,074
It's not displaced
sexual frustration.

201
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,817
- Of course not.
- I am totally cool

202
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,646
if Angela wants to date already,
or, I mean, again.

203
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,130
Right. You do know the point
is to remove the human remains

204
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,328
 from inside the car with minimal
disruption of the evidence?

205
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:28,312
Though, these tox results
are suggesting suicide.

206
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,593
- You got these from the tissue samples?
- Mostly skin, some brain matter.

207
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,692
Clonazepam, lamotrigine,

208
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:38,206
quetiapine, venlafaxine,
hydrocodone, oxycodone and codeine.

209
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,753
Anti-anxiety drugs,

210
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,839
mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics,

211
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,273
antidepressants and painkillers.

212
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,182
He was under psychiatric care.
Even spent

213
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,901
a week in the psych ward last March.

214
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,779
Our victim could have been dead
from an overdose before he was crushed.

215
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,380
Can't tell for sure.
Long-time abusers build up a tolerance,

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,862
so, this could have been a typical
Wednesday night for the guy.

217
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:59,900
Best way to find out
is to crack her open, baby.

218
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:03,874
I didn't mean "baby."

219
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,976
Carefully, Dr. Hodgins.

220
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,212
Like removing a baby bird
from an egg.

221
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,362
Stand back, ladies.

222
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,260
This is about to get medieval.

223
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,158
Sorry, cheri.

224
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,247
Apparently,

225
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:24,610
this is an historic piece of art.

226
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,606
It's a hard car shell
with a gooey corpse filling.

227
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:30,276
I've already collected textile,
tissue and bone samples.

228
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,841
That was before I got here.
Here on in,

229
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,865
this is an historic piece of art.

230
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,408
These fine people

231
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:40,411
persuaded a judge of that
and got a temporary injunction.

232
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:42,288
Oh, this sucks.

233
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,051
Roxie?

234
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:47,256
Angie?

235
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:48,588
Roxie!

236
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,170
My God... Hi!

237
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,039
What are you doing here?

238
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,390
What's going on?

239
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,384
Those two
are old friends from college.

240
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:56,849
If that's the same Roxie.

241
00:11:56,969 --> 00:12:00,472
Luckily, I took initiative and got
those samples before the injunction.

242
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:03,851
- Injunction?
- This heap is considered art.

243
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:06,030
Well, it's... gorgeous.

244
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,334
Where does this leave
our investigation?

245
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:11,824
You can still examine it.
You just can't disrupt it in any way.

246
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,430
Don't worry.
This is only temporary.

247
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:18,114
We'll see how artistic people
are feeling when it starts stinking.

248
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,734
Just don't scratch it.

249
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:23,662
Don't scratch the crushed automobile,
which encases a rotting, dead body?

250
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:25,331
Good! We understand each other.

251
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,621
Geoffrey Thorne dead?

252
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,894
This is a...
great day for the art world.

253
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:37,400
Yeah, well, last time you were
seen together, you were arguing.

254
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,958
We never saw each other
without arguing, so...

255
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,344
- You disliked Geoffrey Thorne?
- Well, let's just say

256
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:44,530
between his work and his guts...

257
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,201
I don't know which I hated more.

258
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:50,472
Yeah, well, artistically speaking,
crushing him up in his own work,

259
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:52,942
that would be very, symbolic.

260
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,578
Is that what happened?

261
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,654
Oh, that, that's hilarious.

262
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,825
He crushed himself inside one
of his stupid car sculptures?

263
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,347
An exhibitionist right
to the bitter end.

264
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:04,995
How Po-Mo.

265
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,059
Po-Mo?

266
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,185
Post Modern.

267
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,518
Let me tell you,
Geoffrey's hermetic aestheticism

268
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:11,254
was choked with tawdry pastiche

269
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,630
He had plastic intentions
and weak enterprise.

270
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,980
All right, someone
I understand less than you.

271
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:21,470
This is asymmetrical
and yet still pleasing to the eye.

272
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,858
Okay, I take that back.
Why don't you just say it's...

273
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:26,495
- Pretty?
- I don't do pretty.

274
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:29,730
Okay. Simmer down there, Picasso.
You get a compliment, you be polite.

275
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,103
I don't do polite either.

276
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:32,758
Maybe that's why you're broke.

277
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,011
Who gave you my name?

278
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,361
Was it that Kabuki Ghoul,
Helen Bridenbecker?

279
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,652
Shouldn't you be trying harder
to look innocent?

280
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,903
Yeah. How long have you
and Thorne hated each other?

281
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,784
You can write down,
before the big bang.

282
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,459
Oh, no.
There was no "before"

283
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,330
before the big bang,
because time didn't exist.

284
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,398
If there are no
organizing properties...

285
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,637
Bones, I'm just going
to write down, it's been a while.

286
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:55,133
All right?
So, why were you arguing at the gallery?

287
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:56,942
We heard it was about money.

288
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,501
I might have said he was a sell-out.
Usually do.

289
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,501
But I didn't think to kill him.

290
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,692
Now it's too late, right?

291
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,849
Well, if you didn't kill him,
then, who did?

292
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,059
I'd look at his girlfriend
if I were you.

293
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,270
- No one has mentioned a girlfriend.
- Roxie.

294
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,481
His "assistant."

295
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:16,411
He said he was gonna
leave all his money to her.

296
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,397
I mean, this is kind of basic stuff
you guys should know, right?

297
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:25,895
Did you have like buckets
of coffee this morning?

298
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,082
You're very shaky.

299
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,212
Could you take a step back, please?

300
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,581
A little more.

301
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:35,002
Just a little more.

302
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:36,882
Like tip-toeing mice.

303
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,255
Oh, rats.

304
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,842
Do you want me to try?
Let me try. I'm very dexterous.

305
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,352
You won't be sorry.

306
00:14:56,882 --> 00:15:00,354
I was going to say that
I had an accident over here,

307
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,323
but I don't like lying.

308
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,052
You dumped a bucket full of domestic
beetles onto this work of art.

309
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,143
They'll strip the flesh off
our victim in no time.

310
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,495
Within 30 hours.

311
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,958
- Am I fired?
- Au contraire.

312
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,417
Remind me of this moment
around Christmas bonus time.

313
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,585
I'm in!

314
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,397
Good work, Ms. Wick.

315
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,714
We could've been here
hours ago if Dr. Saroyan

316
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,638
would have given me
the endoscope sooner.

317
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,441
Thanks for mentioning that.

318
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:28,601
There's too much flesh to really
get an idea of the bone damage.

319
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:29,924
30 hours.

320
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:37,611
I was Geoffrey Thorne's assistant
for almost four years.

321
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,991
OK, I suggest you start
with the mundane,

322
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,023
and then work:
yourself up to the sexual stuff.

323
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,329
So did you have a sexual
relationship with your boss?

324
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:47,360
- That's the opposite of my suggestion.
- No.

325
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,729
No.

326
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,657
So what was the nature
of your relationship?

327
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:51,956
I assisted Geoffrey.

328
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,123
I handled the details
if his day-to-day life.

329
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,466
- Are you sure it's Geoffrey?
- Prevaricate, keep her guessing.

330
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:58,877
Yes, we're positive.

331
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,178
Why am I here?

332
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,132
As his personal assistant
did you get him his drugs?

333
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,819
If you mean
his prescriptions, then...

334
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,132
Yes, I picked them up for him
and I reminded him to take them.

335
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,265
Ask her if Thorne
was clinically depressed.

336
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,766
He was depressed, right?

337
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,051
Yes.

338
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,849
He was... suicidal.

339
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,062
Seeing a shrink.

340
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,861
That's why you're here.

341
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,151
Because you think Geoffrey
took an overdose?

342
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:25,362
If he killed himself, I mean,
wouldn't he have left a suicide note?

343
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,582
Yeah, I would think
that he would have...

344
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,074
left me a message.

345
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:33,279
Look, if you weren't sleeping
with Thorne, then why

346
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:36,790
did he name you the sole
beneficiary of his estate?

347
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,964
Geoffrey's will?

348
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,276
Yeah, it's...

349
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,736
about one million dollars.
Look at that.

350
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,134
I had no idea
that he was going to do that.

351
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:50,324
Perhaps jealousy
is her motive for killing Thorne.

352
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,195
Why else would she deny
sleeping with him?

353
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,541
I don't think so.

354
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:54,746
I swear.

355
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:57,380
No, there was another reason why
you weren't sleeping with Thorne.

356
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,056
Isn't that right, Roxie?

357
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,398
Angela told you, didn't she?

358
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,360
Told us what?
Why don't you tell me.

359
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,404
I'm gay. I'm a lesbian.

360
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:10,491
I've never been with a man
in my life and I never will.

361
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,766
So, according to his will,

362
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,351
Roxie stands to inherit
Thorne's entire estate.

363
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,101
She said they were close.

364
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,600
People usually leave money like that
to a wife or a lover.

365
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,169
I don't think so.

366
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,283
Because?

367
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,369
Because Roxie's an old friend
and she'd have told me.

368
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,550
- She says she's a lesbian.
- Delicacy, Bones.

369
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,609
What? It's not an affliction, Booth.

370
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:39,311
Yes, Roxie is gay.

371
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:42,043
At least she was
when we were together.

372
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,182
In school?

373
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:44,597
Yes.

374
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,473
Oh, you heard rumors.

375
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:48,220
No, I have firsthand knowledge.

376
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,980
You walked in on her,
that's awkward.

377
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,242
No, we were together,
for over a year.

378
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,327
You and, Roxie?

379
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,399
- You have a problem with that?
- No. I was just

380
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,706
processing the information there,
that's all, and in doing so, I was

381
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:04,023
envisioning you and her, you know,
together, and, well, not to...

382
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,171
well, together, but... Really?

383
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,800
Women tend not to be as rigid
in their sexual identities as men.

384
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,595
- Weren't we talking about murder, here?
- Did she ever show any interest in men?

385
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:16,557
No.
And she would never kill anybody.

386
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,851
You haven't been close
in a long time.

387
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,395
- She hasn't changed.
- Except that now she's rich.

388
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,397
Before Thorne was killed,
she wasn't rich.

389
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,166
Roxie never cared about money.

390
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:26,942
I thought that you didn't speculate.

391
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:29,570
That doesn't preclude pursuing
a logical line of inquiry.

392
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,530
We still don't even know
that it was murder.

393
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,783
Thorne wrote about the need
to become one with his work.

394
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:35,971
He was ill.

395
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:38,327
The logical signs
point to suicide, don't they?

396
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,914
You're right. Ange, we're sorry.
We didn't mean to upset you.

397
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,751
I have work to do. Okay?

398
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,648
Here's the C2 axis.

399
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,732
A little further, the C1 atlas.

400
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:57,875
We're almost to the cranium.

401
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:58,795
Nice.

402
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,554
Now maybe you'll be able
to rescue the princess.

403
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,312
That's funny.

404
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:05,397
Everyone here is so nice.

405
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:08,543
You know, I think I may have initially
come off as a bit too needy.

406
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,694
My family was pretty
dysfunctional, so...

407
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:14,323
I tend to want a work environment
to fulfill certain needs.

408
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,450
Perhaps some therapy might help.

409
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,452
What a thoughtful suggestion.

410
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,412
I always wanted a sister.

411
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,362
Dr. Brennan,
Ms. Wick and I were just

412
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:25,607
observing the handiwork
of your beetles.

413
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,170
They did a beautiful job
of cleaning the bones,

414
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,634
but half of the remains
are still obscured by the metal.

415
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,007
The victim's right iliac crest
shows a simple fracture.

416
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,678
I also found microfractures,
extending from his right ribs,

417
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:38,914
five through ten,
down his right greater trochanter.

418
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,975
- Very good.
- Really? And they were really small.

419
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:45,145
Microfractures
are by definition small.

420
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,272
What does this damage indicate?

421
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,090
A test. Okay...

422
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,401
The damage is inconclusive.

423
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,738
The fractures could easily
be explained by the crushing of the car,

424
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:57,904
but some could be the result
of an attack or a fall.

425
00:19:58,214 --> 00:19:59,499
I agree.

426
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,744
She agrees.

427
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,310
The victim's clothing shows
traces of calcium oxide,

428
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,680
ferric oxide and magnesium oxide.

429
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,250
It wasn't found on the car seats
or the carpet,

430
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,330
just pressed into
the fabric of his shirt, front and back.

431
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,333
From what?

432
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,259
It could be from stone
if he was sculpting.

433
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,303
It could be he was lying on
gravel or about a hundred other things.

434
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,399
We can't say without getting further
access to the interior of the car.

435
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,502
Which access you were expressly
denied by a federal judge,

436
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:29,106
a federal judge who turned
red and then blue

437
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:32,072
and then some other color
I have never seen before

438
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,993
when he heard that flesh-eating
beetles had somehow

439
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:36,864
infested said work of art.

440
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:40,033
Domestic beetles were not specifically
forbidden on the injunction.

441
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:43,787
I don't suppose "spirit of the law"
means anything to you?

442
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,842
That little kabuki lady
started screaming

443
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,402
like you peed on the mona lisa,

444
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:50,085
that you compromised
the integrity of the piece.

445
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:53,163
That little stunt turned good
opinion from the judge against us.

446
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,415
How long have we got?

447
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,383
Two days to find
evidence of foul play.

448
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:57,574
And after that?

449
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,804
The question goes to the court
and we grow old and die

450
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:02,224
before a decision is made.

451
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,368
And if there is a murder,
that murderer walks around free.

452
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:06,268
Ideas?

453
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,397
I will think about
it until my head explodes.

454
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:12,274
This one's a keeper.

455
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:18,906
Geoffrey let me use
part of his studio.

456
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,744
Roxie, these are wonderful.

457
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,035
Thanks, angie.

458
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,328
What does helen say?

459
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,105
We're talking about an exhibition.

460
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:27,331
That's great.

461
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:28,832
When was your last show?

462
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:30,943
Eight years ago,
when we were together.

463
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:35,426
I don't know, is it too sappy
to say that you were my muse,

464
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,479
or perhaps my entire source
of self-confidence as an artist?

465
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,350
Your people think I killed geoffrey.

466
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,728
I can't talk to you about
an ongoing murder investigation.

467
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,838
If you can't prove it was a suicide,

468
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,108
i'm going to spend the rest of my life
being geoffrey thorne's murderer.

469
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,986
That could jack up the
price of your work, right?

470
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,600
Sorry.

471
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:08,664
Roxie...

472
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:13,585
yeah, that's actually the
first piece that caught helen's eye.

473
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:15,671
She wanted to buy
it from me for herself.

474
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,172
Why didn't you sell this?

475
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:20,120
Some things aren't for sale.

476
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,850
I remember sitting for this.

477
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,645
Happiest time of my life.

478
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:35,108
Oh, my god.

479
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:37,237
Oh, my god.

480
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,269
I have to go.

481
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:41,167
Why?

482
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,554
I know how to prove that
geoffrey thorne committed suicide.

483
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:50,822
This type of device can be used
to scan boxcars,

484
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,209
shipping containers, anything metal
where items can be hidden.

485
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,101
Amazing it is,
this machine you have.

486
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:00,799
Star wars?

487
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,855
Youth doesn't excuse everything,
ms. Wick.

488
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,369
So, you're feeding the
scans into the angelator?

489
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:07,889
Every crease and fold, yeah.

490
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,641
We have less than 40 hours,
you know.

491
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,981
We're well aware of the time,
we don't need a countdown.

492
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:15,467
Then, I'll recalibrate and get a digital
rendering of the bones inside,

493
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,024
which I can enhance.

494
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,003
You've found out how to show
what bone damage

495
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:21,236
came from the actual
crushing of the car.

496
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:24,948
Factoring in the pounds per square inch
of force exerted by the car crusher.

497
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,990
I hope you've included
the car's frame

498
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,548
and the tensile strength of
the victim's skeletal structure.

499
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,955
I'll make a note.

500
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:36,045
Well, I programmed my phone
to get the five-day forecast.

501
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,048
Okay, take a look at this.

502
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,478
Here we have our car, right?

503
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,424
It had a low-carbon steel frame

504
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:50,140
with a yield strength of 22,450 psi.

505
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,936
So, since I know the hydraulic crusher
imparts 163 tons of force,

506
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:58,092
first horizontally,
then in a 32-degree curling motion,

507
00:23:58,212 --> 00:23:59,608
I was able to verify the source

508
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:02,200
of every single ripple on the surface
of the crushed car,

509
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,405
which then gave me the data
to play the crushing backwards.

510
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:09,993
How did you do that?

511
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:12,626
Daisy provided me with the approximate
tensile strength

512
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,247
of each of geoffrey's bones,

513
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,834
plugged in the bone fragments'
final positions, and based on those,

514
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:22,037
correlated each injury as the body was
moved through the car as it was crushed.

515
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:26,348
God, I really hope that guy
didn't know what was happening to him.

516
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:28,850
His bones sustained 88 fractures,

517
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,702
all of which can be explained
by the crushing in the car.

518
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:32,845
Suicide.

519
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,404
Most likely, yeah.

520
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:36,269
What's that?

521
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,195
Um... This run included
the last of the data.

522
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,709
Oh, no.

523
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,192
What?

524
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,755
There's an 89th fracture.

525
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:49,991
The fracture there
on his occipital...

526
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:53,161
It was not caused
by the car being crushed.

527
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,421
What caused it?

528
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:57,251
I need to examine the skull.

529
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:00,778
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

530
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:02,587
I wanted to prove it wasn't murder.

531
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:03,755
But it is.

532
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:07,195
The 89th fracture proves
that Goeffrey Thorne was murdered.

533
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,881
Okay, I got the injunction removed.

534
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,822
You are free to crack open
the car and remove the remains.

535
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,439
Thanks, caroline, you are da bomb.

536
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,483
- Why is she a bomb?
- No, da bomb.

537
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:24,768
Wait, what changed?

538
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,778
It was a million dollar piece
of art yesterday,

539
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:29,765
- and today, it's a piece of junk.
- Cherie, you proved murder.

540
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:32,284
That changed it from a
work of art into a crime scene.

541
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,295
This is crazy, I don't understand.

542
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,538
And I'm not used to
not understanding things.

543
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:39,137
Legally speaking, all that
matters is that it's a crime scene.

544
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,092
- Isn't that right, caroline?
- That's right.

545
00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:43,253
Get in there and solve the murder,
just like always.

546
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:45,136
- That I understand.
- thanks.

547
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:48,076
Stand back.

548
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,805
I am going in.

549
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,914
Careful.

550
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,950
Okay.

551
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,579
Now, what we want to do here
is remove the skull

552
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:20,415
very carefully.

553
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,190
Carefully.

554
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,379
I can't believe you did that.

555
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:33,325
Bummer.

556
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,302
Usually,
when you say "we", you mean me.

557
00:26:38,694 --> 00:26:40,310
I'm so sorry.

558
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,132
I'll put it together.
I will stay up all night.

559
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,504
I'll do it.

560
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:47,322
Well, I will assist
you every step of the way.

561
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:50,779
- I will not leave your side.
- I would prefer to do it alone.

562
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,118
Am I under arrest?

563
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:58,608
You're one of the good guys.

564
00:26:58,728 --> 00:27:01,081
Look up anton deluca
on the fbi database.

565
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,208
That's geoffrey
thorne's big rival, huh?

566
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,710
- He's a forger?
- You got to be kidding me.

567
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,629
Under the alias of lucas danton?

568
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:09,447
I mean, this guy
really loves himself.

569
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:10,848
Yeah, two years in prison.

570
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,938
Forging francis bacon, lucien freud.

571
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:15,448
Must be pretty good.

572
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,448
All right, so I got a dead
artist and a forger who hates him.

573
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:19,869
That's got to cheer you up.

574
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:22,463
I mean, your friend is
no longer our prime suspect.

575
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:24,130
Thanks, booth.

576
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,355
Any time.

577
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:29,067
- So, does it freak you out?
- What?

578
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:31,611
You know,
that roxie and I were a couple.

579
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:32,742
No.

580
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,073
I mean, come on,
you had feelings for somebody.

581
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:36,533
I'm surprised.

582
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:39,077
Why, because you think
i'm some kind of lunkhead cop?

583
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,037
- No, I just...
- All right.

584
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,749
Uh... Look,
my aunt ruth had a roommate, okay?

585
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:46,341
She was my favorite aunt.

586
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:50,463
She and franny, they'd take
me to the ballpark, to the movies.

587
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,639
And I heard talk when I was a kid.

588
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,510
Beat up my friend,
pete, because of it.

589
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,137
Then, I found out it was true.

590
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:58,698
And...?

591
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:00,515
I already said she
was my favorite aunt.

592
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:04,291
And franny... Well, you know, she
had box seats for the phillies games.

593
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:07,483
I mean, come on, it doesn't
get any better than that, right?

594
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,417
Right.

595
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,798
So, you and roxie... Hey.

596
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,312
You know what I mean?

597
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,276
Yeah.

598
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:16,243
Yeah.

599
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,534
So, you brought me along.
What can I do to help you?

600
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:22,746
I want you to be an artist, okay, and,
uh, keep me from looking like an idiot.

601
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,831
I'm not positive I can do both.

602
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,504
So, we subpoenaed your bank records, and
you're not exactly a starving artist.

603
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,915
- Where did you get the money?
- Hey, booth.

604
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,633
The brush strokes on this painting

605
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,969
match the brush strokes
on thorne's car sculptures.

606
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:41,543
So you were forging thorne's work.
That's why you two were arguing.

607
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:45,044
I didn't say these brush strokes
are like the ones on the car sculptures.

608
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,232
I'm saying that they
are the same brush strokes.

609
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,792
You have a good eye.

610
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,941
Brush strokes are like fingerprints.
You can't fake them.

611
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:55,820
Deluca here is the guy who painted
geoffrey thorne's car sculptures.

612
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,584
- You're positive?
- I'm positive.

613
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,367
I can roll with this. You want
recognition for your brilliant work.

614
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,202
Thorne says no, you kill him.

615
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:03,411
So good.
Cuff him.

616
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,663
- What, so roxie can walk?
- Hey, watch it.

617
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:07,832
A) that work is
anything but brilliant.

618
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:11,503
Painting thorne's cars was like a day
job to subsidize my real art, and b...

619
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,981
Why would I kill my main
source of income, you lummox?

620
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:17,545
Yeah, a lummox who's got enough
to hold you for 24 hours, pal.

621
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,155
When this case falls apart
and I get out tomorrow,

622
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,152
you want to grab some dinner
or something?

623
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:23,348
You're kidding.

624
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,183
Well, I hear the
gate swings both ways.

625
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,894
Maybe we can get a threesome action.
You, me, hot roxie?

626
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:29,270
Okay, all right.

627
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,524
If you're gonna hit on angela,
you should do it with a little respect.

628
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,327
Okay, let's go.

629
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:41,732
Is that geoffrey thorne?

630
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:42,969
Yes.

631
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,077
Nearly done.

632
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,670
I honestly didn't
think it would be murder.

633
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,623
Which makes your conclusions
all the more credible.

634
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,674
Only you would find that comforting.

635
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,266
Booth is questioning deluca again.

636
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,124
He seems to have a motive.

637
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,581
So, there's still a chance
that your friend is not a murderer.

638
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:04,773
We'll know more when
we identify the murder weapon.

639
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,723
It wasn't roxie.

640
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,131
- Do you still have feelings for her?
- No.

641
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:18,529
Booth tells me that sometimes people say
the exact opposite of what they mean.

642
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:22,323
I do still have feelings for her.

643
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:25,160
Are you saying the opposite
of what you mean now or before?

644
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:29,164
We had a very intense relationship
in college,

645
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:30,986
and she fell in love with me--

646
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:32,292
Way in love with me.

647
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:35,837
When I broke it off,
she was really hurt.

648
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,423
That happens with you.

649
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:39,672
Look at hodgins.

650
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,487
This was worse than hodgins.

651
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:45,221
This was, "i'm gonna run away to
europe and stop being an artist" hurt.

652
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,589
I don't really think that I have the
right to open up that can of worms again

653
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:52,423
just because some feelings
are rising to the surface.

654
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:55,607
It's too bad there isn't
a way to experiment with sexuality.

655
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,749
That's how I got into this
whole mess in the first place.

656
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,923
- Well, I meant...
- I know what you meant.

657
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,036
I'm just...

658
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,698
On the bright side,

659
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:07,702
if she did kill geoffrey thorne, you
won't have to think about any of that.

660
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:10,231
Thanks, brennan.

661
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:13,422
How long is it gonna take
you to identify the weapon?

662
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,797
I can do it right now.

663
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,059
I've seen this injury many times.

664
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,612
I'm almost certain that the
death blow came from a common fire ax.

665
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,499
There's also limestone
and silicon oxide on his clothes.

666
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,509
Mix them all together, and poof,

667
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,803
we've got a match with the concrete
floor at the gallery.

668
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,442
It turns out that not all the blood

669
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:42,070
on the floor of the gallery came from
that performance with the pig.

670
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,696
This is human.

671
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,015
Is any of it thorne's?

672
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,121
Someone worked very
hard to clean it up.

673
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,175
It's making things difficult.

674
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,853
First you destroyed geoffrey's
finest work,

675
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,685
and now you are
destroying my business.

676
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,793
You know what else got destroyed?
Geoffrey thorne.

677
00:31:56,953 --> 00:32:00,059
My grief and my business are
two separate things, agent booth.

678
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:02,061
- sir, look at this.
- Is that my fire ax?

679
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,004
Yes.

680
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:06,559
Cam said there was human
blood mixed in with the pig's.

681
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,779
I think we found it.

682
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,588
There are definite
blood stains here,

683
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:12,085
but they're underneath a layer of
what we think is turpentine.

684
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,469
- Could I borrow your lighter?
- Why do you want my lighter?

685
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:16,437
What do we know about that?

686
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:18,998
Not much. I doubt we'll
be able to identify the bleeder.

687
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,915
Hey, Bones, you know, you almost
lit my butt on fire?

688
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:28,575
Notice the flame flapped from the center
of the room toward the loading dock

689
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,550
Wait, so you're saying that thorne
was killed here and then dragged there.

690
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,915
Can we get the uv
lights over here, please?

691
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,383
Not dragged, booth.

692
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,562
Rolled.

693
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:42,185
I got to tell you,
that was a great trick there, bones.

694
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:45,439
Yeah, remove the turpentine, reveal
the blood soaked into the concrete.

695
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,836
The blood stains show up
approximately every 35 centimeters.

696
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:51,431
That would explain why hodgins
found the cement

697
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:54,100
particles on the front
and the back of the clothing.

698
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,102
Yeah, but why rolled
instead of dragged?

699
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,435
Thorne was a big guy.

700
00:32:57,555 --> 00:33:00,419
Okay, whoever killed him could
not pick him up and carry him

701
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,307
to the loading dock
and put him in the car.

702
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:04,254
They had to roll him.

703
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:05,626
You understand? Roll.

704
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,392
- Excuse me, tiny little woman.
- Yes.

705
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:10,366
Can you account for your whereabouts the
night that geoffrey thorne was killed?

706
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:12,995
Yes, I was at home.
I was reading.

707
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,619
That was a lie.

708
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,375
I was watching the real
housewives of orange county.

709
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:22,503
I find it a brilliant
postmodern performance piece.

710
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:23,755
So, no alibi.

711
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:26,549
Geoffrey's work was selling.
I was making money.

712
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,873
Why would I kill the golden goose?

713
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:31,243
I wasn't going to inherit anything.

714
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,388
Not like roxie.

715
00:33:33,318 --> 00:33:34,932
It all seems to come back to roxie.

716
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:37,242
Angela is not going to like that.

717
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:42,374
It's exactly the same situation
as the last time we were sitting here.

718
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:44,310
Except, you know, you're quieter.

719
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,999
No, that was about hodgins.

720
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,590
This is about roxie.

721
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,875
You want to have sex with roxie.

722
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,574
What was that about quieter?

723
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:55,061
I'm sorry, I'm not certain that you're
being guided by your brain, that's all.

724
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:57,124
Need can be confused with love.

725
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,124
Fantasy can convince us
that what we are feeling is love.

726
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:02,250
- You're saying this is all rebound?
- Yeah.

727
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,135
No.

728
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,498
You don't understand love, sweets.

729
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,501
I'm not as innocent
as you might think.

730
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:09,425
You have this bourgeois notion...

731
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,406
bourgeois?

732
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:13,641
... that in order for love
to be real it has to be permanent.

733
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,474
Nothing is permanent.
That's just a fact.

734
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,757
We move in and out of loving
other people, but that

735
00:34:18,877 --> 00:34:20,750
doesn't make the love any less real.

736
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,690
Perhaps you're saying this because
you've never met the love of your life.

737
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,234
I have, actually.

738
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:26,497
Many times.

739
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:27,518
Fine.

740
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:31,197
It seems to me that you always
leave yourself an escape hatch

741
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:32,627
in your relationships.

742
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,742
Because you're afraid of commitment.

743
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:36,465
Nice try.

744
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:37,846
But no.

745
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:40,250
Actually,
I commit to every person I love.

746
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,399
You marry a man and then conveniently
forget that you married him

747
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,545
because you got zonked on kava kava.

748
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:48,423
That compromises your relationship
with hodgins so that ends,

749
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,793
along with the marriage.

750
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:52,051
Now you say you have
these intense feelings

751
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:54,971
for an ex-lover whose heart
you've already broken.

752
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:58,015
Don't you see the
potential disaster here?

753
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,643
Look, you said that,
without the possibility of pain,

754
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:04,772
there can be no joy, no real love.

755
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:06,047
I said that?

756
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,025
That's beautiful.

757
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:09,600
Look...

758
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,904
I don't want to hurt roxie again.

759
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:14,840
Then don't. Don't.
Put her welfare first.

760
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,564
Let roxie decide if she's
ready to pursue this relationship.

761
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,684
Okay.

762
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,541
And what if she doesn't?

763
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:28,129
Then I'm afraid you'll
have to live with that pain.

764
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:35,441
I used a mass spectrometer during
my summer internship at johns hopkins.

765
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:37,222
I even taught my
friend how to use it.

766
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:40,470
Excellent. Next you should learn
the concept of personal space.

767
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,751
What'd you get off the ax?

768
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,567
It was wiped clean with turpentine,
no signs of blood.

769
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,097
And he also checked the handle.

770
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:49,815
- Sodium chloride and odorants.
- Sweat.

771
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:52,111
- Most likely human.
- What was the eccrine ph?

772
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,029
Seven.

773
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,346
It was a woman.

774
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,462
What you should have him do next
is match the dna

775
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:58,698
from the sweat
to angela's lesbian lover--

776
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:01,760
- see if there's a match.
- Do you ever listen to yourself?

777
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,415
Yeah, but it's a good idea, hodgins.

778
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,048
You might want to prepare Angela.

779
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,150
Doctor saroyan?

780
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,359
Thank you so much for seeing me.

781
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:26,277
I didn't agree to see you.

782
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:28,589
How come none of you people
ever book an appointment?

783
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:30,066
Frankly, it's annoying.

784
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:32,214
Annoying.
That's exactly why I'm here.

785
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:33,168
I...

786
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,491
I've done an unofficial,
confidential survey of my people and...

787
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:40,868
and they find me annoying?
No, it's worse.

788
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,171
They hate me.

789
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:43,955
You know why, don't you?

790
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,082
It's because Dr. Brennan
undervalues psychology

791
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:47,903
and all of you have
picked up her vibe.

792
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:50,528
- I know that sounds paranoid.
- and the word vibe is a little dated.

793
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:51,694
But it's true.

794
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:54,402
I'm not here about
you being annoying.

795
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,259
- It's daisy wick.
- Daisy?

796
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,886
Yes, she's very smart, very able,

797
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:01,764
and she has a knack for turning
reasonable people

798
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:05,142
into flaming gas balls of fury.

799
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,027
- You want me to talk to her?
- No, no.

800
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:10,528
I need your advice on how to tell daisy
we can't have her at the lab anymore.

801
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,057
I'm very comfortable
with incompetence,

802
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,216
but when it's just a matter
of personality...

803
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:17,071
- I'll do it.
- What? Really?

804
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:18,437
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

805
00:37:18,557 --> 00:37:21,826
Well, as the boss,
it's kind of my job to fire people.

806
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,495
And as a boss, you know that
sometimes it's better to delegate.

807
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:25,885
I'll do it.

808
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:29,196
Let's just hope she doesn't
turn me into a flaming gas ball of fury.

809
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,454
Well, I'm no psychologist,

810
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:34,908
but I think you should be
flattered that we all drop in on you

811
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,438
and ask your advice.

812
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,649
Thank you.

813
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:46,364
Okay, I'm ready for
you to blow up my mind.

814
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:50,543
Okay, now first off, I almost missed
this so, don't praise me too much.

815
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:52,132
The point is, you didn't Miss it.

816
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:54,528
Yeah, but only because angela
asked for a personal favor.

817
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,279
And I am powerless to resist.

818
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,155
Okay, now,
this is the victim's clothing.

819
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:03,298
And this is the ax handle
of the "presumed" murder weapon.

820
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,717
As you know, there were
traces of sweat on both of them.

821
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:08,122
- But not the victim's sweat.
- Female sweat.

822
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:11,051
Presumably the murderer sweat
on the ax handle

823
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:13,461
then perspired while rolling
the victim's body to the car.

824
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,610
Yes, now, upon further analysis,

825
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,452
I discovered other
traces in the sweat.

826
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:21,690
Imatinib mesylate,
hydroxyurea, busulfan.

827
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,968
Do you have any idea where
these chemicals might have come from?

828
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,592
Medicines.
Treatments for cancer.

829
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:28,763
I looked them up.

830
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:31,475
This is treatment for
chronic myelogenous leukemia.

831
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,439
Then roxie is not our murderer.

832
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,485
You can't necessarily tell if someone
has leukemia from looking at them.

833
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:39,737
No, but this drug here, busulfan,

834
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:42,046
it causes highly visible
skin discoloration.

835
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,898
Oh, then that is
very good for angela.

836
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,579
Not that we are swayed
by those considerations.

837
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:55,501
What's that look?

838
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,639
She knows who did it.

839
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:01,781
I had no reason to kill geoffrey.

840
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,386
You own several of his art pieces.

841
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:06,514
We all know that art increases
in value when an artist dies.

842
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:11,031
Anyone could see that geoffrey
thorne wasn't long for this world.

843
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:12,395
I'm a very patient woman.

844
00:39:12,555 --> 00:39:14,563
Except you're dying, ms.
Bridenbecker.

845
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,399
Nonsense.

846
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,580
- Would you please remove your makeup?
- I will not.

847
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,673
I want a lawyer.

848
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,654
Really? Because,
you know, the phone records--

849
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:25,656
they indicate that you contacted
a cancer clinic in mexico city.

850
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:29,245
And we do know that that
clinic costs a small fortune.

851
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:31,497
If it's any consolation,
it wouldn't have worked.

852
00:39:31,657 --> 00:39:34,039
Their "treatment"--
It's not legitimate.

853
00:39:34,278 --> 00:39:35,376
You don't know that.

854
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,503
I'm afraid I do.

855
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:41,173
Places like that are set up
to prey on the hopes of people like you.

856
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,652
Geoffrey was going to die anyway.

857
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:48,324
Anyone could see that.

858
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,056
I did him a favor.

859
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,829
I gave him his start.

860
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:59,409
Geoffrey would much rather
have been remembered

861
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:02,528
as a fully committed artist
than as a common murder victim.

862
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:03,840
Really?

863
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,614
Maybe he preferred to live.

864
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:10,566
Well, so would i.

865
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:14,162
I guess none of us get what we want.

866
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,474
Hey, roxie.

867
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,533
Now what do I do?

868
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,897
Well, you have money,
and you have a studio.

869
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,874
I think what you should
do is your own art, full time.

870
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,194
That's not what I mean.

871
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:49,658
Did you ever,
even for a second, think that it was me?

872
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:52,789
No.

873
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,914
Not for a second.

874
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:56,301
Why?

875
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,039
Because we...

876
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:01,854
we really knew each other
once and I don't think that...

877
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:04,204
you've changed much since then.

878
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:05,917
Have you changed?

879
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,410
Uh, I don't, I don't know, roxie.

880
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,346
Maybe I have.
But I'm not, I'm--

881
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:14,998
I haven't changed...

882
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,434
how do you think
he's going to do it?

883
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:30,157
He'll convince her that it's
best for her to move to another job.

884
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:32,759
What's going on?

885
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,849
Sweets is firing daisy for us.

886
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,189
We're wondering what
his method will be.

887
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:39,542
He'll explain to her logically

888
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:42,169
that this environment is
not conducive for either her

889
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,971
or us and, as a scientist,
she'll realize that he's right.

890
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:48,289
No, sweets is a lot
sneakier than that.

891
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:51,303
He'll use some kind of psychological
jedi mind trick

892
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:53,998
to make her think it was
her idea to quit.

893
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,600
I've got some good
news and some bad news.

894
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,556
- Which would you like first?
- The bad news.

895
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,313
You're toast here.

896
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:03,607
- Nobody wants to work with you.
- Why?

897
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:05,572
You know why, daisy.

898
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,570
There are some things
that you have to work on

899
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,786
when it comes
to interpersonal relations.

900
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:12,384
- Does anybody like me?
- No, I'm afraid not.

901
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:14,956
What's the good news?

902
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:18,873
There's no reason for us to be
discreet about our relationship anymore.

903
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:20,416
Really?

904
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,042
Yeah, why'd you ask me that?

905
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,958
Because I thought
we were being discreet

906
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:26,213
because you're a little bit
ashamed of me.

907
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,856
I'm totally shocked.

908
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:40,408
Yeah.

909
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:43,439
They should not be doing
that on the forensic platform.

910
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,474
That's a method of
termination I've never tried.

911
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,732
But bravo, Dr. Sweets.

912
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,019
They'll never work.
They're like complete opposites.

913
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,133
I agree.

914
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:56,160
For all her faults, she's a woman
of science, sweets bases

915
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,496
bases his life on the vagaries of
psychology and emotion.

916
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,499
- You know, there's no common ground.
- Right.

917
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:04,101
You need common ground.

918
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,667
- What else is there?
- Absolutely.

919
