1
00:00:12,194 --> 00:00:16,182
My name is Greg Harmalard,
and I am here to recruit you!

2
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,356
Tomorrow night, our noble
conference champions,

3
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:25,316
the Middlesex Archers...

4
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:31,272
... face the desperate and conniving

5
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:33,366
Forest Lake Otters.

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,511
Right about now,
the Otters must be wondering

7
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,079
where their mascot went.

8
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:44,863
Lake Forest sucks!
Lake Forest sucks!

9
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,963
Lake Forest sucks!

10
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,741
Archers, ready your bows.

11
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:53,427
Archers, raise your bows.

12
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:55,262
Archers, aim.

13
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,516
Archers, fire!

14
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,966
Ladies and gentlemen
of Middlesex College,

15
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:12,154
aim your weapons!

16
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,448
Oh, yeah!

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,698
Fire at will!

18
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,663
Artillery!
Fire!

19
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:23,708
Fire!

20
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,512
What is that thing?
'Cause it looks real.

21
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,661
Male.
Some of this costume

22
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,289
has fused to the remains.

23
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,853
Good morning. I'm Vernon Warner,
dean of students.

24
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:07,941
Special Agent Seeley Booth
and Dr. Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

25
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,962
There is a lot of damage
to this body.

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,057
They had a cannon.
More like a blunderbuss, really.

27
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,217
Filled to the brim
with bric-a-brac and shrapnel.

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,592
Yeah, look, I suspect
that this might be a prank.

29
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,388
- A prank?
- It's a college.

30
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,015
I suspect that one of our
less reflective frat houses

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,637
may have stolen these remains
from the, medical school.

32
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:27,395
Beta Delta Sigma.
I got missing cadaver report yesterday.

33
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,356
Bones, when I was in college,
my frat,

34
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,194
we stole a cadaver, dressed it up like
Caesar and put it on a statue of horse.

35
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,906
Would this by any chance
be a fraternity of sociopaths?

36
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,700
If the Betas did do this,
I will withdraw their certification.

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,036
Stolen cadaver was male,
73 years old.

38
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,414
His snowmobile fell through the ice.
Donated his body to science.

39
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,387
Yeah, snowmobilers and motorcyclists
are our main source of cadavers.

40
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,543
No.

41
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,421
The third molar
has not fully erupted.

42
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:55,132
I'd be surprised
if he was older than mid-20s.

43
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,719
This is not the missing cadaver?

44
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,764
I think you'll find your missing
medical school cadaver is over there.

45
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,554
- Where?
- Sitting on the bleachers.

46
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,269
- He hasn't moved since we got here.
- No, that's just campus security.

47
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,953
They're always like that.
But I'll go check it out.

48
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,166
So if he is not a stolen cadaver,
then...

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,278
He wasn't alive when our students
shot him with the cannon, was he?

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,393
I won't know cause of death
until I get him back to the lab.

51
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:21,918
Yeah, she's right.
It's your cadaver.

52
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:23,953
He reeks of formaldehyde.

53
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,791
Let's get it all back
to the Jeffersonian, shall we?

54
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,387
Looks like someone took
a flamethrower to Sasquatch.

55
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,401
This is what
he was supposed to look like.

56
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:37,007
Someone finally killed a mascot?

57
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,387
- Mr. Vaziri, do you have the X-rays?
- Yes.

58
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:45,432
I have never seen so many
foreign objects in human remains.

59
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,654
Arrows, marbles, jacks,

60
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,548
various coins, cutlery.

61
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,775
My best guess is
a nuclear explosion occurred

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,600
just as the victim
entered a 99 cent store.

63
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,723
Well... close.

64
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:59,734
He was shot by a blunderbuss,

65
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:02,116
pelted by an angry mob
and then burned.

66
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,584
Now that's what I call team spirit.

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,375
I'm a wisecracking pathologist
with a dark sense of humor.

68
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,295
It was funny. Yeah.

69
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,588
Bones - Season 4 Episode 24
"The Beaver in the Otter"

70
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,512
Synchro: ShalimarFox

71
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,451
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

72
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,621
What did they say?

73
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,010
Dishonorable discharge?

74
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,303
Court-martial convicted me
of misuse of authority

75
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,640
- and theft of government property.
- No Booth has ever

76
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,013
gotten a dishonorable discharge.

77
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,644
Yeah, no Booth has ever had to save
his brother from an insane kidnapper.

78
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,221
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:18,147
I owed you for digging me
out of crap my whole life.

80
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,569
You're gonna need a job.

81
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:23,108
I joined the navy when I was 17.

82
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,683
So a job, that's what civilians
refer to as "duty," right?

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,079
Angela identified the boy
in the otter suit.

84
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,623
- That was quick. Give me a second.
- Are you talking to me?

85
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,843
No, I'm talking to my brother.
Just one minute.

86
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,064
Do your thing.
I'll catch up with you later.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,381
- Look, I'll help you find a job.
- What, me?

88
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,964
I save your life, you find me a job.
Yeah, seems fair.

89
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,185
Yeah. I'm back.

90
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,489
The student walk-in dentist
was able to provide dental records.

91
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,554
I e-mailed you the particulars.

92
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,343
The victim is James Bouvier.

93
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:59,216
His friends called him "Beaver,"
I assume because of his last name.

94
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,859
I'm sure that's why.

95
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:05,127
Although, despite the similar sound,
"bouvier" means ox, not beaver.

96
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,254
Beaver is 23 years old

97
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,771
and a member
of the Beta Delta Sigma fraternity.

98
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:12,162
That's not a coincidence.

99
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,660
Statistically,
given the size of the campus,

100
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:17,770
it could be a complete coincidence
that the murdered student

101
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,273
is also a member of the group
of sociopathic young male

102
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,422
cadaver thieves.

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,363
Statistically, maybe.
But this is not math class, OK, Bones?

104
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:27,016
Just meet me at
Middlesex College in 30 minutes.

105
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,596
Don't mention anything about Beaver
at these people.

106
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,378
- What people?
- These people here.

107
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:36,531
They're all potential suspects.
Got it?

108
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay, so who organized
the rally last night?

109
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,901
That would be me and Gary.

110
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,321
That's, Greg Harmalard
and Gary Bacon.

111
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,566
The bonfire is kind of a tradition.

112
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,624
Me and Gary added the whole
hanging the enemy mascot element.

113
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,528
Molly brought in the band
and took care of letting everyone know

114
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,039
the where and when details.

115
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,999
Well, just an e-mail chain, really.

116
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,085
- Whose idea was the blunderbuss?
- Me again.

117
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,130
You have to understand that we had
no idea there was a cadaver in there.

118
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,387
It's from the med school?
That's what I heard.

119
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:08,510
Okay, who stole the Otter
costume from Forest Lake?

120
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:11,138
Me, Greg and Dave.

121
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,640
When you stole the costume,
was there anything inside of it?

122
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,097
Nothing.
I mean,

123
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:17,478
there was the dancing
acrobat dude, whatever, but

124
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,877
we duct-taped him
to a pole and took the suit.

125
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,798
Where was the costume
located between the time you stole it

126
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:25,819
and it was hung on the gallows,
blown up and incinerated?

127
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,156
Well, we just kicked it under there.
It's a homecoming float.

128
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,869
Me, Dave and Greg stuffed it with
cafeteria leftovers in plastic bags.

129
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,163
- The head was a cantaloupe.
- Next day,

130
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:39,917
we brought in Dave's dad's truck,
hung it up, drove it out to the rally.

131
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,332
So are any of you guys members

132
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:45,706
of the Beta Delta Sigma fraternity?

133
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,323
The Betas don't build school spirit,
they tear it down.

134
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,886
So definitely not.

135
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,104
Any of you know a guy
by the name of Jimmy Bouvier?

136
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,848
Also known as Beaver.

137
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:58,102
He's a Beta.
He's got a huge bong.

138
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,392
Beaver's okay.
You know, he's a good time guy.

139
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:02,231
He likes to throw up
a lot is all I know.

140
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,136
But if anybody
was gonna put a cadaver

141
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,652
in an otter costume,
it... it'd be Beaver.

142
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,658
I'll bet he was watching
everyone screaming

143
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,073
last night and laughing his ass off.

144
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,149
This is a commemorative pin
from the Chinese Olympics.

145
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,843
It was in what's left
of the victim's liver.

146
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,554
Ball bearing.
All this stuff is extremely common.

147
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:37,302
Nails, screws, bolts,
washers, keys...

148
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:38,350
What is this?

149
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,796
My guess, it's a USB drive.

150
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,233
What kind of people do this?

151
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,987
Perforate human remains with household
commonalities and refuse.

152
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,573
Gee, I don't know.
Every bomber who ever lived.

153
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,367
Did you make that comment
simply because I am Muslim?

154
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,740
- You serious?
- Of course.

155
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,622
Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski,

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,938
William Ayres,
Mr. George P. Metesky,

157
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:06,336
known as the original Mad Bomber.

158
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,925
Seems an insurmountable task, this.

159
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:15,333
Each of these could have
been the cause of death,

160
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,646
and yet we will not be
able to trace its...

161
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,609
Trace its...?

162
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:23,543
What?

163
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:25,022
... origin.

164
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,600
- This is a bullet.
- 22 caliber.

165
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,870
A bullet says "I wish to kill you"
much more clearly than an Olympic pin.

166
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,781
- Can we agree?
- Yeah.

167
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,502
I'm Robert Hooper,
the Beta Delta chapter president.

168
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,231
Dalton Abbot; he helped the Beaver
steal the corpse from the med school.

169
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:47,543
We don't care about the cadaver.
We want to find who killed your brother.

170
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:50,364
We agreed before you guys got here that
we'd answer any and all questions

171
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,593
you have, truthfully.

172
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:54,009
A conspiracy to tell the truth.
Interesting.

173
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,428
Eli was the Beaver's frosh.

174
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,680
You know, kind of breaking him
into the Greek life.

175
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,140
What was Beaver like?

176
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,100
He was the most popular guy
in the house.

177
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,519
No, I asked, "What was he like?"
Not, "Was he liked?"

178
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,641
What? There's a difference.

179
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,026
The Beaver was exactly like
a great guy who everybody liked.

180
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:15,989
What was Beaver's life
like outside of the fraternity?

181
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,967
Like Eli said, everybody liked him.

182
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,240
Well, except for the faculty.
He was on academic probation.

183
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,582
But academic probation is the price
you pay for everybody liking you.

184
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,703
Girlfriend?
Or is this one of those

185
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,294
bros before hos kind of frats?

186
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,171
Beaver was more like a partier.

187
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,799
Well, we do know that Beaver
was with at least one girl.

188
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,424
- Why? What makes you think so?
- Scoreboard.

189
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,137
- What?
- Beaver, one star, one conquest.

190
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,641
So do the stars here represent

191
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,209
the number of times individual
members of the fraternity

192
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,063
completed the sex act
or the number of girls?

193
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,372
The second.

194
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,358
Just curious,
do you also compare penis sizes?

195
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,027
No, only if we're really drunk
and already naked.

196
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,734
- What?
- What? I...

197
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,824
We agreed to answer
all their questions truthfully.

198
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,142
Dalton Abbot.

199
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:02,156
Very successful, according to this.

200
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,578
Compensating for something.

201
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,747
Sweets, stop psychoanalyzing
frat life,

202
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,708
just get on
with the Beaver questions.

203
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,875
Sure, of course.

204
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,378
Guys, wouldn't it be
more impressive to actually have

205
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,061
a single girl want to have
sex with you multiple times?

206
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:17,467
Unless your only objective is to impress
other adolescent males.

207
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,886
- Guys, Beaver's single star?
- Molly Briggs.

208
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:20,887
Thank you.

209
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,223
Guys, we agreed, for the last time.

210
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,060
If Harmalard found out that Beaver
was bouncing Molly, he'd kill him.

211
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,588
Greg Harmalard?

212
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,522
The guy who organized the bonfire?

213
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah. Yeah, Molly's boyfriend.
He's in ROTC.

214
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,447
They like shooting things.

215
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,082
Yeah.

216
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,891
They keep track of sexual conquests
with stars on the wall?

217
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,860
- It's emotionally stunted.
- Guys, it's a college fraternity.

218
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,035
They seem like really
terrible people.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,479
They're college kids, OK?

220
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:52,016
Their job description is to be bad.
It's what they do.

221
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,037
Yeah, but still.
A community of young men

222
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,714
mutually supporting bad decisions?

223
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,912
Look, these kids,
they go out into the world,

224
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,756
they're alone,
they've no supervision.

225
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:02,179
They have to be bad in order
to figure out what it is.

226
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,848
Scientific fact, their frontal
lobes are the size of raisins.

227
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,835
No, that is not a scientific fact.

228
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,675
What they got to do is build
their frontal lobes with exercise, OK?

229
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,761
And that comes
from doing the wrong thing.

230
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:14,024
So, you're theory is, you
got to be bad to be good?

231
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,759
Exactly. Facts of life, my friend.

232
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,819
What transmissions did
you get from the brothers?

233
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,613
Booth, he is not a radio.

234
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,531
He kind of is.
That's why I brought him.

235
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,578
What I did observe,
using my eyes and my traing,

236
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,704
is that these 3 frat brothers weren't
actually upset about Beaver's death.

237
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,612
- How do you know?
- Well, real grief

238
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:31,331
comes and goes in waves.

239
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,294
These guys had their faces
set in sadness the whole time.

240
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:37,214
- They were lying.
- I believe you're just guessing.

241
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,171
Fine.
I'm a Magic 8 Ball.

242
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,519
- I think you hurt his feelings.
- But... Did you believe him?

243
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,165
The bullet Arastoo found in the victim's
remains was a 22 caliber.

244
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,358
- Light and relatively undamaged.
- Low-pressure rimfire cartridge.

245
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,277
Which is consistent
with ROTC small arms.

246
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,916
So, you recognize this pistol?

247
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,699
Yes, sir.
It's a Beretta U22 Neos,

248
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,624
LR with a six inch barrel,

249
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,379
ten round capacity, low blade
front sights and adjustable rear sights.

250
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,381
I'm in ROTC.
I know my weapons.

251
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,306
You should know this one
particularly well

252
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,999
because it was last
signed out to you.

253
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:28,113
FBI ballistics has ascertained
that this gun fired this bullet.

254
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,726
- Where did you find the bullet?
- In Beaver's corpse.

255
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,146
- Beaver's dead?
- He's catching on pretty good.

256
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,772
Wait, I never shot Beaver.

257
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,233
Did you fire this gun at the rally?

258
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,382
Yes, sir, I did,
but I loaded it with blanks.

259
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,114
That was Beaver hanging
in the Otter mascot outfit?

260
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,075
He's quite adept at putting
the puzzle together.

261
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,474
- What he was doing in there?
- We were hoping that maybe

262
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,955
- you'ld be able to tell us.
- Look, I told you.

263
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,075
- I loaded the gun with blanks.
- Did you check the chamber?

264
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,334
I think so.

265
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,800
Well, obviously,
you are either careless

266
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,782
or you intended to fire the bullet.

267
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,173
Or somebody, you know, sabotaged me.

268
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:07,262
Beaver had to be hanging up
there for at least an hour before...

269
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:10,891
No way that Beaver was still
alive when I fired, right?

270
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,685
I had no idea it was Beaver.
I had no reason to shoot him.

271
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,375
Except for the fact that
he slept with your girlfriend.

272
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:20,799
I don't...
I don't want to sound conceited,

273
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:23,972
but look at Beaver.
Look at Molly.

274
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,490
Look at me.

275
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,475
Me and Beaver?
Sexually?

276
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,375
Do I look like a blow-up doll?

277
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,499
Beaver told his fraternal brothers
that he had sex with you.

278
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:38,168
Yeah? Well, he lied.

279
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,128
Look, I'll give you DNA

280
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,074
or whatever you want.
And then you can do me a favor

281
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,217
and broadcast the results
across the campus.

282
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,176
Thanks.

283
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:49,465
We don't have anything
to compare her DNA to.

284
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:50,925
I have an idea.

285
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,472
We're going to collect his
sheets off his bed?

286
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:56,075
Yes. And then we
will check them for DNA,

287
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,231
see if he had sexual
intercourse with Molly Briggs.

288
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,692
Who's going to check
the kid's sheets?

289
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,710
Seems like a bad job to me.

290
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,003
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.

291
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,749
Members of Beta Delta Sigma,

292
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,699
I ask that you form in your mind

293
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:22,294
your favorite image
of our fallen brother,

294
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,313
Jimmy "the Beaver" Bouvier.

295
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:27,951
- Why are they all wearing bedsheets?
- It's a toga memorial.

296
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:30,275
And with that image
firm in your mind,

297
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,513
I say, drink!

298
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,059
Excuse me?

299
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,399
Why did yout take
the sheets from Beaver's room?

300
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,565
'Cause that room is sealed for evidence
and you will be prosecuted.

301
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,651
Good one, now no one's going
to admit to having Beaver's sheets.

302
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,573
Then, we'll have to take them all.

303
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,399
You can take mine, pretty lady.

304
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,282
Yeah, yeah.
You heard them, boys.

305
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,658
Give them your sheets.

306
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,389
I'll meet you back at the lab, okay?

307
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,377
Can... Can I offer
you anything, ma'am?

308
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
No.

309
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,576
- What do you think?
- Yeah, it's nice.

310
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,575
Not really going to do you much good
here in the wintertime. That's for sure.

311
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,067
You're always practical?

312
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,612
- Listen, I got you a job interview.
- Yeah?

313
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,459
An army buddy of mine is looking

314
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,748
for someone to head up his
criminal intelligence unit.

315
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,868
You found me a job
in less than 24 hours?

316
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,829
- Just an interview. You want my car?
- No.

317
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:41,333
Jared, you can't show up
to a job interview on a bike.

318
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,001
I'm not going to the interview.

319
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,197
- Why?
- Because I don't want a job.

320
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:48,298
- I'm going on a trip.
- You're going on a trip? Where?

321
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,035
I've always wanted to see India.

322
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,010
Without, you know,
spying on Pakistan.

323
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:56,427
I see. So you're going to somehow
get this bike to India, ride it around?

324
00:16:56,773 --> 00:16:59,128
What if it breaks down?
What are you going to do for parts?

325
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,556
What am I going to do for parts
if it breaks down in India?

326
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:04,439
- That's all you have to say?
- Just go on the interview.

327
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Would you...

328
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,988
You forgot to tell me to get shots
and not to talk to strangers.

329
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,127
So, were you able
to match sheets with boys?

330
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,399
Believe me, there was
enough DNA on these sheets

331
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:31,199
to paint a very clear picture
of life at Beta Delta Sigma.

332
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,919
For example, these 2 boys

333
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:35,154
were carrying on a sexual
relationship with each other.

334
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,199
Those 2 guys
are sleeping with the same girl.

335
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,199
Although, refreshingly,
not at the same time.

336
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,724
What about Beaver?

337
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,812
- Lots and lots of DNA.
- All of it his own.

338
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,232
There was no DNA on any of the sheets
that could be Molly Briggs'?

339
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,075
Vaginal contributions were found
on eight of the sets of sheets.

340
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,806
None from Molly Briggs.
But Dr. Hodgins did find

341
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:54,823
something more than semen
on Beaver's sheets.

342
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,099
Yeah, I found evidence
of vegetable-based Lanol,

343
00:17:57,224 --> 00:18:00,245
assorted liposomes, Sepigel,
and micronized estriol.

344
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,831
- Ointment.
- From the stain's position on the sheet

345
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,071
and its shape,
which was approximately

346
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,375
3 inches long by 1
and one-quarter inch wide...

347
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,775
Okay, we get it.

348
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,616
... the substance appears to have
transferred from the victim's...

349
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,383
penis directly to the bedsheet.

350
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,151
Adolescent males will use almost

351
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:17,137
any available lubricant
when masturbating.

352
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,430
Even estrogen cream?

353
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,500
A more plausible scenario has
got Beaver sexing it up

354
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,061
at a different location
then coming home to his own bed naked

355
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,397
and, I refer again to the imprint.

356
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,175
- Sex with...
- An older woman. Yeah.

357
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,125
- Yeah, most likely menopausal.
- Molly Briggs is 20.

358
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,775
Also, I finished my autopsy
and the bullet shot by Greg Harmalard

359
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,201
- was definitely not cause of death.
- He was dead when it struck him?

360
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,075
- For at least 12 hours.
- So, we still have no cause of death.

361
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,573
Well, I got a theory.

362
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,275
Kid died of dehydration.

363
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,500
Forgot to replenish his fluids.

364
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:59,480
- What are we looking for this time?
- You know, photos, love notes...

365
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,175
I don't know.
Fur, gray hair...

366
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,435
Anything that's going to help us
identify Beaver's cougar.

367
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,523
Beaver, otter, cougar...

368
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,981
This case is like a day at the zoo.

369
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,233
A cougar is an older woman
who prefers younger men.

370
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,999
Wouldn't that indicate
that every woman is a cougar?

371
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,175
Thanks for the insight there, Bones.

372
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,375
Okay, what's the,
victim's birth date?

373
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,367
11-05-89.

374
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,453
I'm Jared's older brother.
He should listen to me.

375
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:26,652
I could provide you with several
societies where younger brothers

376
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:30,084
are require dunder threat of death to do
what their older brothers tell them.

377
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,046
- I like those societies.
- They're mostly extinct now.

378
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:37,275
Did you give me Beaver's birth
date the scientific way?

379
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,593
Day, month, year.

380
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,024
If you want month, day, year...
05-11-89.

381
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,675
Look at that.
Next time I ask you a question,

382
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,019
just answer it in American.
That's all.

383
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,273
- Kid had some cash.
- Maybe he was a drug dealer.

384
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:56,069
What are those?
Some kind of code books?

385
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,687
You got that right.

386
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,781
Was our victim some kind of spy?

387
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,367
It's worse.
He was some kind of bookie.

388
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,256
- Well, Booth mostly broke the code.
- That's right.

389
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,675
Column one is initials
and nicknames.

390
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,421
Beaver had approximately
50 regular clients.

391
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:17,320
Column two is the day of the week.

392
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,775
What is the significance
of this sequence?

393
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,626
"Foot, bat, pig, dimple, fish."

394
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,348
Those are sports he took bets on.
Football, basketball, baseball,

395
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,417
soccer, golf.

396
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:29,267
Beaver had over $2,000
in the suitcase.

397
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:32,688
This whole operation
generated $12,000 this year.

398
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,025
No wonder this kid did not
want to lose academic standing.

399
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,518
All right, now, 3 of these people,
Zimmer, CC,

400
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:40,989
and 4x4...

401
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,158
they all owed him
over three grand apiece.

402
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,775
- Do you think that could be motive?
- I bet those are the 3 guys

403
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,484
- Sweets said were faking grief.
- Yeah, that is worth looking into.

404
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:51,958
Okay, I found something else
in his computer.

405
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,378
A month ago, he hacked into the
university's computer system,

406
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,994
and went straight to the chemistry
professor's secure server

407
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,819
and downloaded the exam.

408
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:01,676
This guy was a true entrepreneur.

409
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,596
Yeah. It was the third time
he hacked into the chemistry page.

410
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,364
Who was the professor?

411
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:10,018
Professor Marlene Twardosh.

412
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,999
Out of all the damages
the victim's remains suffered

413
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,746
from the blunderbuss, 23 fractures.

414
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,947
I discovered only three
that occurred before he died.

415
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,158
Do any of them offer us
cause of death?

416
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,424
I think not.

417
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,967
Both wrists sustained
compression fractures.

418
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:32,597
The right radius, the left ulna
and significant chipping

419
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:35,627
to both the proximal
and distal carpal rows,

420
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:38,814
and compression
of the lateral epicondyles.

421
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:42,133
- What about the third?
- Compression fracture here,

422
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,844
at the coccyx
and the apex of the sacrum.

423
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,764
These injuries appear to have
occurred at the same time.

424
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:50,220
He fell backwards,
tried to break his fall

425
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:51,935
with his hands stretched behind him.

426
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,325
Dr. Hodgins had an idea
of how to figure out

427
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,147
the height
from which the victim fell.

428
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,409
This should be good.

429
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:04,900
The FBI is investigating
student cheating?

430
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,291
Who says America
undervalues education?

431
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,975
Did any of your students
do suspiciously well on your last exam?

432
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,900
Starting with James Bouvier.

433
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,752
Beaver has never done suspiciously
well at anything, Agent Booth.

434
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,130
He was about to be expelled
because he failed my course.

435
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:24,050
Did he show any signs
that he wanted to do any better?

436
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:25,648
You mean, begging for mercy

437
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:28,096
or offering bribes
and sexual favors?

438
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,556
- That sort of thing?
- Do you use an estrogen cream?

439
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:31,849
No.

440
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:35,061
I make do with the meager hormones
I produce naturally.

441
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:35,999
Why?

442
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:37,939
Did you have sexual intercourse
with him?

443
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,315
What are you...?

444
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:42,527
I was joking
about the sexual favors.

445
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,195
Also about the bribes?

446
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,700
My God, you people are humorless.

447
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,870
Five students failed this exam.

448
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:54,999
It was a tough exam.

449
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,418
They got exactly
the same score: 37%.

450
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,375
What are the chances of that?

451
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,599
I teach chemistry.

452
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,104
You'll have to ask
Professor DeWitt in Statistics.

453
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,799
The same five students

454
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,262
did extremely well on
the two tests preceding this one.

455
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,175
- What are you getting at?
- I believe Professor Twardosh

456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,684
realized that these students
had stolen her tests

457
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,175
in the past, and instead of informing
the university,

458
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,648
she planted a fake test online.

459
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,475
To turn her students in?

460
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:25,299
No. That would result in hearings

461
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:28,273
and excuses and tears and parents.

462
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:29,532
I hate parents.

463
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,599
Your college experience
was with professors.

464
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:34,080
Mine was with students and jocks.
What are you getting at here?

465
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,664
I believe Professor Twardosh
took revenge

466
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,209
against unethical students
who had no respect for knowledge.

467
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,248
- And you approve?
- Yes, I do.

468
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:44,630
Beaver was obviously
an emerging criminal.

469
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:49,675
Thank you. I may need you to testify
at my termination hearing

470
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,429
when the university finds out.

471
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,799
Can I ask you one question?
What floor is your office on?

472
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,768
- The third floor.
- Over grass?

473
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,236
Over flagstones.

474
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:01,064
On my bad days, I consider jumping.

475
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,359
You're a forensic
anthropologist, correct?

476
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:06,875
- Would it kill me?
- No, Professor Twardosh.

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,906
It would probably
just break a few bones.

478
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,240
That's good to know.

479
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,975
So, I checked out the nicknames
of the kids who owed Beaver money.

480
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,678
Are those the guys you picked out
as not being sad he was dead?

481
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,775
Yeah.
You're walking pretty fast.

482
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,464
So, any of those 3 frat guys
set off your psycho-killer alarm?

483
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,591
No, no, no.
They display a fairly banal mix

484
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,673
of social awkwardness, narcissism,

485
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,998
inappropriate fantasies,
all within the normal range.

486
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,182
Even the ROTC guy?

487
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,893
Well, like most overachievers,
he displays a slight

488
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,411
Oedipal neuroses.

489
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,439
Will you tell me
why you're so agitated?

490
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,975
You know what?
My brother Jared is ruining his life.

491
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,694
He's drinking again?

492
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,030
I'm sure he was dried
out before his court-martial.

493
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,116
Then why the recent urge
to self-destruct?

494
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,898
I set up a perfectly great
job interview for him.

495
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:57,900
But instead, you know what
he decides to do?

496
00:24:58,025 --> 00:25:01,502
He wants to just travel across
India on his motorcycle.

497
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:05,699
Yeah, that's right. Talk about
a narcissistic dependence on stupidity!

498
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:07,296
You or him?

499
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,258
This is exactly why I don't talk to you
about these kind of things.

500
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,136
I'm gonna suggest that you're jealous
of your brother's decision.

501
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:14,886
I don't want to go to India.

502
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:17,598
You feel trapped here
by your responsible nature,

503
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,683
your job,
your interpersonal relations.

504
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:22,061
- What?
- Whereas Jared is completely free.

505
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,699
I am free.
I am free as a bird.

506
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,475
Free to do whatever I want.

507
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,142
Yeah, but what you're not free to do
is control your brother's life.

508
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:30,968
Control Jared?
Good luck with that one.

509
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:32,459
It's not for a lack of trying.

510
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,910
Of course, you could always get
a motorbike and go with him.

511
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,951
Motorbike.
A motorbike is used

512
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:39,787
for people who deliver
pizzas in Amsterdam.

513
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,707
You know, India is large.

514
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,041
It's vast.

515
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,690
Get a motorcycle.

516
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,117
Right.

517
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,415
I'd get an American motorcycle.

518
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,185
This dummy is exactly the same
weight as the victim, correct?

519
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:05,259
69.853 kilograms, yes.

520
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,065
And why are we the only ones here?

521
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:11,201
I... asked everyone to leave.

522
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,822
OK, now, I've installed force sensors
in the wrists and the back of the spine.

523
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,597
We should be able to gauge
the height

524
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:20,275
from which the victim fell to within a
few centimeters after only a few trials.

525
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:22,275
Why did you ask everyone to leave?

526
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,219
- Are we doing something shameful?
- No, it's just...

527
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,275
last time I dropped something
from up there, it bounced and injured...

528
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,546
an innocent bystander.

529
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:33,397
But nobody's here this time so...

530
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,075
Coccyx test number one,
Dr. Jack Hodgins supervising.

531
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,059
No.

532
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,575
No, no, no.
I... No.

533
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,450
- But...
- No. No. Stop.

534
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,099
This is an unnecessary experiment.

535
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,687
The height of the fall can be
calculated mathematically.

536
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,875
That is true, but I decided
to humor Dr. Hodgins

537
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,901
so we could bond over a project.

538
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,363
- Why do you need to bond?
- He mistrusts Muslims.

539
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,370
Go grab a beer together,
but I am saying no to this experiment.

540
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,248
Yeah, I got that during the part where
you said "No" 7 times in a row.

541
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,875
I find that you don't pay
attention to the first six.

542
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,044
He can't drink beer.
He's Muslim!

543
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,075
All right.

544
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,926
Hodgins and Arastoo have an estimate
of how far the victim fell.

545
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,469
1.37 meters onto a hard surface.

546
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:24,141
You know what this means?

547
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,436
Yup. Dr. Brennan's gonna stare
at the bones until they speak to her.

548
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,147
So, rock, paper, scissors to see
who stays to baby-sit her?

549
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,749
Best two out of three.

550
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:39,865
Damn.

551
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:30,816
Cam?

552
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:37,675
Booth will want to know.
I found cause of death.

553
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,316
All right.

554
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,146
<i>Professor Twardosh
was not Beaver's sex partner.</i>

555
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,980
Okay, did anyone think that?
Honestly? Because I did not.

556
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,340
Booth believes that the cringe factor
was too high,

557
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,943
even though cringe factor is not
a valid mathematical construct.

558
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:00,299
Believe me, it is, okay?

559
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:03,616
So, the three boys that owe
Beaver the money all have alibis.

560
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,449
Four people bought
the bogus exam from Beaver.

561
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:09,275
All members of the golf team.
At the time of his death, though,

562
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,374
they were at a tournament
in North Carolina.

563
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,799
Great. So all we know now
is that golfers cheat a lot.

564
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:18,506
We know that Beaver was killed
by being stabbed in the chest.

565
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,509
Very small hole. Perhaps an ice pick?
It punctured his aorta.

566
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,705
He bled to death.

567
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,875
We also know that shortly before
he died, he fell backward

568
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,517
1.37 meters, fracturing
his wrists and his coccyx.

569
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,061
So he was stabbed and he fell backwards.
That makes sense.

570
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,731
Something's bothering me about this.
I went through that kid's computer,

571
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,552
and there's absolutely no indication
that he had the skill to hack

572
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,444
into the university's secure server.

573
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,175
Yeah, well, he probably got his
fraternity brothers to hack in for him.

574
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,909
Mr. Vaziri and I will figure out exactly
what weapon killed Beaver.

575
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,953
- Great.
- What are you going to do?

576
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:50,621
- Something personal.
- What?

577
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Personal.

578
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,376
Personal means personal, you know?
Not for the public.

579
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,002
I'm...

580
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,250
I'm not the public.

581
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:05,799
You know, the roads suck in
India when they're dry.

582
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:08,389
And they turn into rivers
when the monsoons come.

583
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:10,516
Trucks don't even give
way to anyone.

584
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,803
Will you give the lifeguard
thing a rest?

585
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:15,664
The State Department has advised that
there's a heightened security concern

586
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,606
for anyone traveling alone in India.

587
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:20,860
Then come with me. That way
you can watch over me every minute.

588
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,675
You know, everywhere you've gone,
you've always had the full might

589
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,739
of the United States
government behind you.

590
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,999
Yeah, I know.

591
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:30,536
You were a frontline guy, a fire-eater,
and I was just some rear echelon wimp.

592
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,581
- I never said that.
- You're so worried, come along.

593
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,702
Then I'll have the full might
of Seeley Booth behind me.

594
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:37,710
Seriously?

595
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:42,941
I didn't think you were serious.

596
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,901
I wasn't when I said it...

597
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,052
but now I am.

598
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,375
Yeah, I'm serious.

599
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,852
You want me to come to India
with you?

600
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:55,124
Ball's in your court, brother.

601
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,375
I'm a freshman pledge.

602
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,076
Beaver was kinda like my mentor
in the fraternity.

603
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:14,399
When Beaver, uh, your mentor,
asked you

604
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,957
to hack into
Professor Twardosh's files

605
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,376
to steal tests, what did you think?

606
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,432
At first, I said no.

607
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,675
- But you know what?
- He was your brother.

608
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,676
That's right.

609
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,515
He was a brother
who was on academic probation.

610
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,182
I mean, he was gonna get expelled
if he didn't pass the Chem course.

611
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,101
Plus, I know it may not have
looked like it from the outside, but...

612
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,919
Beaver was a great guy.

613
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,439
So, I had to help him.

614
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,575
Our computer expert said
that some info was erased

615
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,945
from Beaver's hard drive.

616
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,346
Erased by someone
who knew what they were doing.

617
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,821
That was me, too.

618
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,284
JPEG files.
I think about 30 of them.

619
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,323
- Digital photographs.
- Yeah. I didn't see any of them,

620
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:59,098
but before I permanently deleted them,
he had asked to put four specific ones

621
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:00,459
onto a USB drive.

622
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,696
So I did.

623
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Look...

624
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,324
I told you everything okay?

625
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,475
But if my college finds out that
I hacked into the Chem test,

626
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,475
they're gonna kick me
to the curb, okay?

627
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,999
They don't care about brothers.

628
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,433
Well, I care about brothers
who are great guys, Eli.

629
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,853
But more importantly,
I report to the FBI,

630
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
not Middlesex College.

631
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:24,567
Thanks.

632
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,719
- What do you got?
- We found the hacker,

633
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:32,381
who told Sweets
he put some very sensitive images

634
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:33,775
on a USB for Beaver.

635
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,599
A damaged USB drive was
amongst the shrapnel

636
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,831
that Mr. Vaziri removed
from the remains.

637
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,475
There are four JPEG files
on this drive.

638
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,075
Two of them are total goners.

639
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,602
But here's what I got
from number three.

640
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,466
Concentrate there.
Looks like a face.

641
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,175
Yeah, that's Beaver.

642
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,428
- Is he being tortured?
- Not exactly.

643
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,804
That's a sex face.

644
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:56,515
Can you pull up anything else
and see who he's with?

645
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,432
But this one's almost done.

646
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,107
- Is that a cougar?
- She could be in her 40s.

647
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,985
Okay, print it. We'll see which member
of the faculty this one is.

648
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:18,102
There is no accelerated compression
of the bone around the wound.

649
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:21,675
So, the shaft of the weapon
was uniform in thickness.

650
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,405
If there were no lip on
the outside, then we'd know

651
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,378
it was a projectile
that caused the wound.

652
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,247
Yes, a one way trip, so to speak.

653
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:31,383
But since there was a lip,
we know it was a return trip

654
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,136
for the weapon into
the aorta and back.

655
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,888
As the weapon entered,

656
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,422
it was going substantially faster
than when it was with drawn.

657
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,799
A shaft of consistent width.

658
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,774
Someone hammered a nail into
the victim then pulled it out?

659
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,892
No, not hammered, Mr. Vaziri.

660
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,050
Shot.

661
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:52,154
A nail gun.

662
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:57,326
You recognize this woman,
Dean Warner?

663
00:33:58,141 --> 00:33:59,536
Yes, I know this woman.

664
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,675
- Where did you get the photo?
- Off the victim's computer.

665
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,791
Who is she?

666
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:08,212
Her name is Meredith Warner.
He is my wife.

667
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,075
We've been trying to track down
your wife, and guess what?

668
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,017
It's been a week
since anyone saw her.

669
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:25,199
You think I killed my wife
and James Bouvier?

670
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,099
Have you seen the
photographs before?

671
00:34:27,224 --> 00:34:28,775
Yes, just over a week ago.

672
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,501
Which is when
I suggested to Meredith

673
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:32,736
that it was a good time
to visit her sister in Toronto.

674
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,571
Why was it a good time?

675
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,799
Because the boy threatened to
put the photos of them together

676
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:40,202
all over the Internet if
I didn't let him stay in school.

677
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,996
Beaver failed his chemistry test.
You were going to expel him.

678
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,041
Yeah, I declined to be blackmailed.

679
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:49,086
Did the photos ever appear
on the Internet?

680
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,790
They did not.

681
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,090
Is that because you killed Beaver?

682
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:59,304
I have nothing more to say to you
except that I did not kill the boy.

683
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,597
I'm even a little
sorry that he's dead.

684
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,351
So, either arrest me and let me
call my lawyer or let me go.

685
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,775
Okay. Vernon Warner,
I am placing you under arrest

686
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,982
for the murder of James Bouvier.

687
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,957
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

688
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:15,532
You have the right
to remain silent...

689
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:20,229
It doesn't make sense. I mean,
logically, It doesn't make sense.

690
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,105
I know.

691
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,975
The dean kills the kid
with a nail gun,

692
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,458
then places him in the mascot costume
that's full of leftovers?

693
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,478
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's what I said.

694
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:32,285
That's what I'm saying, too.
It doesn't make sense.

695
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,959
- Why did you arrest him?
- Pissed me off,

696
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,676
Instead of helping us,
he starts screaming for a lawyer.

697
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:44,683
Jared wants me
to go to India with him.

698
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:47,475
- Indiana?
- India, okay?

699
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,313
Taj Mahal, cows, tigers,

700
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,275
cobras, Slumdog Millionaire.

701
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,358
I know. Are you going?

702
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,695
- We don't like each other.
- So, not going?

703
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,907
- But, he's my brother so, I love him.
- I'm confused. You are going?

704
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,575
I mean, Jared should
not go to India alone.

705
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,913
- He'll get into all kinds of trouble.
- You said he's never been alone.

706
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,040
Exactly, you know what?
He'll get eaten alive.

707
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,501
Well, if you go with him,
then he won't be alone.

708
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,851
You won't let him be bad,
and his frontal lobe

709
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:15,798
will always be the size of a raisin.
That's what you said.

710
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,591
Makes no scientific sense.

711
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,324
Yeah, you said.

712
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:21,804
Got it.

713
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:29,075
I did an inventory of the nails
found in the victim's body.

714
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,299
There were 36.

715
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:34,175
Arastoo, we know the nail that pierced
the aorta was pulled out of the victim.

716
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,175
Yes, but I thought perhaps the killer
didn't throw it away.

717
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,071
Perhaps he simply
left it on the body.

718
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,850
- One never knows.
- One never does.

719
00:36:41,975 --> 00:36:44,323
I examined the nails
very carefully for marks

720
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:47,075
that would confirm it
was shot from a nail gun.

721
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,385
A nail gun leaves distinctive marks.

722
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,106
Not from the hammering
mechanism, you understand,

723
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,808
but from the reloading mechanism.

724
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,275
Why are you telling me this?

725
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,475
Dr. Brennan said to be
especially polite to you

726
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,175
when the science was difficult.

727
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,165
How stupid do you people think I am?

728
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,720
- Yeah?
- Do you recognize this nail?

729
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,232
She's the one you want.

730
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Beaver came up to me.
I was working on the float.

731
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,666
He was always hitting on me.

732
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:14,676
- You didn't like Jimmy?
- Not in that way, you know?

733
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,169
Why did you,

734
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,004
shoot Beaver with the nail gun?

735
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,050
Look, everybody went for a coffee.

736
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,260
I stayed.
Beaver must've been waiting

737
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,012
'cause he shows up and he's all,

738
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,999
"Come on,
everybody thinks we're doing it.

739
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,375
You might as well make it official."

740
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:33,449
And I've been up all night.

741
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:34,770
All night, right?

742
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:37,275
- Working.
- So, he moves in closer

743
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,975
and sticks his tongue
right in my mouth.

744
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,569
- That's assault.
- Right, that is assault.

745
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,781
You're right, it's assault.
Go on.

746
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,409
And, you know,
I've got this nail gun, and I just

747
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,684
pull the trigger and...

748
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:55,823
Beaver falls off the float
onto his back and he's hurt.

749
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,716
He's hurt with this

750
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,962
nail sticking out
of his chest and he says,

751
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,175
"Pull it out! Pull it out!"
And I say to him, I've seen on TV,

752
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,093
things like this, you leave it in.
Leave it in!

753
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,844
But he pulls it out himself.

754
00:39:08,163 --> 00:39:10,180
You're right.
And he dies.

755
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,999
Everybody believed that
we were sleeping together.

756
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:16,061
Maybe they would believe
I killed him.

757
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:17,799
So, I put his body

758
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:21,144
in the mascot uniform
before anyone came back.

759
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,979
I have to admit,

760
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,862
I'm impressed that you
picked her out of the crowd.

761
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,974
How did you do it?

762
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,723
You're not going to believe me anyway.
You're just going to say I guessed.

763
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:33,370
Have it your way.
I guessed.

764
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,599
No, I don't think you're serious.

765
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:37,724
I'd like to know what you saw.

766
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,900
Thank you so much.

767
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:57,019
- You're not coming, are you?
- You really want me to?

768
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:58,437
Does it matter?

769
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,775
You know, I was going to,
I really was,

770
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,260
but, I think you should go alone.

771
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,114
- You think it's a good idea for me?
- Yeah, I do... Alone.

772
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,701
Our whole lives as kids,
I was always standing behind you.

773
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,348
Or you had the navy
standing behind you.

774
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:18,165
But this time, you know,
I think you should stand alone.

775
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:21,573
- You don't need your big brother.
- Thanks.

776
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:22,919
So, come as a friend.

777
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,872
We both know I'm not your friend.

778
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,841
I'm your big brother.

779
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Yep.

780
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:33,074
Right.

781
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,500
Right, so...

782
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:39,908
I got you something.

783
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,357
- It's Grandpa's St. Christopher medal.
- No, no.

784
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:46,276
It's a new one.
I got you that.

785
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,375
It looks like the one
Grandpa gave you.

786
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,375
No... Grandpa gave me mine
when I was shipped out to the Rangers.

787
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,800
This one, I'm giving to you.
Patron saint of travelers.

788
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:56,787
Kept me safe in Somalia.

789
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,539
Let's hope it does
the same for you in India.

790
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,075
You know, wear it around your neck.

791
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,504
I don't know, man.
Am I alone if I take a saint with me?

792
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,191
You're not alone.

793
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,333
All right.

794
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:25,799
Thanks.

795
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:28,208
Your jacket.

796
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,249
- How did he take it?
- Like Jared. Meaning I have no idea.

797
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,024
So...

798
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:47,616
do you...

799
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,341
Do you really think
you have to be bad to be good?

800
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:52,924
Yeah, I do.

801
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:58,932
Well, I've never done anything bad.

802
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:00,725
- I believe you.
- I mean,

803
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,530
I've made mistakes, of course,

804
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:04,896
but I've never purposely

805
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,400
- done anything bad.
- And I believe you.

806
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,778
I don't want my frontal lobe
to be a dried-up raisin.

807
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:16,449
You know what? We are gonna
do something bad now.

808
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:19,536
- What?
- Have you ever dined and dashed?

809
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,829
You know the concept?

810
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,268
We're gonna run out of here
without paying the bill.

811
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:25,125
No, that's stealing.

812
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,875
That's why they call it "bad."
We're doing something bad. You ready?

813
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,962
I can't, really.

814
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,797
- No! Are you serious?
- One...

815
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:33,425
- Two...
- No... Oh, my God! Are you serious?

816
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,075
Go, go, go, go.

817
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,250
Oh, God, we're bad!
We're bad!

818
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,424
Easy, easy, easy, easy!

819
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,150
- Get in the car!
- I knew that.

820
