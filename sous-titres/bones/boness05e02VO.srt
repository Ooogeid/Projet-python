1
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:22,964
A rolex?
They just gave you a rolex?

2
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,709
My book was number one
on the best seller list for 12 weeks.

3
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,415
It sold 630,000 copies.

4
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,086
They're, you know,
showing their appreciation.

5
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,136
So that means that you made...

6
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:34,151
I don't really know
how much, actually,

7
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:36,262
But I was told I'll never
have to work again.

8
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,368
What? No!
Slow down, pal.

9
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:43,493
That is extortion right there.

10
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,291
What? No.
No, forget it.

11
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,523
No, no way I'm paying that, bye.

12
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,670
Plumber, he wants
to charge me 800 bucks

13
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,254
to fix the plumbing in my walls.
I'll do it myself.

14
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,653
That should be no problem.
You've told me numerous times

15
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:57,777
- How skilled you are as a repairman.
- Right, since after the coma,

16
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,827
I seem to have forgotten
a few things.

17
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,079
I'm gonna have to figure out
how to do it again.

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,485
I could lend you some money.
OK, miss rolex, I'll be fine.

19
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,752
- If you change your mind...
- All right. This is why I hate cats.

20
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,604
They're feral.
They're natural scavengers.

21
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,545
Hodgins is going to have to sift through
their excrement for evidence.

22
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,416
Don't want to take
his fun away from him?

23
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,265
I need all these cats brought back
to the Jeffersonian.

24
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,222
- Come on!
- Puss, puss, puss...

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,849
Pussy! Move!

26
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,619
Get out of there!

27
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,689
The victim is an adult male,
caucasian.

28
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:33,110
Bullet wounds to both
the sternum and the third left rib.

29
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,489
Hand is severed just
below the radius.

30
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,949
Anything left of this guy.
How long has he been out there?

31
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,745
From the degree of scavenging,
I'd say two days. Come on.

32
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,663
You, parking guy.

33
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,858
You the guy who found him?
My partner here says

34
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,419
That he has been
kitty kibble for two days.

35
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:54,525
- Why didn't you notice him sooner?
- This structure is long-term parking.

36
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,995
Roof isn't used much.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,235
People don't like their cars
baking in the sun...

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,846
- Security cameras around here?
- Somebody cut the feed.

39
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,934
He suffered comminuted
fractures to the femur.

40
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,185
Right, he broke his leg, I get it.

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,470
Someone ran over
him after he was shot.

42
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,650
You, do me a favor and pull some,
paint samples off that speed bump, OK?

43
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,530
Why are the cats staring at us?

44
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,767
Michelle's been asking for months
if we can get a kitten.

45
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,225
I'm thinking no.

46
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,406
Actually, it's much
more likely the family dog

47
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,587
would attack and consume its owner.

48
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,823
Can you pass me the forceps?
I think I see something.

49
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,694
It appears to be steel wool.
I found it in the exit wound.

50
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,645
Steel wool... commonly used in silencers
to muffle the sound of a gunshot.

51
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,505
A silencer definitely points
to a professional hit.

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,484
An ilizarov apparatus was used
to lengthen his bone

53
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,611
when he was a child,
so he was definitely Russian.

54
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:01,261
- Don't people limp in every country?
- Prior to 1981, the ilizarov apparatus

55
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,305
was used exclusively
in the soviet union.

56
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,785
Ergo, dead russian.

57
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:08,434
- Very good, mr. Bray.
- Yeah, don't often get to say "ergo."

58
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,406
And, for bonus points,
any clue why his hand was chopped off?

59
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,810
The bone has been chipped
and bruised around the triquetral,

60
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,339
Like someone was trying
to pull something off his wrist.

61
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,551
And when they couldn't,
they cut off his hand.

62
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,553
Wendell, my man,
we still on for lunch?

63
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,223
You are discussing lunch
while holding a tray of cat excrement.

64
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,809
Everybody poops.
They even wrote a book about it.

65
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,811
I found a piece of plastic

66
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,898
in the cat's feces
from a bag of airline peanuts.

67
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,106
Aeroflot.

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,236
Preferred airline of mother Russia.

69
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:42,072
Looks like our russian friend
was a recent arrival.

70
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:46,201
Yuri Antonov.

71
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:49,342
He's a courier for
a Ukraine diamond manufacturer.

72
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,749
- That's it?
- Why are you state department on it.

73
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:53,876
Because that's not it.

74
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:56,350
What is "it"?
What else do you have for me?

75
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,878
I was told to assess whether
you'd be the best agent

76
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:02,176
with whom to entrust some
very sensitive information.

77
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,385
This is my case.

78
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,847
State is supervising, agent Booth.
We...

79
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:10,267
I approve the investigator.

80
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,485
You, I... okay, an ex-army ranger

81
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,534
with multiple commendations
and a pristine record at the FBI

82
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,274
isn't good enough for you or them?

83
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,018
- You shot a clown.
- It was a mechanical clown.

84
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,697
You're telling me
you never wanted to do that?

85
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:28,994
This one has to be done with discretion.
I mean, it's not just your career.

86
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,242
It's mine, too.

87
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,750
I mean, you're old, but I'm still...

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,876
Here.

89
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:37,127
Right.

90
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,980
Sit down.

91
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:44,334
Antonov went missing after arriving

92
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,637
three days ago from
dulles international.

93
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,765
These photos were taken as he passed
through the diplomatic checkpoint.

94
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,792
That doesn't make any sense.
I mean, why would a diamond courier

95
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,269
have diplomatic clearance?

96
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,921
That's why this is so sensitive.

97
00:05:57,822 --> 00:06:00,234
State didn't authorize
a diplomatic visa.

98
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,641
What about the briefcase
that wasn't found on the body?

99
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,240
Are you sure we're dealing
with diamonds here?

100
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,963
We're not sure of anything...

101
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,412
But we've to assume the worst.

102
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,958
That's why this is being treated
as a national security threat.

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,702
Bones - Season 05 Episode 02
"The Bond in the Boot"

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

106
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,496
<i>What about the diamonds?</i>
Have they been recovered?

107
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:01,255
All right, well, we think
that Antonov's hand

108
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,630
was severed in order to
steal the briefcase.

109
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,962
Of course.

110
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:08,385
He was getting $2 million worth of gems
from our mine in Siberia.

111
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:12,858
How did your courier manage to get
cleared past the diplomatic checkpoint?

112
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,725
- The diplomatic?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,495
- No, you must be mistaken.
- I'm mistaken? No, I'm not that.

114
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,607
See, look.
There he is on the approach.

115
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,257
And that's him clearing
the diplomatic checkpoint.

116
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,321
Briefcase.

117
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,074
I don't understand.

118
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,743
As you can see, all
the paperwork was in order.

119
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,245
There should have been
no complications at customs.

120
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,415
We have couriers
bringing in stones all the time.

121
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,472
- Have you worked with Antonov a lot?
- This was the first time.

122
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:45,442
We're going to need all your import
and export information from the company

123
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,133
and any other information
you might have on mr. Antonov.

124
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,397
Of course.

125
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,414
Every courier is thoroughly checked out.
There are psychological profiles,

126
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:56,016
recommendations from past employers.

127
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,726
- You can have it all.
- OK.

128
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,442
Any reason Antonov,

129
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,815
wouldn't want customs
to see the diamonds?

130
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,570
Unless he wasn't carrying diamonds.

131
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,039
I loaded the victim's x-rays
into the simulator.

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,485
Now, looking at the fracture lines,
the computer should be able to determine

133
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,503
the weight of the car
that ran him over.

134
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,622
According to this, the car weighed
approximately...

135
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,180
3,700 pounds,

136
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,698
which gives us...

137
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,310
152 possible vehicles.

138
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:44,273
The paint from the speed bump
is called tungsten silver.

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,376
Trade name: Casino royale.

140
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,169
Might narrow things down a bit.

141
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,946
Have you two seen dr. Brennan?

142
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:53,448
Yeah, I think she's with Booth.
Why?

143
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,951
It appears mr. Bray
has lost his scholarship.

144
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,163
No scholarship means
no internship at the Jeffersonian.

145
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,039
What?!
How did that happen?

146
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,817
Apparently, the trust
that funds his scholarship

147
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,170
ran out of financing because
of the economic mess.

148
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,173
That stinks.
I like Wendell.

149
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:13,051
We got drunk together last week.
That carries great meaning for men.

150
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,180
- He's one of us, even booth likes him.
- How did he react?

151
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:20,434
I haven't told him yet. I want to see
if there are other funding options.

152
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,036
What's that?

153
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,606
Dude! What's new?

154
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:30,072
Since you saw me on the forensic
platform five minutes ago, not much.

155
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,236
- Great.
- You?

156
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:32,628
Nothing.

157
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,138
Nada from here.

158
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,824
Zippo on my end.

159
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:39,729
It appears you have a match
for the car that ran over our victim.

160
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:42,689
- That's new, isn't it?
- Yes... I do.

161
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,766
Yes, you are something, Wendell.

162
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,710
You really are.

163
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,546
- Believable.
- That's crazy.

164
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,600
- Casino royale and that car?
- That is Bond's car.

165
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:55,552
James bond.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,354
Those wheels and a silencer.

167
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,882
You haven't, by any chance,
found evidence of a Martini?

168
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,088
Shaken, not stirred, of course.

169
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,479
So, you believe James Bond
killed our russian.

170
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:10,150
No, but come on, there was more
than a grain of truth in those films.

171
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,569
Pussy Galore,
that's never gonna happen.

172
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,529
Well, we can always hope.

173
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,907
Boys and their spy fantasies.

174
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,076
I'll tell Booth to put out
a search for the car.

175
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:21,290
Trust me, Angela...

176
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:23,530
Nothing is as it seems.

177
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:27,292
I actually felt you were a little too
psyched to see me when I came in here.

178
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,236
What, we can't be excited
to see you, Wendell?

179
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,965
You got some intimacy issues
there, man.

180
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,313
So, sweets, come up with
a profile yet?

181
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,474
Antonov a spy?
No, still putting the pieces together.

182
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,643
Whatever he says is a guess.

183
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,805
No, it's a subjective evaluation based
on quantifiable psychological markers.

184
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,982
Do we have to go through this
every time?

185
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,343
He may as well be telling
stories around a campfire.

186
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:56,238
- Anyone want some s'mores?
- Okay, all of Antonov's answers

187
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,616
from his psych evaluation
are too perfect.

188
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,361
No one is this perfect.
Now, that coupled with the fact

189
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:04,997
that he had an unexplained
diplomatic cover and was killed

190
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,083
by a professional would lead
any reasonable person to conclude...

191
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,126
He's a spy.

192
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:11,543
Spyish.

193
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,655
Great, I'll pick it up
this afternoon.

194
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,215
It's not...

195
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,047
<i>Pilates for dummies</i>,
it's <i>Plumbing for dummies</i>.

196
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,553
All right?
Get back to me. Thank you.

197
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,893
- Why won't you let me help you?
- I want to fix the leak in my wall,

198
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,086
- I'm very capable of doing it myself.
- With a <i>Dummies</i> book?

199
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,483
- Is that wise?
- Since the coma,

200
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,861
he can't remember how to take care
of his own plumbing.

201
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,654
It sound like I gotta wear diapers.

202
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,932
I offered to lend him money
for a professional plumber.

203
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,893
I just received a very large check
from my publisher.

204
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,254
There goes the "ah."
You had to bring this up. Great. Thanks.

205
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,956
A very large disparity in income

206
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,584
can often have a detrimental
effect on a relationship.

207
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,885
No, this doesn't.

208
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,815
I just get more satisfaction
on relearning an old skill.

209
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:57,940
Instead of paying plumber

210
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,469
800 dollars

211
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,849
What was that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I accept what you're saying.

212
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,561
- Great, we're on our way.
- What, the book?

213
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,087
Found the killer's vehicle.
I will pull the car around.

214
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,762
You can buy breakfast,
okay, miss rolex?

215
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,412
You want my advice?

216
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,094
Okay, if you really
want to help Booth,

217
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,201
you should let him
teach you about plumbing.

218
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,069
I'm a wealthy, accomplished woman.

219
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,996
Why would I want
to learn a menial skill?

220
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,404
Well, for Booth, so he can regain
whatever he feels he's lost.

221
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,668
I think, for once,
it would be beneficial

222
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,087
if you were the student.

223
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,877
The car's registered
to a high-class rent-a-car service.

224
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,868
It was leased using a corporate
credit card: Universal exports.

225
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:46,939
We're tracking them down now.

226
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:50,310
It <i>is</i> Bond's car, Bones!

227
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,440
I see superficial lesions
on the lateral anterior surface.

228
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:02,495
What you see there is scratch marks
on the front bumper, okay?

229
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,325
People have skeletons;
cars, they have chassis.

230
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,869
Right?
Gas tank... stomach.

231
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:12,332
And here, this shattered window
proves... There was gunfire.

232
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,634
The ballistics guy
dug the bullet out of the dash.

233
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,912
He said it was fired
from at least 500 feet away.

234
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,089
So someone was staking him out?

235
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,467
I think the car is bleeding.

236
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,553
Bones, a car has oil, that's oil.

237
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,472
No, this is blood.

238
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,349
It is blood.

239
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,601
Thank you.

240
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,733
- That's gonna kill the blue book value.
- The body is three to four days old.

241
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,000
The heat in the trunk is causing
the skin to liquefy.

242
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,197
So, cause of death?

243
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,907
There's too much flesh.

244
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,826
This is Cam's department.

245
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,870
Look at this.

246
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,743
What do you got there?

247
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,457
That is a walther ppk.

248
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,501
It's Bond's gun.

249
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:01,326
I hate to admit this but
I think Sweets was right.

250
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,895
The victim was CIA.

251
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,731
It is unfortunate Mr. Bray
is losing his scholarship.

252
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:22,848
He's one of our best interns and quite
deserving of financial assistance.

253
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,362
Clean gunshot wounds.

254
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,448
There seems to be damage
to the spine.

255
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,993
The cartilage from L1 to L5 is torn.

256
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,318
Have you thought about
starting a scholarship?

257
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,289
I mean, you have a lot of money now.

258
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:38,511
I support many different organizations
that provide food,

259
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,750
housing and medical care
for people in need.

260
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,672
Should I withhold funds from them?

261
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,884
No, no, but it's Wendell.

262
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:49,345
He grew up with nothing.
He worked his whole life for this.

263
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,112
I try not to get
attached to my assistants.

264
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,672
I have learned that even
the best ones can disappoint.

265
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:58,006
I noticed that there was microfracturing
on the inside edges of the scapula,

266
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,731
as if they'd been rubbed together.

267
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,525
Gun powder residue on his hand.

268
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,319
My bet: that Walther
PPK killed our Russian.

269
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,531
- But who killed James Bond?
- Whoever shot out his window.

270
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,699
- Where's the briefcase?
- What's in the briefcase?

271
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,899
We're going down the
rabbit hole here, people.

272
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:15,705
The CIA has no problem silencing people
that poke around in the business.

273
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,410
I hate to break it to you, Jack,

274
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:20,056
but you're the guy who studies bugs,
slime and poop.

275
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:21,836
It's assassination worthy.

276
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,673
A lot of people
would like to see me dead.

277
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,711
I'm not gonna touch that one.

278
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:29,177
Aren't you on a board
that grants scholarships?

279
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,765
To high school students.

280
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,014
What about you, Mr. Conspiracy Man?
Doesn't your foundation give out grants?

281
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,727
Yeah, after the crash,
our trustees froze all assets

282
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:40,230
until they could reevaluate
the portfolio.

283
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,788
I pack my lunch.

284
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,154
- You guys are gonna have...
- Excuse me?

285
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:49,996
Dude!

286
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,027
What are you doing here?

287
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:55,453
Agent Booth is here to
drive Dr. Brennan to Langley.

288
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,038
Thank you.

289
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,317
In 500 BC, Sun Tzu devotes attention

290
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:10,099
to intelligence gathering
in The Art of War.

291
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:13,680
He argues that all wars
are based on deception.

292
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:17,014
Logically, that would mean
that if we don't deceive each other,

293
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,060
then war would be unnecessary.

294
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,831
Yeah, but not everyone is
logical, now, are they?

295
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,733
I mean, frustrating, but that's
just how the world works.

296
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,693
Not between us two.

297
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,008
- Shouldn't we be honest each other?
- We're honest.

298
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,158
I mean, aren't you? I mean, I am.

299
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,977
So you have no problem
with me making

300
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:38,231
- so much more money?
- No.

301
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,837
Yeah, it's...

302
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,118
it's a little weird.

303
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,170
I mean, you're loaded.

304
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,983
I mean, you're really loaded. And you
still don't even have a flat screen.

305
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,674
It's just kind of weird, to be honest.
It's a little French, if you ask me.

306
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,765
Don't you feel that your life would
be different if you're wealthy?

307
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:58,057
Sure.

308
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,737
But... better?

309
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,197
I mean, yeah,
I wouldn't have to fly coach

310
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:07,942
but what life throws us,
that's what makes us who we are, right?

311
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,022
I mean, fighting through stuff.

312
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,406
And the good things, they're
not any sweeter if you're rich.

313
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,497
Parker, okay,
giving me a hug because it's my weekend.

314
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:20,955
And me and you, when we solve a case.
I mean, that's not about money, right?

315
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,334
No. No, it's not.

316
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,405
But I'll never have to fly coach.

317
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:38,056
I'm Arthur Rutledge, Assistant
Director of Intelligence.

318
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,642
We are very sorry about Greg.

319
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,520
But he wasn't working on
anything for us when he was killed.

320
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,481
Well, the FBI matched ballistics
from Greg Dorit's gun

321
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,567
to the shots
that killed Yuri Antonov.

322
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,532
Greg Dorit wasn't issued a gun.

323
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:55,183
I'm afraid that protocol
in the intelligence community

324
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,617
isn't as simple as
someone like you is used to.

325
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,203
Someone like me.

326
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:03,485
Look, Rutledge, the more you tell
us about your agent's assignment,

327
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,460
the easier it will be for us to track
down the guy who murdered him.

328
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,778
- That's what someone like him does.
- Correct.

329
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,005
Greg Dorit wasn't an agent,
he was an analyst.

330
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,551
And a rather poor one at that.

331
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,053
So that means it doesn't
matter that he's dead?

332
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,722
As far as what assignments
he was working on,

333
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,707
that information is classified.

334
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,561
And far beyond
what I'm able to share...

335
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,263
- With someone like me.
- Yes.

336
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,317
FYI, you know,
I have level-three clearance

337
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,357
and my SSBI
was renewed two months ago,

338
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:33,737
which allowed me
to get this warrant.

339
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:36,156
- Well played, Booth!
- Thanks, Bones.

340
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,624
Right.

341
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,833
She doesn't have clearance.
You can wait in the lobby, Dr. Brennan.

342
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:55,008
You know, I can keep a secret.

343
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,397
Right, Bones, we know.

344
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,998
Greg worked the Turkmenistan
desk, analyzing Web sites,

345
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:04,934
searching for communications
hidden in images and texts.

346
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,395
So you got an analyst to
assassinate a Russian courier?

347
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,450
I already told you we didn't.

348
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,751
Whatever motive Greg had,
I'd like to know as much as you would.

349
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,312
Well, it seems to be about
the briefcase.

350
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:18,365
So...

351
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,827
- do you know anything about that?
- Not other than the fact it's missing.

352
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,998
Do you know what might be inside
the briefcase, Mr. Rutledge?

353
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,925
Just diamonds, right?

354
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,835
Those eyes are
New Year's Eve bloodshot.

355
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,094
- Dorit was hammered when he died?
- There's no alcohol in the tox screen.

356
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,305
I found these marks
on his right arm.

357
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:43,937
Must've hurt.

358
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:47,303
They're holes uniform in diameter
but the pattern is random.

359
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:50,188
Looks like they were
made by a drill press.

360
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,358
He might've been tortured. I'll get
X-rays and photos for Dr. Brennan.

361
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,567
Let me ask you.
You mentioned the neighborhood

362
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,530
where you grew up.

363
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,701
And I don't mean to pry,

364
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,216
but you said it was kind of poor?

365
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,203
I like a good bar band
rather than the opera.

366
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:14,087
But trust me, there are more
people on my side on that one.

367
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,127
No, I don't, I was just
asking because of

368
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,550
your scholarship.

369
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,010
- You mean the miracle.
- Miracle?

370
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,929
That's what me and my mom call it.

371
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:24,556
- Really?
- Yeah.

372
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,268
She's in church every day giving thanks.
She's there more than the priest.

373
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,423
You know, I come into cash someday.

374
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:34,461
I'm starting one myself.
For other guys like me.

375
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:38,111
I'm sorry, you had a question
about the scholarship?

376
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,194
No, that...

377
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,806
answered just about everything.

378
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,963
This was Greg Dorit's office.

379
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:52,582
Mr. Rutledge wanted me to make
sure you have everything you need.

380
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,551
I can't believe Greg is dead.

381
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,195
There's nothing here.
There's, there's no computer,

382
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,123
there's no files, nothing.

383
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:08,850
Any employee who dies has his
equipment and files secured.

384
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,977
Were you friends with Mr. Dorit?

385
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,508
You know, they said that
he wasn't a good analyst.

386
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,625
- Maybe that's what got him killed.
- No, no, he was exceptional at his job.

387
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,920
He was always finding threats
the other analysts missed.

388
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,654
Why would they say he wasn't good?

389
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,564
Because Greg would push...

390
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,028
make sure his leads were
followed or he'd file a report.

391
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:31,122
They wanted him to look a nuts, so
his reports wouldn't be taken seriously.

392
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,701
Do you know what he was
working on before he disappeared?

393
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,669
No, but he was working late.

394
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,631
We were supposed to have
lunch over the weekend but...

395
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,506
But?

396
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:43,235
I never heard from him.

397
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,217
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

398
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,055
No.

399
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,482
Mr. Rutledge did say
whatever I need.

400
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,312
- He did say that.
- Yeah.

401
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,819
Greg was told to
testify against someone,

402
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,147
and he wasn't sure whether
the guy was really guilty,

403
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,783
but it was part of his job
and he wanted to be a team player.

404
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,886
- Who did he testify against?
- His name was Pedro Marquez.

405
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:11,785
The Agency thought
he was a terrorist.

406
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,291
He was detained in a federal prison for
a year before he was cleared of charges.

407
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,503
So was Greg's testimony
that put him behind bars?

408
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,300
Did Greg think that

409
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:23,758
this Marquez guy
was seeking revenge?

410
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:26,970
I did. Marquez was released
from prison last week.

411
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,955
So, Pedro... recognize this man?

412
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:36,227
Yeah.

413
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,190
That's the spook that
accused me of being a terrorist.

414
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:43,061
- But come on, look at this sweet face.
- He thought you were retrofitting SUVs?

415
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:46,469
When really you're just
a poor little misunderstood car thief

416
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,032
who owns a chop shop, right?

417
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,535
- Yeah.
- So, Greg Dorit, Pedro.

418
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,954
My mom says I should write
him a thank-you note.

419
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,539
What, for sending you to jail?

420
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:57,583
The CIA just cut me a check
for a hundred grand for, uh,

421
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,378
wrongful something and
defamation of something else.

422
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,886
I got it yesterday.

423
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:05,883
- I might haven't to steal cars anymore.
- So where were you last Friday night?

424
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,139
Working.

425
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:09,595
As I said,
I only just got the check.

426
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,598
But at your chop shop, do
you have a 70-gauge drill bit?

427
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,017
I got every size.

428
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:18,062
We have evidence that Dorit here
was tortured before he was killed.

429
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:21,107
- Wait, the dude's dead?
- Yeah, they drilled holes into his arm.

430
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,443
A 70-gauge bit
would be a perfect fit.

431
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,382
- Come on.
- That was before we gave you the check.

432
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,573
I'm thinking he's looking
to take some revenge.

433
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,545
Hell, no! You can ask my mother.
I would never kill no one.

434
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,657
So I'm saying that you followed
Dorit, saw him take out the courier,

435
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:39,042
so you probably figured that the
briefcase was very valuable,

436
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,335
so you kill Dorit
and take off with the case.

437
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:46,235
Is there any way you guys would accuse
me of all this in a public courtroom?

438
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,077
'Cause I'd really like to
buy my mom a new condo.

439
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:54,415
According to his file,
Dorit fractured his ankle twice

440
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,477
trying to complete an entry-level
obstacle course during CIA training.

441
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,812
This makes no logical sense.

442
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,607
He dressed like
a fictional British spy

443
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,185
and pursued a shadow career
as a CIA field agent,

444
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,442
even though
he clearly did not possess

445
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,739
the physical aptitude
necessary for success.

446
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:12,020
He didn't want to be stuck
behind a desk.

447
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,619
He saw an opportunity to live
out his dreams and he took it.

448
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:16,370
It's ridiculous.

449
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,831
I don't know, it's always
been my dream to work with you.

450
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,314
Sometimes dreaming is the way to go.

451
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,550
Not in this case, of course.

452
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,492
I cross-referenced the X-rays

453
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,966
and enlarged photos
of the holes drilled in the radius.

454
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,082
Most drill bits leave striations.

455
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,573
- These have none.
- So... not a drill.

456
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,184
Find out what other objects
can make cavities this smooth.

457
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:39,838
Already on it.

458
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,606
Excellent work, Mr. Bray.
I'll be sorry to see you go.

459
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,527
- Where am I going?
- Cam didn't tell you?

460
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,403
I guess not.

461
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,132
She can occasionally
be quite sentimental.

462
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,997
There were funding cutbacks
and you've lost your scholarship,

463
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:58,955
which, of course, means
your internship is canceled.

464
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,829
But aren't there other
funding resources?

465
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:07,839
We have explored all
of the alternatives.

466
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,394
Fine, I'll...

467
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:13,970
take the year off and work.

468
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:15,888
But if I'm,

469
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:19,029
replaced, there's
no guarantee I can come back?

470
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,850
We can't hold a place.
No, I'm sorry.

471
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,055
Sure, I understand.

472
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,993
You are one of the best interns
I've ever had the pleasure to work with.

473
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,386
You will be missed.

474
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,465
So I was inspecting
Dorit's watch, right?

475
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,163
And I see that the battery
case is loose, so I open it.

476
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:44,660
And what do I find? A bug.

477
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,712
Why such excitement over
this particular insect?

478
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,098
Because this bug is not an insect.

479
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,010
It's a bug bug.

480
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:57,292
Someone was spying on our spy,

481
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,528
who was spying on another spy.

482
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,684
Come on.

483
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,748
A little enthusiasm here?

484
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,148
I lost my scholarship.

485
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:11,190
Oh, man. You told him?

486
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:12,612
I thought he knew.

487
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,587
I should tell Booth
about the surveillance device.

488
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,098
You okay, Booth? Did Mandy fight back
when you brought her in?

489
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,113
I just cut myself
trying to fix the pipes.

490
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,361
- Let me see.
- No, I'm fine. Let's get to Mandy.

491
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:39,216
- She's waiting us.
- She can continue to wait.

492
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:41,697
Didn't your book for imbeciles
teach you how to avoid injury?

493
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,985
No, the bookstore ran out of copies,
it's a book for dummies, not imbeciles.

494
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,434
I thought that I could remember how to
fix the pipes, but obviously I can't.

495
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,024
I'm sure it's very difficult.

496
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,604
I can't imagine being capable
enough to fix my own plumbing.

497
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,017
Because you don't want to.
You'd rather buy a plumber.

498
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:58,475
I'd rather have someone teach me.

499
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,008
Look, I can teach you.

500
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,536
I could have taught you.
I just... let's get inside.

501
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,699
Rutledge said the bug
was checked out in your name.

502
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:10,318
I got the bug because I was
afraid Greg was cheating on me.

503
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,463
Why didn't you mention this before?

504
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:15,652
We weren't supposed to date.
I guess it's not like the FBI.

505
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:17,635
We're not allowed to sleep
with a colleague.

506
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,168
Is she talking about us?

507
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:21,931
- We're not.
- No.

508
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,351
It's okay, I'm CIA.
My lips are sealed.

509
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,437
Greg and I were under the radar,

510
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,375
but a week before he went missing,

511
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,133
Greg broke up with me.

512
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:34,804
I guess I got a little too jealous.

513
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:37,829
Let me see this.

514
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:39,825
Wait a second.

515
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,896
This is how he broke up with you?

516
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,879
He sent a picture of him

517
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:46,163
waving good-bye to you in an e-mail?

518
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,110
We had our problems,
but we loved each other.

519
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,127
Greg was about to propose to me.

520
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,068
And why did you think that?

521
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:56,786
Cause the last conversation I overheard,
it was Greg and Mr. Rutledge.

522
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,852
They were talking about diamonds.

523
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,283
I felt so guilty for
not trusting him,

524
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,988
I disconnected the bug
and never heard anything else.

525
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:05,113
I swear.

526
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:10,553
What kind of creep breaks up
with someone over e-mail?

527
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,039
Like there's an acceptable protocol

528
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:15,055
for crushing someone's soul.

529
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:17,725
Wait a second.

530
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,202
This is weird.

531
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,953
This image file is way bigger
than it should be,

532
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,628
Which either means there's some sort
of compression error or...

533
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,418
Or our steganographer hid
data within the file.

534
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:43,681
Look at all that code.

535
00:28:45,711 --> 00:28:47,982
Maybe he wasn't breaking up
with her.

536
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:52,104
She was the only person
he could trust.

537
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:55,024
He was sending her a message.

538
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:02,707
Still no cause of death,
but the domage to the cartilage

539
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:05,447
and lumbar vertebrae
definitely indicate torture.

540
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,953
He was bent in some very painful way
for a long period.

541
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:11,457
I'm analyzing the injuries
to get the exact position.

542
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,787
The strange thing is I found
no contraction band necrosis

543
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,611
in the myocardium in the heart.

544
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:19,658
That means he showed no signs
of distress even after hours of torture.

545
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:20,716
Is it possible?

546
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,667
Unless the CIA
underestimated this guy.

547
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:27,431
Anyone who can take that kind of abuse
makes James Bond look like a weenie.

548
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,309
Weenie?

549
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,020
I'm sorry, I have no idea
where that came from.

550
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,518
I'm gonna miss you.

551
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:43,496
Angela is still trying
to decode the picture.

552
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:47,136
- She says it's very complex.
- We're dealing with the CIA here.

553
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:50,824
- What's that?
- The book  to fix your plumbing.

554
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:52,998
- I found it at a used bookstore.
- Look at that.

555
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,561
Thanks, that is

556
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:57,059
- the sweetest thing.
- Sure.

557
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:59,095
The book was

558
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,463
$6.42.

559
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:02,133
You can pay me later.

560
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:04,288
Excuse me?
It's a gift.

561
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,025
No, if I gave... If it was a gift,

562
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,547
You might think of it as an
assault on your virility.

563
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,446
I can take a check if that's easier.

564
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:13,203
How about a credit card?

565
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,860
- I don't take credit cards.
- Right, just joking.

566
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:17,731
You know, once I

567
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,591
flip through this,

568
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,546
-  If you want to learn, I...
- Sure.

569
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,864
I've always wanted
to wield a wrench.

570
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:29,676
Just don't get all defensive
if I know something more than you do.

571
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,292

I don't understand.

572
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,539
How come we can't bring
Rutledge in for questioning?

573
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,920
Mandy said that he and Dorit
were discussing diamonds.

574
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,648
Clearly he was lying.

575
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,995
He's the assistant director of the cia.
We can't accuse him without

576
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,010
something more definitive than an
overheard conversation, right?

577
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,003
Perhaps Mr. Bray has found
something more on the remains.

578
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:52,975
Cam says he's staying remarkably focused
despite losing his scholarship.

579
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,988
I found, in addition
to perimortem disc compaction,

580
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,615
there was also significant
hemorrhaging on c-3.

581
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:01,575
Trauma confined to a limited space.

582
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,866
If a precision knife-hand
strike was delivered to c-3...

583
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:08,195
It could be used to render
a victim unconscious.

584
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,993
A blow to that region can
cause severe nerve damage.

585
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,550
Which is why this is known
by trained combatants:

586
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,953
special forces, navy...

587
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:17,333
And perhaps the
assistant director of the CIA?

588
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,311
If he had been a field agent first,
it seems likely.

589
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,760
My mom. I haven't told her yet.
You mind if I take this?

590
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,786
I'll let Booth know.

591
00:31:36,824 --> 00:31:40,314
Prior to becoming assistant director,
Rutledge was a field agent in Russia.

592
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,141
Where he could have met Antonov.

593
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,383
And in 2004, he headed
a detention center in Afghanistan.

594
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,988
Where he earned a reputation
for very effective

595
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,183
- interrogation techniques.
- Torture?

596
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,577
One of the techniques was
temporary nerve damage to the spine.

597
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,505
Why would he torture Dorit?
They were on the same side.

598
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,151
Perhaps he's a double agent.
Rutledge certainly fits that profile.

599
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,483
They're usually
intelligent male officers

600
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:04,811
who had poor father figures,
resulting in

601
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,948
repressed anger
and revenge fantasies.

602
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:09,368
- Double agent?
- By betraying his country,

603
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:11,595
Rutledge is, in a sense,
choosing a new father,

604
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,322
One who might treat him better.

605
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:17,087
But that would also fit Booth,
And he's not a double agent.

606
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,311
- Are you?
- Stop. Watch it.

607
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:22,439
Elephants are gray,
but not all gray things are elephants.

608
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,167
- Is that good for me?
- Yeah.

609
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:29,671
You're really going to trust
something this important with a kid?

610
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:31,221
Me?

611
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:33,784
- At least I tuck myself in at night.
- There is a briefcase

612
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,869
out there with god only
knows what inside of it,

613
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,205
And apparently you 
don't seem to have a clue.

614
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,960
- What is it?
- Think we just found our smoking gun.

615
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,551
You put a request in to I.C.E.

616
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,012
to pull a baggage inspector
off the diplomatic line.

617
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,014
And replace him
with one of your men.

618
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:59,059
You created the security holes, so
the briefcase could enter the country.

619
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:00,664
See that?

620
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:03,314
That's your signature.
You're going down.

621
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:13,657
Whatever recording equipment
you have... turn it off.

622
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:28,368
I created the hole

623
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,739
so an additional $20 million in diamonds
could be brought into the country.

624
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:36,579
The diamonds were then
to be shipped to Pakistan

625
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:39,224
in exchange for political prisoners.

626
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,132
To keep congress in the dark.

627
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:43,118
Iran-contra all over again.

628
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,856
And so you killed your
own analyst because

629
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,621
he got in your way?

630
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,861
Dorit read some online
chatter about the exchange.

631
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,512
I told him to mind his own business.

632
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,824
I tried to save him.

633
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:00,245
He got killed
because he didn't listen to me.

634
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,667
Or maybe because there was
something more dangerous

635
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,583
in that briefcase
instead of diamonds.

636
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:15,760
Have you seen Booth and Brennan?

637
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,388
They're in the bone room.
Is everything okay?

638
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,698
No. The CIA's taking over
the investigation.

639
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:22,726
They're collecting
remains in ten minutes.

640
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,140
Wait... So we only have...

641
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,758
Ten minutes.
How are things coming in here?

642
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,284
I'm still trying
to decode the image.

643
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,389
It appears that most of the data
is centered in his hand,

644
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,278
and it could be a map of some kind.

645
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,264
Do it fast.

646
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,276
- He is claiming national security.
- He can't do that.

647
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:43,879
He can bury the evidence,
and we won't be able to touch him.

648
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,935
- Nine minutes left.
- You're joking, right?

649
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,618
It's not a joke. Let's just pretend
this is the stanley cup finals, right?

650
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:51,880
You're down by two goals,
and 9 min left.

651
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:54,568
- There's so much data.
- The puck is about to drop.

652
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,552
How do you want to go down?
And be remembered?

653
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:58,803
All right.

654
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,754
I found avulsion fractures
along the proximal humerus.

655
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,642
The heads of each femur
were dislocated from the acetabula.

656
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:08,263
Mr. Dorit's body was bent back so far
that the tendons snapped the bone.

657
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:10,732
Like if his hands
and feet were tied behind his back.

658
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,941
He was then hung by his hands...
I did a computer simulation.

659
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:19,087
If he was left
upside down long enough,

660
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,534
congestion of the head and brain
would lead to asphyxiation.

661
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:24,621
- Petechiaeexplains the bloodshot eyes.
- We have cause of death.

662
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,039
That's good, but we still
can't tie him to the murder.

663
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:30,738
When I was in Chechnya
identifying bodies, there was one victim

664
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:33,796
who suffered a ukrainian torture
called "the swallow."

665
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,428
He was suspended upside down,
very similar to this.

666
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,060
Not enough.
Look, you got one shot.

667
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:41,179
It's an empty net.
What are you going to do?

668
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:46,059
The holes in the radius. I've been
trying to figure out what caused them.

669
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,186
It wasn't a drill.
It was something strong enough

670
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:50,438
to bore through bone,
but leave no trace.

671
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:52,148
A laser.

672
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:54,066
Diamonds are cut by lasers.

673
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,325
But Lena Brodsky is the head
of a diamond firm.

674
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,070
She would have easy access
to a laser.

675
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,163
She's Ukrainian.
Dorit got to the case before she did.

676
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:03,034
She tortured and killed Dorit.

677
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,413
- Take the body.
- But no! Wait! You can't take him.

678
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:09,142
We're in regulation.
We got four minutes left.

679
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,672
We know you didn't kill him.

680
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:13,907
But Dorit knew Antonov was
working for Lena Brodsky.

681
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:16,886
He came to you, you didn't listen,
so he takes care of it himself.

682
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:20,886
Then Lena finds out, kills him. She must
know where the briefcase is.

683
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,391
We have the neodymium laser

684
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,591
you used to burn holes
in Greg Dorit's arms.

685
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:31,460
And the gun you fired at Dorit's car

686
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:33,669
after you saw him
take off with your case.

687
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:36,109
What was in that case that is
so much more valuable

688
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,078
than millions in diamonds?

689
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:40,823
Where's your briefcase?

690
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,099
You know what?

691
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:46,452
Whoever hired you...
they can't be too happy,

692
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,997
so when we send you back
to the Ukraine...

693
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:50,873
I'm sure you'll live a long life.

694
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,064
I don't know where the case is.

695
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,125
Dorit never talked.

696
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:58,629
After what I put him through,
he should have.

697
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,133
Anyone would have talked.

698
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,348
I've never seen a man so brave.

699
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,850
I was right. It's a map.

700
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,978
<i>Keep your eye on his hand.</i>

701
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,939
<i>He wasn't waving good-bye.</i>

702
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,043
<i>He was telling Mandy
where he hid his briefcase.</i>

703
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,272
We don't know what's in that case.
You call in your cavalry.

704
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:27,886
I know how to do my job.

705
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,334
How come we found
the killer and the case?

706
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,261
We're all clear.

707
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,541
All right, call it in.

708
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:49,197
A usb computer drive.

709
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,199
That's what all this was about?

710
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:54,206
Information. Today that can be
more dangerous than one bomb.

711
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,131
Stars on the memorial
wall represent agents who died

712
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,362
courageously
while serving their country.

713
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,344
The memorial wall
is reserved for agents.

714
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,364
Mr. Dorit was not an agent.

715
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:14,601
In mr. Dorit's case, I asked
that an exception be made.

716
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,952
I'm gonna miss you.

717
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:35,053
Stay safe, okay?

718
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:36,178
You too.

719
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:40,468
Won't be the same without you, man.

720
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:44,884
We are all

721
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,718
grateful for your exceptional work.

722
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:49,165
Thank you.

723
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,516
Hold on a second.

724
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,972
Don't worry. I wouldn't have
left without saying good-bye.

725
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,057
That's nice,
but you don't have to leave.

726
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,532
- Excuse me?
- I was just notified

727
00:39:57,657 --> 00:39:59,758
that they found funding
for your scholarship.

728
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:01,994
You are covered
in full for the next two years.

729
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,025
Apparently,

730
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,902
a donation was made anonymously.

731
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,473
Anonymously?

732
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:14,513
Then,

733
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,900
please allow me to say
thank you to anonymous.

734
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,649
We still need all of the evidence
photographed and catalogued

735
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:26,174
before we send it to the federal
Prosecutor's office.

736
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,382
Yes, right away.

737
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:30,436
Thank you.

738
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,130
Actually, they received

739
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:41,813
enough anonymous donations
for three scholarships.

740
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:46,507
That is quite a coincidence.

741
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,512
It really is.

742
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:57,661
For the next step, you need
to attach the elbow pipe,

743
00:40:58,315 --> 00:40:59,705
using the pvc cement there.

744
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,921
Stick that little fuzzy ball in there,
and swish it around...

745
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:07,942
- You got it?
- It stinks.

746
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,175
You smell dead bodies,
and that stinks?

747
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:12,719
There is a beautiful logic to this.

748
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,806
It's like reconstructing
the circulatory system.

749
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,625
The water is the blood.

750
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,779
The pipes, veins.

751
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:21,519
Right.
So what you need to do

752
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:24,909
is just apply pressure right in there
and hold it for a minute, okay?

753
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:28,144
Got it.

754
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,393
Right, I know.
Just... Making sure that it's safe.

755
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,865
Student-teacher.

756
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,355
You know, I'm...

757
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,397
I'm glad that,

758
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,017
that we don't have any secrets
between each other.

759
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:47,243
I like that.

760
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:50,198
If we have something
on our mind, we just share it.

761
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:52,726
Sure.

762
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:59,102
Even with all of the financial

763
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:01,327
and intellectual contradictions,

764
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:04,234
I... Still feel close to you.

765
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,484
Because, none
of that really matters anyway.

766
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:16,027
Sometimes, looking at it
through your eyes, I believe that.

767
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:21,803
Right, so...

768
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,132
Pipe seems nice and secure, right?

769
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:27,301
- Tight?
- All right, just hold onto it there.

770
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:29,926
Let me just open up the water.

771
00:42:32,256 --> 00:42:34,593
It's an old apartment,
it's Washington.

772
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,804
Close that.
There.

773
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,793
You can take your hand off now.

774
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,893
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

775
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,309
Look at that!

776
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,778
Nice and secure.

777
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:46,604
- No drip?
- No drip.

778
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,481
You're a...
You're a good student.

779
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,693
Only as good as my teacher.

780
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,800
Turn it off.

781
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:05,054
- My watch is ruined!
- What do you mean?

782
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:06,175
It's a rolex.
