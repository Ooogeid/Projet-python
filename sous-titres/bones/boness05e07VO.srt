1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,260
Booth, right?

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,359
You're a legendary shot, man.

3
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:15,097
- I'm Carson.
- I'm concentrating.

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,204
I heard you could shoot a hole
through the middle of a dime on the run.

5
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:38,884
Excuse me.

6
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,791
I obviously got the wrong guy.

7
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,843
Great, I was worried you'd be gone.

8
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:55,926
- Almost gone.
- Well, almost is almost,

9
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,935
so if I ask you a question,
can you answer it in plain language?

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,660
Yeah, I'll do my best.

11
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:02,346
Great, so...

12
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,525
- Okay, what's our deal?
- Our deal?

13
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:10,986
What are you FBI shrink,

14
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:13,823
friend, objective observer?

15
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:16,867
You want to know my primary role.

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,328
That depends
upon a number of factors.

17
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,830
Plain language.

18
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,829
The FBI hires me to evaluate agents.
You're an agent.

19
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:28,963
So, FBI first, me second?

20
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,025
No. Agent Booth,
that's not what I meant.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,128
- It's OK, I get it.
- Please let me finish.

22
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:36,512
You just called me Agent Booth.
That's says it all, Dr. Sweets.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,561
You know, I learned the importance
of vocabulary choices from you,

24
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,624
and I got to go catch a murderer.

25
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,526
- Why aren't you cracking wise?
- Why? Because it's not 1945.

26
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:53,311
Well, shall I start making jokes?

27
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:55,164
Let's just let it flow
naturally, OK?

28
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,683
I've noticed in the past
when you're grumpy,

29
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,734
your mood tends to elevate
when you tell me about it.

30
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,289
Just had a bad day on the range.

31
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,860
- Is that a cowboy metaphor?
- No, I just... Look,

32
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,296
next week, I have to
re-certify as a marksman, and I...

33
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,285
I don't know
if I'm gonna make the grade.

34
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,610
Obviously you need more practice.

35
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,051
Maybe this is all because
of my brain tumor.

36
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,016
Highly unlikely, given
that aiming a firearm involves

37
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,264
your cerebellum and occipital lobe,

38
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,351
while your brain tumor
was temporoparietal.

39
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,188
Perhaps you should speak to Sweets.

40
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,982
Meaning what?
This is psychological now?

41
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,359
No, I... I can't talk to Sweets.
Why not?

42
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:36,331
Because he works for the FBI,
he's going to go on to tell the Bureau

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,960
that I'm all loopity-doopity-doopy.
I can't have that. Sinkhole?

44
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,619
No, thanks, I already got one.
That's it over there. Big sucker.

45
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,913
Let's not do that right now,
Officer Navarro.

46
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,641
All business FBI. Got you.

47
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:50,299
Bro collapsed about 4:00 a.m.
Broken water main.

48
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:52,552
Took a car down with it,
but nobody got hurt.

49
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,904
- Mostly pumped out now.
- Then why are we here?

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,502
Because you're the bones people, right?
We've got bones.

51
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:03,641
They're... green.

52
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:07,144
- That is very interesting.
- Be careful.

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,801
They don't look right. 

54
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,253
- Why, because they look so green?
- Get closer.

55
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,235
That's not all
that's wrong with them.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,735
Definitely human.

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,030
The evidence down here has been
totally compromised by water.

58
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:19,445
Is it a kid?

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,032
You mean
because of the small stature? No.

60
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,663
Dentition indicates late 20s, male.

61
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,549
Why is he green?

62
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,792
That's not really
our highest priority.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,262
Wait, how can being green
not be a priority, Bones?

64
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,842
A gold coin.

65
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,076
Look at that, Bones.

66
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,432
- What happened?
- Water main break.

67
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,193
Got another water main break down here.
Look at that, Bones.

68
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:48,602
You are at the end
of a beautiful rainbow.

69
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,741
Where I am is at the bottom
of a muddy pit.

70
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,607
OK, think about it.
End of a rainbow,

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,202
little green guy, gold coins.

72
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,021
- What does that tell you?
- That I need an umbrella

73
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:01,365
and that the remains
are horribly compromised.

74
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,367
It tells me leprechaun.

75
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:06,543
- Are you praying?
- I'm making a wish.

76
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:08,080
Same thing, really.

77
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,463
Rather than counting on superstition

78
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:13,701
to make you shoot more accurately,
you should just practice more.

79
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,131
Thanks. Okay, why don't we just get
Darby O'Gill there

80
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,896
out of the pit
and back to the lab, all right?

81
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,344
Somebody shut the water off!

82
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,471
<i>Let's go! Shut it down!</i>

83
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,419
Bones - Season 05 Episode 07
"The Dwarf in the Dirt"

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,647
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kujathemas,

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

86
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,659
Leprechauns...

87
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,635
are thought to explode
if you touch them with a broom handle.

88
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,285
A) These remains show no signs
of being exploded...

89
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,514
and "B"...

90
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:09,324
I think you can guess "B."

91
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,280
There are no such things
as leprechauns.

92
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:13,354
This is good.
We're developing a shorthand.

93
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,034
The large skull and torso,

94
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,816
combined with short limbs

95
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,819
and evidence of hypotonia
points to achondroplasia.

96
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,770
- Dwarfism.
- Indeed.

97
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,988
I think I know why
our victim's bones are green.

98
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,452
This soil is lousy with iron oxides.

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,206
Combined with the acidic groundwater,
turned the calcium in the bones green.

100
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,896
- How long would that take?
- It depends. How far down into the bone

101
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:37,920
- does the color extend?
- Two to three millimeters.

102
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,871
- I'm gonna go with two to five months.
- We have time of death, if not cause.

103
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,594
Most of the abrasions to these bones
were caused very recently.

104
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,555
A car fell on the remains last night.
That's going to be a factor.

105
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,522
The question is: how did
our leprechaun end up buried

106
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,394
20 feet under the street...

107
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,022
... wearing only his knickers?

108
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,002
Most likely scenario is

109
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,652
that he was murdered
and tossed in a storm drain,

110
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,070
service tunnel or sewer.

111
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:06,296
A 60% subluxation
between the scapula

112
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:09,410
and the humerus indicates
that his right shoulder was dislocated.

113
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,457
Congruent with having been dragged?

114
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:14,081
As a literal dead weight, yes.

115
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,337
Firing two branzino,

116
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,007
one duck, one rib eye rare!

117
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,401
And one of the branzinos
is without potato.

118
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,834
Well, it's the customer's loss,
the vile bag of gob-slobber.

119
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,323
So you prefer this to psychiatry?

120
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:36,088
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact, yes.
Well, it's the smell.

121
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,439
Plus, let's face it,

122
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,690
<i>Chef</i> Gordon Gordon Wyatt
has more of a ring to it

123
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,859
than <i>Dr.</i> Gordon Gordon Wyatt.

124
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,154
- What do you think?
- That's amazing.

125
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,587
Isn't it? Isn't it?
What do I owe this pleasure to?

126
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:50,132
- Well, listen...
- Careful with those morels, Elan.

127
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:52,179
- They're $60 a pound.
- Sorry, Chef.

128
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:54,333
- I need some advice.
- I can advise you on

129
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,182
how to cook an omelet or how
to <i>sous-vide</i> a pork chop, if you want.

130
00:06:58,307 --> 00:06:59,604
Yeah, go, go with those.

131
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,795
No, I need some shrinky advice.

132
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:05,421
I stopped being a psychiatrist
some time ago, as you know.

133
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,992
Firing three halibut,
two shepherd's pie, one rack of lamb!

134
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,053
Has this something to do
with the jumbling

135
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:13,057
your poor boggled noggin
got last year?

136
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:16,224
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Well, my brain expertise these days

137
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,211
is confined to preparing a superb

138
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:21,231
<i>sautée de cervelles
au beurre noir,</i> I'm afraid.

139
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,735
Maybe you could just pretend
like I'm a recipe that needs fixing.

140
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,868
Take that.
And that.

141
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,135
Go over to that table.
Chef's table, somebody, please.

142
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,837
Prepare, thank you.

143
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,699
- If I eat this, it's going to cure me?
- Heavens, no,

144
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,410
it'll give you something to do
until my break. Right.

145
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,993
Somebody serve these over here,
thank you.

146
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:46,374
The victim was struck in his face.

147
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:49,551
At the nasal and the zygomatic.

148
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:53,163
At worst, a blow like this
would knock the victim unconscious.

149
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:56,429
A good find, Mr. Nigel-Murray,
but not cause of death.

150
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,665
I've cataloged

151
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,043
a large number of remodeled
fractures along the ribs,

152
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:05,609
plus bilateral flattening
of the proximal radii.

153
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,087
Enhanced muscle attachments
here and here

154
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,947
indicate the victim was very strong.

155
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,491
I'd assume that was
to compensate for his condition.

156
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:16,427
What if his strength wasn't
compensation for his condition, but

157
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,705
led to all of these injuries?

158
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,840
A superstrong dwarf,

159
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,928
such as might be found in
<i>The Lord of the Rings?</i>

160
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:28,340
The victim has all of the occupational
markers of a wrestler.

161
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,050
A midget wrestler?

162
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,011
Midget is not the proper term.
As a scientist, you should be aware.

163
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,973
It may not be the proper term,

164
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,901
Dr. Brennan, but I can assure you,
correct or not,

165
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,520
"midget wrestling"
is an American pastime...

166
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:44,887
as wrong as that may be.

167
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:52,717
I am trying to match the physical
characteristics of our leprechaun

168
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,534
to any professional wrestlers
on the wrestling circuit.

169
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,678
Wrestling is popular
in many cultures.

170
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,330
It was the supreme contest
in ancient Greek games.

171
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,457
Well, those were mostly
beautiful boys

172
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,830
wrestling around,
all... oiled up and naked.

173
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,349
That could be our victim.

174
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,797
The muscle development
appears consistent,

175
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:11,758
the distinct curvature
of the femur is undeniable.

176
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,181
Then it seems
our leading contender is

177
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,637
the Iron Leprechaun.

178
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,837
So it was a leprechaun after all.

179
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:20,142
That's him.
I'm fairly certain

180
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,473
that Iron Leprechaun
is not his actual name

181
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,401
but only his wrestling moniker.

182
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:26,317
Thank you.

183
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,651
Well, this says
that he's wrestling tonight.

184
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,779
That would mean that I was wrong
about him being the victim.

185
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,365
Yeah, believe me,
I'm as surprised about it as you are.

186
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,383
Perhaps this Iron Leprechaun
will be aware of someone else,

187
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,246
who looked exactly like him,
disappearing.

188
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,246
I could spend the rest of my life
analyzing the contents of that sinkhole.

189
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:49,039
Yeah, let's not do that.

190
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,343
Start with the coins.

191
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:51,743
All right, well,

192
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:54,369
Brennan found a Chinese
Panda right beside the body.

193
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,234
Now, within three meters,
I found four Krugerrands,

194
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,582
a French Rooster franc,
a Gold Indian Head,

195
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,391
and a Canadian Maple Leaf.

196
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,460
Worth a lot?

197
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,569
Well, the Rooster alone...
Thank you, Sandy,

198
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,494
is worth about 400 bucks.

199
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:10,310
Are any of these coins traceable?

200
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,563
They're all common gold coins.

201
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:15,797
There's a hefty market in it for people
who are afraid the economy will crash,

202
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:18,075
but it's not like they carry
serial numbers.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,970
- What about the gun?
- It's a .22-caliber

204
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:24,468
Ruger Mark III,
rusted beyond all belief.

205
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,616
It's loaded and unfired.

206
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:28,089
It could belong to our victim

207
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:30,826
or it could have been tossed
in the sewer 20 years ago.

208
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,674
Let me know if you find
something special.

209
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:39,361
So you failed to execute
a simple plumbing repair.

210
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,182
- Big whoop.
- I had to get one of those Dummy books.

211
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,381
This is delicious.
I mean, it was great.

212
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:45,811
You're... a good cook.

213
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,064
And you say you forgot about your rather
distinctive belt buckle?

214
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,906
- Bones had to remind me.
- None of these adjustments strike me

215
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,735
as being particularly
earth-shattering.

216
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:56,780
You haven't got to the
juicy bit yet, have you?

217
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,457
I see.

218
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,793
You've suddenly become
an indiscriminate homicidal maniac.

219
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,422
- That is a cause for concern.
- It means that I'm a lousy shot.

220
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,589
And I have to recertify next week.

221
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:18,750
What you expect me to do about it?
The only time I've ever fired a weapon,

222
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,804
it reared up and struck me
on the forehead.

223
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,015
I just need you to help me
fire my gun.

224
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:25,058
That sounds desperately phallic.

225
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,977
Is this maybe a sexual problem?

226
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,229
Don't say that.
Don't even put that out in the air.

227
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,694
It would explain your reticence.

228
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,970
Why haven't you gone to see
the estimable Dr. Sweets for help?

229
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,841
'Cause I can't go to him.
He works for the FBI, all right.

230
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:40,240
You're Gordon Gordon.
Come on, help me out.

231
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,359
All right.

232
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,286
I'll tag along,
and I'll see what I think.

233
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,737
No, no. I thought maybe
you could just, you know,

234
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:49,100
hypnotize me, give one
of those blue pills.

235
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:53,170
One quibble: It's "chef" not "cook."
Chef, all right.

236
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,972
May seem rather a
picayune detail to you,

237
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:57,549
but it's quite meaningful to me.

238
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,934
Did Booth tell you
about the plumbing?

239
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,264
And the socks and the belt
buckle and the shooting?

240
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,957
- Yes. Anything else you noticed?
- Why are you asking Bones?

241
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,435
She spends more time
with you than anyone else.

242
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,193
I think that if he wants
to be a better shot,

243
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,848
he should just practice more.

244
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,135
<i>Come on, Bumblebee!
Come on, man!</i>

245
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,337
I'm nearly certain,
that is our victim.

246
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,882
What, the Bumblebee fellow
or the elf?

247
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,800
A leprechaun.
It's obviously a leprechaun.

248
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,754
Bones, you want to go up and tell
the poor guy he's dead, or shall I?

249
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,492
He does look a bit vigorous
for a dead leprechaun, doesn't he?

250
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,662
- That... that's not him.
- What do you mean?

251
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,758
- You said that was him.
- No, that's him in the poster.

252
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,565
That's not. His forehead,
the frontal bossing is too prominent.

253
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:00,369
That man is not the Iron Leprechaun!

254
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,948
Fake!

255
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,533
- Fake!
- What are you doing?

256
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,454
Booing is the appropriate way
to show displeasure at a sporting event.

257
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:09,497
Fraud!

258
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,873
- Shut up!
- Look at his femurs!

259
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,126
- One cannot deny the femurs.
- Yeah, can't.

260
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,501
One, two, three!

261
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:18,797
Bumblebee wins!

262
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,968
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

263
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,700
<i>Tonight's winner at four-foot-four,</i>

264
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>122 pounds...</i>

265
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>Bumblebee Man!</i>

266
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,383
Let me handle this.

267
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,648
Excuse me, pal. FBI.
I want to have a word with you.

268
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,908
FBI.

269
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,146
Now I gotta go get this guy.
Come on. There we go.

270
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,146
- You don't want to be doing that.
- Come here!

271
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,285
- Booth.
- What?

272
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,287
- Are you okay?
- Fine. Okay?

273
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,081
Get the guy out of the ring,
and I'll talk to him.

274
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,918
- What are you...
- Are you kidding me?

275
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,826
- Are you OK? Do you need help?
- I don't need help. I'm fine

276
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,922
Will you just get off my back?
I'm really starting to lose my patience.

277
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,718
Look...
Sorry. I...

278
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,686
What do you expect me to do?
He came like a rabid ferret.

279
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,354
You suck!

280
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,908
Well, <i>Chef</i> Gordon Gordon Wyatt,
as a matter of fact.

281
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,784
So, observing your prey
before heading on in to interrogate him?

282
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,907
Agent Booth has had me conduct
more interrogations lately.

283
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,117
That's quite the vote of confidence.

284
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:39,081
I know why you're here.

285
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:43,096
Agent Booth left my office
and immediately went to you, didn't he?

286
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,689
No, I'm all right with it.

287
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,445
There have been a few changes
in Booth.

288
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,930
Since the brain tumor?

289
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,756
Is that why he came to you?

290
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:53,505
He doesn't trust me?
Right.

291
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,685
How could I forgot
about cook/client privilege?

292
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,263
Chef/client privileges.

293
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,797
Has he also told you about
how now when he climbs stairs,

294
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,193
he leads with his right foot
rather than his left?

295
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,399
He holds his phone to a different ear,
coffee in his left hand.

296
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:07,239
How wretchedly observant of you.

297
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,032
Not me. Dr. Brennan.

298
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,286
- Would you like to accompany me?
- To what end?

299
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,914
Double team by a psychologist
and a chef?

300
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:17,415
It'll be epic.

301
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,379
My name's Todd Moore.

302
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:24,798
- Then who's this?
- The Iron Leprechaun.

303
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,843
How many Iron Leprechauns are there?

304
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,135
Just one.
Well, at a time, I mean.

305
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,638
I took over when the last
Iron Leprechaun took a powder.

306
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,598
- When was that?
- About 3 months ago.

307
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,668
- What's this one's name?
- That's Bryce DaFonte.

308
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:39,396
Well, I'm sorry to say,
your predecessor is now deceased.

309
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:41,773
We found his body
at the bottom of a sinkhole.

310
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:43,149
Bryce is dead?

311
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:44,776
Oh, man.

312
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:48,154
It totally explains
why he'd bail on a sweet gig.

313
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,699
Being the Iron Leprechaun
is a sweet gig, is it?

314
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:53,827
It's a very popular character.

315
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,769
You two think I killed Bryce,

316
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:02,252
tossed him into a sinkhole,
so I could take over the franchise?

317
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,131
Well, I was there when Agent Booth
identified himself as FBI, and you ran.

318
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:08,633
Running away from the FBI
is always suspicious.

319
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,635
I'm Canadian.

320
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,721
My work visa expired a week ago.

321
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,040
I thought you were gonna
ship me back to Sudbury.

322
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:16,667
Have you ever been to Sudbury?

323
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,404
You would've ran, too.

324
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,896
Do you know anyone
who would benefit from Bryce's death?

325
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,352
Gidget, I guess.

326
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,359
She's like the McMahon of our world.

327
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,904
Well, how would this Gidget benefit
from losing her biggest star?

328
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,908
When Bryce was the Iron Leprechaun,
she used to pay him a piece of the gate.

329
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,078
Me? Flat rate, 300 bucks a pop.

330
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,539
I'll tell you something else, too.

331
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,775
They used to bump uglies.

332
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,543
And it didn't end so great.

333
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,590
Somebody murdered Bryce?

334
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,754
Well, you know,
your number one draw disappears,

335
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,555
you had to have had a theory.

336
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,390
I just figured he couldn't handle
what happened between us anymore.

337
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,729
- Murdered how?
- Well, what happened between you?

338
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,051
Come on, we had a thing.
Got old.

339
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:08,066
I moved on.
Thought at first Bryce did, too,

340
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,844
but it ate at him.
Guys are like that, you know.

341
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,785
The outside, it looks like
they don't care,

342
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,988
but on the inside, they're chewing
themselves up like cancer.

343
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:17,369
I've got to be a suspect?

344
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,663
We don't like to come
right out and say that.

345
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,581
I know I am,
'cause Bryce was suing me.

346
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,334
- Really? What was he suing you for?
- A bigger cut of the gate.

347
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,419
I didn't take it personal,
maybe he did.

348
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,540
You know men.

349
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:31,132
Something goes wrong in the heart,
it always shows itself in another way.

350
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,464
You know Bryce had a criminal past?

351
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,846
Yeah, he went to prison
for assault during a robbery.

352
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:39,470
What can I say?

353
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,310
I got a thing for the bad boys.
Don't you?

354
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,188
No. I prefer good boys.

355
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:46,815
- Really?
- Yes.

356
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:51,778
- Do you know if Bryce owned a gun?
- Of course not. He was on parole.

357
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,488
Tell you something, though.

358
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,282
I had a sweet little pistol came up
missing right about the same time.

359
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,466
Thank you.

360
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,846
Do you know there is something about
an American diner griddle

361
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,067
that turns out eggs
that rival even the greatest

362
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,355
<i>boite du déjeuner</i> in all of Paris.

363
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,882
You've really done it?

364
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,968
You turned your back
on psychiatry to cook?

365
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,887
There's more than one way
to feed people, you know?

366
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,235
You're irked, aren't you?

367
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,127
No. It's just...

368
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,145
You've got to admit.

369
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,306
All that experience and knowledge
and wisdom trapped in a kitchen?

370
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:30,911
It's crazy.

371
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,529
I would suggest
that what really chuffs your eggs

372
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,927
is that, in his hour of need,

373
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,578
Booth turned to me for advice,
instead of you.

374
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,003
But Booth couldn't go to see you,
because your first duty

375
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,164
is to the FBI.

376
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,917
- He should trust me.
- He does trust you implicitly.

377
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,920
Obviously not. He came to you.
Right? A chef.

378
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,915
But the point is,
he would never do anything

379
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,259
that would compromise
your professional obligations.

380
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,909
He's too fond of you for that.

381
00:18:58,677 --> 00:18:59,889
Did he say that?

382
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,639
- Out loud?
- He came to me,

383
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,392
knowing that I would consult
with you.

384
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,604
Which is what I'd like to do now.

385
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,010
In short,

386
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:12,157
he believes that his brain condition
has rendered incapable

387
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:14,736
of hitting the broadside
of a barn with his firearm.

388
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,005
- That must really drive him up a wall.
- Exactly.

389
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:21,050
So, I look forward
to consulting with you

390
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:24,537
on the strange case
of the man we here and after referred to

391
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:26,748
as Agent B.

392
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:31,279
Yes.

393
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,566
You know what I said about the eggs?

394
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,700
Doesn't extend to the potatoes.

395
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,136
Frozen.

396
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,445
Positive identification
on the victim.

397
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,062
That's a mug shot.

398
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,611
There you go.

399
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,545
Apparently, Mr. DaFonte
was somewhat violent

400
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,735
before channeling his aggression
more productively.

401
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,054
By pretending to be a vicious,
head-cracking leprechaun?

402
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,192
Indeed.

403
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:05,328
- What are you doing?
- In searching

404
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,705
for cause of death,
I found three small

405
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,375
grooves along the margin
on three separate ribs.

406
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,086
Number two on the right,
five and six on the left.

407
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,167
Not caused by being crushed

408
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,257
by two million pounds
of gravel and asphalt?

409
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,677
The nicks are deeper
than the extent of the green patina.

410
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,263
Telling us they pre-existed the green.
Very good.

411
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,184
What else do these nicks tell us?

412
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,561
I haven't the foggiest.

413
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,864
Were you aware that...

414
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,704
Marilyn Monroe
had six toes on one foot?

415
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,920
Keep looking, Mr. Nigel-Murray.

416
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:53,692
Morning, Agent B.

417
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:55,382
Hiya, Sweets.

418
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:59,270
About the other night
when I came to your office...

419
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:02,172
"Nuff said, nuff said",
said the blind man to the deaf man.

420
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:04,561
And in this case,
I am totally the deaf man.

421
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:06,097
Not just deaf. Mute.

422
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,559
You want me to talk
to the victim's family?

423
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,762
Yeah, I got the twin brother
and the sister-in-law in the room.

424
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,809
- What are we looking for?
- Lies and guilt, Sweets.

425
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,146
What else is there?

426
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,179
I was always worried
something bad was gonna happen to Bryce.

427
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,788
I stopped worrying when
he started wrestling professionally.

428
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:27,827
So as far as you know, your brother
put his criminal past behind him.

429
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:32,319
He loved the whole leprechaun
wrestling thing.

430
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,417
Quit drinking.
Made a living.

431
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,544
- You were close?
- We were twins, but no.

432
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:38,424
No, we weren't close.

433
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,507
Bryce was always
a little jealous of Derek.

434
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:43,606
- Because Derek was average-sized.
- I'd have been jealous, too,

435
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:46,012
if it worked out the other way
and I got the short stick.

436
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,640
- No pun intended.
- That's not funny, Agent Booth.

437
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,059
I tried helping Bryce out.
You know, got him jobs.

438
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,663
When did you last talk?

439
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,813
When Derek offered to testify
at his parole hearing.

440
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,399
- Offered?
- Bryce said he didn't need the help.

441
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:01,551
It wasn't like that at all.
The whole parole thing

442
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:03,154
was a lock with or without me.

443
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:05,614
A lock?

444
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,493
Bryce testified against his cell mate
in return for parole.

445
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,189
- I think it was brave.
- It was stupid, Nicole.

446
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,810
Probably get him kill.

447
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:23,101
You don't mind me saying, but...

448
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,588
neither one of you guys
looks like a cop.

449
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:28,054
You look like a substitute
teacher and a fry cook.

450
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:30,473
A fry cook?

451
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,809
We're not cops,
we're professional interrogators.

452
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,477
Nobody's a fry cook!

453
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:36,688
- The cops are in there.
- In case

454
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,856
you annoy us
and we want an arrest made.

455
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,984
Any more cracks about fry cooks,

456
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,403
and I'll have them
come in here to rough you up!

457
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,592
So you and Bryce DaFonte
were cell mates for, what, 16 months?

458
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I'm sorry for Bryce. I liked him.

459
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,774
Made the cell feel roomier.

460
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,198
We have information

461
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,000
that Bryce ratted you out
so he would look good for parole board.

462
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,863
I never took that personally.

463
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:01,796
Little guy like that, you got
to hold him to a different standard.

464
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,428
You were released, what,
three months ago?

465
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,718
Paid my debt to society, got a job.

466
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,720
- Road construction.
- Yep.

467
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,097
Did you ever work
in the Cleveland Park area?

468
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:13,016
- Why?
- Because that's where

469
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,976
your former cell mate
was discovered.

470
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:18,187
- 20 feet under the roadway.
- Well, I didn't put him there.

471
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,773
Bryce told them where to find
my pruno and dope stash, okay?

472
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:24,497
That's small beans.

473
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:26,863
Three days in solitary.
I'm gonna kill him for that?

474
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:28,984
All right, all right.

475
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,493
Me and Bryce cooked
that dodge up together, okay?

476
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,844
There was no chance
I was getting out a day earlier

477
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:39,155
than my full sentence, due to a spitting
incident involving the warden.

478
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,483
I figured, why not do my cell mate
a solid and get him out?

479
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,548
And believe me, DaFonte wanted out.

480
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,467
Well, everyone in prison wants out.

481
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,289
No, not like Bryce.
He was talking about escape.

482
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:53,848
- You know, he was highly motivated.
- So, what was the big rush?

483
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:55,600
What you think?

484
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:59,543
I think perhaps a crisis
of the heart and loins.

485
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,498
He got a Dear John letter
from his ladylove

486
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:04,901
saying she was thinking about
calling it quits on him.

487
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,575
The least I could do for my buddy.

488
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,864
Wasn't nobody waiting on me
on the outside.

489
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:14,911
So, my psychic

490
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,014
says that Brennan and Booth
are linked in a very profound way.

491
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,418
In order to eat that thing,
you're gonna have to dislocate your jaw.

492
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,003
Like an articulated python.

493
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:26,621
Tell me, though...

494
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,430
have you noticed
any behavioral changes in Booth

495
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,219
since he woke up from the coma?

496
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:34,268
He's not as happy-go-lucky
as he used to be.

497
00:24:34,393 --> 00:24:35,640
It's like he's...

498
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,308
sort of sad.

499
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:42,188
Well, perhaps the brain tumor forced him
to confront his own mortality.

500
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:45,119
Booth's confronted his mortality
plenty of times.

501
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:49,570
I think that dream he had,
about him and Brennan being married...

502
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,448
I think that he sort of
misses that dream.

503
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,619
It's like he's homesick for that place
and those people.

504
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,814
You think

505
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,363
Booth fell in love with Dr. Brennan

506
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,042
during a dream.

507
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,544
So do you.

508
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,878
Right?

509
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,936
Well, I'm a psychiatrist.

510
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,906
- I'm not comfortable with answering.
- No.

511
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,219
You're a chef.

512
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:15,366
I am. As usual, you...

513
00:25:15,707 --> 00:25:17,260
you see the truth in things.

514
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,976
Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

515
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,604
This is the most ill-conceived,
sapless, vomitous,

516
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:26,027
gargoyle of gastronomity
I've ever encountered.

517
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:27,889
It's just preposterous. You can't...

518
00:25:28,014 --> 00:25:30,746
You know, you're really gonna have
to learn to enjoy things

519
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:32,196
the way they are.

520
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:36,476
Perhaps you're right.

521
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,867
The remains were covered
with 150 years' worth of rubble.

522
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,469
- There's a word I loathe.
- Half-naked dwarf wrestler gets killed,

523
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:49,608
and his body gets dumped in
some old hole in the ground?

524
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,050
Most of what he was buried in and
what I found around the remains was tile

525
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:56,340
translucent, ceramic, vitreous,

526
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:57,847
dating back to the 1920s.

527
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,911
- What was that, some Turkish bath?
- No, it's a pedestrian underpass. Here.

528
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:03,876
It collapsed in the '30s.

529
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,857
They just threw some rocks into it
and paved it over.

530
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,034
Wait a second.
So what you're saying is

531
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,112
you think that the leprechaun's body
was in that pedestrian underpass

532
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,138
- when the sinkhole happened.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,742
I mean, a guy his size,
there could've been a way through,

534
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,480
especially with some digging.
That would've stretched from here

535
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:23,718
underground to approximately
the other side of the street,

536
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:26,079
and then maybe another 20 feet east.

537
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,463
"Cash for gold".

538
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,133
Three months ago
this place got robbed.

539
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,832
No sign of forced entry
to the doors or windows.

540
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,346
Alarm was cut from the inside.

541
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,848
Bad guys got off
with bags of gold coins.

542
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,559
We think the robber may have been
the victim in your sinkhole.

543
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:45,803
I'll be damned.

544
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:47,738
The owners
will be glad to hear that.

545
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:50,088
Fraud Unit suspected
it was an inside job.

546
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:51,459
How much did they lose?

547
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,288
120 grand worth.

548
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,336
I think I found
the point of ingress.

549
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,368
You've got to be kidding.
Just thinking about it, I can't breathe.

550
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,203
Angela's sketch shows the collapsed

551
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,623
pedestrian walkway
comes five feet from this drain.

552
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,787
The victim was small and strong.
He could've dug his way through.

553
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:11,072
That's gotta be, what,
16, 18 inches?

554
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:12,547
Honestly, I can't breathe.

555
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,897
I got anxiety
thinking about a guy down there.

556
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:16,707
Come on,
there's no way the victim can

557
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:19,178
- get his shoulders through there.
- He could have made it.

558
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,976
Mostly naked, in his Lycra shorts.

559
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:25,017
We may even find
a container of luicant down there.

560
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,811
All we found were eight gold coins.

561
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:30,277
Classic accomplice rip-off scenario.

562
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,478
No honor between thieves.

563
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,730
What? I'm not allowed to chime in?
I'm a law enforcement professional.

564
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,622
The only markings we know for sure
came from before the sinkhole,

565
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,625
are these three little nicks

566
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:50,999
on his ribs.

567
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,503
Could he have been stabbed?

568
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:55,548
- With what?
- The world's dullest knife.

569
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,426
Perhaps something along the lines
of a very dull hatchet.

570
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,429
To a little person, a hatchet
would be the equivalent of an ax.

571
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,973
Assuming the accomplice
was already lying in wait,

572
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:07,935
he would've had the aforethought
to bring a more suitable weapon.

573
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:10,313
- Like a gun.
- Or a giant sword.

574
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:12,982
Or a gun.

575
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:18,474
But the killer would have had to
have been an incredibly bad shot

576
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,331
to merely graze his or her victim

577
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,617
three times in such tight quarters.

578
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:32,205
I see!

579
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,171
- If he was reaching forward.
- More wrenched.

580
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,785
Or if he was actually hanging
from his arm and

581
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,259
the killer shot down
from this angle.

582
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,554
One bullet, fired from above,
grazing these three ribs,

583
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,057
deflecting,
piercing the diaphragm...

584
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,245
And of course, as an
achondroplastic dwarf,

585
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,978
his organs would be more tightly
jammed together than a average person.

586
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,669
This would be his liver.

587
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,675
He'd have bled to death in minutes.

588
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,152
We've found cause of death.

589
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,492
There's some collateral damage

590
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,243
to Booth's brain here.

591
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,182
It would result in
the memory lapses,

592
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,835
but it doesn't explain
his other symptoms.

593
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:13,918
But I don't think
Booth has brain damage.

594
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,870
Then what's his problem?

595
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,550
May I ask why

596
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:20,469
you didn't published
your book on Booth and Brennan?

597
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,636
Is there a connection between
my book and Booth's marksmanship?

598
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:26,745
I believe you didn't published it,
because you're afraid of

599
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,600
how Brennan and Booth would
react to its conclusion.

600
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,313
My book concludes that Brennan and
Booth are in love with each other.

601
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:37,505
It's a scrummy conundrum, isn't it?

602
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:41,487
I believe that as a reaction
to the childhood traumas of

603
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,531
abuse and abandonment, Dr. Brennan

604
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,272
utilizes her intellect

605
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:48,494
to armor herself from intense
levels of emotion, like love.

606
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:50,336
And Booth?

607
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,837
Subconsciously, he's sensitive
to her vulnerability.

608
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,843
He knows that acting upon
his feelings for her

609
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,987
would amount to a kind of assault.

610
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,923
I couldn't agree with you more.

611
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,157
Booth not shooting
straight is simply

612
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,835
a manifestation of
his phallic frustration?

613
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,378
He quite literally can't
bring his weapon to bear.

614
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:16,775
Do I even have the
right to publish my book

615
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,567
and make public what these two
can't even admit to themselves?

616
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,322
Good Lord, don't ask me.

617
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:24,697
I'm just a chef, not a psychiatrist.

618
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,216
I gave up that game precisely so I
don't have to face that kind dilemma.

619
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:42,131
We do know that Hodges found a. 22
pistol near the body.

620
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:44,320
- It was fully loaded.
- It hadn't been discharged.

621
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:47,116
I know that, Bones, okay?
I do work for the FBI.

622
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:51,115
So has Gordon Gordon helped you
at all with your shooting problem?

623
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,851
- He doesn't see it as a problem.
- Maybe you don't have one.

624
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:57,980
Have you ever considered the possibility
that you might simply be getting older?

625
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,065
Men do tend to decline

626
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,775
physically past the age of 35.

627
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
Remind me again how great
I feel after talking to you.

628
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,805
- Who else would tell you the truth?
- It does make me feel better.

629
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,868
It makes no rational sense,
but it does.

630
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,163
Maybe I should start
packing heat again.

631
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,835
- Packing heat?
- It's a colloquialism.

632
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,625
I'm quite a good shot.

633
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,085
If the leprechaun was shot,
then where would the bullet be?

634
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,399
I assume somewhere in the six tons

635
00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:25,591
of crap Hodgins
hasn't sifted through yet.

636
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,135
Wait. Did you just
call forensic evidence "crap"?

637
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,803
Colloquial again.

638
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,056
This is very nice.
It shows that you're adapting.

639
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:35,062
I'm working on it, and
joshing around, too.

640
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,570
I already admitted that
Bryce and I had a thing.

641
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,894
Where's that hot FBI agent guy?

642
00:31:49,455 --> 00:31:51,867
If I'm going to be interrogated,
I want it to be from him.

643
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,731
That sweet, little pistol you owned

644
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,939
that went missing, was this it?

645
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,707
Is that what was used to kill Bryce?

646
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,502
But it was nearby.

647
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,871
That's my pistol.

648
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,385
He didn't steal the gun from you.

649
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,385
You gave it to him, because
you worried about his safety.

650
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,710
I'm not exactly the worrying type.

651
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,925
You want to make out a little bit?

652
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,720
People watching from behind
that mirror kind of turns me on.

653
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,275
This personae she's projecting,
this little person cougar...

654
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,193
she's either masking emotional pain

655
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,488
- or overcompensating for guilt.
- Maybe you should tell Sweets.

656
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,635
Believe me, if a
chef can figure it out,

657
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,035
then a prodigy like Sweets
would've got there long before.

658
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,490
- Tell me...
- So it wasn't my brightest idea.

659
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:42,934
What's your theory on why Agent
Booth can no longer shoot straight?

660
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,545
He should practice more.

661
00:32:45,536 --> 00:32:46,614
But perhaps,

662
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:49,585
in conjunction
with his using the wrong foot

663
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,675
to climb the stairs and his
wrong hand to drink coffee,

664
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,347
he's closing the wrong
eye when he aims.

665
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,641
Real marksmen keep both
eyes open when they shoot.

666
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,980
That's what I get for using Quigley
Down Under as a reference, isn't it?

667
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,317
Sweets told you about
the hands and the feet?

668
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,027
We are consulting.

669
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,153
Patient confidentiality
is being maintained.

670
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,907
I won't tell him you've been ratting
him out to the FBI behind his back.

671
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,237
Ratting out is an accurate phrase,

672
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:19,136
but somehow it doesn't seem true.

673
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:23,401
You've come quite a long
distance since we last met,

674
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:26,114
if you can now see
a distinction between

675
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:28,005
accuracy and the truth.

676
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,005
I'm trying to help Booth.

677
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,634
I can be objective about
his brain, and he can't.

678
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:36,104
Sometimes you have to help
people against their wishes.

679
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:39,683
I can't think of anything
I wouldn't do to help him.

680
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,896
Can we listen, please?

681
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,745
Did you give Bryce the gun because
you knew he was planning a robbery?

682
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,364
All I knew is Bryce told me he found
a way to make a ton of money fast.

683
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,158
- Who was in it with him?
- I don't know.

684
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:59,161
I think the reason
you feel responsible

685
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,538
is that if you'd paid
Bryce his fair share,

686
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,540
he wouldn't have been killed.

687
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,596
Bull's-eye. Well done.

688
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,588
Bryce didn't need
money to impress me.

689
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,883
And it wasn't me that he was
worried about when he was in prison.

690
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:13,978
Who?

691
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:17,234
All I know is that Bryce
broke it off with me.

692
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,390
Said he had to get
serious with somebody else.

693
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,741
Said I wasn't enough woman for him.

694
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,177
Why is he looking at us?

695
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,165
What took you so long?
Don't answer that, okay?

696
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,065
- What did he get out of her?
- No idea,

697
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,535
but the two of them
are very excited.

698
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,305
- You want to...
- I wouldn't dream of it, please.

699
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:43,195
Murder victim told Gidget that
she wasn't enough woman for him.

700
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:46,320
- So?
- It suggests that while in jail,

701
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:49,545
your victim was pining
for an average-sized woman.

702
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,839
Vocabulary?
That is your evidence?

703
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,695
We have the victim's phone records.

704
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,175
The people he talked to
were Gidget and his brother.

705
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,625
The brother said that
they were estranged?

706
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:02,395
And the victim's brother's wife is
an average-sized woman, isn't she?

707
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:07,020
- You want us to handle this?
- I'll handle this one, boys.

708
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,395
- Why did you bring me here?
- We found Bryce right there.

709
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,704
He was crawling from
all the way over there,

710
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,832
lugging his own weight in gold coins
through a tunnel, probably about...

711
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,125
about that wide.

712
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,420
He got out. On the other end,
he was shot and killed.

713
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,757
Why is it that somebody
would do something like that?

714
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,508
Greed? Bravery?

715
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,914
He was doing it for you, wasn't he?

716
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,228
How long were you and Bryce seeing
each other behind your husband's back?

717
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,054
Since always.

718
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:53,108
Since high school.

719
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:56,076
I wrote Bryce in prison, and

720
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,520
I told him that we had to stop.

721
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,629
But when he got out on parole,

722
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:03,911
he begged me to choose him.

723
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,185
Got it in his head
that to get me to himself,

724
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,541
he had to be a better
provider than his brother.

725
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,879
Are you going to
tell Derek about us?

726
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:17,591
I'm not going to say anything.

727
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,511
But if you've been in love
with another man for ten years,

728
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,721
your husband knows.

729
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,267
What I need to know is who was
helping Bryce out with his burglary.

730
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,842
I don't know.

731
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
Probably somebody he met in prison.

732
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,045
He said that he would buy me
anything that I ever wanted.

733
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,385
If I knew Bryce was stealing, I
would have begged him to stop.

734
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,641
When a man can't have
the woman that he loves,

735
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,613
he gets a bit crazy.

736
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,600
One brother... he died for you,

737
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:48,570
right there.

738
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,880
The other one, your husband...

739
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:53,293
you put him through hell.

740
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,932
- I still can't find a bullet.
- Keep trying.

741
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,245
It could have been washed anywhere.

742
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,561
The guy's ring

743
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,771
was nearly 30 meters away.

744
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,898
High school wrestling.

745
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,945
Now, that has got to be the
victim's, right? I am back.

746
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,209
I mean, King of the Lab, right?

747
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,365
Not King of the Lab.
This is not the victim's ring.

748
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,244
Achondroplasia causes metaphyseal
cupping at the joints,

749
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:30,664
resulting in large knuckles too...
too big for this ring.

750
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,843
- Then, whose ring is this?
- Someone

751
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,635
who went to the same
high school at the same time,

752
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,189
played the same sport

753
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,515
but had average-size fingers.

754
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,205
- We're good at this.
- This is what we do.

755
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,565
We're the best.

756
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,105
Mr. DaFonte,
thank you for coming in.

757
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,108
So, you got any news on my brother?

758
00:37:58,424 --> 00:38:00,068
Put your hand out like this, please?

759
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,906
- What's going on?
- Please, your hand just like this.

760
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:12,789
When he came out of the tunnel,
you reached out and took his hand.

761
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,295
He thought you were working together,
but you knew why he wanted the money.

762
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,645
When you shot your brother, the
force partially dislocated his shoulder,

763
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,497
while the bullet traveled
through the torso

764
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:25,719
in a fatal trajectory,
grazing three ribs.

765
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:29,056
Then you pushed him back
into the tunnel, foot to face.

766
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,220
But he pulled off your ring.

767
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,464
You're under arrest.

768
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,635
- Why?
- Come on, Nicky. You know why.

769
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,662
- Let's go.
- You know exactly why.

770
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,955
We found most of the gold coins
in the victim's brother's crawl space.

771
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,807
Most of them, not all of them.

772
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:58,855
The oldest murder of them all, eh?
Brother slays brother, Cain and Abel.

773
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,004
Tomorrow morning, I got to be on
the firing line at 7:00 a.m.sharp,

774
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,284
so you have to fix my brain damage.

775
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,825
You haven't got brain damage.

776
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,470
They took out a brain tumor

777
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,825
the size of a melon
ball out of my head.

778
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,785
I can't shoot straight.
I can't tell if people are lying.

779
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,688
I have to get Dummy books
just to do things. I-I...

780
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,825
I'm at a complete loss with stuff.

781
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,275
Not as a result of brain damage.

782
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,779
When you were in a coma, you
got a glimpse of another world.

783
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,739
And how does
that help me aim my gun?

784
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,868
Temperance Brennan.

785
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,537
You're in love with her.

786
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,139
You're building a world around her.

787
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,667
A family.

788
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,055
We're not compatible.

789
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,423
She sees the world one way,
I see it the other way.

790
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,989
No, of course, it's absolutely
ludicrous the idea of you two together,

791
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,842
but the heart chooses
what it chooses, doesn't it?

792
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,556
We don't have any say in the matter.

793
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,851
She doesn't love me.
I would know.

794
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,180
May I counsel patience
on this front?

795
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,033
Hope and patience.

796
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:10,574
About my marksmanship
certification... any advice?

797
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,998
Grow a set.

798
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,952
Be a man. Step up.

799
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,204
She's your partner
for heaven's sake.

800
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:19,505
The job you do together
is highly dangerous.

801
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,505
She counts on you for protection.

802
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,712
So you damn well better protect her.

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,425
That's your big psychiatric advice?
Just grow a set?

804
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:29,884
When it comes to a man
and his gun,

805
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:31,720
a woman is the natural cure.

806
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,694
Take Dr. Brennan to this
shooting event of yours.

807
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,426
You won't fail in front of her.

808
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,731
Trust me.

809
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:49,295
Please, take a seat.

810
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,095
Why can't we sit
out in the restaurant?

811
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,085
This is a great honor
to sit at the chef's table.

812
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,215
But it's in the kitchen.
It's hot and noisy.

813
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,515
It's a thing, all right?
Just go with it.

814
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,905
Would you do me a favor?

815
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,424
As long as it does not
involve me shaving my head.

816
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:18,363
You are making a joke.

817
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:20,980
- I'm becoming quite amusing.
- It's very funny.

818
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:24,981
Honestly, will you do me a favor?

819
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:29,236
As long as I don't
have to shave my head.

820
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:32,101
A little advice on the humor:

821
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:34,783
once the joke happens, don't dog
pile on it. Just let it go.

822
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,701
Do try these amuse bouche.

823
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,215
They may look like
sperm on corn smut,

824
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,581
but I assure you they are
magically scrumptious.

825
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,450
Be brave, my children. Make a foray.

826
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,905
Cast off your
shackles, etcetera, etcetera.

827
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,383
Abide by my exhortations
to joie de vivre,

828
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:53,802
that you may be borne aloft

829
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,597
on the trembling wings
of giggling angels.

830
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,940
Excellent, Agent Booth.

831
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:49,105
