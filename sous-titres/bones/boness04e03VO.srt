1
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,055
<i>- Hey, baby.
- Where have you been?</i>

2
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,369
<i>- You were supposed to call...
- I probably won't be home</i>

3
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:13,764
for another few days.

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:16,645
You making another one of your
pit stops? What's her name this time?

5
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:18,422
<i>- There's no girl.
- Really?</i>

6
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,879
I got to get this load to Punxsutawney.

7
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,609
Look, Shirl, I got to go.

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:23,587
Why?!

9
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:26,088
Because I drank a gallon of coffee,
and I got to go!

10
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,864
<i>Oh, really? If I find that...</i>

11
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:05,224
Bones, wakey-wakey.

12
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:07,472
Bones?

13
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:12,186
Wakey-wakey.

14
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,949
Eggs and bakey.

15
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,707
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- 6:30, which is why I brought you this.

16
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,475
Nice, bed head there.

17
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:31,063
So... Seeley Booth, Mark Gaffney.

18
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,730
Hey.

19
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:34,496
Hey.

20
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,326
- What do you want, Booth?
- My partner.

21
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:39,728
Got some pre-breakfast remains for you.

22
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:41,007
You...

23
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,106
getting a little chilly there, Mark?

24
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:46,443
- I think I'll put some clothes on.
- Excellent choice.

25
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:53,491
- It would be good if you called first.
- Who knew you were even dating?

26
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,457
Well, I wouldn't call it dating. We...

27
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:58,413
occasionally make arrangements
to spend time together.

28
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:01,041
I'm just surprised
you're not more picky.

29
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,735
My relationship
with Mark is purely physical,

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,089
and I am very satisfied
with him in that area.

31
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,008
Did you see his chest and his thighs?

32
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,676
- Bones.
- What?

33
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,596
Haven't you chosen someone `cause
they were satisfying sexually?

34
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:16,378
There has to be more than sex.

35
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,362
Not really.

36
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:20,596
Our interests and professions
do not intersect.

37
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:22,492
Well, what is he? Bricklayer?

38
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:25,184
You know, truck driver? Tango dancer?

39
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,570
He is a deep-sea welder.

40
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,568
I wouldn't even think
to put that on the list.

41
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:33,740
They work on oil derricks, repair boats.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,672
After being at sea for months at a time,

43
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,495
he seems to...

44
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,397
enjoy having a sexual
relationship, so...

45
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm sure. I am sure.

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,667
Deep-sea welder.

47
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:48,338
He can hold his breath
for three minutes down there.

48
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,006
Underwater?

49
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:53,044
Of course.

50
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,236
Come on, seriously,

51
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:02,537
who thinks it's a good idea
to blow up an outhouse?

52
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:03,910
Probably accidental.

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,840
Assuming a minimum
methane level of five percent,

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,159
a simple spark
could trigger the explosion.

55
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:12,737
Of course, that would depend on
the level of fecal deposit in the tank.

56
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,025
Just stop.

57
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,730
Your aversion to feces is irrational.
It's three-quarters water.

58
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,748
Don't mention that to the guy who
almost got his ass blown off.

59
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,831
He survived?

60
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,679
Kind of, but he ain't gonna be making

61
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,829
any contributions to the gene pool
anytime soon.

62
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,837
The victim is alive,
why are we here?

63
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,331
Take a look. Go ahead.

64
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:42,838
Yeah.

65
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:47,312
Bones - Season 04 Episode 03
<i>"The Man in the Outhouse"</i>

66
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:51,234
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Icefreak

67
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,882
Subtitle: <i>A²S Team</i>
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

68
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,768
Gunshot wound to the frontal lobe.
Where's my new assistant?

69
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:28,459
She's at security
getting her ID and badge.

70
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,005
There's powder residue on the bone
indicating that the victim

71
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,035
was shot at close range.

72
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,415
These suits are so cool.

73
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,054
I am a robot.

74
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:42,487
Sorry.

75
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,490
Dead for about 72 hours.
No lividity on the legs.

76
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,059
Wait. Poop will do that
to you in three days?

77
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,127
Actually, it's the fecal
coliform bacteria, streptococcus

78
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,523
and maggots.

79
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,505
Guy you're looking for has major issues.

80
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,997
He deposits the object of his rage

81
00:04:58,117 --> 00:04:59,802
in a literal pit of poop.

82
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:02,263
Excrement being the symbol
for that which we

83
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,728
reject and hate about ourselves.

84
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,645
Do we need to take lessons
in toilet training issues?

85
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,314
Front teeth are shattered.

86
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:13,994
Shot in the head,

87
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,771
punched in the face,
and dumped in the poop.

88
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,953
Whoever did this
did not get enough therapy.

89
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:23,952
Victim has veneers on the maxillary
central and lateral incisors,

90
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:26,829
and there's reshaping of the gum tissue,

91
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:29,083
as well as the underlying bone.

92
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:30,729
Take a look.

93
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,163
Yeah.

94
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:34,743
Looks like
there's something in his throat.

95
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:46,182
Looks like a photograph

96
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,768
after the decomp
and stomach acid got to it.

97
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,147
He wasn't punched.

98
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,022
The killer crammed that down
the victim's throat so hard,

99
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,315
it broke his teeth.

100
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:58,209
There's a motive in that. You're gonna
want to see what's in that picture.

101
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,575
I'll call Angela.

102
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:08,630
Bless you.

103
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,679
Thank you.

104
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:17,963
This is really a lot of feces.

105
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,357
Stop making that face.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,719
It's just sewage, Ms. Wick.

107
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,928
I realize that.

108
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,115
Six barrels worth.

109
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,725
- I'm fine.
- Good.

110
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,728
I just thought for safety's sake,
perhaps a Hazmat suit...

111
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:34,954
We got the all clear.
No danger, no suit.

112
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,957
- You got a problem with that?
- No. No.

113
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,821
Where's Dr. Brennan? I thought
I'd be working with Dr. Brennan.

114
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,127
She's with Agent Booth.

115
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,618
She asked me to tell her
all about how you're doing.

116
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,956
Please tell her that I liked the smell.

117
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,213
No pedicle laminae or spinous process

118
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,230
means we're not talking vertebral arch,

119
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,015
which is cool, 'cause I'm seeing thin
lateral borders with small eminences.

120
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,888
Makes it one thing and one thing only.

121
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,452
A chunk of truck driver coccyx.

122
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,305
My work here is done.

123
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,703
Hand it over.

124
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,277
What have we here?

125
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:22,862
It's human hair.

126
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,614
Distinct color variations.

127
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,923
I'll turn it over to Hair and Fibers.
I know Dr. Brennan

128
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,660
is a stickler for protocol.

129
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,705
There's no root bulb, which there
should be if it was torn out.

130
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:36,283
Cross-section is round,
which suggests it's Mongoloid in origin.

131
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:39,231
Wait. Dr. Saroyan determined
that the victim is Caucasian.

132
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,799
He couldn't have hair
that's Mongoloid in origin.

133
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,259
Yeah. Not bad. But he could if he used

134
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:48,471
this keratin glue to stick a wig
on his little bald head.

135
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:52,225
Start sifting through the sewage
and isolate the strands of hair.

136
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:04,618
I scanned the skull,
and I factored in age and build.

137
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:05,944
I found the toupee.

138
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,543
- They know, Ms. Wick.
- I wasn't sure if you'd mentioned it.

139
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,248
He didn't have to.
You did everything but hire a skywriter.

140
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,097
Have you gotten anywhere with
the picture we pulled from his throat?

141
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:16,868
No, not yet. I'm... how can I put this,

142
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,336
depoopifying the fragments now
to piece together some kind of image.

143
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,097
He looks familiar.

144
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:27,088
Let me add the fatty tissue
and his new, expensive teeth.

145
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,514
He does look familiar.

146
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,711
- Put on his toupee.
- Which I found.

147
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:38,104
Oh, my God.

148
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,897
That's why he looks familiar.

149
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,062
What?

150
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,225
Be careful. If you cheat on your wife,

151
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,249
you just might get Busted By Bill.

152
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:48,722
<i>I'm gonna go to the bathroom.</i>

153
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,916
That girl's the bait
they use to lure the cheaters.

154
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,492
<i>Wait. What is this?</i>

155
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,521
<i>Swing around. Get the wife.</i>

156
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,311
<i>- You son of a bitch!
- Joseph Marilla,</i>

157
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,829
<i>I'm Bill O'Roarke,
and you've been Busted By Bill.</i>

158
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,671
<i>Wait. No! My back hurt.</i>

159
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,978
<i>- I thought she was a masseuse.
- I'm gonna kill you.</i>

160
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:07,383
<i>You are dead! Dead!</i>

161
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:09,027
Next time, ask yourself this:

162
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:12,422
"Am I getting lucky,
or have I just been Busted by Bill?"

163
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,143
Our victim is Bill O'Roarke.

164
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,257
Okay great, thanks.

165
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:26,235
O'Roarke and his wife
live in Cherry Ridge.

166
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,398
Old Bill
must have been making a tidy sum.

167
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:31,182
He shouldn't have been rewarded.
He was perpetuating a primitive

168
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,672
and prurient morality by

169
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,036
parading victims
for the purpose of entertainment.

170
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:37,770
You know what? You cheat on your spouse,
you get what's coming to you.

171
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,709
Anthropologically,
83 percent of societies are polygamous.

172
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,670
Now you sound French, okay?

173
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,369
Look, being faithful is what
separates us, you know, from the chimps.

174
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,397
No, actually, it's a gene called HAR1F.

175
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,436
We're talking about the
10 Commandments here.

176
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,488
"Thou shalt not commit adultery."

177
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:56,641
One down from your personal favorite,
"Thou shalt not kill."

178
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,228
So you also believe that Moses
wandered the desert for 40 days,

179
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,689
climbed Mount Sinai,
at which point a supernatural force

180
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:07,360
carved a convenient list of behavioral
guidelines on two pieces of rock?

181
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,754
Yeah.
That's why it's on the Supreme Court.

182
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:11,990
Fascinating.

183
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,428
I was supposed to be home this weekend.

184
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:21,938
Bill and my 20th anniversary
is in five days.

185
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,488
Why weren't you here?

186
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,510
Our daughter is away
at college in Raleigh.

187
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,661
I try to spend
as much time with her as I can.

188
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,876
She adores her father.

189
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,103
I mean, how am I going to tell her this?

190
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,848
I told Bill not to do that stupid show.

191
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,215
You were worried about him?

192
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:43,104
Bill was a serious journalist
until he met Arthur.

193
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:45,936
Arthur produces the show.

194
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:49,151
And at first Bill said no,
but the money was unbelievable.

195
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,237
I was just always so worried about him.

196
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:54,031
- Bill have any enemies?
- Have you seen that show?

197
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:57,034
There isn't a man he caught
that wouldn't want him dead.

198
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,521
Amanda always resented the show,

199
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,122
but it didn't stop her from
spending the money Bill made.

200
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,550
I'm telling you, if I thought this show

201
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,194
had anything to do with Bill's death,
I'd never forgive myself.

202
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:13,676
You know, just getting us the footage
that we need should be enough.

203
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:16,053
Pete's pulling the cheaters
the moment they were caught.

204
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,096
And you are?

205
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,223
I'm the producer, Veronica Landau.

206
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,605
Agent Booth.
This here is, Dr. Brennan.

207
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,274
Hey, is it true?

208
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:24,651
Where they found him?

209
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,139
Upright and inverted
in the refuse-filled

210
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,108
pit of an outhouse? Yes.

211
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,179
God.

212
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:33,738
I'm sorry but it's very difficult
to paint a pleasant picture

213
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:35,930
of his demise right now.

214
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,146
Look, who was the last person
who saw Mr. O'Roarke alive?

215
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,745
Me. 9:18, Friday night.

216
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:43,164
- That's specific.
- We had to shoot wraparounds.

217
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:46,225
9:20 would have put us into
time-and-a-half, so I pulled the plug.

218
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,672
I was, I was supposed to pick him up
on Saturday morning

219
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,149
for the promos we were shooting;
knocked on the door, wasn't there.

220
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,550
Pete called me, and I called Arthur,
we cancelled the shoot.

221
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:56,913
No one was worried that he disappeared?

222
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:02,296
Bill and I had a small disagreement
Friday night.

223
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,232
He wanted to go visit his kid
at college,

224
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,062
but we had a shoot scheduled.
Promos.

225
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:09,106
- Anyone else hear this argument?
- No. It was personal.

226
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,757
We walked away from the crew.

227
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:14,960
Actually, it was,
it was pretty loud, Mr. Lang.

228
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,850
Mr. O'Roarke threatened to quit.

229
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,338
He was just blowing off steam.
That's why I wasn't worried.

230
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,879
Figured he'd just gone off
with Amanda to see the kid.

231
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,296
This is a popular show. It's probably
worth millions of dollars, am I right?

232
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,478
- Why do you ask?
- Well, money like that,

233
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:36,926
you must insure
your star for quite a bit.

234
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,154
Of course, but
I think you're taking this all wrong.

235
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,429
See, Bill and I were best friends.

236
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:43,291
We played tennis together
all the time...

237
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:45,207
If he quit, you'd lose everything.

238
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:47,116
And if he was found dead,

239
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:49,524
you'd end up with a nice payout.

240
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,236
Wouldn't you?

241
00:12:56,748 --> 00:13:00,100
Why don't you get Agent Booth
everything he needs, Pete?

242
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:02,441
I believe I should call my attorney.

243
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,819
Arthur Lang will only talk
through his attorney,

244
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,227
who says he was in Atlantic City
all weekend playing Keno.

245
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,688
- We're checking out his story.
- He could've hired a hit man.

246
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,427
No, this was not a contract job,
this was personal and violent.

247
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,222
Okay, Sweets is on his way up
with the show tapes to

248
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,178
profile for a revenge killer.

249
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,475
- Okay, see you later.
- Bones, wait a second.

250
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,186
Where you going? I thought maybe
we could, you know, help out Sweets.

251
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:32,094
- To a film.
- This is much better than a movie.

252
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,067
Hours of fascinating video. Hey,
great stories for the deep-sea welder.

253
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,585
Actually,
I'm going to the film with a botanist.

254
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:39,639
I get it.

255
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:42,529
You dumped Mark.
It's too bad, I kind of liked the guy.

256
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,744
No, I didn't dump Mark,
I'm seeing both of them.

257
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:48,246
- At the same time?
- Mark and I have a physical connection.

258
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:51,677
The botanist,
while brilliant and fascinating, just...

259
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,586
just doesn't appeal to me in that way.

260
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,161
OK, so all that stuff you said
about monogamy being unnatural,

261
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:58,441
- you're just making excuses.
- I do not make excuses.

262
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,623
Only people
who are ashamed make excuses.

263
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,344
Bones, two guys at the same time,
it's not right.

264
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:05,435
I mean,
that's why they invented dueling.

265
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,808
Hey, you guys ready?

266
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:10,871
I know what I'm doing, Booth.

267
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,846
My gut says you're going
with your gut on this one,

268
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:16,121
and we all know how that ends up.
Not good.

269
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,051
Is there something we need
to discuss before getting to work?

270
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,237
No, no.

271
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:23,677
Just call me when
you find something of value.

272
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:31,269
No, it's nothing.
It's just, she's got a date.

273
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:34,804
- Oh, and how do you feel about that?
- It's not about me, OK?

274
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,347
Let's go look at those videos.

275
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,788
Do you have any idea
how good it smells in here?

276
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,821
It's Eau de Formaldehyde,
glad you like it.

277
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:45,221
There are hairline fractures
at the base of the skull.

278
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,973
Probably made when the photo
was jammed down his throat.

279
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,230
Dr. Hodgins could probably
pull some particulates.

280
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,310
Very good.

281
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:54,155
My boyfriend thinks it's weird
that I love doing this. But,

282
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,204
I think it's weird
that he loves the accordion.

283
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,804
- I'm with you there.
- Dr. Brennan is my hero,

284
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:00,531
always has been.

285
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,444
I just, I hope she loves, she likes me.

286
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,599
Well, bonjour.

287
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,118
Ante-mortem fractures
to the lumbar vertebrae.

288
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,563
- Maybe two weeks old.
- Try to find what caused it.

289
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:11,448
On it.

290
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,271
It's just, Dr. Brennan and I are,
like, the same, you know?

291
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,321
We just, we understand
that the dead don't talk back

292
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,822
or want the window open
when it's freezing out

293
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:22,257
or pick at your plate or
pee on the toilet seat...

294
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,636
You might want to keep
a little mystery about yourself.

295
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:26,980
Sure.

296
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,466
But you're gonna put in a good word
for me, right? I mean,

297
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,874
wouldn't it be fun
if I were here forever?

298
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,032
Yeah.

299
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:36,105
Brush abrasions.

300
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,607
Can you hand me a swab?

301
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:41,883
I managed to get some
usable pieces of that photo.

302
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,572
Just fragments, but it's a start.

303
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:48,369
Okay. I used an infrared camera
and I excluded all the visible light.

304
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:51,370
If I had to take a guess,

305
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:54,623
I'd say the mystery couple
were knocking boots.

306
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,318
I always love your clinical assessments.

307
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,951
<i>Sorry. I'm so sorry. "Sorry"?!
But nothing was gonna happen.</i>

308
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,826
<i>- Nothing was gonna happen?
- Nothing...</i>

309
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,427
<i>- You're in your under... Don't!
- God, please don't cry.</i>

310
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:08,582
<i>- Don't cry? Don't cry.
- You're in your underwear.</i>

311
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,432
<i>- What do you want me...
- Nothing...</i>

312
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:14,030
- What'd I miss?
- Six men crying,

313
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,952
two insisting they'd gotten lost,

314
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,333
four saying they were trying
to show the poor, young woman

315
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,050
how dangerous the Internet could be.

316
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,233
Parade of saints?

317
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,924
The murder was premeditated
and filled with rage,

318
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:26,342
not the act of someone
apologetic or ashamed.

319
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:27,679
Did you find any rage?

320
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,124
Well, I know you don't have the benefit
of years of psychological traing,

321
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:33,704
but, check out one Jim Dodd.

322
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,075
<i>Come on, baby, I can't wait.</i>

323
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,070
<i>You bastard!</i>

324
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,963
<i>You're never gonna see this child, ever!
Do you hear me? Ever!</i>

325
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,216
<i>I'm Bill O'Roarke, and, Jim Dodd,
you've been Busted By Bill!</i>

326
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,198
<i>- Oh, God! Stop it! Stop!
- I'll kill you!</i>

327
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:49,178
<i>Stop!</i>

328
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,050
<i>Come one, stop!</i>

329
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,670
Serious impulse control issues.

330
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,313
Very good, Agent Booth.

331
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:58,376
I've marked a few other possible
suspects that match the profile,

332
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,944
but I think Dodd exhibits
the right amount of rage and

333
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:02,554
and self-justifying vengeance.

334
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:03,978
So, Dodd's our guy.

335
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,934
Let's go tell Bones, come on.

336
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:08,129
Well... couldn't we just call?

337
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:09,486
No. Let's go.

338
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,159
Open City might be
Rossellini's best film.

339
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,982
Rossellini had nothing, no sets...

340
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:17,998
1945, the country had barely started
rebuilding after the war.

341
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,960
Yes. Of course,
I'm also a big fan of Meatballs,

342
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,087
Bill Murray's paean to anarchy.

343
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,089
Hey, Bones.

344
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,831
Hi. Special Agent Booth, her partner.

345
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,449
- Hi.
- I'm Dr. Lance Sweets.

346
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,596
- I'm their therapist.
- Jason DeFry.

347
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:34,498
DeFry.

348
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,490
Do you follow them around all the time?

349
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,162
No. No, no, no. I'm also a profiler.
I help with the cases.

350
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,989
- Did you know that she was on a date?
- Slipped my mind.

351
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:46,777
Spiffy suit, man.

352
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,279
Thanks. Picked it up in Italy.

353
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:51,573
Little tight? It's the style.

354
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,742
- You ever been married?
- No.

355
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:54,785
Have a kid?

356
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,537
Never been married, remember?

357
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:57,705
I have a kid.

358
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,169
He's never been married.

359
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,356
I should get to work, Jason.

360
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,462
We've got a murder to catch,
you understand?

361
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:07,879
Of course, of course.
You know, it's getting late anyway.

362
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,634
Listen, I have Coldplay tickets
for tomorrow night.

363
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,573
Thought maybe we'd grab a bite first.
Any interest?

364
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,951
Absolutely.
I might have to leave from work.

365
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,333
No problem.
I'll meet you at your office at 6:00?

366
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:19,411
I'll be there.

367
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,832
Nice meeting you all.

368
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:25,763
Yeah.

369
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,273
- No wonder you two are platonic.
- What is that supposed to mean?

370
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,392
Well, look, I'm fine with it, Bones,
really. I have zero problems with it,

371
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,576
but... that guy is gay.

372
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,161
- He is not gay.
- Please.

373
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,747
- Double cheek kiss, tight Italian suit,
- Coldplay.

374
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,336
- never married,
- Coldplay.

375
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,544
Jason is as heterosexual
as either of you.

376
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,919
Then how is it that he's okay
with not having sex?

377
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,139
What?

378
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,781
We share an intellectual bond.

379
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:54,094
I don't have physical feelings for him.
He understands that.

380
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,565
Not if he's straight. Right? Am I right?

381
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:58,815
You are hot.

382
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,271
You're here for a reason?

383
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,524
We got something off the DVDs...

384
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,003
Mint tea, fruit tart...?!

385
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,089
- Okay, speak, Sweets, please.
- Okay,

386
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,240
most of the cheaters
were essentially cowards,

387
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,618
seeking alternate
sexual experiences because

388
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:20,329
they're too afraid to confront
the problems in their own lives.

389
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:23,284
Just because someone seeks
an alternative sexual outlet

390
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:25,084
doesn't mean that they're a coward.

391
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,024
- She has issues.
- I do not have issues.

392
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,671
Case in point:
Deep-sea welder and a botanist.

393
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,007
What, did they go into a bar?

394
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:33,586
No.

395
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,135
Brennan's two boyfriends.

396
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,371
Right. Let me guess,

397
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:39,933
that one's the botanist.

398
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:40,873
Yeah.

399
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:44,311
- So you have nothing.
- Show her.

400
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:46,605
This is Jim Dodd.

401
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,316
The photograph that
you pulled out of O'Roarke's throat,

402
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,422
turns out that
Jim Dodd used to be a mall

403
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,869
photographer at Tiny Tots Photography.

404
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,685
- Motive and means.
- Yeah, I mean,

405
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,459
his landlord said he disappeared
five days ago, no forwarding address.

406
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:01,496
And you think he left because
he was planning to kill Bill O'Roarke?

407
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,823
Yeah, it fits, okay?

408
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,850
Landlord also said he has a drinking
buddy by the name of Chris Gutman.

409
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,234
We're looking for him.

410
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:09,324
What?

411
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,464
This couldn't have waited till after
I said good night to Jason?

412
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:14,317
I'm just looking out for you, all right?

413
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:17,386
You don't have the best taste in men.

414
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,671
So you're going to hire
a stalker to find Dodd?

415
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,062
Perfect undercover move.

416
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:29,830
- So you think this is a good idea?
- Of course I do, it's mine, okay?

417
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,670
Gutman was lying through his teeth.
There he is right over there.

418
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,296
This way, we'll be able to find out
what he really knows.

419
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,164
Yo, namaste, guys.

420
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,575
- Hi, Noel.
- Think they have mung beans?

421
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,702
- I'm on an ayurvedic cleanse.
- What?

422
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,413
I do mung beans till Sunday,
then I start the enemas.

423
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,432
Listen, Noel, we'd like to harness you
for your natural abilities.

424
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,256
- You want your chart done?
- No.

425
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,092
Stalking.
You like to stalk people.

426
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:56,582
Observe them.

427
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:59,052
Hey, Noel, eyes over here.

428
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,676
Okay?
Eyes on him, not her, him.

429
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:02,639
Noel.

430
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,040
Chris Gutman.

431
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,354
- So not my type.
- It's not recreational.

432
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:12,237
I want to find out where he goes,
who he sees, who he talks to.

433
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,735
Okay, listen, he hangs out with
a guy by the name of Jim Dodd.

434
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,407
Want me to write that down for you?

435
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:17,971
- I got it.
- What's his name?

436
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,198
- Jim Dodd.
- Right.

437
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,611
Jim Dodd. I want details.
I'll give you 50 bucks.

438
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:23,492
50 bucks?

439
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,239
Sure, but I got to be done by Sunday,
because I got this...

440
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,625
Right, the enemas.

441
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,498
Nomaste.

442
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:29,605
Namaste.

443
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:34,421
Everything you never wanted
to drain from outhouse sludge.

444
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:37,340
Two toy cars, three cell phones,

445
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,594
a doorknob, a rubber casing,

446
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:42,971
plastic Easter bunny head, and...

447
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:44,431
drumroll...

448
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,683
optional...

449
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,352
one slightly used 40-caliber bullet.

450
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,668
Excellent.

451
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,199
If Booth can find the murder weapon,
we can match it.

452
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,819
We may not have to wait that long.
I took some initiative

453
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,107
and checked out the lumbar fractures
I found on O'Roarke

454
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,950
figured he'd have
to be treated for them.

455
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,200
He was treated at Providence Hospital.
The police brought him in.

456
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,209
The wife of a guy he busted rammed Bill
with her grocery cart at Food King.

457
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,539
You did this without my approval?

458
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:14,959
And why shouldn't I toss you out
of here right now?

459
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:20,050
Dr. Brennan says that in an intellectual
pursuit, therer are no limits.

460
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,589
In fact there are.

461
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,597
Produce section road rage is a long way
from shooting a man dead.

462
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:28,350
Not if you're a police officer
who carries a gun

463
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,561
the same caliber as the bullet
you found in the poop pit.

464
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,714
"Capitol Police Sergeant
Francis Diamond."

465
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,371
Doesn't it feel as
if I've always been here?

466
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,606
I hate Bill O'Roarke.

467
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,876
He tried to destroy my marriage.
But I didn't kill him.

468
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,045
You don't think your husband
cheating might have

469
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,733
put a wrinkle in your relationship?

470
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,716
What my husband did was not cheating.

471
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:04,720
See, this is a woman enlightened enough
not to expect a monogamous relationship.

472
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,096
He'd never cheat on me.

473
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:09,057
Okay, then why did you turn your husband
in to the Busted by Billshow?

474
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:10,837
I didn't, it was my sister.

475
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:12,644
She called up their tip line.

476
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:15,647
Kept insisting that he was messing
around, but it wasn't true.

477
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,318
Sergeant Diamond, we saw the video.

478
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,695
Your husband met the young woman
at the motel...

479
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:25,561
- with flowers.
- And then took off his pants.

480
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,869
He went there to warn her that it could
be dangerous meeting someone online.

481
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,912
Perhaps she's not so enlightened.

482
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,999
Okay, Ballistics is going to need
to see the sidearm.

483
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,674
Please.

484
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:38,773
Now.

485
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:53,304
I want to show you what I found lodged
in Bill O'Roarke's lower intestine.

486
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:56,930
I can't understand why Booth has
an issue with me seeing two men.

487
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,015
Guys like to think they're the only ones

488
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,898
who should sleep with more
than one person.

489
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:02,434
They like to be in control.

490
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:05,304
Doesn't take a lot to throw
the little darlings off their game.

491
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:08,602
Oh, yeah, then you end up lying in bed
holding them while they say,

492
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:11,161
"I don't know what's wrong, this has
never happened to me before."

493
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:14,039
He should be happy that I've found
a way to satisfy myself.

494
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,264
It just happens to require two men.

495
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,549
I've done that.

496
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:18,680
I miss college.

497
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,838
And the botanist,
no biological imperative?

498
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,020
He's flirted with the intent
to become intimate,

499
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,760
but Mark keeps me quite sated sexually.

500
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,211
You've really got to learn
some girl talk, sweetie.

501
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay, look at that.

502
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,477
How did a wire get lodged
in his intestine?

503
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:36,740
Not sure yet.

504
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,185
The tox screen's even stranger.

505
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,618
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride.

506
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:45,237
- Eye drops?
- And sildenafil citrate.

507
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,675
Viagra.

508
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,032
Bloodshot eyes and wood in a pill.

509
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:51,551
Party time.

510
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:54,913
Dr. Brennan, I'm Daisy Wick,
your new grad assistant.

511
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,387
I'd rather not learn your name
until I've assessed your work.

512
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,057
Oh, of course.
I'm the same way.

513
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,288
We're two of a kind.

514
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,561
You're like a hero to me.

515
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:06,550
Hero worship exposes a lack of
independent intellectual examination.

516
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,497
I'll tell Booth what we found.

517
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,103
She is so smart.

518
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,349
Yeah.

519
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,808
So Sergeant Diamond's firearm
wasn't a match.

520
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,681
She wasn't even in town
Friday and Monday.

521
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:26,745
She was with her husband fixing her
marriage at some tantric sex workshop.

522
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:28,522
I've heard that if practiced correctly,

523
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,655
tantric sexual techniques
can extend orgasms

524
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,434
by 400 to 500 percent.

525
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:33,909
They actually teach that?

526
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:34,869
Teach what?

527
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,024
Extended orgasms through tantric yoga.

528
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,594
- No, Bones, don't encourage this guy.
- It's a godly pursuit, man.

529
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:40,791
Noel?

530
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:42,419
What do you have for us?

531
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,801
I followed Gutman from
that gas station where he works.

532
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,387
Are you embarrassed to talk about...?

533
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,076
Gutman went off shift at 7:00,
beelined for the roach coach.

534
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,894
Dude actually ate a hot dog.

535
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,201
You have any idea how many toxins
are in your hot dog?

536
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,731
- Yes, I do.
- Jim Dodd, Noel.

537
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:05,121
He caught the M Street bus.

538
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:10,418
Sat next to a girl wearing
a Led Zeppelin tour T-shirt.

539
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:11,498
Not a real one.

540
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:15,577
One of those fakes where Jimmy Page
has a Stratocaster instead of a Gibson.

541
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:18,121
- Where did he go?
- To a church, St. Xavier's.

542
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:19,525
Goes down to the basement

543
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,933
where they store all these awesome
Christmas decorations.

544
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:23,296
The Jesus is like...

545
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:26,922
you could sit down and share
a doobie with Him, you know?

546
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,300
I really hope this has something
to do with Jim Dodd.

547
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:34,346
Not only did he meet up with Dodd,
he sat next to him for two hours.

548
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,556
With the life-sized Jesus?

549
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:37,998
No, man!

550
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,852
They were in divorce support group.
They're breakup buddies.

551
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:43,691
Getting busted by O'Roarke must've
ended Jim Dodd's marriage.

552
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,233
Would you say that these divorce
support groups were angry?

553
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:47,426
No way.

554
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,748
The guys are all sad and weepy.

555
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,185
The dumped chicks eat it up.

556
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,615
The Dodd dude, he's hooking up
with at least two of them,

557
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,007
which is probably
why he goes there every day.

558
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,695
Which I know...

559
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:00,881
'cause I photocopied the sign-in sheet.

560
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,542
- Right, that's great.
- So how'd I do?

561
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,375
Oh, right.
You did great.

562
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:10,048
Here you go, pal. Get all the mung beans
and the enemas you want.

563
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:11,680
Boy, here you go.

564
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:13,655
See ya.

565
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:18,557
The loan shark's got me down
for five G's plus the vig,

566
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:21,201
so I told Gutman to keep his mouth
shut if anybody asked about me.

567
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,310
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna be the FBI?

568
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,992
So, why'd you do a runner last week?

569
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:27,940
I owe two grand back rent,
child support,

570
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,819
alimony, plus the loan shark...
I mean, wouldn't you run?

571
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:33,868
And all this hard luck is because
of Bill O'Roarke, right?

572
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:34,906
What?

573
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:37,075
No. No, it had nothing to do with that.

574
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:38,868
Where were you Friday and Saturday?

575
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:41,037
I didn't kill him.
I swear.

576
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,163
Where were you?

577
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,626
I drove to Jersey to
borrow money from my mom.

578
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:49,671
She pawned her engagement ring because
the loan shark was gonna

579
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,798
rip my ears off.
Pathetic.

580
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:53,675
Mother's contact information.

581
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:01,807
Pathetic.

582
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,234
Hey. So...

583
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:12,105
it takes over two hours for this
computer to render each new image, but

584
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:15,572
this last pass gave us a little
more detail in that photograph.

585
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:19,659
- What is that on her back?
- A tattoo?

586
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,411
- It's a tramp stamp of some kind.
- Cool.

587
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:25,446
Useful, I hope.

588
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:26,708
Anyway...

589
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:31,212
I was starting to enhance the resolution
when Sweets brought me the videos.

590
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:33,340
O'Roarke was talking to his producer.

591
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:36,993
Appeared upset, but the sound
was distorted and barely audible.

592
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,332
They were Busted By Bill.

593
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:42,222
I'm Bill O'Roarke.

594
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:43,730
Okay, let's get a tail slate.

595
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,759
Arthur, a moment... now.

596
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,039
What's up, Billy?

597
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:58,081
Okay, I sampled Bill's voice and
I removed all the extraneous noise.

598
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,235
Arthur, a moment... now.

599
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,243
What's up, Billy?

600
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:05,205
This thing with Veronica, it's over.

601
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:07,767
- I can't work with her anymore.
- Just kiss and make up.

602
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:09,398
No, I want her gone.

603
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:12,211
I'm serious.

604
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,957
Sounds like Viagra-popping Billy
might have gotten himself

605
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:19,025
a bit too involved with someone at work.

606
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,012
So that could be
Veronica in the picture.

607
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,431
Fits the profile:
jilted and vengeful.

608
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,139
That's a wrap.

609
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,611
Sorry to interrupt.

610
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,237
I'm just packing up some things
for our daughter.

611
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:41,922
I don't know if she wants them,
but maybe someday.

612
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:44,493
If you don't mind, Mrs. O'Roarke,
we'd like a word with Veronica.

613
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,272
Sure. Excuse me.

614
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:50,375
Is there a problem?

615
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:53,420
Did Mr. O'Roarke ask Arthur Lang
to fire you?

616
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:55,463
I'm still working here, aren't I?

617
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:58,425
- Because O'Roarke is dead.
- See, I'm thinking that you got fired,

618
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,587
then you got angry,
which led to revenge.

619
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:02,929
Is he serious?

620
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,098
Why would O'Roarke want you fired?

621
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,230
I sold a new show... on my own.

622
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:15,201
Bill accused me of stealing
the idea from him.

623
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:17,402
Did you?

624
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:19,131
No. I didn't.

625
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:22,270
I knew he'd be mad when he found out,
but the idea was mine.

626
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,201
And now that he's dead, we're just going
to have to believe you, right?

627
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:28,037
I worked with Bill
every day for two years.

628
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,275
We were incredibly close.

629
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:32,292
We would've made up.

630
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:34,252
How close?

631
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:35,790
What is that supposed to mean?

632
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,713
I believe Agent Booth is asking if you
had sexual intercourse with O'Roarke.

633
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,408
But I agree, he could have phrased
the question more clearly.

634
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:44,444
No.

635
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,723
I was not sleeping with Bill.

636
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:51,502
Do you have a tattoo on
the small of your back?

637
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:01,988
If there are no more questions, I would
like to help Amanda with Bill's things.

638
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,615
Excuse me.

639
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm done with the culture you swabbed
from the wound on the victim's thigh.

640
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,707
What'd you get?

641
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,416
A trace of enameled iron,
a fleck of silver plating.

642
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,626
Maybe from a knife?

643
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:15,834
Don't think so.

644
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:18,686
The wound's too jagged and
I found amylase activity.

645
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:23,176
He had saliva and iron
in a wound on his thigh?

646
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:25,220
And I found candidiasis in the saliva.

647
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:31,055
Okay, so somebody with
a thrush infection

648
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:34,273
scratched him with something metal,
and then licked him?

649
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,660
You're getting warm.

650
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,232
Look.

651
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:38,584
Come on, you can do it.

652
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:41,486
Distance between peaks is irregular
and about two inches apart.

653
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,890
- Hmm... wavy thigh scratch.
- Oral thrush.

654
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:47,168
Wiggle your tongue side to side.

655
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:49,509
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

656
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,398
Infected tongue piercing.

657
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:59,022
You want to see it?

658
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:04,384
Silver-plated iron.

659
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,805
Come on, was it something
that Bill did to you?

660
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,348
I mean, he was older than you?

661
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:14,409
- Probably took advantage of you?
- No. No, Bill was a good man.

662
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:16,851
You two were sleeping together,
weren't you?

663
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,222
I don't have to answer
questions like that.

664
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,391
I know my rights.

665
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,119
Your stud, please?

666
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,856
- You're kidding.
- You really

667
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:31,231
should consider some nystatin for
that infection, by the way.

668
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:34,205
We found saliva in the laceration
on your boss'thigh.

669
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,624
And we can prove that it's yours.

670
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,496
Your stud.

671
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,170
- Forget it. No way.
- Well, we have a court order.

672
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,880
We know our rights, too, so...

673
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:44,716
Your stud, please.

674
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,346
That wasn't too hard.

675
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:55,375
You're sure you don't want
to talk to us?

676
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:56,927
It is not what you think.

677
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,556
- What do I think?
- We loved each other.

678
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:00,731
I didn't kill him.

679
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,851
Why would I kill a man that I loved?

680
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:05,528
Is that how you got the job,
sleeping with O'Roarke?

681
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:06,487
No!

682
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:07,697
No, it was...

683
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,366
it was Pete, the camera guy.

684
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:13,983
Okay, Pete and I met at a club one night
and we went out for a while.

685
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:16,106
Anyway, we still have a place together.

686
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:19,040
And Pete knew that I wanted
to get into TV,

687
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,461
so he got me a job as
a production assistant,

688
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:24,808
and, um... Bill just kind of...

689
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,008
took me under his wing.

690
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:29,608
I'd say so.
Didn't bother you that he was married?

691
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:32,723
Perhaps he wasn't fully satisfied
in a long-term relationship.

692
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:36,099
What? It's understandable.
Needs change.

693
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,762
When did you last have intercourse?

694
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,314
- Is she for real?
- I'm sorry.

695
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:44,232
We have to ask these kind of questions
in a murder investigation.

696
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,421
Intercourse?

697
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:48,154
Friday night.

698
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,479
Just before he disappeared.

699
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,159
What happened, Holly?

700
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:56,073
You were lying there in his arms.

701
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:58,665
You tell him you're tired of
his wife getting all the money, the...

702
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:00,712
No, I never cared about the money.

703
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,836
So... you tell him
that he should leave her,

704
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,048
but he says he's got a life with her,
he's got a daughter, and right there,

705
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,870
you snap, you realize you've been used.

706
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,922
So you show him a picture
of the two of you.

707
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:17,558
Oh, my God.

708
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,104
You cram this down his throat.

709
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:22,414
Then you shoot him.

710
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:26,633
Do you have any body modifications other
than the... piercing, Ms. Markwell?

711
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:33,616
- What, like fake boobs?
- No, like tattoos.

712
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:42,917
I have to, right?

713
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,043
I'm afraid so.

714
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:03,648
You know, I loved Bill.

715
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:06,445
I didn't kill him.

716
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,216
And there you have it.

717
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,877
You are busted, Billy.

718
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:29,342
Holly admits it's her in the
picture but insists she didn't kill him.

719
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,716
If denial is severe enough,
she might actually believe that.

720
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:34,013
I know what was used to cram
the picture down his throat.

721
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,921
Because of what I found.
Hi, Dr. Brennan.

722
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,319
I don't fraternize at work.

723
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,463
Daisy found the fractures
on the sagittal suture,

724
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,726
- which contained some particulates.
- Told you.

725
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:43,770
They are chlorinated polyethylene.

726
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,189
It's the rubber used on
the tail of a microphone.

727
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,358
The copper wire found in his intestine
was from inside that rubber cap.

728
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,278
Putrescent gases forced
the wire into the esophagus,

729
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,696
and the buoyancy of the outhouse sewage

730
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:58,476
caused it to migrate up
the digestive tract to the intestine.

731
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,023
Holly had access to the microphone.

732
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:02,789
She's small. Do you think she could have

733
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:05,708
upended a 180-pound man and
placed him in a poop pit?

734
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,504
You're her size. Pick up Dr. Sweets
and turn him upside down.

735
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:10,463
What?

736
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:11,964
That's not going to happen.

737
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,385
I have to.

738
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,511
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't,
you don't, you don't, it's fine.

739
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:18,971
Nice.

740
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:20,969
So it's probably not Holly.

741
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,059
Anyone else have access
to the equipment?

742
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,906
The print was e-mailed to somebody.

743
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:27,381
The murder was surprised
and enraged by that image.

744
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,889
I minored in psychology.

745
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:32,417
Really?

746
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:33,849
Yeah.

747
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:40,020
Holly wouldn't be surprised.
She knew she slept with Bill.

748
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,455
Right, but someone who was sleeping
with either O'Roarke or Holly

749
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:45,021
might have seen this.

750
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:46,874
The image triggered the killer's rage.

751
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,293
There was only one way
to avenge that violation.

752
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,463
The killer had to make sure
that this image died with O'Roarke.

753
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,018
That's brilliant.

754
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:57,704
I know who did it.

755
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:03,200
- So, you sure?
- Yeah, it's the only person...

756
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,679
who makes sense.

757
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:07,217
Mark, wha-what are you doing here?

758
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,734
Well, you told me to pick you up.

759
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:12,649
- With dinner?
- I... am so sorry.

760
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,152
I... there's been an emergency.

761
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,525
Okay, do you want me
to reschedule, or...?

762
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,365
- Temperance.
- Jason!

763
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,992
What are you doing here?

764
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,578
- We're going to Coldplay, remember?
- You remember Coldplay.

765
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:24,900
Coldplay?

766
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,587
Sorry, I've been distracted by the case.

767
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:29,542
Why don't we ever go to a concert?

768
00:37:30,149 --> 00:37:32,712
As a matter of fact, why don't
we ever leave your bedroom?

769
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,266
- Can we talk about this later?
- We're about to arrest...

770
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,426
- You're dating this guy?
- I don't like that term.

771
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:41,336
It has an antiquated moral and
needlessly restrictive connotation.

772
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:42,501
And who are you?

773
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:45,057
Obviously, a guy who is not doing
as well as you.

774
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,643
This is Jason.

775
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,103
Jason, Mark.

776
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:50,520
Mark, Jason.

777
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,983
Please understand, Jason, you're very
good-looking, but sexual attraction

778
00:37:55,144 --> 00:37:58,945
is an involuntary hormonal response
involving an increase

779
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:01,574
- in neutrophins and testosterone.
- So you get to go out?

780
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,745
Mark, you are a strong
and attentive man,

781
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:10,458
but Jason is more stimulating
intellectually.

782
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,752
That's not the only
way I could be stimulating.

783
00:38:14,638 --> 00:38:16,770
- Murder?
- Murder, yes.

784
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,633
What do you do with this one?

785
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:22,887
Oh... this...
Booth is my partner, that's all.

786
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,389
We should go.

787
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:28,309
Yes, okay. All right. Oh, Jason,

788
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,831
we can talk at the concert.

789
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:32,605
I'll meet you out front by 8:00,
and Mark, we can...

790
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:35,816
talk later at... my apartment.

791
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:39,846
Oh, yes. See you, boys. Thanks.
I'll grab one of those.

792
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,700
Thi-This is crazy.

793
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,269
Why would I kill him?
I mean, B- Bill and I were like family.

794
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:50,373
Because he was sleeping
with your girlfriend.

795
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,836
Although not only did
you lose your girlfriend,

796
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,794
you lost your job.
It was not a good choice.

797
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:56,769
What is she talking about?

798
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,207
No, Holly and I are,
we're just roommates.

799
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah, but you used to be a couple
and you were in love with her.

800
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,678
And you felt that Bill ruined
it for you.

801
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:04,901
No, no.

802
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:06,495
You said that O'Roarke wasn't home

803
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:09,090
when you went to pick him up
Saturday morning, but that's not true.

804
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,060
You brought him
his usual cup of coffee,

805
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:13,520
but this time you put in
something a little special.

806
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,204
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride.

807
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:18,150
That right there is squint talk
for eyedrops.

808
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,654
Old bartender's trick, guaranteed
to give ll the runs.

809
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,672
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

810
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:24,707
Really?

811
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,329
- Where did you get that?
- What'd you do, Pete...

812
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,997
set up your own camera, shoot
your own show so you could bust Bill?

813
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,925
I just lost it.

814
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:47,496
Look, I'm a nice guy.

815
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:49,563
I am.
You can ask anybody.

816
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,202
I just lost it.

817
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,748
Hey.
Come on in.

818
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:15,248
You look nice, Dr. Brennan.

819
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:18,836
Oh, thank you, uh...
I was supposed to go to a...

820
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,297
gallery opening tonight.

821
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:23,711
What, did Jason get a new tight suit?

822
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:25,586
- With Mark.
- Yeah, the two amigos.

823
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:28,399
I thought he was more of your,
"stay at home" kind of a guy.

824
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,904
I was visiting the possibility

825
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:33,184
that I might enjoy him
in a strictly conversational setting.

826
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:34,454
And?

827
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:38,522
Since the murder, I'm considering
the argument for monogamy.

828
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:41,776
Write that one down, Sweets.

829
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:43,528
I have a positive influence on her.

830
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:45,029
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

831
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:46,696
Mark broke up with me.

832
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:52,114
Sorry. Well, what about "gay Jason"?

833
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:53,537
Him, too.

834
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:58,236
I guess they weren't as accepting
of each other as I thought, so...

835
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:03,672
Is it typical for you two to discuss
your love lives?

836
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,213
Well, I mean, only when she has
naked men in her apartment.

837
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,763
No, that's not true. I'm very open about
my relationships, as opposed to you.

838
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:12,890
Okay, what's that supposed to mean?

839
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,428
You're very secretive,

840
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:17,213
as if discussing your sex life would
somehow be offensive to me.

841
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,563
- I assume you are sexually active.
- I do fine.

842
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,608
Does it seem that your partnership

843
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:23,252
provides a surrogate relationship,

844
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,194
making it more difficult
to form other bonds?

845
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:28,502
A surrogate relationship wouldn't
necessarily be such a bad thing

846
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:31,991
because then I could avoid the sting
of rejection, which, however fleeting,

847
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:34,627
is still uncomfortable.

848
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:37,597
Right.

849
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:40,165
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
You know what?

850
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:42,657
If Mark and Jason don't know
how lucky they are,

851
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,574
they don't deserve you
in the first place.

852
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:46,132
All relationships are temporary.

853
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,050
No, that's not true, Bones.

854
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,081
You're wrong.
Okay, there is someone for everyone,

855
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:54,753
someone you're meant to spend
the rest of your life with.

856
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,097
All right?

857
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,688
You just have to be open
enough to see it.

858
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,035
That's all.

859
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,329
Come on, I'll buy you dinner.

860
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,000
Hey, I can be fun in a strictly
conversational setting.

861
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,732
See?
Surrogate relationship.

862
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:24,837
Surrogate nothing.
Okay? It's a meal. With drinks.

863
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:27,256
- Just strictly conversational.
- I can come, too.

864
00:42:27,637 --> 00:42:31,538
Actually, our partnership does make
it difficult to form other bonds.

865
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:32,482
No offense.

866
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:34,662
- Our session isn't over yet.
- How about Chinese?

867
00:42:34,782 --> 00:42:36,860
I love Chinese.
Love it.

868
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,976
- I feel more like Thai.
- Thai?

869
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:40,429
I got coupons to Hop Li.

870
00:42:40,596 --> 00:42:42,995
What, you're gonna take me out
for a discount meal?

871
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:46,367
What? There's two for one,
and then they throw in some...

872
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,596
Hi, is this Daisy Wick?

873
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:56,005
Hey, this is Lance.

874
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,886
Uh, the shrink.
Yeah.

875
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:03,876
Listen... sorry you got fired.

876
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:07,380
Nothing.
What are you doing?

877
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:09,555
The accordion?

878
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:11,979
No, no, no, I...

879
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:13,971
I play a little bass, though.

880
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,408
