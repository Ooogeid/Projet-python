1
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,102
Now this cab is young,
so limited finish, of course,

2
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:12,428
but still has a nice depth.

3
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:15,806
I can taste cherries,
a bit of ginger.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,733
Plums and cassis.

5
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,352
And a hint of dark chocolate.

6
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:20,607
Lovely.

7
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:23,695
In another five years,
it's going to be an exceptional wine.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,811
Yes, Bruce is a magician
with my grapes.

9
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:28,027
Of course, he convinced me
to sink a mint

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,446
into the vineyard over
the last two years alone, but,

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,019
money well spent.

12
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,706
You're going to make Virginia
the next California, Sean.

13
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,631
Doc, wait until you taste the'97.

14
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:40,206
Gotta be the best year
we've ever had at Bedford Creek.

15
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,584
Wouldn't you say, Bruce?
Perfect balance of sun and rain,

16
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,252
limestone and gravel.

17
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,296
It was a year one dreams about.

18
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,258
Now, some sediment is normal,
especially in such a big wine.

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,218
Salut.

20
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:53,794
Cheers.

21
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,352
- What the hell is going on, Bruce?
- I don't know, sir.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,145
Something's in my glass.

23
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:11,276
My God, that's a human finger.

24
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,324
It's quite simple.

25
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,829
Whatever Agent Booth says,
you respond with whatever

26
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,497
word or phrase pops into your head.
And vice versa.

27
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,254
That's ridiculous, I can't properly
respond without careful thought.

28
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,004
Can't we just make it
a drinking game?

29
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,527
No. This is a valuable,
psychological tool, Agent Booth.

30
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:33,217
When you respond viscerally

31
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,173
we can get to the root of your emotional
issues and figure out what

32
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:37,847
binds you two together as partners.

33
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,973
Donuts.

34
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:43,096
- Beg your pardon?
- Glazed donuts. I see 'em right there.

35
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,506
- You had no breakfast. You're hungry.
- I'm starving.

36
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,399
- No, that's not the proper response.
- Of course it is.

37
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,693
I'm explaining why he said "donuts."

38
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,113
The point of the exercise
is not to explain, but to respond.

39
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,991
- Children can do this.
- Because it's childish.

40
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,160
- Can we just try it, please?
- All right, okay, fine, here we go.

41
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,485
Are you ready?

42
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,460
- Hunger.
- Sex.

43
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,754
- Horse.
- Cowboy.

44
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,005
- Child.
- Baby.

45
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,591
- Booth.
- What, do you think, I'm a baby?

46
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,760
- You're a father.
- Mother.

47
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,511
- Birth.
- Happy.

48
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,722
- Sperm.
- Isn't this getting a little weird?

49
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,405
No, keep going.

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,476
- Okay. Egg.
- I want a baby.

51
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,979
- Horse.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

52
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,565
- We can stop here.
- I actually found that interesting.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,499
- You want to have a baby?
- Yes. I do. I just...

54
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,211
I just realized it.
I should have a progeny, it's...

55
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,655
selfish of me not to.

56
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:38,615
- Selfish?
- Yes.

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,202
Don't you need a,
you know, guy to...?

58
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,420
Just sperm.

59
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,473
You'd be a very good donor,
potentially.

60
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,209
- Me?
- But you need to be tested, of course.

61
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,590
- What, is something wrong?
- Yeah. Okay.

62
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,280
You don't just go around
asking for people's sperm.

63
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,887
Yeah. No, I wasn't talking to you.

64
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,597
Right. Yeah.
On our way.

65
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,890
We got a case.

66
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,017
Wait, perhaps
we should discuss this.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,378
I'm not conflicted, if that's what
you're concerned about.

68
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:10,397
- I've made a reasonable choice.
- In two seconds over some stupid game.

69
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:13,526
This is a well researched,
therapeutic technique, Agent Booth.

70
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:16,570
Really? This happens all the time
patients asking for sperm?

71
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,827
Yeah... no, well,
not this specifically.

72
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,046
Which is why I think
some discussion is in order.

73
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,808
- Shouldn't we go? Don't we have a case?
- Yeah. We gotta get going.

74
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,750
- This is all your fault.
- I know this was surprising, but...

75
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,301
You're the one who's always
touting parenthood,

76
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:35,061
implying that my life is incomplete
because I don't have a child.

77
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,002
I know, but this is kind of sudden.

78
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,518
- Perhaps you don't want to help me.
- Of course I do.

79
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,455
- So you'll do it?
- I'll think about it.

80
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,333
I don't understand.
It's a simple request.

81
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,469
I'm sure you engage in masturba...

82
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,470
Horse.

83
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,197
Enough. We'll talk about it later.

84
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:51,376
I'm not asking for you to be involved.
All I want is your sperm.

85
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:56,277
That's a good one.
"All I want is your sperm."

86
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,496
I never heard that joke before.

87
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,364
- I don't understand.
- Yeah. Okay.

88
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,748
OK. Just close your mouth
and point us to the body.

89
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:04,523
The barrel's over here.

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Dr. Granger said
it was a human bone, but...

91
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,504
that's impossible.
This may be an animal, a rat.

92
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,548
- That could happen, right?
- And you are?

93
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:21,677
Sean Mortenson. This is my winery.
And Bruce Hanover, my viticulturalist.

94
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,554
The remains are human.

95
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:27,516
The cask has been sealed since 1997.
I did it myself.

96
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,292
The seal must have been broken
when the body was thrown in here.

97
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,063
Exposure to air turned
the wine to vinegar.

98
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,405
- Looks like a purple Smurf.
- Pelvic bone indicates a male.

99
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,819
More like a rubber purple Smurf.

100
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,907
Bones in vinegar leech calcium and will
become gelatinous within three days.

101
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,368
That is actually cool.

102
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,200
This cask is filled with debris,
decomposed tissue and organs.

103
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,830
It all has to come back to the lab.

104
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,756
Oh, God.

105
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,738
Bones - Season 04 Episode 25

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

108
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,415
Liquefactions suggests
he's been there at least eight months.

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,762
Scapula, clavicle.

110
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:48,871
Fat globule.

111
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:52,518
We're all just one step away from
dissolving into the primordial ooze.

112
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:55,338
Manubrium and ilium.

113
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,106
Rendered brain matter.

114
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,797
You got a sock, a belt.

115
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:02,111
Molar, lateral incisor and canine.

116
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,072
And this is just goo.

117
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,463
I got a grommet, three nickels,

118
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:11,501
and I am guessing a chocolate kiss.

119
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,122
Bingo!

120
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,291
A chunk of liver,
enough for a tox screen.

121
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:18,002
My guess,
you'll find a high alcohol content.

122
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,253
Tibia.

123
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,338
I've decided to have a baby.

124
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,008
Capitulum.

125
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:29,304
Wait.
Baby, like a small human?

126
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,182
Yes. I know I've had
no interest in the past, but,

127
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:35,436
neither did you and you seem
to find parenthood very fulfilling.

128
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,145
Yes. I do.

129
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:42,067
And... you brought this up now...
why?

130
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,550
I wanted to give you notice.

131
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:46,488
I'll be needing some time off
when the baby comes. About...

132
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,113
six weeks I imagine.

133
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:52,578
The staining makes it very difficult
to see any anomalies on the bones.

134
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:54,955
Is there a father?

135
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,540
I'd like to use Booth's sperm.

136
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,792
Booth. What do you know?

137
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:02,796
If Booth doesn't work out,
I donate my sperm monthly.

138
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,216
I have a high IQ, excellent genetics,
and motility.

139
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,178
No emotional baggage.
I'm kind of a catch.

140
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,764
- Down, boy.
- Weren't we investigating a death?

141
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:14,016
Oh, my God.

142
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,820
Dr. Brennan wants to have a baby.

143
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,346
I offered my sperm, but she's leaning
more toward Agent Booth.

144
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:20,773
You're joking, right?

145
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,818
Booth and I discussed it
in Sweet's office.

146
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,848
He's thinking it over now.
Although,

147
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,273
I don't understand why
he'd be protective of his semen.

148
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,597
There are six evenly-spaced cavities

149
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:34,578
along the sides of the frontal
and parietal bones.

150
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,538
Hand me that grommet you found.

151
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:39,792
Grommet.

152
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,834
The grommet. Yes. Right.

153
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:43,405
There you go.

154
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:45,866
Thank you.

155
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,189
I could get you my little swimmers
at a substantial savings.

156
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,721
- Fisher, just scoop, please.
- Sure.

157
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,144
He had a craniofacial implant.

158
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,671
The way they're spaced,

159
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,398
they're positioned
to secure a prosthetic hairpiece.

160
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,248
- Those are not very common.
- I'll strain for the rug.

161
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,696
If there's a missing persons
report on the victim,

162
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,631
it would definitely mention
a surgical hairpiece.

163
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:15,296
You can also replace the teeth
in the mandible and...

164
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,745
confirm with dentists.

165
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,626
We heard right, didn't we?

166
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:23,957
A baby.

167
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,585
With Booth.

168
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,259
There's a fracture on the zygomatic.

169
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,396
Probably from a blow to the face.

170
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,070
The guy is pickled, sweetie.
He can wait.

171
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:47,651
You can't just announce
you're having a baby and walk away.

172
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:52,039
15,000 babies are born every hour.
It's not all that exceptional.

173
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,908
Brennan... this is crazy.

174
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:55,942
Why?

175
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,601
I'm intellectually gifted,
financially secure.

176
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:03,000
Statistically, I could expect to have
an exceptional child.

177
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,177
Fine. Yes. Absolutely.

178
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,838
But you do know how
this is supposed to work, right?

179
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,509
You get naked together.

180
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,908
You devour each other
in a passionate frenzy.

181
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:16,013
Booth would think that would create
an emotional bond between us.

182
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:20,111
- Of course that's ridiculous.
- I knew you'd understand.

183
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,643
Then why use Booth at all?

184
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:24,396
Why don't you use Fisher
and his discount sperm?

185
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:26,835
No, Booth has a larger mandible

186
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,027
and a more prominent zygomatic
than Fisher, as well as a more

187
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,989
pronounced ratio between
the width of his clavicles and his ilia.

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,074
So, it's because Booth is hot.

189
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,161
Now we're getting somewhere.

190
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,737
Statistically, attractive people
are more successful.

191
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,015
I'm only thinking of the child.

192
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,711
Then do this right, sweetie.

193
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,066
I am.

194
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,939
Emotional ties are ephemeral
and undependable.

195
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,344
Look at you and Hodgins.

196
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,662
You and Roxy.

197
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,640
Booth and Rebecca.
Booth and Cam.

198
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,176
Brennan, I...

199
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,020
I appreciate your concern, but
I have thought this through rationally.

200
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,940
This fracture
hasn't fully remodeled.

201
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,408
It occurred within a month of death.

202
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,778
Possibly from an attack.

203
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:19,993
The victim is Spencer Holt.

204
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,287
Missing almost a year.
He was a wine critic.

205
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,831
Apparently he could destroy
a vineyard with one review.

206
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,183
Everyone likes a dead critic.
I mean there's...

207
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,495
we're going to have
lots of suspects.

208
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:32,422
Why are you here and why
didn't you just send an e-mail?

209
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,709
You and Brennan,
you're going to have a baby?

210
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:37,027
- She told you.
- She told everyone.

211
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,471
- It's probably on the news by now.
- I'm just donating.

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,634
- So you decided?
- No. I am deciding. I-N-G, ing.

213
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,587
I know you.
You're going to do it.

214
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,645
You want to do it
without really doing it.

215
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,149
It's still doing it even if you're not
doing it the way it should be done.

216
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,986
She wants a kid, okay? It'll make her
more personable with people.

217
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,530
- And what will it do for you?
- She'll get what she wanted.

218
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,454
- A piece of you?
- Look at this.

219
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,799
Holt's wife filed
for a missing persons report.

220
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,787
Now, I have to go tell her
the bad news.

221
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,163
- Sure.
- You done?

222
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,707
- Yes.
- Thank you.

223
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:18,218
So apparently, Holt's wife
was pregnant when he disappeared.

224
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:21,501
- So she's raising the child alone?
- I guess so.

225
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:23,954
You know, and no one
thinks twice about that.

226
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,020
There are millions of single women
raising healthy, productive children.

227
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:31,106
There was a domestic disturbance
report filed

228
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,066
a month before he disappeared.

229
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:36,192
You know, if we go,
through with this,

230
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:39,489
and I'm around,
and if you need help...

231
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,782
I'll have a nanny.

232
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:43,452
I I figured. But, you know,
if it's her day off.

233
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,584
You don't have faith
that I can do it?

234
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,167
- What? I didn't say that.
- But you think I'd be a good mother?

235
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,585
Yeah, of course.

236
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,338
I know sometimes
you don't think I'm empathetic.

237
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,761
And it can be difficult
for me sometimes.

238
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,411
But I would love my child,

239
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,639
Booth, I would.

240
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,560
I know.
I know that, Bones.

241
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:12,496
I know people disapprove.
If you're uncomfortable,

242
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,542
Fisher sells his sperm monthly,
he's very intelligent and...

243
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,779
Fisher?
No, you are not having Fisher's kids.

244
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,156
You'd be giving birth
to the spawn of Satan, I'll do it.

245
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,035
No obligation.
I don't want you to feel any obligation.

246
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,434
I'll do it. Don't worry about it.
It's your kid, it's totally yours.

247
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,291
- Not worried about it.
- I just saying I'll do it.

248
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,963
You hold out hope, but in my heart,
I've known for months.

249
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:39,729
- What happened?
- We don't know yet;

250
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:43,178
- we're still investigating.
- He was found at Bedford Creek Winery.

251
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:44,679
At Bedford Creek?

252
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:47,224
- You been there?
- I'm the wife of a wine critic.

253
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:50,800
I've had to sit through tastings
at half the places in the country.

254
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,518
I don't even like wine.

255
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,482
Oh, God.
I am all covered.

256
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,800
I'll get her.

257
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,946
Spencer always wanted me
to give up my carpentry business.

258
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,240
Said I smelled of stain.

259
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,158
Ruined the bouquet
when he was tasting wine.

260
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,870
- Bones, you need help?
- No, no, I'm fine.

261
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,845
You got to help with the...

262
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,842
You like
spatial disorientation, don't you?

263
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,045
Yes, you do.

264
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,630
She likes you.

265
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,258
All Spencer could ever talk
about was having a little girl.

266
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,580
He would've made a good father.

267
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:33,010
Your husband also exhibited
a facial fracture

268
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,563
that hadn't fully remodeled.

269
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:37,917
Yes. He tried to break up a fight
at the wine expo.

270
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,485
Mortenson was going after
Charles Dunwood.

271
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,320
Mortenson from Bedford Creek?

272
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,780
He's a real bastard.

273
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,158
- He and your husband didn't get along?
- No.

274
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:47,861
Mortenson loved him.

275
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:50,986
Spencer gave his cabernet a 99.
No one gets that.

276
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,035
It was Charlie Dunwood
Mortenson hated.

277
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:56,422
Because Charlie
made a cheap wine next door

278
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,211
and he wouldn't sell out
to Mortenson.

279
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,505
- And you saw this fight?
- No.

280
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:03,633
They all deny it, of course.
But Spencer told me about it.

281
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,265
There was a domestic
disturbance report filed

282
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,485
approximately one month before
your husband disappeared.

283
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,459
- Can you explain that?
- Our neighbor heard us arguing.

284
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,982
That's all.
She called the police.

285
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:22,736
The report says it was more
than an argument, Mrs. Holt.

286
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:24,684
I threw some dishes.

287
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:26,531
But not at Spencer.

288
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:29,451
It was just the pregnancy hormones,
you know?

289
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,120
I would never hurt Spencer.

290
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,712
You don't believe the victim's wife?

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,965
I think that we should check with
Dunwood. He might've a different story.

292
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,001
What about the owner
of Bedford Creek Winery?

293
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,177
Mortenson is rich.

294
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,429
If he's involved,
you don't want to spook him

295
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,465
or he's just gonna hire
an army full of lawyers

296
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,558
to go make our lives miserable.

297
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,561
Would you like legal protection?

298
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,064
- What?
- With the child

299
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,651
so you feel secure that
I won't be asking for money or support.

300
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,862
- No, I don't need legal protection.
- But if you do...

301
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:06,905
I don't.

302
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,741
I've made an appointment for you
at the fertility clinic.

303
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:13,353
They will check
your semen for motility,

304
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,431
morphology, sperm count.

305
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,791
My boys can swim.

306
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,210
All right? I have a child,
do you rember?

307
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,834
This isn't personal.

308
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,509
I'd be remiss if I didn't look
at an analysis of your semen.

309
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:27,767
It's a very simple process.

310
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:31,012
You just go to the clinic,
give a sample. It takes five minutes.

311
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,974
They have pornography,
if you need stimulus.

312
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,099
I get it.

313
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,697
You really liked
holding that kid, didn't you?

314
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,752
I've been thinking
about how exciting it will be to

315
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,864
expose my own child
to early pattern recognition.

316
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,569
You know, they like singing and...

317
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:55,120
when you make
funny faces at them, too.

318
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,238
Yeah, of course.
I will make a diverse schedule.

319
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,288
When it doesn't contain
human remains,

320
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:14,097
Bedford Creek
makes an excellent cab.

321
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,767
It's very full-bodied.
It's like an Australian Shiraz.

322
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,821
I only drink diet soda.

323
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:23,106
I'm hoping the preservatives
can add some stability to my life.

324
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,454
Here's a little pocket knife.

325
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,572
And some glass fragments
embedded in the fabric from his shirt.

326
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,617
There's some scraping
on the anterior of this rib.

327
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,539
I got a gouge on the third rib and

328
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,788
one here on the sternum.

329
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,292
- You think he was stabbed?
- I can't tell from the incised edges,

330
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:46,463
'cause the bones are soft and completely
stained from soaking in the wine.

331
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,091
Man, I can barely get wine stains
out of my shirt, let alone a skeleton.

332
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:53,372
But your shirt
isn't composed of calcium.

333
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,221
Oh, my God.

334
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,732
I can clean them.

335
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,813
This is weird.
Something good is happening.

336
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,488
Take a deep breath;
I'm sure it'll pass.

337
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,651
The approximate weight of
the bones is 12. 43 kilograms.

338
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm gonna need 781 boxes
of denture cleaner.

339
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,219
Shame about Holt. He was a good guy.

340
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,942
One of the only critics
who didn't dump on my wine.

341
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,765
But your wine sells for
three dollars a bottle.

342
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,120
That's right, yeah.
In a bottle or a box.

343
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,003
- It's a good honest drink.
- That's good.

344
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:31,925
I didn't know you knew
anything about wine.

345
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,760
It's good, like the beer of wine.

346
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,929
Holt got that. He knew
I wasn't trying to be more.

347
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:40,100
Holt's wife said that,
he had to break up a fight

348
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,311
between you and Mortenson
from Bedford Creek Winery.

349
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,745
Yeah, it was at the wine expo,
in the parking lot.

350
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,485
I told Holt to stay out of it.

351
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,052
I shoved Mortenson, all right?
The guy was in my face.

352
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,432
Holt got in the middle, right when
Mortenson was taking a swing, so

353
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:57,867
he took the hit.

354
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,704
Mortenson walked out.
Just left him.

355
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:02,205
What was the fight about?

356
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,515
My vineyard's next door to his, and,
he thinks I'm an embarrassment.

357
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,304
He wants to buy me out.
He threatened some bogus lawsuits.

358
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,214
My family's been working
those fields since 1928.

359
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,553
This is my life.

360
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:14,968
So you had no issue with Mr. Holt?

361
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,638
Hell, no. You know, if he were alive,
I'd pat him on the back.

362
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:19,806
For what?

363
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,809
For taking that bastard
Mortenson down a peg.

364
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,311
- Yeah, but he loves Bedford Creek wine.
- Yeah.

365
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:29,065
But I heard he loves sleeping
with Mortenson's wife even more.

366
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,658
Is that what I think it is?

367
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,075
Were you thinking sodium perborate
and potassium monopersulfate?

368
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,475
Actually, I was thinking
Nana Shirley's teeth.

369
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,834
More like 781
sets of Nana Shirley's teeth.

370
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,919
Fisher says this will remove
the staining.

371
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
Could. I said could.

372
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:53,541
There is no certainty but death

373
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,092
and the incomprehensible
conundrum that is life.

374
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,985
Fisher, have you ever just taken
a moment to forget yourself?

375
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,060
Watch, like, The Three Stooges
and just laugh?

376
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,745
Yeah, I never found
humor in grown men

377
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,320
giving each other concussions
with construction equipment.

378
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:09,786
I tried.

379
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,609
Tox screen on the remnants
of the liver was inconclusive.

380
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,254
Rhe vinegar will obscure
just about everything.

381
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:19,133
But I did find some inorganic agents
mixed in with the liquefied tissue.

382
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,775
Might help us find cause of death.

383
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,505
I think I found stab wounds
on the ribs and sternum.

384
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,330
We'll know more
if we can clean the stains.

385
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,505
It's quite simple.
You just ejaculate into the cup.

386
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,334
Here we go, Mr. Booth.

387
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,920
You look a little flushed.
Are you okay?

388
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:43,389
- Sure. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Sometimes men can feel awkward.

389
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:46,559
Knowing people out there know
what you're doing in here.

390
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,727
Thanks for that.

391
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:50,897
You know what to do.

392
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,796
You're kidding, right?

393
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,653
There are magazines and videos,
if you need them. Enjoy.

394
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,703
Why are you here at the bank, Booth?

395
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:06,688
You've got a hot doctor friend.

396
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:08,998
Go to her and make
a direct deposit like a man.

397
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,131
That's impossible.

398
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,049
And yet we converse.

399
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,990
Look, a pile of porn.
Delicious.

400
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,346
Give me a peek, Booth.

401
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:25,682
Just a little peek at a booby?
Please?

402
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,714
What's your problem? You're threatened
by a cute, harmless baby?

403
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,732
Grow a set!

404
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,319
You do want her to have
your baby, don't you?

405
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,170
Of course I do.
It's just,

406
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:43,867
I want her to have a baby
because it's what she wants.

407
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,345
And you could just walk away
like a heartless cad

408
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,495
while she changes poo
all by her lonesome?

409
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,275
It's what she wants!

410
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,482
Are you okay in there, Mr. Booth?

411
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,607
I'm fine.

412
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,598
Just, fine, thank you.

413
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,758
Listen, could you just go away now, OK?
I don't need your help.

414
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,762
You're not a bad looking fellow,
and if you'd just keep an open mind...

415
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,353
Go back to cartoon land,
wherever you came from. Leave!

416
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,351
You sure? I'm good at pretend games.

417
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,067
That wasn't possible.

418
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,500
- Agent Booth.
- Sweets!

419
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,080
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

420
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:34,049
Turns out that, the victim might have
been sleeping with Mortenson's wife?

421
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,835
Jealousy, always a good motive.

422
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,630
Yeah, that's good.

423
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,966
But, I'm more interested in whether
you decided to inseminate Dr. Brennan.

424
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,010
God, you know,
don't say it like that.

425
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,461
I'm sorry. I'm interested
in whether you decided

426
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:49,140
to provide your semen
for her fertilization.

427
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,909
Saying it like that is worse.

428
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,127
I could go with "baby daddy,"
but that seems even...

429
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:54,270
I'm gonna do it.

430
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,567
I've already made the deposit.
That's right. Apparently, I am a god.

431
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,590
That's right.
Motile sperm count: 28. 8 million.

432
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:05,556
I could start my own country.

433
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:08,815
Okay, then. Well, I'm sure you'll be
going through a lot of emotional changes

434
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,870
because of this,
so if you need to talk...

435
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,706
Thank you, but, it's her baby,

436
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:17,543
so it's gonna be her life
that's turned upside-down, not mine.

437
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,298
- So you're not at all stressed by this?
- I'm an FBI agent, and a former sniper.

438
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,485
This is not a life or death
situation, you understand?

439
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,660
Yeah, sure.

440
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,638
Well, if you need anything,
I'm available.

441
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,220
I don't need anything.

442
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,394
I am just doing what, you know, anyone
else would in this situation, right?

443
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,399
Like what?

444
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Just...

445
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,856
I got a little, you know,

446
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,324
anxious at the clinic.

447
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,744
- Anxious?
- Anxious. Don't get all shrinky on me.

448
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,290
No, no, what kind of symptoms?
Shortness of breath, lightheaded?

449
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,208
- It's normal, right?
- Absolutely.

450
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,044
Sometimes, donors can feel
an emotional attachment,

451
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,870
even if they don't know
the recipient.

452
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:03,755
In this case,
since you and Dr. Brennan...

453
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,010
It's normal to imagine things?
Well, not pink elephants, but...

454
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,054
No, no, no, of course not.
Like, baby things.

455
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,381
It'd be odd if you didn't.

456
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:15,435
It'd be odd if I didn't.
You're my guy.

457
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,160
That's all I needed to hear.
Thanks, Sweets. Thanks.

458
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,606
I gotta go, take care of something.

459
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,358
No problem. Anytime.

460
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:36,465
There are tiny fractures
near the coronal sutures.

461
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,458
We never would have
noticed these before.

462
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,876
The denture cleaner
was an excellent idea, Mr. Fisher.

463
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,131
Now if I only possessed
rudimentary social skills.

464
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,967
They aren't really
necessary for your work.

465
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:51,308
I wish my parents were
that understanding.

466
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,132
You're gonna be a good mother.

467
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,934
I would imagine so.

468
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,330
Evidence of hemorrhaging
on the underside of the fractures.

469
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:03,066
There was a perimortem
blow to the head.

470
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,375
Okay. Booth is waiting for me.

471
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,704
Check the degree of hemorrhagic
staing to see if it was cause of death.

472
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:18,539
If Booth is still reluctant...

473
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,200
No, he offered
28. 8 million viable sperm

474
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,336
in a mere three milliliters
of ejaculate.

475
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,329
As the feeling of inadequacy
makes me shrivel.

476
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,390
Spencer Holt was a big
supporter of Bedford Creek wines.

477
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,325
- He was here for numerous tastings.
- Your little boy is adorable.

478
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,455
Thank you.

479
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,315
Phalanges, dancing phalanges.

480
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,671
- Bones.
- Right, sorry.

481
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,640
So you...

482
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:50,287
were sleeping with
Spencer Holt, weren't you?

483
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,480
Subtle.

484
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:54,534
Sleeping with him?
Of course not. Who told you that?

485
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,578
Seems like your husband
had, quite the temper.

486
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,050
Charlie Dunwood, right?

487
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:03,360
- That is not your husband's child.
- What?

488
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:06,736
- I think you should leave.
- The bone markers bear

489
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:09,522
- a clear resemblance to Spencer Holt.
- They do?

490
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,932
Research shows that babies

491
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,758
strongly resemble their fathers
in the first year of life.

492
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,951
The evolutionary theory being that
they're less likely to be abandoned

493
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:20,435
if the fathers recognize
themselves in their offspring.

494
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,436
What?

495
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,938
Your kid will look like me,
at least for the first year?

496
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,566
There's a high statistical
probability, yes.

497
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,871
Excuse me.

498
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,615
I can compare these photos
against Spencer Holt's remains.

499
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,440
- The maxilla and nasal aperture...
- Stop.

500
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,660
My husband could come in any moment.

501
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,662
So it's true?

502
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,708
Sean and I tried.

503
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,140
It's all about business with him,
but I really wanted a child.

504
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,914
Spencer understood, and one night
after a little too much wine...

505
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,680
I appreciate everything
Sean does for me,

506
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,101
but Spencer was, you know...

507
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,063
Kind?

508
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:05,980
I wish he had the chance
to see his child.

509
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,192
So does his wife.

510
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,100
Maybe your husband found out
that you were having an affair,

511
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,685
and, he decided
to get rid of Mr. Holt.

512
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,557
Seems like the kind of guy
who likes to get what he wants.

513
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:23,355
Sean has a temper,
but he would never hurt anyone.

514
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,890
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:27,543
We were just asking a few
questions about Spencer Holt.

516
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:31,434
You keep your mouth shut. I told you
everything when you found him,

517
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,605
and we're not saying anything
else without our attorneys present.

518
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,930
Is that clear?

519
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:41,432
I tried to talk to Brennan
about that whole baby thing.

520
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:44,652
- She won't listen to me.
- Neither will Booth.

521
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,055
Guess all we can do is board up
the windows and hope the levees hold.

522
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,566
- It's none of our business.
- Exactly right.

523
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,902
- That kid is gonna be so cute, though.
- Please, we're gonna go nuts.

524
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,645
I bought it a little onesy today.

525
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,825
I got the results back
on the inorganic goo.

526
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,800
Contains calcium arsenates.

527
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,481
- Arsenic?
- Yeah,

528
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,083
it was on his clothes
and mixed in with the tissue.

529
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,753
So, he was poisoned?

530
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,480
This isn't a high enough
concentration to kill him.

531
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:14,465
Booth said Holt's wife worked
with wood building playsets.

532
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,077
Arsenic is used in stains
and wood preservatives.

533
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,511
It's tough to wash off.

534
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,056
So Jenny Holt found out her husband
was cheating on her, stabbed him,

535
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,809
and left us a chemical fingerprint.

536
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,006
Spencer traveled a lot,

537
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:41,477
visiting vineyards across the country
and Europe, South America.

538
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,328
That's why I waited to file
the missing persons report.

539
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,248
He was missing for ten days. You didn't
even talk to him during that time?

540
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:51,836
We'd been having some trouble in
our marriage, but we loved each other.

541
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,172
You know he was having
an affair with, Kim Mortenson?

542
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,479
Yes,

543
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:01,463
I knew about Kim,
but we would have gotten past it.

544
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,434
When the baby was born, we would've
gotten closer, like we had been.

545
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:09,979
Did you know he was
the father of Kim's baby, too?

546
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,145
- What?
- Yeah.

547
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,865
No, that's impossible.

548
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,975
Knowing that he was having
an affair is one thing,

549
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,480
but knowing he fathered another
child while you were pregnant...

550
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:21,324
that would put anyone over the edge.

551
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:23,685
I didn't kill Spencer.

552
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:26,431
I loved him.

553
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,407
In your work,

554
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:34,712
do you use stains or wood
preservatives that contain arsenic?

555
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:36,951
There are traces, yes.

556
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,850
Arsenic was found on his clothes,
in his wounds

557
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:42,008
in an amount that could easily
have been transferred

558
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,138
from the assailant during an attack.

559
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,839
Why would I leave my little girl
without a father?

560
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,814
Why would I do that to her?

561
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,887
Where were you for the ten days
he went missing?

562
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:56,653
That was months ago.
I couldn't tell you. No one could.

563
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,345
All of the injuries to the ribs
and sternum had silica embedded in them

564
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,441
which matched
all of the glass shards

565
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:08,365
found in the wine cask
and on Holt's clothes.

566
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,582
Yes, these injuries to the ribs
and sternum...

567
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,043
can you connect the impact points?

568
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,922
Why, you think Holt's wife was making
a design when she was attacking him?

569
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,341
There are three main impact points.

570
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,843
What if they were
a circular pattern?

571
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,870
Okay, well, a circumference...

572
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:29,266
the circle is nine
and a half inches.

573
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,435
What is the circumference
of a wine bottle?

574
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,648
My guess, nine and a half inches.

575
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,233
Yeah, let's see.

576
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,904
Yep, nine and a half inches.

577
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,560
OK, get some Bedford Creek wine.

578
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:46,375
See if the bottle was sufficient
to cause these injuries

579
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,400
and hemorrhagic staining
at the coronal suture.

580
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,765
You know, a watermelon
is the same density as the human head.

581
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,461
I like the way you think, Fisher.

582
00:29:57,741 --> 00:30:00,095
I have an appointment
with a fertility specialist next week.

583
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,242
I could be inseminated
within a month.

584
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,972
- Really?
- You didn't tell Agent Booth?

585
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,391
I promised him he wouldn't
have to be involved.

586
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,220
Right, exactly, you see,
'cause we have a... an arrangement.

587
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:15,980
Well, I thought that these sessions
were meant for you

588
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,050
to see how we interact as partners.

589
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:19,400
How does this relate?

590
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,038
You're using
agent Booth to have a child.

591
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,665
You don't see how that might
relate to your partnership?

592
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,490
Has nothing to do with our work.

593
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:31,675
Let me just
organize my thoughts here.

594
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,865
It's not like
I'm going to be bringing

595
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,833
the child along
when we interrogate someone.

596
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,752
But you might decide to breastfeed.
It is healthier.

597
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,335
That's true.

598
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,740
So, yes, there might be some crossover.
I can see that now.

599
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:44,008
I'm sorry. Go on.

600
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,066
I think you need to

601
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:52,722
acknowledge that there are
some emotional considerations

602
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,226
that you might be denying.

603
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,368
Like what?

604
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,649
There are sperm banks that guarantee

605
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,692
high IQs
and exceptional physical prowess,

606
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,578
yet you specifically
chose Agent Booth. Why?

607
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:08,019
He has traits like

608
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:11,695
courage and compassion and empathy

609
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,028
that would be tremendous
assets to my child.

610
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,665
Sperm banks
don't catalog those traits.

611
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,376
Did you just say something nice?

612
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,379
No, I gave an objective evaluation.

613
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,591
Because it sounded like
you said something nice.

614
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,794
How can you two not see
what's going on here?

615
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,785
What is the big deal? She was gonna
have a baby anyway, I mean, with Fisher.

616
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,517
What would you have done?

617
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:38,440
What I would have done is not important,
but you admitted to feelings of anxiety.

618
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,482
You know what, Sweets?
You are crossing a line right there.

619
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,920
- I agree.
- No, I'm not actually.

620
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:46,695
In my position, I could make
an evaluation that states

621
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,140
that you two are not
suited to work together

622
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,700
because of interpersonal issues
that are not being dealt with.

623
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,385
- Ridiculous.
- Dreamer.

624
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,330
So perhaps until our next session,

625
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:59,208
maybe you should think about some
of the things that I brought up today.

626
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:05,130
It's confirmed by the modeling.

627
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:09,105
Yep, the shards of glass found
in the cask have the same thatch design

628
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,970
as the base of the
Bedford Creek bottles.

629
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,430
So, we know the bottle
was from Bedford Creek.

630
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,850
Then we don't have to do
the experiment.

631
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:21,438
We have all the melons
already, you know, and the bottles...

632
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,275
- Confirmation would be beneficial.
- We'd be remiss if we didn't confirm.

633
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:30,406
Sorry, Mr. Holt.

634
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,618
That bottle was supposed to break.

635
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,745
Yeah, otherwise,
the injuries make no sense.

636
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,416
You're sure a melon has
the same density as a human head?

637
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,857
Would I waste our time?
Give me that.

638
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,759
- I enjoyed that too much, didn't I?
- It's important to love your work.

639
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,596
Maybe she hit him
with the narrow end.

640
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,392
She was a carpenter. More strength.

641
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,874
I was going out to dinner.

642
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,661
- Would you like a towel?
- Very much.

643
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:23,208
The Bedford Creek bottles,
they wouldn't have broken.

644
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,280
But it would've smashed his skull.

645
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:28,255
But you said the design
you found on the glass

646
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:32,009
confirmed that it was
a Bedford Creek bottle.

647
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,360
Yeah, but...

648
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:36,950
these bottles wouldn't have
provided the injuries that we found.

649
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:40,961
So... after all this, we have no weapon
or cause of death?

650
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,899
Did you ever think, what if Booth
is the perfect father for your child?

651
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,343
Not just his stuff, but him.

652
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:06,133
What if you're throwing away the chance
to have a family,

653
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:08,555
a real family,
because you're scared?

654
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,651
Scared? Why would I be scared?
I've been to Rwanda, to Iraq.

655
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:17,449
Listen, you said you wanted to do this
alone because feelings are ephemeral.

656
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,620
So is life, Brennan.

657
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,309
We're here one minute,
and then we're gone the next.

658
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,580
You should know that
better than anybody.

659
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,705
If you keep living
trying to protect yourself,

660
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:29,525
nothing is ever gonna touch you.

661
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,245
Sweets said that it's not his job
to tell somebody what they're feeling

662
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,541
or how they should live their life.

663
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,910
Lucky thing I'm not a shrink.

664
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,435
The bottles were counterfeits.

665
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,890
- Counterfeit?
- Even though the design was the same,

666
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,832
the glass found in the cask had

667
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,467
a lower concentration
of dolomite and magnesium dioxide

668
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:49,253
than the real Bedford Creek bottles.

669
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,672
Someone's been counterfeiting
Bedford Creek Cabernet.

670
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,216
A bottle of Bedford Creek
sells for over a hundred bucks.

671
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,302
So if someone fills counterfeit
bottles with cheap wine

672
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:01,194
and ships out a couple thousand
cases saying it's from Bedford Creek,

673
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:03,415
- they could make some serious money.
- Exactly.

674
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,649
Now, I also found
that the arsenic compound

675
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:08,272
I thought was from the stain
contains parathion.

676
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,610
We don't know what that means.

677
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,278
It's an organophosphate
used as an insecticide.

678
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:18,115
The only vineyard in the area licensed
to use it by the EPA is Dunwood Winery.

679
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,372
Charles Dunwood.

680
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:31,532
We found cases of this
in your warehouse.

681
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:34,405
You were counterfeiting
Bedford Creek wine.

682
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,676
You charged a hundred dollars
for a three-dollar wine.

683
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,596
The stupid wine snobs,
they don't even know the difference.

684
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,155
But Holt did.

685
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,570
He found out, didn't he? He was...

686
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:46,185
going to tell Mortenson.

687
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,700
It was none of Holt's business.
I told him to stay out of it.

688
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:51,523
I need the money to fight
Mortenson's bogus lawsuits.

689
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,680
I wasn't gonna let that
bastard take my place.

690
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:55,915
My family's been there
for over 80 years.

691
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,990
Is this man a complete dunce?

692
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,327
God.

693
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,287
Booth, what is it?

694
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:08,155
Why doesn't he just clam up
and ask for a lawyer?

695
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,500
You, sir, are a boob!

696
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,972
Some people, they just feel remorse,
and they

697
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:13,545
want to set the record straight.

698
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,128
Please! He makes wine a homeless
person wouldn't cook with.

699
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:18,926
He never felt remorse about that.

700
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,425
Nobody asked you.

701
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,597
- Who are you talking to?
- What's going on?

702
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,495
Nothing, just, go on.

703
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,511
I followed him to Mortenson's.

704
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:35,859
He had one of the bottles.
It was late and...

705
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,976
And you cornered him in the wine cellar
and beat him to death to shut him up.

706
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:40,531
Blah, blah, blah. We know.

707
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,199
Will you shut up? Shut up!

708
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:44,159
Booth, who are you talking to?

709
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,079
So, are you gonna let her have
this baby alone?

710
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,550
- I didn't say that.
- You are!

711
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,895
You're going to abandon your child!

712
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,337
Night's deepest gloom
washes over my tiny frame.

713
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,380
No, I can't away. I never said that, OK?
Do you understand?

714
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,551
I can't walk away. This is my kid.

715
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:04,680
If I can't be involved,
I don't want her to have the baby.

716
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,683
And the sun shines again!
Good man, Boothie!

717
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,395
- What the hell's going on here?
- You shut up and don't move.

718
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,813
You're coming with me.

719
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,439
Wait! Stop!

720
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,484
You're leaving a helpless
child alone with a killer! Stop!

721
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,695
- What is going on?
- I can't do it.

722
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,657
Listen, I have to be involved.

723
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:26,192
If I'm the father, then...

724
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,448
I have to be a father.

725
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,998
You were seeing something in
there, what were you seeing?

726
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,877
Stewie, you know,
the baby from The Family Guy.

727
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,463
You, you saw Stewie... in there?
In the interrogation room?

728
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,800
- So, what do you say about the kid?
- Fine, I won't have a baby.

729
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,010
That's it?

730
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,300
No, it doesn't matter now,
we're going to the hospital.

731
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,086
- It's no big deal, OK?
- It is.

732
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,359
Booth, you thought
you saw Luc Robitaille

733
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:52,519
and then the ghost of a dead friend
and now a cartoon baby.

734
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:56,337
Trust me, something is wrong.
Trust me.

735
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,225
They should've
the CAT scan results now.

736
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,155
They're getting a second opinion.

737
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,250
Then the other doctor
should've been standing by.

738
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,385
- Are you all right, Sweets?
- No, no, I'm not.

739
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,750
I'm not the level-headed
shrink at the moment.

740
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,758
I'm just the guy
whose friend is in trouble,

741
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,703
and I'm having a hard time
dealing with it. Okay?

742
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,969
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:30,279
I just need a moment.

744
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:31,854
Sure.

745
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,151
Man, just when you think
you know what's what.

746
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:44,529
Man, we can't take anything
for granted, can we?

747
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:46,990
Why is it so easy to forget that?

748
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,675
Ange, when we split,
either one of us could've stopped it.

749
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,300
- It would've been easy.
- I know.

750
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:02,005
It'd be just as easy...
to begin again.

751
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:10,305
They think it's a cerebellar
pilocytic astrocytoma.

752
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,140
God, that sounds bad.

753
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:15,894
Brain tumor.
It's usually benign.

754
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,062
Usually.

755
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:20,432
They're prepping him
for surgery now.

756
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:22,234
So fast.

757
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,150
- They didn't want to take any chances.
- Go.

758
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,740
He shouldn't be alone
before he goes in there.

759
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,340
I just wanted all of you to know...

760
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,770
statistically, he should be fine.

761
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:46,925
This isn't about me.

762
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,864
The surgery should take about
two hours.

763
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:55,827
I was getting used to hallucinating.
I get lonely.

764
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,413
You're gonna be fine, Booth.

765
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,668
Dr. Jurzik is one of the best.

766
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,715
Would you come in there with me,
to the operating room?

767
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:10,759
No, I'll see you in Recovery.

768
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,880
What are you gonna do,
sit in the waiting room

769
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:14,763
and read all those old
magazines for hours?

770
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,307
I'm not a neurologist, Booth,
or a surgeon.

771
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,275
Yeah, but you're a genius.

772
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:21,770
That's good enough for me.

773
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:26,942
Plus, you'll know
if they're screwing up.

774
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,850
I'll ask.

775
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,665
I'll let you know
when we're ready for that... thanks.

776
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,770
Let me just take a look.

777
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,233
Excuse me.

778
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:59,675
Can we stop for a second?

779
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,771
Can you just
give me a minute, please?

780
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,398
What's wrong?

781
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,733
Listen, Bones, if I don't make it...

782
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,915
- Booth, you're gonna be fine.
- Yeah, but if I'm not...

783
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,198
I want you to have my stuff.

784
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,659
You know, for our kid.

785
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,694
I want you to.

786
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:25,052
You're gonna be a really good mom.

787
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,807
You're gonna be fine, Booth.
I'll be right here.

788
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,467
I'm ready.

789
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,521
