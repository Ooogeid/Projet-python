1
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:05,930
That was great. You were great.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,898
So maybe we could do it again?

3
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:10,805
The others are coming, right?

4
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:12,461
We still got time.

5
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:17,062
- What is the matter with you?
- I gotta take a leak.

6
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:18,188
Go.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,586
It's not my fault they make those
GargantuGulps so gargantuous.

8
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:24,853
Doesn't seem to bother me any,
micro-bladder.

9
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,587
- Karen!
- What?

10
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:43,134
Are you sure I'm the only guy
you've ever had sex with?

11
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:45,587
Why?

12
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:50,440
Oh, my God!

13
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:56,639
Karen!

14
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:58,104
Karen!

15
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,567
As I've told you many times,
Dr. Sweets, I do feel remorse.

16
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:09,406
But not for stabbing
a man in the heart.

17
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,609
No. For succumbing
to the faulty logic

18
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,033
that persuaded me that
his death was desirable.

19
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,618
You know, a sane person

20
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:17,822
would regret murdering
someone more than

21
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,624
being taken in by a line of crap.

22
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:22,419
- Define "crap."
- Drivel. Blarney.

23
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,665
Nonsense.

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,434
Balderdash.

25
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,538
Twaddle. Bull. Bunkum.

26
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,175
Hooey. Like that.

27
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,573
Now I realize
it was drivel-blarney-nonsense

28
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,590
balderdash-twaddle
bull-bunkum-hooey.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,473
Then I perceived it as logic.

30
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,726
How are your hands?

31
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,362
I estimate that I've regained
almost 60% full function,

32
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,670
which is not bad for hands that
were torn apart by an explosion.

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,265
You know, you'll only be released
from this psychiatric institution

34
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,222
if we cure you of your delusions.

35
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,740
My card isn't working. Hello.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,867
I was wrong, not delusional.

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,329
Your card must have expired,
Dr. Sweets.

38
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:58,455
Thank you.

39
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,459
Perhaps you should consider that your
delusion is that you're not delusional.

40
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:08,872
- How many pieces in total?
- Twelve.

41
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:11,551
- Interesting anomaly: no head.
- No head? That's odd.

42
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,061
Which is why I said anomaly.

43
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:14,979
No need to be snippy
with my partner, pal.

44
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,178
It's all right.

45
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,115
- What's wrong with your back?
- Nothing.

46
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,739
You're walking as though you strained
your intertransverse ligament.

47
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,337
- I can help you with that.
- No.

48
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:25,131
I never should've gone down that small
slide with Parker. I'll be fine.

49
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,895
The body parts were found
in this evaporation pool.

50
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,576
Look at that. It's purple.

51
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,821
Kid said it turned purple
when he peed in it.

52
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,158
For future reference, this is more
of an anomaly than a missing head.

53
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,496
- Sad comment on your life, Doc.
- Again. Snippy.

54
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,621
You know, if my back wasn't bad,
I would hit you.

55
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,039
I can take care of myself.

56
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:45,518
Size of the limbs suggest that
our victim is a fully-grown male.

57
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,253
What is with the purple water?

58
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,070
- Hodgins can analyze it.
- Cell phone.

59
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,924
Don't tell me. You want the entire

60
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,093
purple pond drained and shipped back
to the Jeffersonian.

61
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,888
No. I think a small sample will do.

62
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,098
- Great.
- Although...

63
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:01,333
Skulls are heavy.

64
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:03,436
The head
could have sunk to the bottom.

65
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:07,402
- You're correct, We should drain it.
- We're draining it. Let's drain it.

66
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:12,821
Bones - Season 04 Episode 05
"The Perfect Pieces In The Purple Pond"

Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

69
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:49,702
The ends of his fingers look burned.

70
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:50,827
Torture?

71
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:54,404
Sometimes, guys try to conceal their
identity by losing their fingerprints.

72
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,323
Mr. Bray is my brightest
scholarship student.

73
00:03:57,816 --> 00:04:01,172
These are children's shoes,
but they're a size 11.

74
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,705
So you think our victim
was a giant toddler?

75
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,790
No. That would show up in the bones.

76
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:09,419
Sarcasm does not play well
on the forensic platform.

77
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:15,236
I tracked down the manufacturer
in Sri Lanka, and guess what?

78
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,593
Special order.

79
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:19,721
Time of death, based on decomp,
between two and four days.

80
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,956
All the cuts to the skeleton
are clean except

81
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:24,350
for several incomplete slices
to the C-2 vertebra.

82
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,736
It comes to cutting off the head,
the killer hesitates.

83
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:29,063
Makes sense.
Gets easier after the first chop.

84
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:32,066
- What do you glean from the X rays?
- Slight spinal curvature,

85
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,611
hypermobile extension joints,

86
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,696
cartilage deficiency.

87
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,357
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?

88
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:41,127
We'll have the FBI check with
local orthopedic physicians.

89
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,343
The water turned purple because
of the bottom growing

90
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,455
algae called Lemanea.

91
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:47,999
Something agitated the algae,
so it turned purple.

92
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:51,336
The young man who found the body
urinated in the pool.

93
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:55,885
Well, average rate of flow
for males under 45 is, what?

94
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,255
It's 21 milliliters per second,
so, yeah,

95
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,178
that would be enough
to disrupt the algae.

96
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:02,081
Dr. Hodgins, have you moved yet?

97
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,558
Nope. If you hand me those shoes,
I can check for particulates.

98
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,774
Where is Hodgins moving?

99
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:15,693
Cam thinks that Hodgins should move
into Zack's Ookey room.

100
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,253
Cam's right.

101
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,209
I tell all of my grad students

102
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,660
not to be distracted
by the standards set by Zack.

103
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,620
I don't know who that is.

104
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,105
You and me, Wendell,
we need to talk.

105
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:35,401
If your back doesn't hurt,
why are you letting me drive?

106
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:38,603
You know what? Don't get used to it,
okay? I heal really, really fast.

107
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:41,999
My guys, they didn't find
the victim's head in the pool, right?

108
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,230
But I put out a bulletin
to orthopedic doctors

109
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,591
within 200 miles of the body drop.

110
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,180
Body parts drop.

111
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,771
The victim was killed, chopped up,
and then dropped.

112
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,732
- Breaking in a new intern, aren't you?
- How did you know?

113
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,632
`Cause, you know, you always get overly
precise. That's how I usually know.

114
00:05:57,752 --> 00:06:00,072
So, you want me to talk to him?
Break him in a little bit?

115
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,220
No, Booth, you don't need to fix
everything for everyone all the time,

116
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:06,536
- You know, I can handle myself.
- Partners watch out for each other.

117
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,547
If that were true,
you'd let me fix your back.

118
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,737
My back is fine.

119
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:12,561
All I need is an aspirin,
a hot bath, and maybe a nice

120
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,252
single malt Scotch.

121
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,349
We cross-referenced
Ellen-Danny syndrome...

122
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,714
Ehlers-Danlos.

123
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,924
with those kiddy shoes
Ange tracked down.

124
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:22,969
Okay.
We came up with this guy right here.

125
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:25,179
Jared Addison.

126
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,857
- 25 years old.
- Watch the road!

127
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,655
- I'm watching the road!
- 25 years old.

128
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:31,508
- I'm an excellent driver.
- I'm guessing that that's our victim.

129
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,787
My son was diagnosed with
Ehlers-Danlos in his teens.

130
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,949
Are you sure it's Jared?

131
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,891
Do you recognize these shoes?

132
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,621
Jared ordered them specially.

133
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,738
This distinct footwear,
in combination with Ehlers-Danlos

134
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:58,379
and other markers indicate that
the remains we found belong to your son.

135
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,965
We're very sorry for your loss.
If you need a moment...

136
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,342
It would be helpful
if we could see your son's room.

137
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:13,129
You can see why
I recognized the shoes.

138
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,897
Mrs. Addison,
your son died days ago.

139
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:17,530
Why didn't you report him missing?

140
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,410
I had no idea Jared was missing.

141
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,027
He lives here with you, right?

142
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:24,826
Jared was a novelist.
He was finishing a book.

143
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,742
He checked into a hotel
so I wouldn't bother him.

144
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,999
I had no idea anything was wrong.

145
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,831
Your son was Jared Addison
the cult science fiction novelist?

146
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:37,001
On the back here, it says that
he lived in the Caribbean on a boat.

147
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,461
No. That's not your son.

148
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,882
Obviously,
the publisher hired an impersonator,

149
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,574
and came up with
some romantic cover story.

150
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,218
How did you know that?

151
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,712
My publisher wanted to do
the same thing with me.

152
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,225
Jared's publisher dropped him
after his second book.

153
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,228
Jared was feeling a lot of pressure
to make this one great,

154
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,896
maybe try to get him back.

155
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,879
Ms. Addison.
With your permission, I'd like to

156
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,569
bring someone in here to take a look
over your son's room. You know,

157
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,595
an expert.

158
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,259
What kind of expert?

159
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,197
You know, Bones. An expert.

160
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:14,172
I found coffee grounds and sea kelp
in the treads of the vic's shoes.

161
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,094
So, before
the giant toddler was killed,

162
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,932
he was brewing coffee
on the seashore?

163
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:21,379
Yes. That's it precisely.
Case closed.

164
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,154
Also, I found a tiny fly egg,

165
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:27,685
smaller than any of the eggs
of any of the flies common

166
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,350
to where we found the body parts.

167
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,630
- Where is this fly egg from?
- In order to answer that,

168
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,935
I have to hatch it.

169
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,161
Seriously?

170
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:35,945
I'm an entomologist.

171
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,036
I have to hatch
this insect egg in order to

172
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:40,940
identify an important piece of evidence
in a murder investigation. Where...

173
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,445
Where's the funny in that?

174
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:45,695
I know you're upset about
breaking up with Angela, Dr. Hodgins.

175
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,655
And I know
you're upset about losing Zack.

176
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,224
But, despite your personal problems,
this is a workplace,

177
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,451
and your attitude
leaves a lot to be desired.

178
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,692
Fine. If you want to make a change,
you make a change.

179
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:59,000
Otherwise, you let me do my job
and hatch this egg.

180
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,921
These action figurines,

181
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:12,680
they're awesome.

182
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,867
- Still living at home, there, Sweets?
- No. I have my own place.

183
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,140
And, before that,
I lived with a woman, all right?

184
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,207
- Was that woman your mother?
- Yeah. Your mommy?

185
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,732
No. She most definitely
was not my mother.

186
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:29,047
If our victim is 25 years old,
I'd assume he was mentally slow.

187
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,234
Given the complexity of his novels,
I'd estimate

188
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,825
 his IQ to be higher than yours.

189
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,849
Then Booth is right.
Something else is wrong.

190
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,885
Full speed ahead, Sweets.

191
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,534
Let me have it. Come on.

192
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,340
It goes without saying.

193
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,335
Everything is perfectly aligned.

194
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,954
- Obsessive compulsive.
- How does this help us?

195
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,632
People with OCD repeat patterns
in their lives in order

196
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,414
to stave off psychological panic.

197
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,718
Now, if we ask

198
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:54,267
which of Jared Addison's set patterns
have recently been disrupted,

199
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,648
we may very well discover
what got him killed.

200
00:09:57,768 --> 00:10:00,394
We can't ask Jared Addison.
He's dead.

201
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,754
She is wicked literal?

202
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:05,074
Hey, it's her process.
Don't be mean to her.

203
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,526
I'm not defending,
I'm just explaing.

204
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:10,098
- I can defend... You were defending.
- I was explaining.

205
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,949
This is an interesting development
in your interpersonal behaviors.

206
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,462
No. What's more interesting
is that Booth's back hurts,

207
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,915
- and he won't let me fix it.
- No. None of this is interesting

208
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,082
Look, I just want to know what kind
of mojo disrupted crazy boy's pattern?

209
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,638
My first guess?

210
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:23,791
At his age?

211
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:25,888
- Sex.
- Sex?

212
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,172
"Crazy boy" is offensive,
by the way.

213
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,299
His mother
didn't mention a girlfriend.

214
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,679
What's wrong with him?

215
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:37,713
Sweets, what are you doing?

216
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:41,562
I'm putting myself in the mind
of an obsessive compulsive

217
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,248
in order to figure out
where I might conceal a

218
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:47,066
memory-enhancer
or psychosexual proxy.

219
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,026
Right. Right. What's that mean?

220
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:51,487
- Masturbatory aid.
- Oh. Check the shoes.

221
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:52,606
- What?
- Good.

222
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,991
You're not going to find it
in the shoes.

223
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,504
Do all boys keep their
masturbatory aids in their shoes,

224
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:04,977
or is that particular to you?

225
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,873
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

226
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:09,797
Ms. Kelly Sutton. There's a phone
number, an e-mail address,

227
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,301
and a list of sexual suggestions.

228
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:18,116
What?
You're surprised he has a girlfriend?

229
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,057
No, I wouldn't actually
call her a girl.

230
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:37,432
I loved Jared.

231
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:41,059
The age difference bothers you?

232
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:45,688
Mrs. Addison said that Jared wasn't
really all that interested in you.

233
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,128
She said that I was pursuing Jared,
didn't she?

234
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,890
Fact is, Jared wanted to marry me.

235
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,077
One study showed that in 45%
of successful American marriages,

236
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:01,770
the woman was at least
five years older than her husband.

237
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,736
Older women are sexually experienced
and less inhibited.

238
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:07,730
Younger men have a greater sex
drive and they can keep up.

239
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,563
I know quite a bit
about older women.

240
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:12,110
The woman I lived with was 26, so...

241
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,381
Sorry.

242
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:20,910
So, how did you meet?

243
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,547
Well, I help out my son
at his florist shop and nursery,

244
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,547
and Jared came in to buy
an orchid for his mother.

245
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,044
He was full of anxiety.

246
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,382
Probably about microbes, Booth.

247
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,547
Afraid of germs?

248
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,411
I picked out an orchid,
and I took it out to his car,

249
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:38,271
and he was very appreciative.

250
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,334
And I thought he was just adorable.

251
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,929
So I asked him out to dinner,
and the rest is history.

252
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:48,932
He fell in love with me,
and I responded.

253
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,147
Jared's mother thought
he was at the hotel writing his book,

254
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,070
but there's no record
of him checking in.

255
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,656
He was at the hotel,
but for a conference.

256
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:01,367
Right,
with the science fiction writers.

257
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,369
No, for behavior modification.

258
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,281
If he was trying to overcome...

259
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,748
His psychological issues,

260
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,275
that might have threatened her.

261
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:10,365
- With your support?
- Of course.

262
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:15,315
Look, I only wanted
what was best for Jared.

263
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,133
I'm not a crazy person.

264
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:24,419
I look at the remains over and over
and I can't find any cause of death.

265
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,916
Without the head,
we may never discover cause of death.

266
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:30,438
And without cause of death, it's much
less likely that we'll solve the crime.

267
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:31,764
This fracture

268
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,900
on the right metacarpal in the last
two fingers has got a nickname:

269
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:36,610
"the boxer's fracture."

270
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,393
It happens if you slug someone

271
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,860
without keeping
your wrist dead straight, so...

272
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,328
How did you know that?

273
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,267
I fought Golden Gloves
when I was a kid.

274
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:49,165
You X-ray my hand,
it don't look much different than this.

275
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:53,085
I don't expect anyone to live up
to Zack's standards, Mr. Bray, but that

276
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,151
is extremely good work.

277
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:01,104
Mr. Bray, have you ever
conducted a sexual relationship

278
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,704
with a woman over
20 years older than yourself?

279
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,173
I ask because,
anthropologically speaking,

280
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:13,033
there's a correlation between
physically aggressive young males

281
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,720
and sexual precocity.

282
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,406
I'm pretty sure you aren't any
20 years older than me, Dr. Brennan.

283
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,825
Why would my age be relevant?

284
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,264
Very good work
on the boxer's fracture.

285
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,455
What'd you bring me, Hodgins?

286
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,885
Try and figure this one out.

287
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,283
A lemma on its own
is difficult to solve

288
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:49,023
because the solution changes
dependent upon whether or not

289
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:52,277
the subsequent proposition
is auxiliary or subsidiary.

290
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:54,438
So, I got you beat, right?

291
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,316
Yeah, that makes me king of the...

292
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,486
That-That makes me king.

293
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,870
We're gonna get you out
of here someday, Zack,

294
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:06,825
and you can be king again.

295
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:10,412
I know you're lying to make me
feel better and not to be malicious.

296
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,156
Want to hear about the case
we're working on now?

297
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,044
Body in 12 pieces.

298
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:19,004
And get this: no head.

299
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,506
So, 13 pieces.

300
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:24,885
The linear functional must be bounded
before you apply Riesz representation.

301
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,313
What?

302
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,073
The characteristic polynomial
of a differential operator

303
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:32,017
is not the same thing as the
characteristic polynomial of a matrix.

304
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,019
- You solved it?
- Yes.

305
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,356
I'm king of the loony bin.

306
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:42,444
Yeah, you are.

307
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,541
Hey, I got an idea.
I'm gonna leave the case file with you.

308
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:49,233
It's got all the X rays so far,
all the data.

309
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,482
Maybe
you'll find something we missed?

310
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,747
I've done that many times
in the past.

311
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,043
Angela says you and
she aren't together anymore.

312
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,438
Yeah, you know.

313
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,508
I'm sorry things
are going badly for you.

314
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,042
Why are you laughing?

315
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,542
My best friend
is locked up in a loony bin,

316
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,448
wearing gloves because
he blew up his own hands and

317
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,708
he feels sorry for me.

318
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,236
Mud is not dangerous,

319
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,734
mud's not toxic,

320
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,127
mud is not poisonous,
mud will not hurt you.

321
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,114
Now, you're gonna dip
your hand in the bucket

322
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:34,747
and you're gonna mix it around.

323
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:38,636
Do it!

324
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,586
Look at the hematoma
left on his temporal.

325
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,294
It's what you would call a "shiner."

326
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:43,327
I know, Bones.

327
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,007
Now take that mud,

328
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:48,010
rub it on your arms, your legs,

329
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:49,887
your stomach,

330
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:51,430
your feet.

331
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,570
Get it in there.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, ladies.

332
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,300
On the chest, it's not gonna hurt you.

333
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,826
- Come on!
- No.

334
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,323
I can't do it. I can't.

335
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:03,096
Who's in control Ralph,
you or the OCD?

336
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,609
Oh, God, oh, God.

337
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:06,712
Do you want to be ordered
around by a disorder?

338
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:09,883
No, I want order, not disorder.

339
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:11,403
I have been where you are, man.

340
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:13,160
I have felt your fears.

341
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:15,858
Now look at me now.
You can do it, too.

342
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:17,756
Ralph?

343
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,618
Oh, got a runner.

344
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,419
You think you want to follow Ralph?
All of you?

345
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,555
But you don't want to do that.

346
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:28,902
You do not want to do that.
I know because I'm one of ya.

347
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:33,013
Excuse me. Maybe you'd like to
follow me. I have few questions for you.

348
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:38,168
I'm a professor of psychology
at the University of Maryland.

349
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,368
I received a grant
to conduct trial research

350
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,231
on methods of reforming
OCD behavior.

351
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,199
Was Jared Addison
one of your students?

352
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,611
I'm bound my patient confidentiality.
I'm sure you understand.

353
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:51,498
Jared was chopped into pieces and
tossed away into an industrial pool.

354
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:54,576
Yeah, that's not one of
your therapy exercises now, is it?

355
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:57,250
Oh, God.

356
00:17:58,296 --> 00:17:59,203
Yes.

357
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,178
Yes, Jared was, was one of mine.

358
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:07,297
He, I believe he was making
progress despite severe mysophobia.

359
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:10,217
- Mysophobia. Which is...?
- The germ phobia.

360
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:11,197
Right.

361
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:14,120
He'd hold a flame under
his fingertips after shaking hands.

362
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,140
He literally burned the germs away.

363
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,734
- When was the last time you saw Jared?
- Thursday afternoon.

364
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:21,650
He took off right after
we completed the toilet exercise.

365
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,772
- You mean, you went to the bathroom?
- No,

366
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,937
each participant is required
to pick a mint out of the toilet

367
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,924
and hold it on their tongue
for ten seconds.

368
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:32,740
Maybe Jared gave you that shiner after
you made him suck on a toilet mint.

369
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,742
We know he struck
someone with his right hand.

370
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:36,749
Yeah, just like this, right there.

371
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,572
You see? Right there like that.

372
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,559
I was punched by another participant

373
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,542
who had an extreme reaction
to the floor-licking exercise.

374
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,537
Is it common for patients
to attack you?

375
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,215
It happens.
There's a lot of stress involved,

376
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,214
people break.

377
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,747
Some people would see
what you do as torture.

378
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,261
Yeah, maybe when Jared
let you down, you broke.

379
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:55,824
Let me down?

380
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,357
Jared was my star patient.

381
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,310
It's a tragedy he died before
he could fully enjoy his new freedoms.

382
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,763
Excuse me.

383
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,869
It's okay, Ralph.
We'll try again tomorrow.

384
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,216
I'm not here to apologize,
Professor Amerian.

385
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:10,675
I'm here to confess.

386
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:12,696
I killed Jared.

387
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,975
Can you please sterilize
your handcuffs before taking me in?

388
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,961
I just want to say for the record,
that you're here of your own volition,

389
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:29,755
and have declinedlegal representation.

390
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:32,111
Why are you letting Sweets
conduct this interrogation?

391
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,333
Crazy guy, shrink,
it's a no-brainer.

392
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,402
Are we gonna let Sweets interrogate
all of our insane suspects?

393
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,473
Annoying, isn't it, Sweets?

394
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,189
- Why did you kill him?
- I didn't mean to kill him.

395
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,429
The fact is,
if I don't eat at exactly 8:14 a. m.

396
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,692
according to this watch,
the person nearest to me dies.

397
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:54,660
Professor Amerian told me not to eat
till 9:00 a. m. according to this watch.

398
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,042
Jared was sitting next to me.

399
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,976
And you believe
that's what killed him?

400
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,078
When you lock me up,
I should either keep my watch

401
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:05,707
or you should only put me next to
terrible people who deserve to die.

402
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:09,390
Did you, by any chance,
dismember Jared after you killed him?

403
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,963
No, I just killed him.

404
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,465
No, we got to keep looking.

405
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,172
If Jared was having breakfast
with Ralph,

406
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,012
how come he never showed up
to that day's session?

407
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:21,500
Where did Jared go after
you had breakfast together?

408
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,058
To the coffee bar in the lobby.

409
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:24,268
Why?

410
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:25,435
To get coffee.

411
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:30,607
Hodgins found coffee grounds and
sea kelp in the treads of Jared's shoes.

412
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:36,783
What can I get you?

413
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,638
A sample of your grounds.

414
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:41,053
Just take 'em, Bones, it's garbage.
You don't need a warrant.

415
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,786
Garbage?
What's going on?

416
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,288
FBI.

417
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:47,562
Special Agent Booth.
Do you recognize this guy?

418
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,546
What did he do, lodge a complaint?
Because I never actually hit the guy.

419
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:55,924
I pushed him in the chest
with maybe two fingers.

420
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:57,843
- A nudge.
- Why'd you push him?

421
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,866
The dude had me wash my hands
with antibacterial soap

422
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,565
before I started on his cappuccino.

423
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,479
Then he had me redo it three times

424
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,019
because the cup was dirty
on the outside.

425
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,438
Which it was not.
Look at my cups.

426
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:10,612
Pristine.

427
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:14,006
So you pushed the dude
for insulting your cups.

428
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,905
No, all of these OC-DC
people are the same.

429
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:21,241
Complaing. Every day,
I'm throwing out perfectly good coffee.

430
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm going bankrupt.

431
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,788
He did it to me one too many times,
and I cracked.

432
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:28,332
Call it a crime of passion.

433
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:30,751
- Was that the last time you saw him?
- Nope.

434
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:34,366
Guy came by here the other day
and we made nice.

435
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:36,906
Thursday, he apologized to me.

436
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,791
He even shook my hands without
putting on rubber gloves.

437
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,012
He was like a different guy.

438
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:44,806
Professor Amerian's methods
were working.

439
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,917
Oh, God,
please keep that under your hat.

440
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,617
That's all I need is for this place

441
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:52,064
to become the coffee mecca
for the phobics.

442
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,822
Hey, Wendell. Come in.

443
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:06,203
- What can I do for you?
- You said come to you with questions.

444
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:09,122
I owe people money.

445
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:14,503
It's not technically a question,
so there's not much for me to go on.

446
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:17,723
What I gotta do is keep
my nose clean,

447
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:20,717
graduate top of my class, and get
a good job so I can pay off that debt.

448
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:24,262
You're worried about getting fired
because you can't satisfy Dr. Brennan?

449
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,807
Never mind.

450
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:28,747
Wendell...

451
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,332
Wendell, hold on.

452
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,854
You never actually asked me a question.

453
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:35,983
The guy, the psycho
who helped the serial killer?

454
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,726
Could you please not call
Zack a psycho?

455
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,904
Crazy as it sounds,
we all still love him.

456
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:42,864
He was Dr. Brennan's boy toy, right?

457
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:46,868
What, boy toy, as in... sexual?

458
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:50,824
No.

459
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:53,792
Where did you get...?
No. Absolutely not.

460
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,987
Plus, the FBI guy.

461
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,754
Again, no. Wrong.

462
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:58,964
Then she hit on me.

463
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:01,615
- I don't think so.
- She looked me in the eyes and asked

464
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:04,537
if I had experience with older women.
It's like, if you wanta work around here

465
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:06,179
- you gotta...
- Wendell, stop.

466
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:09,108
You need to look for some
alternative explanation

467
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:11,268
for what you think happened
between you and Brennan.

468
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:13,898
And if you can't think of anything,
then you should just...

469
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,606
assume you're hallucinating or insane

470
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,859
because she absolutely
didn't hit on you.

471
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,160
I'm glad we talked.

472
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,829
You get anything off
the victim's cell phone?

473
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,998
I was able to recreate
a call list from the SIM.

474
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,540
He only called one number.

475
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,964
Once a day for 30 days
at exactly the same time.

476
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:42,101
Who is it?

477
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,338
I called the number
and recorded the answer:

478
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:48,472
Forward-Retro Publishing.
How may I direct your call?

479
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,807
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Yes.

480
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,796
Forward-Retro is the publisher
who dropped Jared Addison

481
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,373
after his second book.

482
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,397
The one who never wanted
to talk to him again.

483
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:11,803
The publishing game has changed.
You know what I mean, Dr. Brennan.

484
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:14,998
- No, I do not.
- Try me, Mr. Tushman.

485
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,177
Book-wise, it's no longer
about good writing per se.

486
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:18,585
It's about marketability.

487
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,714
- Of the book.
- Of the author.

488
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,882
There's a reason why your photo takes up
the entire back cover of your books.

489
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,551
- Because I'm a very good writer.
- You're serviceable.

490
00:24:26,711 --> 00:24:31,223
But your success is contingent upon
your image as a hot scientist chick.

491
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,449
- That's not true, is it?
- No, of course not.

492
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:36,519
Don't call my partner "a chick."
What's the matter with you?

493
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,637
Fine, got it.

494
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,532
The point is I had to hire a guy
to pretend to be Jerry,

495
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:43,954
book tours, press the geek flesh
at the nerd conventions.

496
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:45,712
- This guy?
- Yeah. C.D. Howe.

497
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,080
The deal I had with C.D. was
to let him write his own stuff.

498
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,222
And you know what, it was good.
He started selling.

499
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,202
So I had to choose
between Jared and C.D.

500
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:55,330
So you had no contact with
Jared Addison after firing him?

501
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,208
- Absolutely none.
- Yeah, that's a lie.

502
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,835
He called you every day.

503
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,220
Whoa, Bones.

504
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,868
Ask him what happened to his tooth.

505
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:06,550
That's assault.
Are your hands clean?

506
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,790
My partner wants to know
what happened to your tooth.

507
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,472
Jared Addison punched him.

508
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,640
I admit to that cause
and effect situation.

509
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,883
Why'd he punch you?

510
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:17,151
Probably because he said
Jared was a bad writer.

511
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:18,471
I didn't kill Jared.

512
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:22,229
But you think I did because of
a minor physical altercation.

513
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,152
You know what?
Explain yourself.

514
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,572
Jared came into my office.

515
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:31,323
And he told me he was cured of his OCD.

516
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,573
He mentioned, um, toilet candy?

517
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:39,721
He said he was willing
to go out on the road, hustle

518
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:41,526
the books however I wanted.

519
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:43,856
I told him I wasn't interested,
I heard it all before.

520
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,716
And, uh, then he clocked me one.

521
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:46,719
Didn't hurt.

522
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,258
Then I told him
that I would take on his book.

523
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:51,683
Why did you change
your mind after he hit you?

524
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:54,044
So if I punched you,
you'd read my manuscript?

525
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:56,010
Jared hit me with his bare hand.

526
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,268
The old Jared Addison
would have never done that.

527
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,187
- You believed he was cured.
- Can you imagine...

528
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:05,284
the sales I'd have gotten off
of revealing the real Jared Addison?

529
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,444
I'd have made a fortune.

530
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,470
Dr. Hodgins?

531
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,539
My egg from the victim's shoes
is hatching.

532
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,120
You need quiet for that?

533
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,585
No, I just thought it might stop you
from talking.

534
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,488
Pushing it, Dr. Hodgins.

535
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:27,756
How's about we say you found the line?

536
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,056
This fly might tell us where
Jared Addison was murdered.

537
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:39,190
Oh, look, look, look, look.
Hey, there, little buddy.

538
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,102
This is a white fly.

539
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:43,813
Only lives in very warm, humid climates.

540
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:47,411
Jared Addison's old lady girlfriend
used to work at a nursery.

541
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,331
Hey, Dr. Saroyan...

542
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,884
I'm not moving into Zack's space.
I'm not being difficult.

543
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,200
I just...

544
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,030
I can't do it.

545
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:58,745
I hope you understand.

546
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,097
I understand.

547
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:06,126
I thought you being the one who moved in
there would be easiest for Zack.

548
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,840
If he were a normal human,
that might be true, but...

549
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,858
Okay, here's the thing,
this new guy, Wendell?

550
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:23,186
- He might be nuts.
- Hi, Angela. Pickle?

551
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:25,063
He thinks Brennan hit on him.

552
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:27,148
Why does he think that?

553
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,485
He says she asked him if
he was interested in having sex

554
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,903
with an older woman.
Which is impossible.

555
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:35,240
Which I set him straight about in
no uncertain terms, believe you me.

556
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,117
I'm certain she did exactly that.

557
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,926
I've known Brennan for years
and there's no way, believe me that...

558
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:44,549
Our murder victim was 28 years younger
than his girlfriend.

559
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:47,724
Dr. Brennan was probably looking
for insights in her...

560
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:50,096
clumsy yet endearing way.

561
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,997
You might want to let Wendell know
that you misjudged him...

562
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:54,467
in no uncertain terms.

563
00:27:56,361 --> 00:28:00,545
Well, Wendell also says that he owes
a lot of people a lot of money

564
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:02,538
and that he really needs this job.

565
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:05,596
- Like the mob or something.
- Oh, no, no, no.

566
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:08,406
Unless it's rampant paranoia,
not my jurisdiction.

567
00:28:08,526 --> 00:28:10,039
But on the other thing, I'm solid.

568
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,040
You know, the last time
I listened to you,

569
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,695
you broke up me and Hodgins.

570
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,113
- No.
- Yeah.

571
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,265
Angela, that wasn't my fault.

572
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:19,159
I think you know that.

573
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:30,532
So what do we think here, huh?

574
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,041
What do you think?

575
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:36,608
This is definitely an environment
conducive to the white fly.

576
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,269
I'll start taking some samples.

577
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:40,805
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, FBI.

578
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:44,934
Special Agent Seeley Booth, we have
a warrant here to search the premises.

579
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:46,895
Is this about Jared Addison's murder?

580
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:50,381
No, don't touch that.

581
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,650
There's tons of disgusting stuff
and chemicals...

582
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,104
Not here. Our fertilizer's 100% organic.

583
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,155
- My own blend.
- There you go.

584
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,282
Now you're gonna get sick,
your stomach's gonna go

585
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,381
- upside down, it's gonna be a mess.
- Coffee.

586
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:03,176
- Coffee?
- Sea kelp and coffee grounds.

587
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:05,205
Jared Addison was here
shortly before he died.

588
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:07,874
Jared was my mom's boyfriend.

589
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:09,501
Heavy emphasis on the "boy."

590
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,329
Yeah, well, we heard
this place kind of freaked him out.

591
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,283
- All the germs.
- Yeah, but he was here.

592
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:17,050
I don't know if it was the dirt
that made him squirm or the question,

593
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,427
- but the kid toughed it out.
- What question?

594
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,721
He wanted my permission to marry Mom.

595
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:23,056
What was your answer?

596
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:25,778
I told him I thought it would be creepy
to have a stepfather

597
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,472
who was ten years younger than me.

598
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:29,881
I told him he should forget
about it and try to be normal.

599
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,159
You told him no?

600
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,001
I said no, he could not
have my blessing.

601
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:37,112
He's lucky I didn't conk him on the head
and chop him up

602
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:38,863
for fertilizer.
But I didn't.

603
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:40,347
White flies.

604
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:43,910
I'll do some lab work, but they look to
be the strain that I hatched at the lab.

605
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,746
I'm sorry, did you just say
you did conk him on the head?

606
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,193
I said I didn't.

607
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,291
Flies on the shovel.

608
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,295
Oh. We know that flies are attracted
to manure and blood.

609
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:57,058
The flies are mostly on this shovel.

610
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:59,467
It follows that there's something
different about this one.

611
00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:02,428
Will that warrant let me test
the shovel?

612
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:04,639
Well, yeah, it's out in the open,
so it's fine.

613
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,467
I'm going to use phenolphthalein.

614
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,978
It'll tell us if there's blood present
on the shovel.

615
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,261
What's pink mean?

616
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,280
It means you caved
in Jared Addison's skull.

617
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,866
And/or removed his head.

618
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:25,691
I'm going to have to ask you to close up
shop and take you downtown.

619
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:28,586
We have a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

620
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:47,072
Somebody as smart as
you should know better.

621
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:50,115
Oh, I don't smoke.
I just...

622
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:51,617
I don't smoke.

623
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,117
So...

624
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,732
you weren't totally wrong
about Dr. Brennan.

625
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:59,861
I can't risk having sex with my boss.
Like I said, I got debts.

626
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:02,196
No, no, not totally wrong, I said.

627
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,770
When she asked you about
your experiences with older women,

628
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,328
her interest was anthropological.

629
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:09,996
She was looking me in the eyes.

630
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:11,554
She's direct...

631
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,240
and awkward.

632
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,950
Now, you've got two choices here:

633
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,880
you either answer the question,
like me or Zack,

634
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:22,258
or you tell her she's being
inappropriate, like Booth or Cam.

635
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:24,761
Either way, she's not gonna hold
it against you.

636
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:27,013
- You're sure about this?
- Yeah.

637
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:32,268
Frankly, I'm more worried about
the money owing thing.

638
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:33,478
I can pay my debts.

639
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,187
Yeah, but you can't work
on legal cases if

640
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:38,390
the wrong kind of people
have leverage on you?

641
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,525
Wrong kind of people?
What's that supposed to mean?

642
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:41,986
I'm trying to help, Wendell.

643
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:44,572
If they're the wrong kind of people,
then so am I.

644
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:46,563
- Could you not yell?
- My whole neighborhood

645
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:48,100
ponied up to send me to school.

646
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,380
They're working people.
They make money with their hands.

647
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,965
I need to pay them back.

648
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,876
I... I... thought you owed
the mob money.

649
00:31:57,274 --> 00:32:01,140
Like, we're working on a mob case
and you owe the mob money.

650
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:04,342
I don't owe the mob money.

651
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,010
Yeah. See the problem?

652
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,994
And I don't smoke.

653
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,524
When I gotta think, I ask myself
what my dad would've done.

654
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,210
He smoked all the time.

655
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,316
Holding a cigarette, it's stupid, okay,
but it helps me get into his head.

656
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,430
But he died of lung cancer.

657
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,361
So I do not smoke.

658
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:27,143
Wow, Wendell,
once you start talking, it's...

659
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,089
I don't get you people.

660
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:34,438
I'd like to work here,
but it's like a minefield...

661
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:35,999
too many ways to step wrong.

662
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,788
I admit it takes some getting used to.

663
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:40,745
Good luck.

664
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,026
It wasn't blood.

665
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:50,591
On the shovel... It wasn't blood.

666
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:52,445
Bones's magic juice didn't work.

667
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,014
No. Phenolphthalein is not magic.

668
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:55,893
It's an indicator that reacts with...

669
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:57,239
Potato proteins.

670
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,011
Potatoes?

671
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,894
Phenolphthalein turns pink
in the presence of potatoes.

672
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,691
I locked a guy up because of potatoes?

673
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:04,969
He might have done it.

674
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,866
But we know that without
the victim's head,

675
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,770
we aren't likely to solve this murder.

676
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,829
Maybe Wendell here missed
something in the bones.

677
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,560
- I didn't.
- Don't blame Wendell.

678
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,577
- He's doing very well.
- I just wish Zack were here.

679
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,705
You got to get over it...
Zack's not coming back.

680
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:19,917
I know where to find
the victim's head.

681
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,960
This is not good.

682
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,423
How did you get out?

683
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,133
You don't appear happy to see me.

684
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:28,570
Oh, we're not.

685
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,846
Well, I am.
I... really am!

686
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:37,310
I doubt he got a weekend pass.

687
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,969
Zack, how'd you get out?

688
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:41,207
Dr. Sweets helped me.

689
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,312
Then I totally change
my mind about Sweets.

690
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:44,484
I now love him.

691
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,444
Does Dr. Sweets know that he helped you?

692
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:47,631
No.

693
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,573
- You're hurting my arm.
- Zack, you're with me and Bones.

694
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,825
The rest play with your
microscopes, whatever you do.

695
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:55,536
- Let's go... Bone room, now, march.
- Come on.

696
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,540
Everything in the room
is organized in sets of 12.

697
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,542
A dozen shoes in the closet,
a dozen action figures on the shelf,

698
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,420
a dozen pencils in the pencil holder.

699
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,214
Even books are grouped by the dozen.

700
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,873
I should've noticed that.

701
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:12,220
Sets of 12 must be a manifestation
of Jared Addison's OCD.

702
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,341
I did an analysis of his novels.

703
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:16,125
There's no recurring sets of numbers,

704
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:18,476
only recurring images of germs
and fear of microbes.

705
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:20,400
Okay, then what is with the number 12?

706
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,697
They live at 12 Kindergarten Street.

707
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,637
"Kindergarten" has 12 letters.

708
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:28,861
"Alphanumeric" is also a 12-letter word,
but I suspect that's just ironic.

709
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:30,655
This side of him I don't miss at all.

710
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:32,365
Books, CD's, everything...

711
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,969
it's always 12.

712
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,669
In the yard, everything comes in 12--

713
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:38,792
paving stones, plants,

714
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,906
decorative rocks, gnomes...

715
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,083
always 12.

716
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:43,444
What?

717
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:46,459
Jared Addison wouldn't have been
gardening... He's germ-aphobic.

718
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,472
Even his name, Jared Addison--

719
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:49,507
12 letters.

720
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:51,217
What?

721
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,428
He didn't name himself, his mother did.

722
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:55,012
His mother has OCD, too?

723
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:56,973
That's the most reasonable conclusion.

724
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:00,143
But the body was found in 12 pieces,
not counting the head... Why?

725
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:04,160
The incomplete saw marks on
the C-2 vertebra were hesitation marks.

726
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:07,783
She couldn't deal with the part of
the body that was her child's face.

727
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,194
You. You used me to escape?

728
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:13,060
- How?
- Your card.

729
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,948
Sweets, one crime at a time.
Murder first, okay?

730
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,960
- Why'd she kill her son?
- He was overcoming his disorder.

731
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,457
Jared Addison was ready to take control
of his professional life.

732
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:25,626
He'd found love and was ready
to leave her house.

733
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:28,921
It wasn't just his patterns
he was destroying, it was hers.

734
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:31,883
And as a result, she suffered
a psychotic break

735
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,461
and murdered her own child.

736
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,344
You know, I still have my card.

737
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,263
I swapped out the magnetic strip

738
00:35:37,423 --> 00:35:39,044
with my loony-bin library card.

739
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:40,600
Wait, that's why it didn't work?

740
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,884
Zack, where is Jared's head?

741
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,760
Everything comes in 12s.

742
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,943
Everything except for...

743
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,302
This.

744
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:38,175
Zack was right.

745
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:40,887
Of course he was.

746
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:42,638
- As always.
- Time to go.

747
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:49,270
I should get back.

748
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:54,598
Okay.

749
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:56,527
Okay.

750
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:58,981
Okay.

751
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,318
Yeah, come on, let's go.

752
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,502
Come on.
Easy.

753
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,507
- What took so long?
- Relax, Sweets, okay?

754
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:13,347
- He's all yours.
- Wait, I thought we'd do this together.

755
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:16,243
Look, just walk him back through
the front door, okay,

756
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:20,083
don't look guilty, and if anyone asks,
you took him for electroshock.

757
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:21,279
All right?

758
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,285
Don't escape again.

759
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:24,430
You got it, Zack?

760
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,894
Figure out who our killer is,
you call me or Dr. Brennan.

761
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,186
Not Sweets.
All right?

762
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:32,792
Wait.

763
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:36,140
What if he...

764
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:38,945
I don't know,
what if he overpowers me or...?

765
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,363
Zack?

766
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:42,780
- I'm much stronger than I look.
- He's done it before.

767
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,275
He killed a man.

768
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,327
Okay, Zack,
promise you're not gonna kill Sweets.

769
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,777
- I promise.
- There you go.

770
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:50,539
There you go!

771
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,677
I got great seats to the Capitals.

772
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:02,733
If we bump into anybody,
let me do the talking.

773
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,347
I haven't actually literally done
it before, you know?

774
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:07,682
Had sex?

775
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,050
Ended someone's life.

776
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,602
Why doesn't anyone ever
believe I've had sex?

777
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:15,356
You confessed to plunging
a knife into a man's chest. No.

778
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:17,545
I said I killed him, which I did.

779
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,360
I told the Master where to find the man.

780
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,071
But you didn't plunge
a knife into the man's chest?

781
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:23,364
It wasn't me.

782
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,366
Zack, why did you confess?

783
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:26,700
Iwould have done it--

784
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,995
if the Master had asked,
I would have done it.

785
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:30,719
You don't know that.

786
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,007
People have no idea if they're capable
of ending a life

787
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,001
until they're put in that situation.

788
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:41,257
In all of our sessions, I've had
questions marks, because you,

789
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:43,009
at heart, arenota killer.

790
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,380
I got to... I got to tell
Dr. Brennan and Booth.

791
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,787
You can't tell them--

792
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:49,932
because I'm your patient,
and you're not allowed, ethically.

793
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,935
Zack, don't you want your friends
to know that you didn't kill anyone?

794
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:55,068
I'm still an accessory to murder.

795
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:57,704
If you tell them, they'll take me out
of here and put me in prison.

796
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:00,317
Hodgins assures me
I would not do well in prison.

797
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:03,041
Okay, what about the person
that actually did commit the murder?

798
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,570
- He's still out there.
- No.

799
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,504
The Master killed him,
so he could recruit me.

800
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:09,076
There can only ever be two.

801
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,988
You have to let me tell the truth.

802
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,080
You can't tell anyone
without my permission.

803
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,028
We should go in.

804
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:22,083
I don't want to get you into trouble.

805
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:35,813
What are you doing?

806
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,271
Throwing out my book.

807
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,371
It's still on your hard drive, right?

808
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,472
- Nope, not anymore it's not.
- You erased it? Whoa!

809
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:44,403
What?

810
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,947
- Stop.
- I don't want to be a writer anymore.

811
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:49,206
Why, because of what
that publisher said?

812
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:51,085
He was an idiot...
did you see his glasses?

813
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,907
I don't wantto be a sexy scientist.

814
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,847
Well, that's like me saying
I don't want to be a sexy FBI agent.

815
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,458
We can't change who we are.

816
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:04,289
Oh, God, this is just...

817
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,165
it's not good for the back.

818
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,974
"Suspenseful and chilling."

819
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:17,016
"Temperance Brennan leads the pack."

820
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,785
"Anthropology has never
been more exciting."

821
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,733
You memorized my reviews?

822
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:26,320
Angela can scan these and
get 'em back on your computer.

823
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,615
You know my reviews, Booth,
but... do you read my books?

824
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:31,265
Every single word.

825
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,911
You never said anything.

826
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:37,033
Well, I figure, you know,
I'm all over your real world...

827
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:39,448
why would you want me
in your fantasy world, too?

828
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:45,923
- I can appreciate that.
- You see...

829
00:41:46,223 --> 00:41:47,808
how this works, huh?

830
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:50,201
It's give and take,
we're partners, huh?

831
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:53,783
- Except you won't let me fix your back.
- Oh, come on, my back is fine.

832
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:54,975
Oh, really?

833
00:41:55,962 --> 00:42:00,005
How do I know that you're not gonna,
like, paralyze me or make it worse?

834
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,746
I also help you by explaing
a lot of things to you.

835
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:06,129
Yeah, well, you know, I explain...

836
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,365
Well, my things are more important.

837
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:16,237
Necessary pain.

838
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:18,048
Yeah. Necessary... Ah.

839
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,053
The way you really help me is...

840
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:21,798
is help me be a guy.

841
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:25,410
- I help you be a guy?
- You know, it's a guy's thing to...

842
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,602
fix things, to make 'em right.

843
00:42:27,722 --> 00:42:30,384
When I fix things, I feel like
I am one with the universe.

844
00:42:34,127 --> 00:42:36,824
God! That is amazing...
How'd you do that?

845
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:38,748
See? We help each other...
Quid pro quo.

846
00:42:38,868 --> 00:42:40,542
I know what that means,
"quid pro quo."

847
00:42:40,662 --> 00:42:42,561
- Sure you do.
