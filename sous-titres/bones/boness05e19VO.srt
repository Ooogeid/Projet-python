1
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:02,838
They put me in charge of this.

2
00:00:02,963 --> 00:00:05,218
I'm like one of those
big shots on Wall Street, only

3
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:07,530
I deal with laundry
instead of money.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,718
Not many people know it, but <i>this</i>

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,381
is the nerve center
of the entire hotel.

6
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:15,306
I would've thought
it would be room service.

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,559
No way. Proper washing
at this volume

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,922
depends on water quality,
bleach concentration, time,

9
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,606
and of course, agitation an heat.

10
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,724
Agitation and heat.
Yeah, I definitely got that.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,833
- We're going to be late for dinner.
- I pushed our reservations.

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,732
Check this baby out.

13
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:34,700
Energy Plus.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,661
Means not only
am I washing away the filth

15
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,851
and the fluids that people get
on your hotel sheets,

16
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm also on the front line
of the fight against global warming.

17
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,550
- What was that?
- Foreign object in the wash barrel.

18
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,406
- It happens.
- It looks gooey.

19
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,548
Won't it gum up your machine?

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,579
Whatever it is,
this baby can handle it.

21
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,527
The only way the body
could've gotten down here

22
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,495
is if someone threw it
in the laundry chute.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,319
- That would seem to suggest homicide.
- Yes, it would.

24
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:14,975
Is that a new tie?

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,686
Yeah, it is. You like it?

26
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,735
I'm not sure why you'd want to wear
frolicking cetaceans around your neck.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,022
Catherine got it for me.
They're little dolphins.

28
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,467
The marine biologist?

29
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:25,387
Yeah. Yeah, it was a present.

30
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,086
Interesting.

31
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,004
What do you mean, "interesting"?

32
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:30,506
Check this out.

33
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,459
Good luck on the I.D.

34
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,229
Too bad they didn't do him
on the delicate cycle.

35
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,566
Obviously, the manufacturers
didn't anticipate human remains.

36
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,159
According to the laundry guy,
the body could've been sitting

37
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,812
in the pile of dirty sheets for 2 days
before it got thrown into the wash.

38
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,231
Well, the heat in here
would have sped up decomp.

39
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,360
Look out.
I'm going in.

40
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,822
Judging by the concavity
of the rib end,

41
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,840
the victim was middle-aged.

42
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,103
Dismemberment occurred postmortem,

43
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,256
most likely during the spin cycle.

44
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,661
- What's so interesting about my tie?
- A gift is a social contract,

45
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:08,207
a basic anthropological construct.
By giving you the tie,

46
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:10,880
Catherine has entered into
a social contract with you.

47
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,339
Really?

48
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,260
Fabric softener has permeated the tissue
everything's swollen.

49
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:20,014
Speaking of social contracts,
do you like your gynecologist?

50
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,842
She's extremely competent, yes,

51
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,056
but I don't think
she's accepting new patients.

52
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,142
I thought you were happy
with Dr. Oksenberg?

53
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,482
Can you two just save the lady part
discussion for when I'm not here?

54
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,985
Dr. Oksenberg moved to
California, and I am looking

55
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,529
for a doctor for Michelle.
She's at that age, you know...

56
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,074
No. We are not gonna be discussing
your daughter's sex life

57
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,620
because, A: she doesn't have sex;
and, B: you're touching a dead body.

58
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,140
I don't follow your logic.

59
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,522
I'm always touching a dead body.

60
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:49,752
If I let that be a barrier
to conversation, I would nev...

61
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,896
Okay, can someone just please
remove the eyeball.

62
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,511
This is not an eyeball.

63
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,723
What is it?

64
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,768
I'll put it this way:
our victim was male.

65
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,688
Would you rather us go back
to talking about lady parts?

66
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,929
Bones - Season 5 Episode 19
"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle"

67
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,156
Synchro: ShalimarFox, JoJo13,
Dark_Chii

68
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:28,031
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

69
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:46,565
The skeleton appears to have suffered
a great deal of damage in the washer.

70
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,116
That wins the
understatement award for today.

71
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,485
It's going to be difficult
to find cause of death.

72
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,512
If the 3 pounds of muck I've got here
in the catch is any indication,

73
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,898
then that washing machine
must have been a beast.

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,924
Dr. Brennan, I found something.

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,545
Right here, at the junction
of the maxilla and palatine.

76
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,785
What is that, a bullet wound?
He was shot?

77
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,454
The hole is a result of surgery,
not a gunshot.

78
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,248
Most likely for oral cancer.

79
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,918
There's also bone degeneration
on the mandible.

80
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,433
Our victim was probly
a cigar smoker.

81
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,393
- Anything else?
- Condom.

82
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,217
Unused.
Never mind.

83
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,927
I also found a number of fully remodeled
fractures.

84
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,892
Here's one on the right hamate bone.

85
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:27,154
It's approximately three years old.

86
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,227
An injury like this is most typical
from professional base-ball player.

87
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:33,232
The great Tony Pena suffered
a similar fracture.

88
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,026
For-11 as a utility infielder
before being traded by the Royals...

89
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,195
To the White Sox after successful
surgery to repair his hamate.

90
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,637
And our All-American
Muslim drives in a run.

91
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,160
- Nice one, Arastoo.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:50,926
I thought our victim played baseball,
but then I saw these.

93
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:54,229
A number of mostly repaired
compression fractures

94
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:55,669
in the tibia and tarsus.

95
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,006
An injury pattern most commonly
sustained by rock climbers.

96
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:02,509
And these fractures occurred
about a year after the hamate fracture.

97
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,554
And here's where I go
for the triple because...

98
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,891
another remodeled fracture,
about a year old, and to the hyoid.

99
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,059
With an accompanying
microfracture on the parietal.

100
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,148
Almost certainly indicating
our victim was involved

101
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,606
in a high-speed collision
while wearing a helmet.

102
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,576
- What does this mean?
- Rock-climbing,

103
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:23,113
Rock-climbing, baseball-playing,
crash test dummy?

104
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,159
- Is there a testicle up here?
- Four that I know of.

105
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:29,365
I thought
you located them at the scene.

106
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,468
Just the one that scared Booth.

107
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:34,833
I've cataloged the loose tissue,
and all the victim's organs and glands

108
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,795
are accounted for, but the other
testicle seems to have vanished.

109
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:39,338
Well, it's not here.

110
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,648
But it does appear
our victim was in the habit

111
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,677
of injuring himself annually
a variety of risky behaviors.

112
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,804
So the guy with one gonad
actually had balls.

113
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,849
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got an appointment.

114
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,988
I should be looking
for a cigar-smoking,

115
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,985
thrill seeker missing
one of the family jewels?

116
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:03,800
- That's correct.
- You know, stereotypical male behavior

117
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,364
such as cigar smoking

118
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,242
and risk-taking could be
a form of overcompensation

119
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,330
in a man who was born
with only one testicle.

120
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,706
- I could write up a profile.
- There's no reason to assume that.

121
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,251
He could just as easily have lost it
in one of his dangerous pursuits.

122
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,658
If a testicle is severely
twisted or de-gloved,

123
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:22,877
it almost always
necessitates removal.

124
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,339
In the case of penetrating trauma...

125
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:30,343
Do you think we can go 20 minutes

126
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,307
on this case without
talking about testicles?

127
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,475
Please.

128
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,981
Booth has made a social contract
with the marine biologist.

129
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,276
It's amazing you go from injured
testicles to the woman I'm dating.

130
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,280
And you, you're supposed to say
"That's interesting" in a annoying way.

131
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,532
- It was a logical transition.
- It is interesting.

132
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:52,494
Booth and I are friends. Catherine is
an intelligent, attractive woman,

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,080
and I'm intrigued by
their developing relationship.

134
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:58,292
Yeah, that's nice. I think.

135
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,710
I think it is nice.

136
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,086
Thank you.

137
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,133
You two seem to be handling dating
very well. I'm impressed.

138
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,386
You've known me for two years, Sweets.
You should expect to be impressed by me.

139
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,087
- You were board-certified in '99?
- That is correct.

140
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:21,318
And you did a fellowship
at Vanderbilt in...

141
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:23,454
Reproductive endocrinology.

142
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,598
Boy, you really did your research.

143
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:28,129
You were recommended
by Dr. Oksenberg, but

144
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:30,449
I wanted to make sure
this is the right fit.

145
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:32,076
Yeah, no, of course.

146
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,745
Do you consider yourself
easy to talk to?

147
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,435
Especially about
delicate topics, like...

148
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,667
someone's first time having sex.

149
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:45,511
- Their first time with a new partner?
- No, no, their first time.

150
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,132
Losing their virginity.

151
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:52,012
Well, yes, of course.
I'd be, very sensitive

152
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,014
with that topic.

153
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,671
Especially if the delay
in sexual maturity

154
00:07:56,796 --> 00:08:00,223
was due to some sort of trauma
or negative conditioning.

155
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:03,148
Trauma? My God.
Why would you bring up trauma?

156
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,569
When an adult woman, such as yourself,
forgoes sexual activity,

157
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,738
there are often
deeper issues at play.

158
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,000
- What?
- There's been a misunderstanding here.

159
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm looking for a gynecologist
for my daughter, who's 16.

160
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:22,055
Great. I mean, yeah,
that just makes more sense.

161
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,048
I deal with a lot of teenagers.
And they feel very comfortable with me

162
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,584
because they know
they're free to speak about anything,

163
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,470
and it will remain confidential.

164
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:34,760
Excellent.

165
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:38,308
Obviously, you're respectful
and highly qualified.

166
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,727
- I think this will work.
- I'm glad.

167
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:44,219
You and your husband can feel confident
that I will treat your daughter

168
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,554
with the utmost care
and consideration.

169
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,797
Thank you.

170
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,384
Actually, I... don't have a husband.

171
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,324
Michelle is my adoptive daughter.

172
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:56,526
I see.

173
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,823
So thank you, Dr. Lidner.

174
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,510
Paul, please.

175
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:02,578
You could just call me Paul.

176
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,661
- You have something for me?
- Yep, fingernails.

177
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:16,643
I don't think
they're gonna help with the I.D.

178
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:19,604
I also have clothing
remnants, mostly denim;

179
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:22,348
a chain, also most likely
part of the victim's apparel;

180
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:25,173
some pieces of a molded
silicone elastomer.

181
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,373
The missing testicle.

182
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,740
It's a prosthetic one.

183
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,240
They're made of a silicone
shell and filled with saline.

184
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,619
Now, obviously this has suffered
a lot of damage in the wash, but

185
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,585
if we can get a serial number
off this, we can get an I.D.

186
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,733
Okay, I photographed each piece
of the silicone elastomer,

187
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:52,027
and I used the photos
to reassemble a virtual prosthetic.

188
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,444
Well, the serial numbers were
pretty worn from the washing machine.

189
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,821
Well, hopefully by looking at the image
under different color filters,

190
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,225
we can at least get
some of the digits.

191
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,203
I have to say that this whole

192
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:07,064
finding I.D. by testicle
definitely beats facial reconstructions.

193
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:10,692
Does that prosthetic
seem overly large to you?

194
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,808
It isn't to scale, Cam.

195
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:16,907
Guess it's... been a while.

196
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,078
I got the serial number for you.

197
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,574
I'll get it to Booth.

198
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,812
It's pretty big.

199
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:34,785
Richard Cole. 42, single,
commercial real estate developer.

200
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,889
Left his entire fortune
to the American Cancer Society.

201
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,888
So that rules out, financial motive.

202
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,390
Researchers can be ruthless.

203
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,893
Yes, look at this. This article
he did last spring in Cigar Connoisseur.

204
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,119
He had oral cancer.
He shouldn't have smoked.

205
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,356
That is not
his biggest problem right now.

206
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,567
He talks about going to fantasy camps
every year for his birthday.

207
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,162
- Fantasy camps?
- They're expensive camps

208
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,526
they get to pretend to be,
race car drivers,

209
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,742
professional ballplayers.


210
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,947
That would explain the yearly injuries.
You could easily crush a testicle

211
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,364
at rodeo camp.

212
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,626
What's going on this week at the hotel.
I wish I had enough money for this one.

213
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,822
Why, what is it?

214
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:14,767
<i>Did you ever dream about jamming
with your favorite musical heroes</i>

215
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,051
<i>or playing gigs in front of throngs
of screaming fans?</i>

216
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,053
<i>Please join us</i>

217
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>at the one and only fantasy camp</i>

218
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,222
<i>created by</i>

219
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:25,995
<i>legendary music manager
and promoter:</i>

220
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,644
<i>me, Simon Graham!</i>

221
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,082
- Music camp?
- That's not music.

222
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:32,441
That's rock and roll,

223
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,640
baby.
Yeah.

224
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,505
According to Cole's lawyer,

225
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,622
he was trying to buy a property that
Simon Graham didn't want him to have.

226
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:44,080
Graham murdered Cole
to safeguard some property?

227
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,314
It's possible.
But don't say that Cole is dead.

228
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,744
I don't want anybody panicking
or trying to flee the scene.

229
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,943
I was a very big fan
of Toad the Wet Sprocket.

230
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:54,689
You might want to keep that to yourself.
It's gonna be very loud in here and...

231
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,752
You going to the seminar
on string height?

232
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,384
- I have a class on tone control then.
- That's great.

233
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:02,054
They're all in line...

234
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,393
they're not even pushing.

235
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,019
This is not
my rock and roll fantasy.

236
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,504
No, this can't be right.

237
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,859
Rock and roll's not about seminars.
Come on, people.

238
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:19,215
- "Does anybody remember laughter?"
- I remember.

239
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,515
<i>Zeppelin</i>, man.

240
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,991
Dude,
you can lose the tie around here.

241
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,619
He-he likes it.
It's a gift from a woman.

242
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,704
Righ FBI Special Agent Sealy Booth.

243
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,624
- Hacker get you anything?
- A subscription to Lapham's Quarterly.

244
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,897
Can I help you guys?

245
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:36,088
'cause Idon't want to be late for class.
I paid a fortune to be at this camp.

246
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,709
- We're looking for Simon Graham.
- I think he's near the stage.

247
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,634
- "Walk this way. "
- Aerosmith.

248
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,142
You know your music.
This is Bebe. I'm Gino.

249
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,346
Is something wrong?

250
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,015
It's about one of your camp mates...
Richard Cole.

251
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,684
Cole? He hasn't been around
for a couple of days.

252
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
- Probably tired of fighting with Simon.
- Really?

253
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,820
<i>Boys and girls, Erik Dalton!</i>

254
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,944
Simon's in there.
Erik Dalton is starting his workshop.

255
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,788
What? Erik Dalton is here?

256
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,552
This is more like it.

257
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,452
Just give me a minute.

258
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,631
Shouldn't we try to talk to Simon?

259
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,517
Who unplugged me?

260
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,102
No one unplugs me!

261
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,896
- No one unplugs Erik Dalton.
- Apparently I do.

262
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,482
- The only way to get your attention.
- Get her out of here!

263
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,693
You're yelling unnecessarily,

264
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,123
probably due to hearing loss
from the music you play.

265
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,763
What do you think you're doing?

266
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:47,868
Simon Graham. FBI. We just have to ask
you a few questions about Richard Cole.

267
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:51,288
- What? I'm running a business here!
- I understand.

268
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,595
It's not gonna take long.
I'm really sorry.

269
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,242
I've identified 83 injuries to
the skeleton that occurred either

270
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:18,519
at the time of death or in
the washing machine. I can't tell which.

271
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,966
So no cause of death?

272
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,158
Not without evidence
from hemorrhagic staining,

273
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:25,591
and these remains went through a wash
cycle with industrial strength bleach.

274
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,200
I was pitching a no-hitter,
and now I can't find the plate.

275
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,714
This baseball thing.

276
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,888
- Were you allowed to play?
- The Quran strictly forbids baseball,

277
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,625
lacrosse, of course,
and board games with hungry hippos.

278
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:40,304
That's a yes, with an additional comment
on my ignorance.

279
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,590
I was a All-Star in high school. I even
got scouted by a couple of farm teams.

280
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,799
No way.

281
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,288
I still play on the weekends.
My mosque is in a league.

282
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,253
We play against churches
and synagogues.

283
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,479
- You should join us sometime.
- Come on now.

284
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,392
I can't be on an all-Muslim team.
I m a lapsed Episcopalian.

285
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,896
Every team has a few ringers.
The Jews have a Unitarian batting. 400.

286
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,356
Really?

287
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,108
Never tried
to beat the infidels before.

288
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:05,654
As long as you find something in
your washer goop that helps me

289
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,112
determine cause of death,

290
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,491
- you can play shortstop.
- You're on.

291
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,359
Is it true that Simon Graham's here?

292
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,648
- Yeah, he's in the conference room.
- I can provide a valuable insight.

293
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,130
This man practically invented
a rock subculture.

294
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,017
- You need me.
- You just want to meet him.

295
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,489
There's a little of that, yes,
but I'll be professional.

296
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,009
I'm a good profiler.

297
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:31,533
Okay, professional.

298
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:32,927
Yes, sure.

299
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:37,134
Do you know how many seminal rock
concert tours he's managed?

300
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:39,396
Yeah, the guy's a god,
but maybe a murdering.

301
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,138
So use your ears, not your mouth.
Just listen, you understand?

302
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,236
The camp is for people
who love music,

303
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,814
not wannabes in designer jeans

304
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:49,823
and fancy guitars they never touch.

305
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,324
You're describing Cole?

306
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:55,120
He's the idiot that wanted me
to turn him into Jimmy Page

307
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,998
when the only guitar that he ever played
came from a video game.

308
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,452
That would offend you.

309
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,752
That's a personal affront
to someone who's dedicated their life

310
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,754
to nurturing real musicians.

311
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,797
Shouldn't it?

312
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,942
- Can you tell me about The Stockyard?
- It's a famous rock club

313
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,845
in downtown Baltimore.
All the greats used to play there.

314
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,055
Mr. Graham used to
run it in the '80s.

315
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,057
You weren't asking me. Sorry.

316
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,810
Once Cole's deal went through,
he was gonna tear it down, wasn't he?

317
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,771
That's why you and Cole
were fighting?

318
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,647
Yeah, we settled that, though.

319
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,478
- What are you talking about?
- He said that he'd leave the club alone

320
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:30,196
if I let him do one song with Erik
Dalton at the end of camp night.

321
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,532
Dalton's one of your guests?

322
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,076
Dalton's one of your guest stars?

323
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,494
He blackmailed you.

324
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,913
Did you agree
to let Cole play with Dalton?

325
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,166
Yeah.
It's The Stockyard we're talking about.

326
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,627
- How did Dalton feel about that?
- How do you think he felt?

327
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,671
Do you mind if I go back to work?

328
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,890
- Sure.
- One-one quick question.

329
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,176
Bar fight: Who wins?

330
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,554
Prince and the New Power Generation
or Korn?

331
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,791
Never mess with Prince.

332
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,842
Never mess with Prince.

333
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,860
Honestly,
I think you'll like Dr. Lidner.

334
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,237
You should have someone else
to talk to,

335
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,574
especially if there's anything...

336
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,243
anything you'd prefer
I didn't know about.

337
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,038
I told you,
Perry and I are not having sex.

338
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,415
I know, and I believe you,

339
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:24,793
but you're growing up.
Your body,

340
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,523
it's a woman's body now,
not a child's.

341
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:30,048
And you should treat it
like a woman.

342
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,425
And I'm gonna stop talking now.

343
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,553
It's no big deal, Cam.
It's just a doctor.

344
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:39,089
I know, it just means
you're growing up for real.

345
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,726
And you don't quite know
how to handle that.

346
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,039
What? No.

347
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,688
Yeah, kind of,

348
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,731
but I will.
We will, right?

349
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,209
You don't know how to handle me either.
Do you?

350
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,236
'Cause that would be embarrassing.

351
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,612
We're fine.

352
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,407
Because you and Perry
aren't having sex, right?

353
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:57,937
Fry?

354
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,070
How's it going?

355
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,551
Dr. Brennan's waiting for cause
of death. I'm gonna be John Gochnaur.

356
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:09,338
Okay, boys, I'll bite.

357
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,060
Who is John Gochnaur?

358
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,345
The worst
major league baseball player ever.

359
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,857
Cleveland Indians.

360
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,758
187 batting average,

361
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:19,889
zero home runs, and 146 errors.

362
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,266
Is that bad?

363
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,560
Yeah, that's incomprehensibly bad.
Here,

364
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,020
this might help.
I found it in the washing machine catch.

365
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,523
- What is it?
- It's bone, so it's your department.

366
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,233
Crosshatching.

367
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,706
It may be bone, but it isn't human.

368
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,195
Well, then what is it?

369
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,702
It can't be.

370
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,533
What can't it be?

371
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,226
It's a piece of bone...
tusk, actually... from a...

372
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:43,496
a woolly mammoth.

373
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:46,666
There was a prehistoric elephant
in the washer with him?

374
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,652
- What, are you nuts?
- No,

375
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:51,288
it has Schreger lines on the grain.
It's a woolly mammoth.

376
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,880
But no help to me.

377
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,883
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

378
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,594
See how this top edge curves?

379
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,393
Now, if the curve continued,

380
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:05,127
and then down here, before it got worn
away in the washer, there was a point.

381
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,342
- A guitar pick?
- Exactly.

382
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,491
Why would someone want a guitar pick
made of an extinct prehistoric mammal?

383
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,071
According to my dad, guitarists
have this thing about their picks.

384
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,155
Different materials
make different sounds.

385
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,157
Bryan May, he uses an English penny.

386
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,367
My dad uses a Nicaraguan Cordoba.

387
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,204
Some guys use tortoise shells
or shark's tooth.

388
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,791
Do you know of any famous guitarists
who use woolly mammoth picks?

389
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,292
Erik Dalton.

390
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,572
Mr. Dalton's pick ended up in
the washing machine with the dead body.

391
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,839
That poses some serious questions,
no?

392
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,158
Yes, I do.

393
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,052
And Dalton isn't exactly known
for keeping his cool.

394
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:42,860
Check out this video from a concert
in Australia two years ago.

395
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,574
This guy's
got a seriously short fuse.

396
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:05,063
So, Richard Cole stops showing up
for his private rehearsals with you,

397
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,043
- and you don't notice?
- I was thrilled.

398
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:10,041
I was sick of kissing his ass.
What you doing? Can I help you?

399
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,585
You have no expertise
that would be of value to me.

400
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,004
I wouldn't be so sure.
Why don't you come sit next to me?

401
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:18,716
I really like your music, doesn't mean
I'm not gonna clock you. Let's focus.

402
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,301
So, Simon Graham,

403
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,596
he pays you a boatload of money, and you
still treat the campers like crap?

404
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,989
The guy's a poser, dude.
I got stuck with an asshat.

405
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:28,450
Couldn't even play rhythm
for Toad the Wet Sprocket.

406
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,853
I love them.

407
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,897
Suddenly the inside of my pants
isn't such a happy place.

408
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,949
Personally, I find your music discordant
and irritating.

409
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:39,570
Rather reminiscent of Murawari
death wailing in its capacity to annoy.

410
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,387
So, maybe Cole pisses you off,

411
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:44,576
throw in a little coke in the mix,
and you lose control.

412
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,195
- It's not like it hasn't happened.
- Hey, man,

413
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,857
I've been clean for two years.

414
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,166
I even do yoga.
And that hurts.

415
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,418
- Yeah?
- The splintering is fresh.

416
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,295
Something hit the side of this table

417
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,594
quite hard,
and there are scuff marks

418
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,430
on the wall beside
it that could indicate a struggle.

419
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:05,179
- Was there a fight in this room?
- I had some campers over Tuesday night.

420
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:07,348
Gives 'em a story
to tell their friends.

421
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,896
There's blood on the carpet.

422
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,190
I don't know anything about that.
When things got wild, I left.

423
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,985
Caught a cab across town to spend
some quality time with a girlfriend.

424
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,029
I need that girlfriend's name
and number.

425
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,822
And I'm gonna need this carpet.

426
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,449
Sure.

427
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,088
How did it go?

428
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,586
Fine.
You really didn't need to come with me.

429
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,672
I just wanted to make sure
you were comfortable.

430
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,300
Sure. He's cool.
Easy to talk to.

431
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,176
Good.

432
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,693
That's excellent.

433
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:48,097
Excuse me, Dr. Saroyan.
Do you have a minute?

434
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,141
A couple of insurance questions
is all.

435
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,397
Sure. Be back in a minute.

436
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,312
Is there a problem with Michelle?

437
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:03,029
No. She's great. In perfect health.

438
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:05,866
And she spoke to you...

439
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,575
about things.

440
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,839
Confidential things.
Yeah.

441
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,983
I can tell you
she's a wonderful girl.

442
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,416
But that's not why
I wanted to talk to you.

443
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,585
Right. Insurance.

444
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,299
Not about insurance, either, no.

445
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,091
Now I'm stumped.

446
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,501
I just thought...

447
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,054
Would it be weird

448
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:31,724
if I asked you to,
go out with me sometime?

449
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:33,895
Yes, that,

450
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:35,937
would be weird.

451
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,772
Of course. Very weird.

452
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,732
Yeah, right? It is weird.

453
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,359
Totally. Totally weird.

454
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:44,002
But, I would say yes.

455
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:47,407
Really?

456
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,553
That's... great.

457
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:53,663
Does that mean you're asking?

458
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:57,417
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

459
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,210
Work. I've got to go.

460
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:00,712
I am, though.

461
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,171
- What?
- Asking.

462
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
I'll call you?

463
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,641
I would like that.

464
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:14,177
So we know that the microfractures
radiate out of each trauma site.

465
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:18,454
These microfractures expand until
they run into other radiating fractures,

466
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,646
which were created
by earlier trauma wounds.

467
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:22,608
Now,
the trick is to separate out those

468
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,903
points of trauma where the radiating
microfractures just keep going

469
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,032
because there were no earlier fractures
to cross paths with.

470
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,951
In this way, we can identify
the perimortem fractures,

471
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,506
and therefore,
determine that cause of death was trauma

472
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:36,164
to the skull and chest cavity.

473
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,499
Cole was beaten to death.
Excellent work.

474
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,376
Thank you.
And Angela, of course.

475
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,045
- Double play, right?
- Yeah.

476
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,340
I assume you were talking about baseball
again, although I have no idea why.

477
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,134
It's baseball season, sweetie.

478
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:51,518
This is when boys like to hit balls
with sticks when the snow melts.

479
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:52,819
I don't know why.

480
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:56,116
What about the murder weapon?

481
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,518
I'm going to make castings
of the pertinent injuries.

482
00:23:58,643 --> 00:24:02,273
I'm making him 3- D scans so he can
focus on all the un-remodeled fractures.

483
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:05,359
Sweets would probably say
that the need

484
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,405
to hit balls with a large stick shows
that you're insecure with your manhood.

485
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,600
- I can assure you...
- I think it's probably

486
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,061
just enjoyable to hit things.

487
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:19,487
Erik Dalton's
hotel room's a good bet

488
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,784
for the murder scene.
We found two sets of DNA.

489
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:23,917
So, two people bled on this carpet?

490
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,589
The first set of DNA
belonged to our victim.

491
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,841
Perhaps the second set
belongs to our killer.

492
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:32,136
I found traces of Klonopin
in the mystery blood,

493
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,055
which means, whoever it belongs

494
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,766
to either has a panic disorder
or epilepsy.

495
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,469
We shoulcross-reference

496
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:41,786
the list of campers
with the prescription drug database.

497
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:45,733
Booth seems to like Catherine,
don't you think?

498
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:49,362
I do. I'm glad. It's been a long time
since he's dated anyone.

499
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,157
I know. It's important for Booth
to share his life. I prefer being alone.

500
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:54,951
But you're seeing Hacker.

501
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,911
Yes, and I like him,
but not like Booth.

502
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,956
I mean
not like Booth wants to like someone.

503
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,954
All organisms evolve and develop

504
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,567
along patterns only recognized
in retrospect.

505
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,964
Your life doesn't exist outside
the laws of nature.

506
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,467
Then in ignorance,
I await my own surprise.

507
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,513
Although the odds of it involving a
commitment to another person are remote.

508
00:25:15,844 --> 00:25:18,850
I never thought I'd be dating now,
yet I am.

509
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,170
- You met someone?
- I think so.

510
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:23,896
- We're going to have lunch.
- It's been quite a while for you.

511
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,357
And thanks for pointing that out.

512
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,278
Booth wants me to meet him
at the hotel.

513
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,946
Go. I'll call you if I get
a hit on the Klonopin.

514
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,841
All right,
now reverse on the chords.

515
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,350
Booth?

516
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,863
I'm not sure this is a
worthwhile use of our time.

517
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,277
We're still waiting for an I.D.
on the blood, right?

518
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:17,901
We've got a few minutes.

519
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:20,745
This is pathetic, Booth,
pretending to be something you're not.

520
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:22,612
It's dilettante camp.

521
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,123
What if this was, like,
anthropology fantasy camp,

522
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:27,919
and you got to meet,
I don't know... Margaret Mead?

523
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,548
- She's dead.
- Who would you want to meet?

524
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,693
- Me.
- You?

525
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,760
If I were an enthusiast, I'd want
to go to fantasy camp to meet me.

526
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,094
Play along.

527
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,820
It's rock and roll fantasy camp.
It's cool, right?

528
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:45,010
You hear that? That is our song.
Remember? "Hot Blooded".

529
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,688
The last time we sang this song,
someone tried to kill you.

530
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,449
Yeah, but it was fun up
until the blast, right? Come on.

531
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:56,530
Wait a second.
You play the guitar?

532
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,510
Well, I play the akontig,

533
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,176
the folk lute of the Jola tribe, but

534
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,284
the guitar is not dissimilar.

535
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:46,678
Cam got an I.D. for

536
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:49,317
the other blood found
in the hotel room.

537
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,476
Fred Keaton.

538
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,642
He's also registered
here as a camper.

539
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,174
All right, look, one more verse.

540
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,281
I didn't do anything.

541
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,617
You took off from fantasy camp.
You disappear, and you end up hiding out

542
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,615
- in a motel?
- I wasn't hiding.

543
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,519
We know you and Richard Cole

544
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,501
had a fight in Erik
Dalton's hotel room.

545
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,667
Your blood is on the
carpet with his.

546
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:34,337
- He had it coming, okay?
- What was the fight about?

547
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,631
I told him
I was still hoping to be discovered.

548
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,800
I know it's ridiculous,

549
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,471
but I've spent years in my garage
playing, and I'm good.

550
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,598
- It could happen, right?
- Just keep going.

551
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:47,171
Last Monday,

552
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:49,483
we had a jam night at camp.

553
00:28:49,887 --> 00:28:52,271
This guy came up to me,
told me he's with Rolling Stone.

554
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:54,482
Told me my guitar
playing is amazing,

555
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,543
he's gonna include me
in an article called

556
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,081
"The 100 Best Guitarists
You've Never Heard Of. "

557
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,822
- That sounds like a good thing.
- Too good, I'm guessing.

558
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:04,533
These girls come up,
told me I'm going to be a star.

559
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,660
Asked if they could keep me company.

560
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,668
- What for?
- For sex, Bones.

561
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:12,333
- A lucky night for you.
- A prank.

562
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,507
- He was messing with you?
- How was I supposed to know?

563
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:17,880
I called my wife,
told her I wanted to take a break.

564
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:21,509
Then at Erik Dalton's party,
Cole starts laughing.

565
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,261
Tells me the journalist
was an actor.

566
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,389
- And the groupies were...
- Professionals.

567
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:28,933
Rich bastard ruined my life.

568
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,836
Excellent motive for murder.

569
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:33,134
- What are you talking about?
- Cole is dead,

570
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:35,064
and I think you killed him.

571
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:37,899
I left to do damage control.

572
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:41,742
My wife won't even let me in the front
door. She wouldn't even talk to me.

573
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,998
Look, I have no idea
who killed Cole,

574
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:46,162
but what he did to me,
he deserved it.

575
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:53,201
Angela scanned the castings
of the fatal injuries

576
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,252
so we can get a better
sense of the weapon.

577
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,646
I cleaned up the edges,

578
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,944
and these are the shapes
that caused the injuries.

579
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:02,261
Cam said the blood spatter
analysis didn't show any drag marks

580
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,009
on the carpet from Dalton's room.

581
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,429
Which means that
Cole wasn't killed there.

582
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,709
No, two of these injuries
share the same impact surface area.

583
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:13,310
So it appears the guy was hit with
weapons that were each used once.

584
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,939
Or he was hit multiple times
by a weapon with a variety

585
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,220
of surface shapes.

586
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:21,360
Well, you know,
this could be a tailpiece.

587
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,487
- A what?
- And that

588
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,699
could be a tremolo arm,
which means that those lines are

589
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,801
from strings.

590
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,027
Wait a minute.

591
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:35,272
Out victim was beaten with a guitar?

592
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:36,750
I've seen this before.

593
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,086
Solid body guitars can
prove quite lethal.

594
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,666
There have to be over 50 guitars
at the camp.

595
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,430
Without cause, we can't get
warrants for all of them.

596
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,302
Yeah, but that shape.

597
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:49,680
I mean, the bottom is too curved
to be a Tele or a Strat, but...

598
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:52,643
it's not an SG because the
tailpiece wraps around,

599
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,894
and then there's the
distance to the jack plate.

600
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,897
You know, I think we're looking
for a '57 Gibson Les Paul.

601
00:30:58,229 --> 00:30:59,943
That is so hot that you know that.

602
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,860
Interesting. It's interesting.

603
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:05,034
It's not like I know every guitar,

604
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:06,906
but the expensive ones.

605
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:07,948
Expensive?

606
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:09,979
I'd say our victim
was beaten to death

607
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,203
by about a quarter
of a million dollars.

608
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,185
And then after a perfectly
nice evening,

609
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,476
I could tell he didn't
even want to shake my hand.

610
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,043
He looked positively pained.

611
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:28,844
- He's a science professor.
- No. Associate professor.

612
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,940
People get weird when they find out
that I handle dead people all day.

613
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,099
Now I just say
I'm an insurance underwriter.

614
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:37,269
Good one.
I'm an accountant.

615
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,955
No one wants to talk about
work with an accountant.

616
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
Or an insurance underwriter.

617
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,694
Except other accountants
or underwriters.

618
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:51,450
So, do we share any
other great deceptions?

619
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:55,788
I can make a coin disappear
and come out of your ear.

620
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:57,998
I hate magic. I'm sorry.

621
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,583
Yeah, me, too.

622
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,335
But it worked for my Uncle Dave.

623
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,204
Of course he was in a nursing home.

624
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,693
Am I smiling like a fool?
'Cause that would be embarrassing.

625
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,783
You look beautiful embarrassed.

626
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,168
Then I'll keep smiling.

627
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:22,064
I should get back to the office.

628
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,650
And I have a murder to solve.

629
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,818
Right.

630
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,614
What do you say
we catch a movie on the weekend?

631
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,409
I'll see what my parental
duties are and give you a call?

632
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:34,994
Sounds good.

633
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,041
Do you remember when Simon

634
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,544
told us that Cole showed up
with a fancy guitar?

635
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,130
Yeah, he wasn't kidding.
A '57 Gibson Les Paul?

636
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,048
It disappeared at the same time.

637
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:49,842
He was killed for guitar?

638
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,219
All we know is, he was killed
with his guitar.

639
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,950
With a '57 Gibson Les Paul.

640
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,471
That's like whacking someone
with the Mona Lisa.

641
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:00,603
I got agents checking out dealers.
See if anyone tried to sell it.

642
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,396
Unless the killer destroyed it.

643
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,968
Killing something like that
would be like killing Altamont

644
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,276
or, "Smells Like Teen Spirit".

645
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,819
You know, the guitar

646
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:12,072
has long been recognized
as an unconscious symbol of copulation.

647
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,533
The head and the shaft are phallic,

648
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:15,951
the body feminine.

649
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,685
Maybe our killer was acting
out of sexual confusion.

650
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,624
Or maybe someone just wanted the guitar.
Wouldn't you?

651
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,669
Look at this.
I got a hit: dealer in DC

652
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,088
got the guitar, said it was
brought in by a woman

653
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,542
with a pierced eyebrow.

654
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:36,180
Whatever. Jimi Hendrix choked
to death on his own vomit.

655
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,327
The autopsy was inconsistent,
and Hendrix's manager confessed

656
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,363
to shoving pills and red
wine down his throat,

657
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:43,707
hoping to cash in on
an insurance policy.

658
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:45,564
You really know your
rock and roll deaths.

659
00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:47,816
Hi again.
Yeah, I guess I do.

660
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,277
- We need you to come with us.
- What for?

661
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,042
We have some unanswered questions
about Kurt Cobain's death.

662
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,115
Maybe you could
give us some insight.

663
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:56,450
Seriously?!

664
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,577
I believe he was being ironic.

665
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,080
But if you do have information
about this Cobain,

666
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,374
I'm sure the FBI would
appreciate that too.

667
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:05,334
Thanks. 

668
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:09,846
Cole is dead.

669
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,370
- I thought he was missing.
- That why you thought

670
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,344
you'd get away with
selling his guitar?

671
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,026
How much?
That dealer totally ripped me off.

672
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:19,491
Stay on topic, all right?

673
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:24,478
After Dalton's party, I snuck into
Cole's room and took the guitar.

674
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:27,022
It was sitting on the
stand all polished.

675
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,109
He usual kept it filthy. I don't know
why he suddenly gave a crap about it.

676
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,985
- How did you get in?
- I had a key.

677
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:34,488
We hooked up

678
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,884
the first night of camp.

679
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,552
You know, after all the
loser musicians I dated,

680
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,954
I thought I finally found
a decent guy, but...

681
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,046
What happened?

682
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:45,859
Cole told me that he was planning

683
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,694
on sleeping with every woman at camp

684
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,045
as part of his own "rock
and roll fantasy".

685
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:54,425
He thanked me
for being such low-hanging fruit.

686
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,593
You killed him and
you stole his guitar.

687
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:59,773
He was a poseur.
He didn't deserve that guitar.

688
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:01,975
I know it was wrong to take it,

689
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,089
but I swear to God,
I didn't kill him.

690
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,967
I believe her.

691
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,401
Me, too. Too bad she's going
to prison for grand theft.

692
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,695
- Then who killed Cole?
- Everything that

693
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,856
you've learned about
the victim indicates

694
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,226
that he was interested
in the external signifiers

695
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,993
of the rock and roll, right?

696
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,412
Yes, the clothes,
the instruments, the groupers.

697
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,830
Groupies, Bones.

698
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,541
Groupers would be more logical.
Male groupers

699
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,697
have harems of multiple females.

700
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:31,703
If you enter into a social contract

701
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:34,047
with a marine biologist,
you should know these things.

702
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,509
- A fish can't play the guitar.
- Apparently, neither could Cole.

703
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,554
- Don'tbringing up Catherine.
- You're welcome to bring up Andrew.

704
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,034
I have an opinion on motive,
if anyone's interested.

705
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,159
Right.

706
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:45,517
To a true music fan,

707
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,529
the fact that Richard Cole was
playing the ultimate guitar

708
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:50,898
would be sacrilegious,
profane, even.

709
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,483
And the fact that the killer

710
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,995
put it back in Cole's room,
rather than destroy it,

711
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,286
further demonstrates his
reverence for rock and roll.

712
00:35:57,411 --> 00:35:59,502
So, you're saying that
the music is the motive.

713
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,911
I know it's wrong, but I am liking
our killer better than our victim.

714
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,168
This is gorgeous.

715
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,548
I wish my dad was here.

716
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,476
No prints other than
those of the dealer.

717
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:20,649
The killer did an
excellent cleaning job.

718
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,983
Take it apart.
See if he missed anything.

719
00:36:25,907 --> 00:36:27,995
I'm not going to watch that.

720
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,163
I'll do it in the Ookey Room.

721
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,105
Arastoo, little help here?

722
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,063
Will you excuse me?

723
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:45,112
Dr. Lidner left a
message at the house.

724
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:47,611
Was there anything
wrong with your tests?

725
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,018
He was confirming your
date for Saturday night.

726
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:54,294
That.
I was going to tell you...

727
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,129
You're dating my gynecologist?

728
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,215
It wasn't my fault.
It just happened.

729
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,127
What?

730
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,242
Think about what you'd say
if I said that to you.

731
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:05,033
I'd ground you.
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,974
We had lunch. We liked each other.

733
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,308
That's all.

734
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,603
And that was wrong.
Very, very wrong.

735
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,147
Is that why you sent me to him?
Get a date?

736
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,650
You haven't seen anyone
since I'm with you.

737
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,777
He's a good doctor. That's all.

738
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,612
Who just happens to be cute.

739
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,823
Yes. No. God.

740
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,867
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you trust me?

741
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,493
You have to sneak around?

742
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,954
No. Wait.
How did we switch roles here?

743
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,748
I can't go back to him now.
That would be extremely skeevy.

744
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,002
We just had lunch. I swear.
I will never see him again. I promise.

745
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,504
- Yes, you will.
- What?

746
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:40,299
You've been so focused
on being a good mother

747
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,092
that you've totally
ignored yourself.

748
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,686
Do you know what kind of
pressure that puts on me?

749
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,513
No, I didn't realize.

750
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,521
You need a life... for my sake.

751
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,184
But don't sneak
around behind my back.

752
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,063
You two seem like a good fit.
Have a little fun.

753
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,572
But don't go too fast.

754
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:58,692
- You're out of practice.
- Excuse me?

755
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,169
I thought you believed in honesty.

756
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,427
All right.

757
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:04,261
I'll go slow.

758
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,158
Very, very slow.

759
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,695
And find me a new doctor...
a woman.

760
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,892
Sure. Right away.

761
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,135
I've got to get back to school.

762
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:16,293
Love you.

763
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,108
Love you, too.

764
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,520
What do you have, Dr. Hodgins?
Anything? A walk? A single?

765
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,122
Don't strike out, please.

766
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:36,768
Mr. Vaziri, your obsession

767
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,758
with sport will diminish
your mental acuity.

768
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:42,229
On the contrary, baseballs a game
built on mathematical certainty,

769
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,987
the physics of force, as well

770
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,999
as its significance as being one

771
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,479
of the unifying cultural
traditions for Americans.

772
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,739
Intellectually, it's quite stimulating,
and, I like swinging a bat.

773
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,623
- Okay, this fret is cracked.
- What, from impact?

774
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,696
The cracks are tiny.

775
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:02,381
Yeah, you know, every fret in
the lower register is cracked.

776
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:04,817
- The guitar is old.
- But that doesn't matter.

777
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,302
This is from chlorine.
The frets are made out of nickel,

778
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,013
and nickel reacts like this
when exposed to chlorine.

779
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,140
There's a rooftop pool at the hotel.

780
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,311
If Cole was, the killer might have
cleaned the guitar with pure chlorine.

781
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,148
- That's why it was so clean.
- The strings are made out of nickel.

782
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,669
Yeah, but they're brand-new.

783
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,671
I mean, there's no cracking.

784
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,614
The killer must have known
he couldn't get all the blood off.

785
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,645
If the killer restrung the guitar,
then maybe he left us a little present.

786
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,044
Bingo.

787
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,874
Is that a hair?

788
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:41,833
Yes, it is.

789
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,798
- Purple.
- I think I know whose that is.

790
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,634
Someone who would kill
to play with Erik Dalton.

791
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,125
I believe we would
call this a home run.

792
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:02,088
Guess what kind of
pick Bebe said Gino uses.

793
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:03,789
Woolly mammoth?

794
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,081
Yeah, rock and roll!

795
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,990
Come on! I love it!

796
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,123
- I couldn't let the poser play with it.
- Go ahead.

797
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:02,647
- It was worth it.
- I'm sure it was.

798
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:04,294
Come on.

799
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,651
You know, our killer plays
a mean guitar.

800
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,021
I'm sure that they have
a band in prison for him.

801
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:22,656
- You're a very good singer.
- Thank you, Bones.

802
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,299
And you play the guitar
in a very interesting fashion.

803
00:41:25,742 --> 00:41:27,442
I know.
Does Catherine play?

804
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,904
I don't know.
Only been out with her twice, Bones.

805
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:34,658
Last night, Andrew gave me
a CD with music he likes.

806
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:37,911
Mix-tape.
Talk about a social contract.

807
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,330
That's what I surmised.

808
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:45,043
Our partnership is
still important to me.

809
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,755
You know that, right?

810
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,824
Sure.

811
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,581
You die for your partner.
That's the way I look at it.

812
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,814
I liked Andrew's taste in music
except for a band called Led Zeppelin.

813
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,275
"Except for a band
called Led Zeppelin"?

814
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,939
 You kidding me? Led Zeppelin is,
like, the best rock and roll band ever.

815
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,074
They had a reunion tour in '07.
I would have killed for those tickets.

816
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:19,346
My publisher offered me tickets,
but when I heard "Zeppelin,"

817
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:20,912
I thought it was for air show.

818
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:23,170
You turned down what probably

819
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:25,876
was the last concert that
Zeppelin would ever play?

820
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,388
- Are you going to kill me?
- You're unbelievable!

821
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,189
It's just a band, Booth.

822
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,649
It's not just a band, okay?
This is Led Zeppelin.

823
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:34,154
I am your partner.

824
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:36,793
You offer your partner
those kind of things.

825
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:39,556
- I didn't know that.
- Offer your partner the tickets.

826
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,078
What's that mean?
