1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,830
Sanders, Dubovich,

2
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,151
check these hot spots
and we're good to go.

3
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:10,760
What's up?

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,263
Pop this wardrobe. Don't want a flare-up
dragging us back out here this weekend.

5
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:28,352
That's a new one on me.

6
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:39,497
Order in successful societies
depends upon enforcible rules.

7
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,828
People can do the right
thing left on their own.

8
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:43,893
History shows otherwise.
A weak government

9
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:45,753
will always spawn mutiny
and rebellion.

10
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,082
You don't believe in human decency
under circumstances?

11
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,831
Not as a means of controlling
a population. That would be anarchy.

12
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,137
I have to say I agree with
the pretty lady on this one.

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,407
Without the strong arm
of the law, we're animals.

14
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,500
Sheriff Gus Abrams,
thank you for coming out here.

15
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,034
What caused the fire?

16
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,061
Well, it could be arson.
The fire boys say

17
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,996
they didn't find any sign
of an accelerant.

18
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,342
The source of the flame
looks like a lit candle.

19
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,718
Was someone killed?

20
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,778
Well, that's why we
asked for you people.

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,368
Is that real, Bones?

22
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:19,548
- Yes.
- I was hoping "no."

23
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,416
The bones were already dry
and de-fleshed prior to the fire.

24
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:26,043
The victim was elderly, female.

25
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,630
Wait, you usually don't say "oh."

26
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:33,092
- It was an indication of my surprise.
- Well, I know that, but why?

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,313
- The bones have been re-articulated.
- Is that bad?

28
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:39,688
The skeleton has been reassembled,
quite amateurishly.

29
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,778
See how the right ulna has been
placed with the left radius?

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,104
Yeah, shoddy.
That's shoddy work.

31
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,347
Hodgins noticed that there's a path
all the way around the house

32
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,528
And Angela noticed
that it was a circle.

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,530
Looks like it acted as a firebreak.

34
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:57,742
Also dusted with some fine powder.

35
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:05,291
Those are crows.
You city people may not be familiar.

36
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,674
Crows are carrion birds, Sheriff.
They scavenge for fresh kill.

37
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,676
When she starts flapping
her elbows like that,

38
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,069
she's hot on the trail
for something.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,888
Well, I don't want to think
about what she's after.

40
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:46,791
- Don't say it.
- I've got to.

41
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,418
"We aren't in Kansas anymore."

42
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,923
I don't like it when dead things move.
Did you see that?

43
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,550
It was moving there.

44
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:05,381
Who do you want to start with?
The Wicked Witch of the East over here?

45
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,422
East, right?

46
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,479
Right, she wore the red shoes.

47
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,981
We should start
with the more recent remains.

48
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,634
Which are sealed up.

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,070
What is it with this job and corpses
encased in mystery wrap?

50
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,740
Dr. Hodgins says it's most likely
polystyrene ceiling insulation

51
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,450
that melted and coated the body.

52
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:23,135
Could he explain the sparkle?

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,348
Fluorescent bulbs exploded afterward,
shattering over the polystyrene.

54
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,948
Perhaps you and Dr. Hodgins
can find a way to unseal the remains.

55
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,603
Let me see if I can get in here.

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,425
Wire ligatures around the wrists
indicate foul play.

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,326
No evidence of smoke inhalation.
She was dead before the fire.

58
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:46,642
Now... that one is just weird.

59
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,506
These bones were
found in a sealed wardrobe.

60
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,431
It preserved her in fire.

61
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,565
Female, also Caucasian.

62
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,577
40 to 50 years old.

63
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,587
There's evidence of spinal kyphosis,

64
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,738
which would have given her
a hunched posture.

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,742
This stain, here on the forehead,
is the result of contact with copper.

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,834
I've seen this before
in disinterred bodies

67
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,181
because of the copper hardware
on coffins.

68
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:11,619
So, somebody robbed a grave,
strung together a skeleton

69
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,419
and stuck it in a wedding dress?

70
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,006
- That's a reasonable conclusion.
- These are greenstick fractures.

71
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,092
Extreme force
was applied to the chest.

72
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:21,343
And...

73
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:25,222
there's a clean-edged
indentation of the spinous processes,

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
L-2 and L-3.

75
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,517
Thoracic crushing, combined

76
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,261
with the puncture wound.

77
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,590
This woman was subjected
to a kind of torture

78
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,399
that was used in the 17th century.

79
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,376
Torture?

80
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,762
These injuries are consistent
with a form of punishment

81
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,114
used during the Salem Witch Trials.

82
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,011
She was a witch?

83
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,336

86
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,680
You know what I think?
I think Cam sent us both

87
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,407
to the crime scene because
of the tension between us.

88
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,785
"Tension"? There's
no tension between us.

89
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,274
Yeah, at first I thought it was
because I'm suddenly...

90
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,135
I don't know, available again.

91
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,258
And...

92
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:36,877
then I thought maybe it was because
you think that I treated Wendell badly.

93
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,848
Hold on. Wendell said
that it was totally mutual.

94
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,139
- He said that you were wonderful.
- I'm not sure

95
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,134
how I feel about you two
discussing me.

96
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:47,012
Not "discussing" you.
Complimenting you.

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,348
Okay, fine.

98
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,392
No more compliments.

99
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,435
You don't look good today.

100
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:57,473
Your smile is ordinary at best,
and it is not cool that we finally

101
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:59,817
get to work together
again in the field.

102
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,410
Okay, that's fine.

103
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,238
I can live with that.

104
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,825
Yeah, this symbol
is very creepy on this chimney.

105
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,326
All right, let me see.

106
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,873
- See?
- Yeah. It could be a lot of things.

107
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,355
What is that?

108
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:25,175
The Prius helps you stay
in your lane.

109
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,062
- That's kind of cool.
- It is cool.

110
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,470
Let's do that again.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,108
- That is not cool.
- I didn't even see him there.

112
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,265
He's pretty sneaky.
Pull over.

113
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,473
I'll pour on the charm.

114
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,452
It's Sheriff Abrams
from the crime scene.

115
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,546
Perfect.

116
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:56,023
Good afternoon, sir. I observed you
crossing the double-yellow.

117
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,834
- How much have you had to drink today?
- Sheriff Abrams, it's us.

118
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,471
We just left the crime scene.

119
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,797
We're heading up north to
drop off our stuff at the lab.

120
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,409
I know, Dr. Hodgins.
I'm just following the law.

121
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,569
Have you had anything
to drink today?

122
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,387
Listen,

123
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,235
I really do like a man in uniform
who loves his job.

124
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,937
So, neither one of us
has had anything to drink. No.

125
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,823
Hello, Ms. Montenegro.

126
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,025
But I'm afraid I need
the driver to respond.

127
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,774
Yeah, I've had several martinis,
some absinthe and a barrel of mead.

128
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,906
License and registration, please.

129
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,249
He was kidding.

130
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,334
He's just being an idiot.

131
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,828
You, too, please.

132
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,810
A real Salem witch?

133
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,971
- That's awesome!
- Relax. Simmer down.

134
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,215
The strontium isotope results
verify Massachusetts.

135
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,584
- Can I see it?
- What's the big deal?

136
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,206
My first published work concerned
the collective sociopathology

137
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,941
behind the Salem Witch Trials.

138
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,843
- I'm a leading expert.
- Shrinkery meets witchery.

139
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:00,271
Your head's probably
about ready to explode?

140
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,316
It's a completely acceptable
arena of study, even for a psychologist.

141
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:07,044
Thank you.
At last, I feel validated.

142
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,497
Most cultures believe that some sort

143
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,775
of supernatural power can be
elicited through ritual.

144
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,280
Like, you going to church.

145
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,453
At least I don't
ride there on my broomstick.

146
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,872
Most witches align themselves
with the Wiccans,

147
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,834
but witchcraft is an extremely
heterogeneous subject

148
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,028
which encompasses the dark arts

149
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,063
like evil spells, sacrifices...

150
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,716
So you're saying this creepy, old witch
came from the dead to kill this victim?

151
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,645
Of course not,
but we are talking about

152
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,089
a three-century-year-old body
that was rearticulated

153
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,517
and costumed as a virgin,
are we not, Dr. Brennan?

154
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,862
Well, given that women
in those times

155
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,481
were expected to be virgins on
their wedding days, that's reasonable.

156
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,191
I want to work on the case.

157
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,277
What are you going to do,
cast a spell?

158
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,930
I want to see if I could find
a link between the old witch

159
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:52,356
and the new witch.

160
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,640
Go for it.

161
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,727
There's no evidence that
the other as a witch.

162
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,592
Aside from the fact
that she was wearing

163
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,049
red slippers and her feet
curled up after she was dead.

164
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:00,998
What?

165
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:03,486
There's a completely scientific
explanation for it.

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,469
Cheri Byrd.

167
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:08,064
That creepy house belonged
to a woman by the name

168
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:10,926
of Cheri Byrd, and she has
a surviving brother.

169
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,973
Are you sure it's Cheri?

170
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,093
Dental records confirm her identity.

171
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,729
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

172
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,864
Two, three months ago.

173
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,609
Someone made an offer on the house.

174
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,761
Our grandfather left it to us both.

175
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,006
 I wanted to sell.
She refused.

176
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,115
We haven't spoken since.

177
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,451
You don't seem too surprised
that she's dead.

178
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,247
Cheri and I used to be really close.

179
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:43,274
You know, but, last ten years,

180
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,357
she got into some
really... weird stuff.

181
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,711
Witchcraft?

182
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:55,628
Started ordering us to call her
Zephyra.

183
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,181
I told her I wouldn't.
Thought it was stupid.

184
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,267
The fact that she didn't sell the house,
didn't get you upset or angry?

185
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,613
No, I didn't care about the money.

186
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,884
I wanted her to move to the city.

187
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:13,237
Thought her mind might go back to normal
if she saw more people.

188
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,656
- Who wanted to buy the house?
- Guy named Mario

189
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,958
Trivisini, Trivisonno...

190
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,592
Making some big development.

191
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:22,996
Said Cheri's place was the key.

192
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,322
"The key," why?

193
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:25,666
Lake access.

194
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,884
When Cheri said "no",
he had to give up on the whole project.

195
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,932
You're not Hodgins.

196
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,017
He's not here
and I can't wait any longer.

197
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,061
- Wait for what?
- Dr. Brennan

198
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,845
 wants me
to identify the best solvent

199
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,148
to remove polystyrene

200
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,942
from the bones.
So I put myself

201
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,860
in the mindset of Dr. Hodgins

202
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,361
and came up with...

203
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,072
this experiment.

204
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,738
I have a new appreciation
for Dr. Hodgins.

205
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:09,251
This device slowly fills
each polystyrene cup up

206
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,983
with kerosene, propylene,
turpentine,

207
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:13,714
hydrochloric acid and...

208
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,009
acetone.

209
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:25,976
Acetone.

210
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,140
It's not like Hodgins to be late.

211
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,871
Can you come get me
as soon as he shows up?

212
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:42,242
And I think the acetone
is eating through your shoes.

213
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:43,577
What?

214
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,417
I love these shoes.

215
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,403
We live in a fascist state.

216
00:11:58,604 --> 00:11:59,926
If you know that,

217
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:02,007
then why did you taunt
the guy with the gun?

218
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,097
You expect me to just roll over?

219
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,642
Praying that you do, though.

220
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:09,644
Here he comes.
Listen,

221
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,120
be nice, or I will
cause you great pain.

222
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,110
Have we cleared this up, Officer?

223
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,568
Not quite.
Now,

224
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,050
the problem is
that Miss Montenegro here is a criminal.

225
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,948
I found an outstanding bench
warrant on you, young lady.

226
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:24,034
What?

227
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,535
For what?

228
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,413
For defying a notice to appear
on a speeding charge.

229
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,458
That? I didn't speed.

230
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,628
But you did defy a bench warrant,
which is worse than speeding.

231
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,630
And Dr. Hodgins, you also

232
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,799
have a warrant
for escaping police custody

233
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,427
during a Freedom of Information
protest eight years ago.

234
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,223
They have a right to know.

235
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,120
But not a right to run away.

236
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,672
Okay. All right, listen.

237
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,039
I will appear,
and Hodgins will surrender

238
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:54,519
as soon as we get back.

239
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:55,690
Word of honor.

240
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,592
It's not up to me.

241
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,278
I can't let you go until the
judge rules on your warrants.

242
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,696
When will that be?

243
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,346
Whenever one shows up.

244
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,534
In the meantime, I suggest

245
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,911
you two make the best of things,

246
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,584
the best you can.

247
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:17,587
Speeding?

248
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,049
Don't you dare.

249
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,810
So, thanks so much for coming in there,
Mr. Trivisi...?

250
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,510
- Trivisonno. Trivisonno Properties.
- Right.

251
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:39,317
So, this is something new for me
to be called in by the FBI.

252
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,346
What's this all about?

253
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,985
Yeah. I know this house.

254
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,246
Bet you get a good deal on that now.

255
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,706
Yeah. Why is that?

256
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,421
You don't know where
I'm going with this, pal?

257
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,214
Maybe it was your aunt
that lived there?

258
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,375
You're thinking
I want to buy the place now?

259
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,679
No way. I learned my lesson.

260
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,556
What do you mean by that?

261
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:11,595
You see me now?

262
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,227
You see me there?

263
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:19,649
- See the difference?
- Yeah. You shaved your head.

264
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,469
I did not shave my head.

265
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,322
Your aunt put a curse on me,

266
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,531
and all the hairs fell off my body.

267
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,699
All the important ones.

268
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,188
First of all, Cheri Byrd is not my aunt.
And secondly,

269
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,411
she's dead.

270
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:35,749
Here's hoping a curse loses its oomph
after the voodoo lady dies.

271
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,747
Apparently, she was murdered,
so, you want to know what I'm thinking?

272
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:42,672
Guy thinks he's cursed,
he loses his hair, he wants her dead.

273
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,358
No, you couldn't get me
anywhere near that lady.

274
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,093
Not to kill her, not for anything.

275
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,387
She painted this symbol
on the bricks

276
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,147
on the chimney and inside,
there was all this spooky stuff.

277
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,663
Black candles.

278
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,855
The day she cursed me, a dead cat
was laid out on the dining room table.

279
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,732
- You ditched the project?
- A month ago.

280
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,034
I'm a professional.
You think I need it to get around

281
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,217
an evil witch lived
on the development?

282
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:06,738
I know when to cut and run.

283
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:10,997
Just wish
I'd done it a week earlier.

284
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,447
Hodgins isn't back yet?

285
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,844
No, but I've made some progress.

286
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,379
I found this.

287
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,554
Sharp instrument trauma
on the xiphoid press of the sternum.

288
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,721
And anteriomedial aspect of ribs 1
and 4 bilaterally.

289
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,212
She was stabbed repeatedly.

290
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,712
Make casts to analyze the striations

291
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,191
and kerf characteristics
to determine the weapon.

292
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,055
I also

293
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,581
found this on the manubrium.

294
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:49,573
What is it?

295
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,207
That's a Dr. Hodgins' job.

296
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:52,988
If we had him...

297
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,119
which we don't.

298
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,704
You haven't heard from him?

299
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,194
He and Angela never came back.
And since they used to be intimates,

300
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,277
I decided not to push it
because that's none of my concern.

301
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,295
None at all.

302
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,338
- It's a little icky.
- It's not like them

303
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,799
to just disappear,
something could be wrong.

304
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,985
- It's ringing.
- Tell them we've got the evidence

305
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,888
from the crime scene.
They'll get us out.

306
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,026
Yeah, hi.

307
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,438
And Hodgins. Help!

308
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,690
- Where are you?
- <i>We're in Berryville.</i>

309
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,276
Maryland, we're in jail.

310
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:28,570
Why are you in jail?

311
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,745
Well, it goes a little like this:

312
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:33,992
Hodgins got pulled over
for driving like an old lady.

313
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,578
Yeah, and Angela
had an outstanding bench warrant.

314
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,384
<i>You have a warrant, too, Mr. Clean.</i>

315
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:40,560
Where is the evidence
you collected yesterday?

316
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,584
- <i>It's in jail with us.</i>
- <i>We're stuck here</i>

317
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,046
until the judge shows up to set our bail
and who knows when that's going to be.

318
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,882
Well, we need that evidence.
I'll tell Cam to come and get you.

319
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,267
Okay, also...

320
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,093
Will you tell Clark to throw

321
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,138
<i>a blanket over my molting swallowtail
caterpillars at 4:30</i>

322
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,550
or they will die.

323
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,608
I'm afraid we might have
to check out a little early there, pal.

324
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,006
I hope that's okay.

325
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,987
That sheriff out in Podunk
was a decent guy.

326
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,823
I'm sure Hodgins getting
arrested for really good reason.

327
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,784
So, I've been thinking
about dead cats.

328
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,536
That doesn't seem like
a good use of your time.

329
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,634
Witches, the bad kind,

330
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,542
use animal sacrifices in their spells.
Black cats are particularly meaningful.

331
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,062
I told Sweets that
the developer saw a dead cat

332
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,464
on the victim's dining room table
before he went bald.

333
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,300
- What's the connection?
- He thinks that she put a spell on him.

334
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,845
- You should talk to their local coven.
- Wait a second. There's a local coven?

335
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,373
The Circle of Moonwick.

336
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:40,141
You said that Wiccans were good,
whereas the victim was bad.

337
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,560
They're probably competing
for the same eye of newt.

338
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,064
No, Wiccan ceremonies honor nature

339
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,023
and the sanctity of life
above all else.

340
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,401
- They don't use eye of newt.
- Okay, tonight is

341
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,241
their Waning Moon ceremony.
Now.

342
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:54,565
I logged into their Web site,
using the name Lilith82.

343
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:56,825
I got directions.

344
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,355
Witches have Web sites?
Gotta love the Internet.

345
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:03,248
- So, witch hunt tonight?
- All right.

346
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,633
If you bring the candles,
I'll bring the broomstick.

347
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:10,588
This is the hardest bench
that I have ever sat on in my life.

348
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,765
Sat on?

349
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:13,717
Slept on.

350
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,468
My shoulders are killing me.

351
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,897
Tell me about it.

352
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:20,652
Come here.

353
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,142
Why?

354
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,811
I'll give you a little rub.
You know, work out the kinks.

355
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,817
Are you really that mad at me
that you don't want a little massage?

356
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,297
Only because I hurt.

357
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:53,840
Yes, down, down.

358
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,635
A little lower. Lower.

359
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,227
Thank you, God.

360
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,119
"God" is a little formal.

361
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,352
Hodgins is fine.

362
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,073
Looks to me like, you two are doing
just fine in here.

363
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:25,726
Did you spring us?

364
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:29,292
These two aren't Bonnie and Clyde.
Can't you let them go?

365
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,710
Not until the judge.

366
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,631
I'll post bail, pay the fine, whatever.
We need them to solve this murder.

367
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,126
You have the evidence.

368
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:38,426
They can be reached here
any time to assist.

369
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,804
Don't you think
you're being a little...

370
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:42,377
rigid?

371
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,767
You are a law enforcement
professional,

372
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,041
- are you not, madam?
- Yes, but...

373
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,847
Well, then you know

374
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,480
the law can't be twisted to our will

375
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,275
or chaos will ensue.

376
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,568
Where does it end?

377
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,738
Today, a seemingly
minor bench warrant, tomorrow

378
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,340
we overlook another piece of paper

379
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,451
and a murderer goes free.

380
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,875
You are like
the last upright man in America.

381
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,697
Well, I wouldn't say that.

382
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:15,166
But I'm a good sheriff

383
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:17,215
And I love the law.

384
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,322
That's very impressive, Sheriff.

385
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,471
My God, he's getting to her.

386
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,975
I'm sure the judge
will be coming soon.

387
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,643
No, no, you're kidding, right?

388
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,092
Sorry. It was like arguing
with one of the Founding Fathers.

389
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,726
I've got the evidence.
We'll talk, okay?

390
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,067
- My God.
- No.

391
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,247
See you guys later.

392
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,366
Could you not walk so loudly?

393
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,784
Don't tell me that
you're afraid of witches.

394
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:50,304
Wiccans, and no,

395
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,084
but why waste an opportunity
to observe them when they don't know

396
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,295
- they're being observed?
- Want to spy on witches?

397
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,171
Wiccans.
No, I want you to spy on them,

398
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:00,872
while I study them
anthropologically.

399
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,088
Ground zero.

400
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:16,900
Fascinating.

401
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,286
What are they doing with
that <i>Blair Witch</i> thingy?

402
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,025
It's a miniature effigy.

403
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:05,482
Okay, why is it
when things like this happen,

404
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,952
it always happens to people
you don't want to see naked?

405
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:20,896
Okay, so we have...

406
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:22,914
Rowan and Eden, right?

407
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,550
- Ember.
- Ember. Exactly.

408
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:27,283
We'll give you
the names society assigned to us,

409
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,263
but not while in the Sacred Grove.

410
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,255
Okay, dancing naked is okay,
but Christian names are forbidden.

411
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,363
- Got it.
- We weren't doing anything wrong.

412
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,938
Why are you disrupting
a religious service?

413
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,023
You know what happened to Zephyra?

414
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,193
Is this by any chance
a totem representing her?

415
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,697
We were marking
the end of Zephyra's corporeal life.

416
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,934
Celebrating the unification
of her spirit with the elements.

417
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,280
Why would you do that?

418
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:52,203
Unless she was a member
of your coven.

419
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:53,955
She was not one of us.

420
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,332
- A bad witch.
- Sadly,

421
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,706
Zephyra performed magic for profit.

422
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:00,670
She was known to use human relics.

423
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,453
Such as the body of a Salem witch?

424
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:04,517
I don't know
where she would get that,

425
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:07,522
but that would be an immensely
powerful relic, yes.

426
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,388
So she has other clients.
We're gonna have to talk to them.

427
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,640
The dark arts are fragile,

428
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,975
Agent Booth.

429
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,353
Zephyra's clients employed her
to do evil.

430
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,939
Bad people getting other bad people
to do bad things.

431
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:28,646
What's that?

432
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,744
Fragments of the hyoid
and the throat cartilage.

433
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,318
Some of the smaller bones were
broken when the house collapsed.

434
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:36,807
They're very difficult to clean.
I may need to go back in with acetone.

435
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,167
Well, it's time to multi-task.

436
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,830
I have the evidence Angela
and Hodgins gathered from the scene.

437
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,257
I thought your intention
was to bring back Hodgins and Angela.

438
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,863
They had to wait for the judge,

439
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:50,623
and you can't bend the law
to help your friends.

440
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:53,737
We're going to do this without them.

441
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:56,174
They can coach us
and consult, but, yeah,

442
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,310
it's you and me.

443
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,478
So you expect me to deal with dirt.

444
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,483
Great.

445
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:08,274
Close, but now I'm up 18 cents.

446
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:09,528
Yeah, for now.

447
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:13,704
Nice!

448
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,811
Only 17.

449
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:20,812
Do you realize how long it's been since
we've spent this much time together?

450
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,342
Outside the lab, I mean?

451
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,088
Yeah, I know. God.

452
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,490
I keep thinking about

453
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:30,635
that crappy cabin
that we stayed in in the mountains.

454
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,001
Do you remember that?

455
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,365
30 degrees, there was no heat.

456
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,103
Man, this jail is way better
than that cabin.

457
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,809
That was a good weekend, though.

458
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:44,418
Keeping warm.

459
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,941
Your lab called.

460
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:56,171
This computer may not be
state-of-the-art,

461
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,579
- but we got the Internets.
- Sure.

462
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,624
Let's, throw some coal
in that thing and fire it up.

463
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,693
Cheri Byrd was a dark witch,
perhaps even a Satanist.

464
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:11,008
The Wiccans really seemed afraid of her.
What is this?

465
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,362
I found the transcripts
of the Salem Witch Trials.

466
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,055
I thought maybe we could identify

467
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,661
the remains that Cheri Byrd
dressed up in the wedding dress.

468
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:21,644
"Prudence Sullivan, female.
48 years of age, of small stature

469
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,605
"with back bent as though burdened
by great

470
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,399
- weight of guilt"?
- "Guilt."

471
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,782
It sort of matches
Dr. Brennan's description, right?

472
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,603
"Old, short, hunched over."

473
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,196
Sounds like every other witch.

474
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,532
No, no, that's a stereotype.
48 is old?

475
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,326
Well, it was back then.
I can't believe you got all this stuff.

476
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,890
Okay, trust me,

477
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,351
a Salem witch doesn't just
show up in Maryland.

478
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:42,999
Her grave was robbed for a reason.

479
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,673
I know my witches, all right?

480
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:46,234
- Sorry.
- Just put it down.

481
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,729
Relax. Slow down. Just sit.

482
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:49,934
I did so...

483
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,257
so much reading.

484
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,428
Nice cell.

485
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,763
<i>It's not much, but we call it home.</i>

486
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,599
We're thinking
of redoing the kitchen.

487
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,976
Okay, it's amber. It melts

488
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,978
at 400 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit...

489
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,230
temperatures easily
reached in the fire.

490
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:07,607
Is that a bug?

491
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:10,067
Oh, yeah, baby.

492
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,819
Check out those tibial bristles.

493
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,202
<i>There's plenty of room in here, Sheriff,
if you want to join us.</i>

494
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,212
That's against regulations.

495
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,735
You can verify
with the Entomology Department,

496
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,083
but I'm fairly certain
we're looking at

497
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,869
Nedocosia naiba.

498
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:29,522
It's a fungus gnat.

499
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,964
- Does that help with time of death?
- No.

500
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,969
<i>This gnat would have had his last</i>

501
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:36,328
<i>fungus about a hundred
million years ago</i>

502
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,762
<i>in the Lower Cretaceous.</i>

503
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:39,731
So, if we remove the DNA,

504
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,641
we could re-create dinosaurs, right?

505
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,001
It was probably an amber pendant

506
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,833
from an ordinary piece of jewelry.

507
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,305
What's with the hair?

508
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,665
- What hair?
- <i>Yeah, she's right.</i>

509
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,798
<i>Check out the speck at 3:00 o'clock.</i>

510
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:56,489
<i>The amber probably picked up a piece
of hair when it melted in the fire.</i>

511
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:58,946
But our victim's hair
was gray and wavy.

512
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:00,781
<i>But this one is dark.</i>

513
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,249
If the root bulb's present,

514
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,683
it could indicate that
the hair was forcibly removed.

515
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,451
So it could be from the perp.

516
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,480
I'm sorry. Caught up in
the thrill of the chase.

517
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:11,810
<i>I'll run DNA.</i>

518
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,444
So how are you guys doing?

519
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,547
<i>I mean, we'd like to get out of here,
if that's what you mean.</i>

520
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,838
I'm sure you will. Thanks, guys.

521
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,526
The hair in the amber gave us a hit.

522
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:32,037
CODIS says it belongs

523
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:34,314
to one Murray Huddler,

524
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,632
convicted of assault in 2008,

525
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:38,054
paroled last October.

526
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,763
Now this may possibly
go towards motive.

527
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:44,081
It certainly goes toward
"creepy coincidence."

528
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,829
"Dumped Hubby Decks Attorney."

529
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,149
So this man was incarcerated

530
00:27:49,274 --> 00:27:51,251
for assaulting his
ex-wife's attorney?

531
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,820
Huddler's wife dumped him,
hosed him in a divorce,

532
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:56,922
then married the lawyer
that represented her. But look at this.

533
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,116
Anything look familiar to you?

534
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,045
She's wearing this dress. 

535
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,326
Murray Huddler.

536
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,626
You know a woman by the
name of Cheri Byrd?

537
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:22,658
How about a witch named Zephyra?

538
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,828
- I'll take that as a yes.
- I hired her.

539
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,923
- Hired her for...?
- To put a hex

540
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,910
on my bitch ex-wife, okay?

541
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,519
- Is that illegal?
- Zephyra's dead.

542
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,546
She was murdered, house torched.

543
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,149
- You think I did it?
- I don't know.

544
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:40,718
Depends how much you
paid for the hex.

545
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:43,512
Two grand up front.
Three if it took.

546
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,140
- Did it take?
- No, it did not take.

547
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:49,310
I'm thinking you killed Zephyra,
and in the struggle,

548
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,208
- she yanked out some of your hair.
- No, I gave her my hair

549
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,405
for the spell.

550
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,358
That and my ex-wife's wedding dress.

551
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,873
Right. We found that in your truck.

552
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:01,822
That's not what you think it is.

553
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:03,908
I went fishing on Friday.

554
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:05,148
Fishing?

555
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:07,818
But you know if this blade
matches the stab marks

556
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,634
on Cheri Byrd's bones,
that could spell trouble for you.

557
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:14,258
Huddler's fishing knife is thin,

558
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,087
very sharp on one edge,

559
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,247
and has a slight curve at the tip.

560
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:21,766
The blade that made these cuts
is thicker, evenly tapered

561
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,235
and sharp on both edges,
like a dagger.

562
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:26,013
Definitely not a match.

563
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:27,786
What's this?

564
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:30,013
Fragments of the hyoid
and throat cartilage,

565
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,995
damaged by a fire and
crushed by a house.

566
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,979
- The acetone didn't help.
- These bones

567
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,687
certainly resemble the hyoid

568
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:38,317
and surrounding cartilage,
but not all of these are human.

569
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,485
What?

570
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,482
Okay, is this whole witchy thing
about to get creepier?

571
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:48,619
<i>This looks like part
of a tiny joint.</i>

572
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,914
<i>I believe these bones are the incomplete
skeleton of a small animal.</i>

573
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,162
What do you think?

574
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:56,420
<i>A little outside my expertise,
but they look like bat bones to me.</i>

575
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:58,385
<i>You missed that, Clark?</i>

576
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:00,775
Clark's error is
completely understandable,

577
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,634
given the condition of these remains

578
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,790
and the bizarre nature
of these circumstances.

579
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,470
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

580
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,910
<i>But I made the
call on a piece-of-crap</i>

581
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:12,099
<i>cathode-ray tube while in jail.</i>

582
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,769
That's right: you're a criminal.

583
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:15,438
Are we thinking a woman

584
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,232
had a bat shoved down her throat?

585
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,276
Yes, that's exactly what happened.

586
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,820
- Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.
- <i>What?</i>

587
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:34,364
Another round?

588
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:36,762
Really? You sure?

589
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:38,919
You're down 31 cents.

590
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,214
32.

591
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,018
What?

592
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:57,180
Do you ever wonder
what happened to us...

593
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,316
on the day we broke up?

594
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,444
Every day.

595
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,658
I run through that
conversation word for word.

596
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,045
Me, too.

597
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:15,108
You said, "All you had
to do was trust me."

598
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:20,414
And you said, "Hey,
you're the one who's leaving."

599
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:24,715
And then you said, "You're the one
who isn't stopping me."

600
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,218
And I left.

601
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,595
Right.
Well, I wish I hadn't.

602
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,309
The biggest regret of my life
is I didn't stop you.

603
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,110
What was up with that?

604
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:39,993
I panicked.

605
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,554
I lost faith that I could

606
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,692
sustain that kind of happiness.

607
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,371
- You talk to Sweets?
- Kid's got the goods.

608
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,691
It was like we were both
playing chicken, and then we...

609
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:52,952
we both swerved.

610
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:56,038
What we should have done is
crashed right into each other.

611
00:31:57,486 --> 00:31:58,900
At the speed of light.

612
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:11,912
The judge is here.

613
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,668
- The judge is a barber.
- Keeps me grounded.

614
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:19,478
It's against the rules for prisoners

615
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,897
to fraternize sexually
while in custody.

616
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,983
Maybe give it a rest, Gus?

617
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:26,193
Let's get you two out of here.

618
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,448
- Bat bones?
- A Myotis albescens.

619
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,710
Not indigenous to the United States,
but the bones are available online.

620
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,421
Like everything else.
I'll look.

621
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,949
So, I think I've identified
our skeleton bride.

622
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:51,162
- Look at that!
- You identified human remains?

623
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:53,861
Dr. Brennan, you said that
the woman was subjected

624
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,848
to a form of torture known
as "pressing".

625
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:57,465
Yes. That's how I surmised

626
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,852
we were dealing with the
remains of a Salem witch.

627
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:03,904
In fact, only one Salem witch
died as a result of pressing.

628
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,357
One female witch
and a 80-year-old man.

629
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,710
You don't care about the old man

630
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:11,779
Emily Quimby died November 1692.

631
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:14,990
Buried in Salem
in unconsecrated ground, of course,

632
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,620
but her grave was
robbed six months ago.

633
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:20,121
You think the victim dug
up the old witch's bones

634
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,581
- to increase her own power?
- Absolutely.

635
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:25,544
This is interesting,
but not pertinent to the case.

636
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:27,921
- Wait for it.
- Wait for it. Here it is.

637
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:31,330
Upon finding Emily Quimby's grave,

638
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,330
I researched her family tree,

639
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:35,583
and there's a 16-generation
remove, but...

640
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,349
- look.
- "Mary Harden Trent."

641
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,725
Direct descendant.

642
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,352
Why is that name familiar?

643
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,773
Mary Harden Trent is a member
of the Circle of Moonwick Coven.

644
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,274
Her witch name is "Ember".

645
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:51,406
Digging up great-grandma is not the
worst motive for murder I've ever heard.

646
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,008
what I'm doing here is releasing
you two on your own recognizance.

647
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,354
Thank you.

648
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:03,388
Yes, we will pay our fines and
make our court appearances.

649
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:04,333
I'm sure.

650
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:07,625
Gus will come after you if you
don't follow the letter of the law.

651
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,179
Let me notarize this stuff
and get you on your way.

652
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,382
Thank you.

653
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,636
How long did he say he'd be gone?

654
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:23,511
Mary Harden Trent.
That is your signature, correct?

655
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,594
Yes, though I prefer
to go by "Ember".

656
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,068
What do you say we step
outside your magic forest,

657
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,445
stay on point, okay?
Our credit card records show

658
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,014
that you purchased bat bones online.

659
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,155
Is that true?

660
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,011
Bat bones are an integral
part of my religion.

661
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:41,412
Did you shove those bat bones down her
throat before or after you stabbed her?

662
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,857
No! No, I swear upon the goddess

663
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,874
that I'm incapable of such violence.

664
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,460
- How tall are you?
- Five-two.

665
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,880
She may be too small to inflict
the injuries that killed our victim.

666
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,342
She may be small,
but she's full of anger.

667
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,468
There.

668
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,180
That is your great-great
something-grandmother Emily Quimby.

669
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,182
She was a witch, too.

670
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,017
And she didn't deserve to die.

671
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,146
What, did you boast to Zephyra
that witchism ran in your family?

672
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,284
Then she dug up your
ancestors' bones to use them

673
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,109
in what you call "dark rites".

674
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:15,154
What are you talking about?
How could anyone do something like that?

675
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,488
I had no idea. 

676
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,633
Dr. Brennan. I finally
got the results back

677
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,702
on the powder
collected on the pathway

678
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:29,460
- around the victim's house.
- The circular path.

679
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,239
Usually the person standing
inside the circle is safe

680
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,507
from the dark forces.
In this case, oddly,

681
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,787
everything inside the
circle was destroyed.

682
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,303
- The powder was...
- Angela isn't here for a computer

683
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,372
re-creation, so we have to make do.

684
00:35:41,497 --> 00:35:43,920
Please hold 1 and 4 in
the proper position.

685
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,117
Sweets, it's bilateral.
Do the same.

686
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,940
Booth believes a witch named
Ember to be the killer,

687
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,989
but the victim was a large
heavily muscled woman.

688
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,725
- Ember wasn't strong enough.
- I observed her in the woods.

689
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,962
She and the other one
were standing in a circle

690
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,694
taking turns with their
ceremonial object.

691
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,176
These stab marks...

692
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:05,808
reflect a similar pattern.

693
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,965
Now these injuries...

694
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,060
are clustered.

695
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:14,521
Five groupings of three.

696
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,309
So a total of 15 strikes.

697
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,933
In the same pattern
as the dots on the chimney.

698
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:20,150
It's a pentagram.

699
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,095
It's an ancient Wiccan symbol
that stands

700
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,982
for solidarity, some say sisterhood.

701
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,018
There are 15 women in
the Circle of Moonwick.

702
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,353
Ember alone wasn't the killer.

703
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,104
The entire coven took part.

704
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,648
They're white witches.

705
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,358
They stand for goodness.

706
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,652
What if they were stoned
out of their minds?

707
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:38,987
The powder on the path is called

708
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,242
Secale cereale: rye flour.

709
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,034
And it's infested with the fungus
Claviceps purpurea.

710
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:46,495
Formed in the ergot stage

711
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,913
of fungal development.

712
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,834
It's hallucinogenic. The natural
substance from which LSD is derived.

713
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,878
It was used for
ceremonial purposes centuries

714
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,046
ago in Salem.

715
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,675
Some people think that the exact
same substance was responsible

716
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,678
for the hysteria surrounding the
Witch Trials in the first place.

717
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,640
- Those naked ladies were trippin'.
- Add that to their rituals,

718
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,433
they may have thought the demon
they were slaying was real.

719
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:16,396
Wiccans do not ingest

720
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:18,777
any kind
of consciousness-altering drugs.

721
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,821
- Not on purpose.
- We believe

722
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,617
you were performing a ritual meant

723
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:25,079
to keep Zephyra's evil from
spreading past the circle.

724
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:26,660
A ritual using rye flour.

725
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:29,121
We use rye flour in many ceremonies.

726
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,372
And it has LSD fungus in it.

727
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,322
It's what made you afraid of Zephyra.
You thought that her obsession with

728
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:36,962
black arts could destroy you.

729
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,881
You also knew that she had

730
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,332
Ember's ancestor's
bones on her side.

731
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,386
You're good witches.

732
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,014
You're nice. You don't lie,
but when you make a mistake,

733
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,340
you want to make that
mistake right, right?

734
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,810
We were just trying to help.

735
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,441
We wanted Zephyra to live
in harmony, but she kept

736
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,114
cursing at us and casting spells.

737
00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:03,780
We just wanted to
restore the balance.

738
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,003
Dearly beloved,

739
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,464
we're gathered here today
to join in holy wedded matrimony

740
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,251
Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro

741
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,545
and Jack Stanley Hodgins IV.

742
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:20,078
There's...

743
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,382
there's one small problem.

744
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,621
Please don't change your mind.

745
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:27,139
Oh, no. That's not it.

746
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,264
It's...

747
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,779
that's not my real name.

748
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,048
- How bad could it be?
- Yeah, did you get mine?

749
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:38,357
It's Stanley.

750
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:41,360
My dad is,

751
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,430
he's sort of unique,

752
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:46,757
and, he's Texan, and...

753
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,408
other things, so...

754
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:50,828
do you mind if I just,
if I whisper it to you?

755
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,455
- That'll work.
- Thank you.

756
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,131
We are here to wed these two people.

757
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:05,755
Vows?

758
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,170
Vows.

759
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:14,226
Angela...
or whatever your name is...

760
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:18,138
I'm your guy.

761
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:22,252
Stanley...

762
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,434
we're gonna live together
and're gonna love together

763
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:29,704
and we're gonna have so much fun,

764
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:31,947
and a little pain,

765
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:36,641
and we're gonna live a life
that's gonna make other people

766
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:39,356
die with jealousy
wishing they were us.

767
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,243
- Do you have rings?
- Yes.

768
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,361
Where'd you get that?

769
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:54,016
I've kept this in my wallet
since our first wedding.

770
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,810
- What?
- No, we didn't go through with it.

771
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,299
- Where'd you get that?
- I'll tell you later.

772
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,492
You may exchange the rings.

773
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:20,375
By the power vested in me
and the state of Maryland,

774
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,651
I now pronounce you husband
and wife. You may...

775
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,572
They were good.

776
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:53,598
Good people who butchered
another human being.

777
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,099
They were being attacked.
They weren't in their right mind,

778
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,530
and sometimes, people...
they just get carried away.

779
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,384
Crazy people.

780
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,520
What is that?

781
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:08,875
This was given to me by the witches.

782
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:11,306
It's you, Little Bones.

783
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,054
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is, you see?

784
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,226
The witch said that if I burned this

785
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:18,576
in your presence,

786
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,895
then the wish I make
for you will come true.

787
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,732
You think I care, but I don't.

788
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,957
It's just superstition.

789
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,821
And for superstition to work,

790
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,782
the person has to believe that he
is cursed... Watch!

791
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,667
You don't burn your fingers.

792
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,106
Want to know what I wished for?

793
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,164
No, it doesn't matter.
Completely irrelevant.

794
00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:43,463
I wished...

795
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,502
I wished that
you could find happiness.

796
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:48,915
I don't know what that means.

797
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,925
Happiness, love, laughter,

798
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,158
friendship, purpose...

799
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:55,626
and a dance.

800
00:41:58,667 --> 00:41:59,954
Then thank you.

801
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:03,728
Why is that funny?

802
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,293
'You wouldn't have thanked me

803
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,428
if you didn't think that
part of it was true.

804
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,578
No, I was thanking
you for your kindness,

805
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:11,486
not because I believed
in the outcome.

806
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:14,940
- I detected relief.
- No, no, you didn't.

807
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,413
Relief that the mojo
was good and not bad.

808
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,705
Now you're just mixing
up belief systems.

809
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,450
You want me to burn another one?

810
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,640
- No... how many do you have?
- Got a lot.
