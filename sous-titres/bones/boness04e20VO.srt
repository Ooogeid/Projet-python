1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,260
- Who's the new guy?
- That's not a guy.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,558
Baby! I swear to God,

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,576
I'd give my left cajoneto
take her for a spin.

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,522
The Lord is not pleased
with lustful thoughts, man.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,954
He put her here.

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,984
If he wants me
to keep it in my pants,

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,002
tell him to send me a sign.

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,159
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,747
It's the Blessed Virgin.
Please forgive me.

10
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,819
All right, let's go everybody
move back. Hello? FBI.

11
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,665
Watch out. Excuse me. Watch out.

12
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,290
Thank you. Let's go.

13
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,701
Oh, my God.
It's the Virgin Mary.

14
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:09,249
Have you Googled
the grilled cheese Jesus?

15
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:11,195
'Cause that was just
a faulty griddle.

16
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,056
We're here because someone
suspected a crime.

17
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm just saying, life is a lot more than
what you cook up in your chemistry sets.

18
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,541
Miracles do happen.

19
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,289
Well, religious visions
are nothing but pareidolia...

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,740
random stimulus
being perceived as as significant.

21
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:28,754
Yeah? Did you ever hear of the Shroud
of Turin, Dr. Burn-In-Hell?

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,215
Sorry, big guy,
that was debunked 20 years ago.

23
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,051
Carbon dating doesn't lie.

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,169
Neither does phenolphthalein.

25
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,680
This was not a miracle.

26
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,390
It's dried blood.

27
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,518
All right. Let's get
this bale of hay down. Come on.

28
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,727
Yeah, let's go!

29
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,665
All right, here we go.
Don't got all day.

30
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,434
All right.
Let's do it.

31
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:06,811
Careful.

32
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:18,095
I'm going to give you this one.
Maybe it's not a miracle.

33
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:28,468
The fractures I can see are consistent
with the baling machine.

34
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:31,108
Based on lack of hemorrhagic
tissue, she was dead

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,236
- before ending up in the baler.
- Can we remove her from the cardboard?

36
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,530
Not until
she's completely processed.

37
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,652
I don't even know how
I'm going to tox her.

38
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:40,743
The cardboard soaked up
most of her bodily fluids.

39
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:44,080
Her blouse looks like it's got
patches of glaze on it.

40
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,609
Could be extruded body fat.

41
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,721
Hello, maggots.

42
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,545
Maybe Hodgins can use these little
devils to give us time of death.

43
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,500
The second joints of the victim's middle
toes have been shaved.

44
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,966
I think she was tortured.

45
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,264
No.

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,142
The victim had her toes
surgically shortened.

47
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,478
- On purpose?
- For vanity.

48
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,996
Women love shoes.

49
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,987
Like I said on the phone,
this is definitely my patient.

50
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,034
I remember
I threw in a toe tuck for free.

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,036
- A toe tuck?
- What can I say? Toes are the new nose.

52
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:28,958
The Board of Plastic Surgeons hasn't
approved this for elective surgery.

53
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,129
They haven't condemned it, either.

54
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,087
Right, okay.
So, who's our girl?

55
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:38,175
Meriel Mitsakos. She wanted the surgery
'cause she was getting married.

56
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,512
Had her eye on a pair of
Christian Louboutin sandals,

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,140
but her middle toes stuck out.
I said it was an easy fix.

58
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,185
What, you cut her toe off,
so she could fit into a pair of shoes?

59
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:51,730
Self-mutilation
for an antiquated ritual. It's barbaric.

60
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,638
Come on, marriage is very important
to a lot of people.

61
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:56,515
It's ridiculous.
No one can guarantee

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,255
how they're going to feel
about someone for life. We are not a

63
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,573
monogamous species.

64
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,825
Marriage has been around
since the beginning of time.

65
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,146
Women from Amazonian tribes
expressed their love

66
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:08,414
by spitting in their partners' faces.
I hope we've progressed past that.

67
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,916
Okay, well, you know what?
Sometimes love trumps logic.

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,990
Love is a chemical process
which causes delusion.

69
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,047
An intellectually rigorous person
would never get married.

70
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,758
- Never say "never."
- That's a paradox. It makes no sense.

71
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,576
Am I still needed here?

72
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:24,179
Because of you two
having relationship issues.

73
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:28,142
- We're not a couple.
- No, we just work together, that's all.

74
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,188
Meriel Mitsakos was murdered.

75
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,984
And as of now, you're the only one
we know who's taken a knife to her.

76
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:45,367
Bones - Season 4 Episode 20
"The Cinderella in the Cardboard"

77
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,121
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Reborn

78
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,018
Subtitle: A²S Team
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

79
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:16,649
Meriel wanted everything
to be perfect for our wedding.

80
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,503
Including her feet?

81
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,342
I told her I loved her
just the way she was, but that...

82
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,967
that doctor made her...
feel like her feet were unsightly.

83
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,776
- You checked him out, right?
- Yeah. He was in Europe

84
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,837
at the time of Meriel's murder.

85
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,499
Meriel was my oldest friend.

86
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,918
I was going to be her maid of honor.
She asked me in tenth grade.

87
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:40,364
Why would Meriel plan a wedding
if she didn't have a groom?

88
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,925
You had to know her.
Meriel get everything that she wanted.

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,387
And all she ever wanted
was to be a bride.

90
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,431
But don't misunderstand.
We loved each other very much.

91
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,073
Mike, when was the last time
you saw her?

92
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,750
Four days ago.
About 2:00, we had a...

93
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,379
a wedding cake tasting.

94
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,157
I don't want to come off
as sounding offensive,

95
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,361
but do you think
maybe she got cold feet?

96
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:04,655
We were in love.

97
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:08,499
All we wanted was each other.

98
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,745
I'm very sorry for your loss.

99
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,625
Just find out who did this
to Meriel.

100
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,014
Where did this come from?

101
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,982
The Egyptology Department.

102
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,476
- They let you borrow it?
- Well, no one was using it.

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,146
- Tell me you're kidding.
- No. I left a note.

104
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,632
Dr. Saroyan won't let me
take the victim off the cardboard,

105
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:44,737
and Dr. Brennan's going to kill me
if I don't get her complete X-rays, no?

106
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,105
- You cannot just take a...
- Fluoroscopy machine.

107
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,238
I've always wanted to use one, and this
is the perfect opportunity.

108
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,828
I just got a call from
Ethan Lawrence in Egyptology.

109
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,040
Something about a Post-it note where
his fluoroscopy machine used to be.

110
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,029
Well, their victims have been dead
for thousands of years.

111
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:01,211
There's little chance
of catching the perpetrators.

112
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,297
I figured it was
a priority thing, right?

113
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,628
Really it's more of a firing
and arrest thing.

114
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:08,469
- Did you really think one minute...
- I found something. Looks important.

115
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,408
Very important. Would have gone
unnoticed without the... fluoroscopy.

116
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,349
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt you?

117
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:16,586
- He's good.
- Just show me.

118
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:22,405
Something embedded in the
anterior superior iliac spine.

119
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:31,575
What is it?

120
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,078
A straight pin.

121
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:37,409
Right. Dead bride wearing
a strapless bra,

122
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,957
plus a straight pin...?

123
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,169
She must have had a bridal gown
fitting right before she died.

124
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:54,473
Well, according to her maid of honor,
this is where she ordered her dress.

125
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,102
Size six, coming through!

126
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,524
Ladies, watch the toes!

127
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,228
- These women are crazy.
- You know how I feel about weddings.

128
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,398
What's happening here
is definitely not about love.

129
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,569
Hello.

130
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,482
You're beautiful.
Your size is on that rack.

131
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,215
No, we're not looking for a dress.

132
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,616
No, never.
Ever... ever

133
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,793
Cold feet.
You'll get over it.

134
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,080
You two are obviously
meant for each other.

135
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:19,553
No.

136
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:23,620
- We're looking for the manager.
- I'm Lucia Bertolino.

137
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:26,111
- Is there a problem?
- I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

138
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,913
This here is my partner.

139
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,001
- How are these treated?
- We dip them in glycerin.

140
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,011
They're freeze-dried.
They last forever.

141
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,764
I'm sure they do.
Listen, we're investigating a murder.

142
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,868
The victim was here getting a bridal
fitting shortly before she was killed.

143
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,645
Meriel Mitsakos.

144
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,000
Hard to forget Miss Mitsakos.

145
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,321
She had a fight with Anya,
our best bridal consultant.

146
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,988
She was screaming at her
and calling her incompetent.

147
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:53,907
Right. Is Anya here today, working?

148
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,161
Actually, I had to let her go.
Anya slapped her.

149
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,653
Miss Mitsakos threatened to sue.
I didn't have a choice.

150
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,833
Did Anya show any other signs
of violence?

151
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,169
Was she dealing
with something else in her life?

152
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,462
This place was her life.

153
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:10,223
Well, I'm going
to need her contact information.

154
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,217
Anya couldn't kill anyone.

155
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,304
Well, had she ever
slapped anyone before?

156
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,625
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,910
Come on, Bones...

158
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,128
You must've dreamt about being a bride
before your heart turned to stone.

159
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,908
Just because I don't want
to take part in a meaningless ritual

160
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:33,575
doesn't mean that I'm not
a warm and affectionate person.

161
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,866
There are even some children
who have taken to me.

162
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,984
Oh, my God, I love it! Isn't it perfect?
Do you think it's perfect?!

163
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,747
- It's Daisy.
- What?

164
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,749
Turn around. Turn around.
That's Daisy Wick.

165
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,542
Sweets' girlfriend.
Don't look.

166
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,316
- No, she cannot see us.
- Why?

167
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,754
- Why?
- Because...

168
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,174
she is buying a wedding dress
and some guy is hugging her.

169
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,593
She's marrying someone else
without telling Sweets?

170
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,946
Don't you think
he'd be upset about that?

171
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,014
- Of course.
- I like Sweets. We should tell him.

172
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,730
No, no, no.
It's got to be our little secret.

173
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,276
- Here is Anya's information.
- Thank you.

174
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:07,481
You know, this veil
would be perfect for you, dear.

175
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,167
Well, it's a symbol of virginity

176
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,611
and I've been sexually active
since I was...

177
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,872
Bones, we really have to get going.
Thank you so much for your help.

178
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:21,427
A woman buys a wedding dress
to get married, Booth.

179
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,108
You know, if you're such
a strict adherent to monogamy,

180
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:27,203
then shouldn't you warn Sweets
that he's being cuckolded?

181
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,426
Now, listen, Bones.
There are complicated emotions

182
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,672
that are involved here.
It's definitely not your thing.

183
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,867
- It's a matter of honesty.
- Just trust me on this one, OK?

184
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:37,094
It's none of our business.
It's none of our business.

185
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,804
What's none of your business?

186
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,138
We were just discussing
our latest case.

187
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,457
- Dead bride?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:47,229
That would be completely
your business, though, wouldn't it?

189
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:50,023
- No, we were just...
- Am I missing something?

190
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,400
- What?
- No, crazy.

191
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,966
Daisy.
You must really miss Daisy.

192
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,029
- Yeah, we manage.
- Let me ask you a question.

193
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:59,236
Could dealing with crazy brides all day
make someone, you know,

194
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,076
snap and commit murder?

195
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,050
No, the bride snapped first.

196
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,913
She had a fight
with a bridal consultant.

197
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,748
Right, well, if the bride's physical

198
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,477
or emotional needs are not met,
yeah, she might act out.

199
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,218
Violence is rare, though.
Infidelity's more common;

200
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:15,723
using some disposable sap
as an emotional Band-Aid.

201
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,136
- Right, let's go.
- So a woman could be buying

202
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,550
her wedding dress with her fiancé and
spending her free time with a lover...

203
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:25,775
Right, but, physical violence
is definitely a possibility, right?

204
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,561
- Yeah.
- So we got to get going.

205
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,314
- Come on, Bones.
- It is, but you interrupted her.

206
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,486
We have somewhere we have to be.
We're late. See you later.

207
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,116
I worked at Bertolino's
for 29 years.

208
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,161
No matter what a bride looked like
coming in, when I was done with her,

209
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,729
she was beautiful.

210
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:49,727
But that one... Miss Mitsakos,
ugly from the inside out.

211
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:52,230
Okay, why don't you
just tell us about Meriel.

212
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:55,727
Every time she dropped a pound,
she made me adjust that bodice,

213
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:59,842
which would have been fine, but Friday,
she decided instead of a drop waist,

214
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,594
she wanted a natural waist.

215
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,181
She suggested I start from scratch.

216
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,229
She insinuated I didn't know
what I was doing;

217
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:10,008
that her dress issues were my fault.

218
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,401
She pushed me away.

219
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,649
- Pushed me!
- And then you slapped her?

220
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:16,064
No.

221
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,237
I slapped her
after she threw the pins at me.

222
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,362
You got fired.
You must've been angry.

223
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,909
I pride myself
on being a gentlewoman.

224
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,031
I would rather not talk
about this any further.

225
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:31,958
I understand.
Just one more thing.

226
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,586
You had Meriel's personal
information,

227
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,397
her account, address, et cetera.
Can you account for your whereabouts

228
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,049
the day after you got fired?

229
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,414
I know what you're implying,
Agent Booth.

230
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,117
I was at home.

231
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,869
I live alone. But I have spent
the last 29 years

232
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,934
bringing joy to young women.

233
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,520
So, no alibi.

234
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,692
I am a gentlewoman.

235
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:03,593
Hodgins found gravel in her hair,
but death by gravel is unlikely.

236
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,951
- Time to get her off the cardboard?
- How?

237
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,172
She's basically been absorbed
into the substrate.

238
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:11,415
We could cut underneath, but that runs
the risk of compromising the bones.

239
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,251
- We have to scrape her off.
- Look at this.

240
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,792
Tox screen results
on the pureed maggots:

241
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:18,917
tequila.

242
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:22,339
- The maggots were hammered.
- Which means Meriel was, too.

243
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:24,219
Yeah, but it gets better.

244
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,206
The weird glaze on the vic's
clothing wasn't extruded fat.

245
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:29,558
- It was glycerin.
- According to Dr. Brennan,

246
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,185
Bertolino's uses glycerin
to preserve bridal bouquets.

247
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,520
Looks like Bridezilla might have
messed with the wrong old lady.

248
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,548
I used to work at Anthony's
Famous in Georgetown.

249
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,728
That is some seriously good pizza.

250
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,118
The secret is the crust.
It's all in the crust.

251
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,155
Does this relate to our victim
at all?

252
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,330
This is how we get
the pizzas out of the oven.

253
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,645
And every pie was perfect.
Everybody ready?

254
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,737
This is so far out of my job
description, it's not even funny.

255
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,705
Okay, we are in.

256
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,008
She's sticking.

257
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,127
It was always tough
getting the pie out.

258
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,539
The cheese would bubble over
onto the oven and stick.

259
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,139
The pie could break apart.

260
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,056
- I wouldn't serve a pie like that.
- Can we save your war stories

261
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,394
for a more appropriate time,
Mr. Bray?

262
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:17,397
Careful.

263
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,115
Careful of the skull.

264
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:22,842
Okay, perfect.

265
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,738
Now that's something I'd serve.

266
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,852
If she were a pizza,
which she's not.

267
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
So, I'll stop now.

268
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,789
Ready?

269
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,294
Carefully.
Careful.

270
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,630
- Can I remove the flesh?
- Knock yourself out.

271
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:47,260
So, do you think the bridal
consultant killed Meriel?

272
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,429
Not really, but, you know,
I've been wrong before.

273
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,501
- You're usually quite certain.
- No, that would be you, Bones, okay?

274
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,352
- "I'm never getting married."
- You've never married.

275
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:56,603
Well, I will.

276
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,835
- Impossible to know.
- You know what? Obviously,

277
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,817
you have issues with this, so next time
we see Sweets, you should bring it up?

278
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,975
He's having an affair
with a woman who's engaged.

279
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,071
He's hardly one to give advice.

280
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,404
You are scared.

281
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,687
That's what it is,
you're scared of love.

282
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:12,830
Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth.
Hey, mind if we join you?

283
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,579
It's Sweets and Daisy.

284
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,706
Dr. Brennan,
it's so good to see you.

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,595
I want you to know, that even though
you fired me twice,

286
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,255
I have nothing but warm
feelings toward you.

287
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,882
- You wouldn't mind if I spoke freely?
- Of course not.

288
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,554
- We were just leaving.
- No, we haven't gotten our food.

289
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,220
- We don't need the food.
- Great.

290
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,805
- And she sits.
- You know,

291
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,025
every time I get
stuck on my dissertation,

292
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,561
- I think to myself, "WWBD."
- I have no idea what that means.

293
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,565
"What Would Brennan Do?"
I mean, it really should be "WWDBD,"

294
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,686
"What Would Dr. Brennan Do?"
But that seems unnecessarily formal

295
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,903
since I'm only thinking it silently.

296
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,322
- Isn't she cute?
- Yeah, she's adorable.

297
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,575
Multiple wives is the norm
in most of the world.

298
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,910
They would've no problem
if the same were true here.

299
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,204
- Beg your pardon?
- You see, Bones is just so into

300
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,928
the murder of this bride, that the facts
just start pouring out.

301
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,106
You would really
kick ass on that Millionaire show.

302
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,461
I can only imagine what it'wld be
like to have your brain.

303
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,213
- That's true.
- Look at that.

304
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,459
- Text flying in. We gotta go.
- I don't see a text.

305
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,218
How about the four us grab
some Mongolian barbecue tonight?

306
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,345
I'm busy. I already have plans.

307
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,272
- With whom?
- That's none of our business.

308
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:17,547
I have yoga class. You don't mind,
do you, Lancelot?

309
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,667
It makes me limber.

310
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:20,854
Here we go.

311
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:24,232
We really have to get going here.
Come on. Let's go.

312
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,676
- So we can take your table?
- Have the food, too.

313
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:29,154
- All right!
- They're so nice.

314
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,375
If they want a healthy
monogamous relationship,

315
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,443
- they should be honest.
- That's not the way

316
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,719
a relationship is supposed to be.

317
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:41,688
Most of the boxes don't have
any identifiable markings,

318
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,405
but the surface scratches
on this one

319
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,046
look like they may be handwriting.

320
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,007
- Daisy Wick is having an affair.
- Really?

321
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,606
She's getting married, she's cuckolding
on her fiancé with Dr. Sweets.

322
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,943
Poor Sweets.
He loves her.

323
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:57,807
Booth doesn't want to tell him.
He says it's none of our business.

324
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:58,949
Exactly.

325
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:01,435
But wouldn't it be kind
to spare Sweets

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,273
any emotional pain Miss Wick's
infidelity might cause him?

327
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,151
If Sweets is in love with Daisy,
and she's cheating on him,

328
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,694
somewhere inside he knows.

329
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,822
And if he doesn't, then it's
because he doesn't want to.

330
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,190
Will you hand me that lemon juice?

331
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,537
I think you are correct.

332
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,705
Good.

333
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,833
- A person's love life...
- The scratches on the cardboard

334
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,562
should take on a higher
concentration of lemon juice

335
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:27,968
than the surface area.

336
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,694
You just want to tell him,
don't you?

337
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,114
Sweets says that he's an expert
in human psychology.

338
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,830
He should be able to handle
a problem this common.

339
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,429
Come on, sweetie, be kind.

340
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:38,478
Of course.

341
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:42,142
Look, it looks like we can read
the writing on the box.

342
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,396
"Champagne Lounge,

343
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:48,118
"271 Beloit Avenue, Washington, DC."

344
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,035
I'll tell you what.
You know what?

345
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,152
- These bubbles are gonna stain my suit.
- They are formed using glycerin.

346
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,317
Maybe that's how the glycerin

347
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,590
got on Meriel's clothes,
not the flowers.

348
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:10,213
Yeah, right.
Hey, Buddy, over here.

349
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,090
- What can I get you?
- Information.

350
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,758
You working here Friday night?

351
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,822
- Do you recognize this woman?
- Oh, wish I didn't.

352
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,222
She sent her drink back three times.

353
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,526
Dirty martini... too dirty.
Mojito... too sweet.

354
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:25,353
- Vodka on the rocks...
- All right. Who was she with?

355
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,355
I don't know. Some guy.

356
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,108
Well, her fiancé
about 185 centimeters,

357
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,017
rectangular cranial structure,
dominant maxillary bone.

358
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,320
All I remember is that
the dude paid for her drinks.

359
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:39,638
He used a credit card, so why don't you
go look for those receipts for me?

360
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:42,731
Must've served a thousand drinks Friday.
When I get a chance, I'll look for it.

361
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,993
You should get the chance.
Why don't you think about it

362
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:48,001
when I go I card
these two blondes over here.

363
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Thanks.

364
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,666
What do you do with those boxes?

365
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,475
Recycling Dumpster
off the back alley. Why?

366
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:07,114
All right.

367
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:11,357
All right, it always stinks
in the back alleys, doesn't it?

368
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,580
Come on. Okay, let's go.
Break it up.

369
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:15,222
FBI. Come on. Back inside.

370
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:17,280
- All right, no worries.
- Thank you.

371
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,532
Pea gravel.
Hodgins can determine

372
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,341
if it's a match for what we found
in the victim's hair.

373
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,041
Yeah, Special Agent Booth, 22705.

374
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,377
Look, I need a crime scene
unit here at 271 Beloit.

375
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,374
Back entrance.
Thanks.

376
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:01,140
Look at that, I think I may have found
the woman's cell phone.

377
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:02,265
Yeah.

378
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,834
- What do you got?
- Come here.

379
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:14,940
Thanks.

380
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,550
We got some blood there?

381
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,472
Booth says that if we can pull
the call history,

382
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,930
he won't have to subpoena
the phone company records.

383
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,894
Yeah, I've heard of that place,
the Champagne Lounge.

384
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:32,397
A lot of couples use the alley
for a quickie.

385
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,252
OK, it looks like
it's just the battery.

386
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:37,610
Maybe she was regretting her decision
to limit her sexual activity to one man.

387
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,863
You just can't let it go, can you?

388
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,081
All right, this ought to do it.

389
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,911
All fixed.

390
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,454
Well done.

391
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,451
Oh, my God, she's getting a call.

392
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,755
What... what...
what do you want me to do?

393
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,056
Answer it.

394
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:05,805
Oh, my God.

395
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,141
It's Hodgins.

396
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:14,106
Okay, this is embarrassing.

397
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,376
It's worse than that
'cause your picture just popped up

398
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:17,842
on a dead woman's cell phone.

399
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,196
Because my phone was
within 100 yards of hers.

400
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,536
Don't go all squinty on me, OK, Hodgins?
I want an explanation.

401
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,825
It's a dating service.

402
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,808
- You're using a dating service?
- Yes.

403
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,662
Along with millions of other people.

404
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,227
It's called "Date or Hate?"

405
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,459
When a potential match
is within 100 yards,

406
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,133
both our cell phones ring.
You can either press "date" or "hate."

407
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,784
If we both press "date," then we get
each other's cell numbers.

408
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:41,453
But Meriel was engaged.

409
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,717
Why would she be using
a dating service?

410
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:45,511
Maybe she forgot to cancel.

411
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,679
Guys, sex.

412
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,093
- It's a no-brainer.
- Is that your reason, because

413
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:52,477
weren't you and Angela
sexually compatible?

414
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,303
It's not about the sex.
I was...

415
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,901
- looking for a meaningful connection.
- I get it, Jack.

416
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,261
- You do?
- Yeah.

417
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,948
Hey, guys, dead body, all right?
Murder.

418
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,617
Did you know the victim
before she was a pizza?

419
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,245
No. But she would definitely
have many other potential dates.

420
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,331
You should talk to the agency.
The "Date or Hate?" offices are local.

421
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,322
Doesn't she work in the cafeteria?

422
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,546
She just pressed "hate."

423
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,632
- You're out.
- Okay, all right, just...

424
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,555
We have 8,000 registered users
in the DC area,

425
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,675
and almost 200 marital
success stories.

426
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,229
One of your registered users,
a Meriel Mitsakos, was murdered.

427
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,237
Did you know the victim?

428
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:44,975
No, but I'm in the process of securing
venture capital to...

429
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,453
to take my company national.

430
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,783
If this gets out,
I could lose my investors.

431
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,554
We're going to have to take a look

432
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:53,037
at Meriel's "Date or Hate?"
activity.

433
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,040
- That's private.
- Well, she's dead, Mr. Rossi.

434
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,669
Or maybe your investors would like
the publicity of a court order.

435
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:09,089
In the last month,
she was matched with 20 potentials.

436
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:11,970
She hit "hate" on 14 of them,

437
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:14,642
"date" on five.
She never responded to the last guy...

438
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,649
a Jack Hodgins from earlier today.

439
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,824
When did she last press "date"?

440
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:23,234
7:45 p.m. last Friday.

441
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:25,111
The night she was murdered.

442
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,529
Do you have a name?

443
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,657
Owen Smith.

444
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,701
He pressed "date," too.

445
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:39,834
I don't believe it. There's no way
Meriel was cheating on me.

446
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,682
- You're sure?
- We were engaged, Agent Booth.

447
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:45,798
Would you want someone to tell you
if your girlfriend was cheating?

448
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,966
Or...

449
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:48,426
Do you favor denial?

450
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,387
No, I mean, I'd know
if Daisy were cheating on me,

451
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,767
I'm trained to recognize
the subtleties of human behavior.

452
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,783
So, it's a moot point.

453
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,979
<i>You know, I think you found out
she was cheating.</i>

454
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,939
<i>I mean, she wasn't really discreet.</i>

455
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:05,983
Using your cell phone
to meet other guys.

456
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,017
It's understandable
that you snapped.

457
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:12,450
- Are you sure about this list?
- Yeah.

458
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,142
That's what makes it
so understandable.

459
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:18,253
Where were you the night
that she disappeared?

460
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:19,478
Dance class.

461
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:24,379
Genie told me how important
that first dance was to Meriel,

462
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,089
I just wanted to be perfect for her.

463
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:29,467
In our sessions,
you put a high premium on honesty,

464
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,235
don't you, Dr. Sweets?

465
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:34,028
Of course.
You think he's lying?

466
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:35,983
No.

467
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:38,601
I'm talking about you and Daisy.

468
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:42,622
She's engaged to be married and...

469
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,942
she's sleeping with you
behind her fiancé's back.

470
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:47,254
What? No.

471
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:51,030
You're wrong, Dr. Brennan.
That can't be.

472
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,911
- You're wrong.
- Obviously,

473
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:55,993
You can't read all the psychological
subtleties that you think you can.

474
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,582
Booth and I saw her trying on
her wedding dress with her fiancé?

475
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,700
He hugged her
and twirled her around in the air.

476
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,750
That's impossible.

477
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,100
I would have known.

478
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:13,344
- This is denial, right?
- No, I mean...

479
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,892
- Oh, God.
- Booth felt that I shouldn't tell you,

480
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,561
that it was none of our business,

481
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,564
but I think that now you can make
an informed decision.

482
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,482
Either... share Miss Wick

483
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:27,483
or...

484
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:28,568
move on.

485
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,250
I'm sorry.

486
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,225
Could you excuse me for a moment?

487
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,426
I need a minute to myself.

488
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,757
Sure.

489
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,400
Booth is finished anyway, so...

490
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,498
I found fractures on the piece
of the cranium inconsistent

491
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,305
with the compression from the baler.

492
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,915
Stop. That's a good one.

493
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,642
Brennan thought we could find out
the cause of the fracture

494
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,519
by reexamining photos of the tissue.

495
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,850
Isolate her head full frame.

496
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:10,625
- I don't see anything, guys.
- We're not looking on the surface,

497
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,550
we're looking beneath it.

498
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,822
Okay, I need to enhance the details.

499
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,925
I can shower the image
with various wavelengths of light.

500
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,119
Next, I apply the filter software.

501
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,237
Finally I blacken the blacks,

502
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,131
maximize contrast
and sharpen the focus.

503
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,168
Perimortem bruising.

504
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,050
That's a tire tread.

505
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,350
She was run over by a car.

506
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,636
Seems like our victim was flattened
before she was flattened.

507
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,025
So her fiancé's alibi checks out.

508
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,150
He was dancing the night away.

509
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,177
I told Sweets about Daisy.

510
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,500
Bones, why?

511
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,696
I felt like I was lying to him

512
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,324
by keeping it to myself.

513
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,680
How about the others?

514
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:01,617
The others?
He was dating other people?

515
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,955
No, the other suspects
in Meriel's murder.

516
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,582
- What about Owen Smith?
- The Bureau's doing a background check.

517
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,950
Smith was using a disposable phone

518
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,899
and his e-mail accounts
were cancelled.

519
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,171
According to Kurtis,

520
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,839
it's a common MO for

521
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:16,513
married men to get a little
something-something on the side.

522
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,678
Why did you tell Sweets?
He's going to come in here,

523
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,638
he's going to cry and stuff.

524
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,266
Excuse me.

525
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,050
Oh, God.

526
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:30,088
- You have a minute?
- Of course.

527
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,779
I was talking to Agent Booth.

528
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,192
I'd like a minute alone.

529
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:34,605
Sure.

530
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,750
Well, I'll get right to it.

531
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:47,327
Dr. Brennan told me that Daisy

532
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,719
is engaged to another man.

533
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,150
I'm sorry, Sweets. I...

534
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,450
It's okay, it's okay.

535
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:57,091
Dr. Brennan was being honest.
I appreciate it.

536
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,750
No, you don't. Come on.

537
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,370
I don't! I don't!
I feel like an idiot!

538
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:03,431
Have a seat.

539
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
Daisy...

540
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,061
she's been canceling on me
all the time lately.

541
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,179
Like yoga the other day, and,

542
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,550
you know,

543
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,010
recently,

544
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,209
at night, when she's over,

545
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,561
the frequency of our...

546
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,882
our intimate relations,

547
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,875
she says that she's been tired
because of her dissertation.

548
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I get it.

549
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,150
It was right in front of me,
right in front of me all along.

550
00:28:31,897 --> 00:28:33,047
I'm a failure

551
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:36,047
as a lover and a psychologist.

552
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,775
No, no, it's not true.

553
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,675
Sweets, these things, they happen.

554
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,450
Okay, what should I do?

555
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,257
I don't have many

556
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:45,875
manly-man friends like you
that I can talk to.

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,650
What would a guy-guy do
in this situation?

558
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:51,270
Are you asking me
if you should fight for her?

559
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,482
Do you think I should?

560
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,850
If you were your own patient,

561
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,488
what kind of advice
would you give yourself?

562
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,350
Impressive.

563
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,319
Turn the question back on me.
It's a classic therapeutic technique.

564
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,850
It's really, really annoying.

565
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,200
Did it work?

566
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,334
I should confront her.

567
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,514
I should be candid.
You're right.

568
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,465
You're right.
It's the only way.

569
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:19,218
Thank you.

570
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,050
Any time.
It was very helpful.

571
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,668
The session's over.

572
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,238
You think maybe we could...

573
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,231
hug?

574
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:28,811
Like men, of course.

575
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:31,475
It'd be comforting for me
under the...

576
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,561
No?
No.

577
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,939
I don't hug things out.
We just kind of

578
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,475
good slug on the arm.

579
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,317
It's more of a manly thing to do.

580
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:40,945
- Sure.
- Okay?

581
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,144
- Could you do it again?
- Sure.

582
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,658
Want more?

583
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,376
- See ya.
- Thank you.

584
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,175
Wendell's data suggests
that she was struck by an SUV.

585
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,775
The patella fractures
are several centimeters higher

586
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,750
than a standard car bumper.

587
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:02,075
You didn't findany incised wounds
with glass or paint, did you?

588
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
No, why?

589
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,345
I'm just confirming that the victim
didn't wrap around the hood.

590
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,890
Which means that her center of gravity
thrust her backward,

591
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,312
something like this.

592
00:30:14,557 --> 00:30:16,600
Whatever happened
to your online dating thing?

593
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:19,625
I didn't have the time
to properly sort through

594
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,486
- all the potential matches.
- You thinking of trying it?

595
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,275
I think Sweets should sign up.

596
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,867
Did you really tell Sweets
that Daisy was cheating on him?

597
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,077
Everyone thinks
that I've done something terrible.

598
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,080
- I didn't want to lie.
- In this case, it was the way to go.

599
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,165
OK, ladies.

600
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,383
It's ready.

601
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,700
In newer model SUVs,

602
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,803
the grill
protrudes almost as far as the bumper.

603
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,972
It's like being hit
by a battering ram.

604
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,475
I thought you said you found
tire treads on her head?

605
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,250
No, I'm not finished.

606
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,575
Assuming this was done on purpose,

607
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,200
the driver backed up

608
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,775
to see where his victim had landed.

609
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,650
And then, he gunned it.

610
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,675
The multidirectional fractures
on the skull are consistent

611
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,951
with a tire's downward
vertical force.

612
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,405
The killer ran her down,

613
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,080
and then made sure she was dead
by running her over again.

614
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,075
That is much worse than anything
I might have done to Sweets.

615
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,500
I'll call Booth.

616
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,150
Excuse me, Dr. Hodgins.

617
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:30,193
I wanted to tell you
that I'm going to the Founding Fathers

618
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:32,350
for a drink tonight
with some friends.

619
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:33,891
Girlfriends.

620
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,052
Girlfriends.

621
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:36,659
I've got a bunch of friends

622
00:31:36,784 --> 00:31:39,230
and we get together
and hang out like we're guys...

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,250
It's not as confusing as it sounds.

624
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
Most of them are single.

625
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,252
Trying to fix me up there, Wendell?

626
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:49,865
I'm offering you an opportunity
to meet some great people.

627
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,242
Who have breasts.

628
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,412
That they do.

629
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,328
I think they'd like you.

630
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:56,038
You don't really know me.

631
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,775
I grew up on the streets,
Dr. Hodgins.

632
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,126
It doesn't take me long
to get a feel for someone.

633
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,963
First round's on me.

634
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,975
Booth got the name
of the victim's drinking partner

635
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,675
from the bartender
at the Champagne Lounge.

636
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,875
Joe Fillion.

637
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,775
He works in this building.

638
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,175
There's another SUV.

639
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,053
DC plates, F793A4.

640
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,975
Those plates are registered
to Joe Fillion.

641
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,276
So this guy ran her down, then backed up
and ran over her again?

642
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,298
That's a bad date.

643
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,575
These stains could be blood.

644
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,952
What was the height
of the patella fractures?

645
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,370
54 centimeters.

646
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,331
Undo my necklace.

647
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,751
I need to measure
if the point of impact matches.

648
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,875
What happened
to your measuring tape?

649
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,839
I don't know. It's missing.

650
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,509
There was a Post-it note from
the Egyptology Department in its place.

651
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,554
Exactly one and a half lengths high.

652
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,432
Consistent
with the patellar point of impact.

653
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,975
The victim's skull
was crushed by a tire.

654
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,700
It was the proximate
cause of death, yes.

655
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,050
The victim had black hair, right?

656
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,367
I think we found the murder weapon.

657
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,750
So, were you at the Champagne Lounge
to meet women in general

658
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,418
or Meriel in particular?

659
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,975
No, I was meeting Meriel.

660
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,423
There's no secret. Her mate Genie knew.
I wanted to get my engagement ring back.

661
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,955
You were engaged?

662
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,236
She broke it off
when she met that Mike guy.

663
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,973
- The ring was my grandmother's.
- Did she give the ring back?

664
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,518
She sold it to pay for her wedding.

665
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:46,523
She sold your grandmother's ring?

666
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,766
Are you kidding me?
That's only the half of it.

667
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,245
When we were talking,
her cell phone rang. It was one of those

668
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,275
"Date or Hate?" match thingies.

669
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
And Meriel

670
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:55,775
presses "date".

671
00:33:56,626 --> 00:34:00,075
I mean, can you believe that?
She's screwing over her new fiancé too.

672
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,922
That must've made you mad, Joe.

673
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,422
Oh, come on man,
you're not going to blame me for this.

674
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,176
All right, no, look,
she is not going to screw me again!

675
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:16,303
Look at that.
That is the Lab calling.

676
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,790
They tore apart your SUV.

677
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:20,975
Anything you want to tell me
before I pick this up?

678
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,900
I want a lawyer.

679
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,775
He didn't do it.
At least not with that vehicle.

680
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,675
What about the hair and the blood?

681
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,700
He hit a dog last week.

682
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,175
When he talked about it,
he burst out into tears.

683
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:41,704
He was more upset about that
than he was about Meriel.

684
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,375
She lied to him
and he hates her for it.

685
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,275
Cam thinks
that I should've deceived Sweets, too.

686
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,775
I don't understand. Our lives
are devoted to the pursuit of truth.

687
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,049
You can't tell everybody what's
on your mind even though it's the truth.

688
00:34:54,765 --> 00:34:56,837
What if you and I were going out,
and you were,

689
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,098
you know, taking forever to get ready
and you came out in this dress,

690
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,558
and I told you I didn't like it.
What are you gonna do?

691
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,561
I'd reevaluate, change,
or ignore you.

692
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,550
Of course you would, Bones,
good answer.

693
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,339
Here's the guys
that Meriel met on that "Date or Hate?"

694
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:15,946
We're looking for Owen Smith.

695
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,650
Here he is, Owen Smith.

696
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,325
He looks weird.

697
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,454
- Why? The guy looks perfect.
- I know, that's what's weird.

698
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,275
He doesn't look real, right?
Seems too young for plastic surgery,

699
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,209
but these wide flaring cheekbones:
there's no way that they could

700
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,879
- coexist with this nasal bridge.
- He is real.

701
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,897
Owen Smith, her final date.

702
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:36,772
Connected at 7:45
the night she disappeared.

703
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,650
I don't know...

704
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,175
What's so important, Lancelot?
You miss me too much?

705
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,000
Please, sit down, Daisy.

706
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,650
What's wrong?

707
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:58,405
I've devoted myself
to this relationship.

708
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,157
I've given you everything.

709
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:02,284
- My heart...
- Are you breaking up with me?

710
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,678
I love you, but I can no longer...

711
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,246
You are breaking up with me!

712
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,224
Tears will have no impact on me,
Daisy.

713
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,875
Why? What have I done?

714
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,303
You're engaged to someone else,
for God's sakes!

715
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:14,262
I'm not gonna be your little boy toy

716
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:17,300
because you have a dysfunctional
relationship with your fiancé.

717
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,258
What?!

718
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,929
All those classes that you go to...
You probably don't even take yoga.

719
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,932
If I wasn't taking yoga,
how could I do a Shirshasana?

720
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,675
What about the wedding dress?

721
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:29,464
Booth and Brennan
saw you trying it on

722
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:30,854
at the bridal shop

723
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,148
- cavorting with your fiancé.
- Baby,

724
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,066
my cousin is out of town.

725
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,275
Bertolino's
was having their annual sale.

726
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,821
We're the same size.

727
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,939
It was 50% off, one day only.

728
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
Okay, and that man you were with?

729
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Her fiancé.

730
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Not mine.

731
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,365
I love my Lancelot.

732
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,650
Oh, my God.

733
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,950
I was so jealous.

734
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:58,423
How could I have doubted you?

735
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,475
We're both beautiful people, Lance.

736
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
I mean, we're bound
to get jealous sometimes.

737
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,976
I wish we could run home
together right now.

738
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,550
I can't wait that long.

739
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,024
I can't believe
I didn't see that before.

740
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:30,205
See what?
What are we looking for?

741
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,682
Owen is a composite
of these four other dates.

742
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,675
He has Graham Mouw's chin,

743
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
Mel Jensen's eyes,

744
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,775
Frank Henley's mouth,

745
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,300
and Mickey Jasper's
nose and cheekbones.

746
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,344
Someone created the perfect man
in order to meet our victim.

747
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,212
Someone who had access
to all these photos.

748
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:54,501
That's insane.

749
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:57,775
Why would I create a fake persona
just to meet some girl?

750
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,803
Because your facial morphology
is subpar.

751
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,239
Your supraorbital torus
is too high and thick,

752
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,533
- you lack a mental eminence.
- Bones?

753
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:08,076
He gets the picture.

754
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:10,575
- This is crazy.
- Right, we checked with the DMV.

755
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,375
We know that you drive
a sport utility vehicle.

756
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,838
The forensic team
is examining your SUV right now.

757
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,650
It was an accident.

758
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,475
Hitting her once might
have been an accident,

759
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,287
but running over her twice seems...

760
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:34,452
very deliberate.

761
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,147
She said she wanted a funny,
smart, successful guy.

762
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,315
That's me.

763
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,446
- I just wanted a chance.
- Really, and you

764
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,866
thought she'd overlook the fake photo
that you put in there, too?

765
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,100
All these beautiful women
on my service, but...

766
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,950
none of them will look at me.

767
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,672
I'm better than half the losers
that sign up.

768
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,209
She laughed you off
and you followed her?

769
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,536
I was driving down the alley
on my way home.

770
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,057
She was having a smoke.
I rolled down my window to talk,

771
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,766
just talk, and she gave me the finger
and walked away.

772
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,059
And you ran her down.

773
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:15,221
Twice.

774
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,450
I don't know what happened.

775
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,650
I'm a nice guy.

776
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I'm smart.

777
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm just what she asked for.

778
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,850
- What?
- Booth, it's Bones.

779
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,100
- I should've called.
- No, come on in.

780
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,650
You kidding me?

781
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,275
I saw Sweets and Daisy,
and I was wrong.

782
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,891
- She wasn't cheating on him.
- That's a good thing, right?

783
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,186
I wanted to spare him pain,
but all I did was cause it.

784
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,410
- You meant well.
- I made him so jealous, I almost

785
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,745
ruined their relationship.

786
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,575
I should've listened to you.

787
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,154
Maybe next time you will.

788
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:34,311
I was just gonna go out

789
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:36,475
and grab a bite to eat,
some Chinese, maybe some...

790
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,800
I'd rather drink. Do you want one?

791
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,824
We could do that.

792
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:42,582
My good bottle of scotch.

793
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,164
Bottoms up, Bones.

794
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,155
You know, intellectually
I know that jealousy is absurd.

795
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,050
But I see that it's real for people.

796
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,400
I even experience it myself.

797
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,503
So...

798
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,501
who are you jealous of?

799
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,168
Angela.

800
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,531
Hodgins.

801
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,105
Cam.

802
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,502
You.

803
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,344
Why?

804
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,450
Because you all want to lose yourself
in another person.

805
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,869
You believe that love is

806
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:32,346
transcendent and eternal.

807
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:38,249
I want to believe that, too.

808
00:42:40,844 --> 00:42:41,683
You will.

809
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I promise.

810
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,789
Someday you will.

811
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,988
You will someday, okay?

812
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
You will.

813
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:06,121
