1
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:08,223
This poor guy was only 50.

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,635
They say cause of death
was cardiac failure

3
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:13,012
resulting from a congenital defect.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,316
You're not gonna talk like that
when we get there, OK?

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,516
- Like what?
- You know, it's a wake,

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,144
it's not a crime scene.
You know, "I'm sorry for your loss."

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,294
"How are you holding up?"
Stuff like that.

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,914
I know, I just don't agree
with the social convention

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,214
which requires us to attend
a daylong grieving ritual

10
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,698
simply because the deceased
worked at the Jeffersonian.

11
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,706
Try not to say "the deceased."

12
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,327
It's not like any of us knew
this Dr. Reilly personally.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,440
I knew him. It was Hank.
Hank was a prince.

14
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,844
I talked to him just last week
about Michelle.

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,709
How to get her to stop smoking.

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,841
- She's smoking? She's smoking what?
- Cigarettes.

17
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:50,219
I've been her legal guardian for a month
and I'm already a total failure.

18
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:52,806
She's 16. She's just trying
to test you, that's all.

19
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,613
Maybe we should just focus on Hank.

20
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:58,579
I think I remember him.
Curly blond hair, blue eyes, glasses...

21
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:00,434
Nope, dark hair, balding.

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,755
You don't work at the Jeffersonian.
How do you know him?

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,959
The guy ran the best
fantasy football league in DC.

24
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,608
Man... oh, man,
I still owe him 20 bucks.

25
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,336
Come to think about it,
you know what, he owed me 20 bucks.

26
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,614
Great, how am I gonna get that back?

27
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:30,640
There are a lot people here
whom I recognize.

28
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,343
They're from work, honey.

29
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,059
There's Amy Valeska.
That's Hank's assistant.

30
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,124
She looks really upset.

31
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,579
Grief can be very difficult to process,
so, if anyone needs to talk...

32
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:42,954
That's why they have booze, Sweets.

33
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,814
Hank's mother over there
is very rich.

34
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,579
Something to do with dry cleaning.

35
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:50,696
Dr. Temperance Brennan?

36
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,070
Yes. Hello.

37
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,239
Hank said you worked at the museum,
but I didn't think you'd be here.

38
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,075
I'm Barney, Hank's brother.

39
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,799
I'm sorry... for your loss.

40
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,424
Yeah, I'm an author.

41
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:06,356
A writer, like you.
I mean, I write thrillers.

42
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,669
I've read all of yours.

43
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,481
Ladies and gentleman, after you take
a moment with the deceased,

44
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,384
please join us in the family room
for refreshments and reminiscences.

45
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,294
Sorry, Hank...

46
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,788
But she's still smoking.

47
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,998
Go up.

48
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,387
- Pay your respects.
- I know.

49
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,214
OK, Bones, you really suck at this.

50
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,084
You are staring way
too long at this guy, okay?

51
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,542
People are gonna start thinking
you have a thing for him.

52
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,998
This man was murdered.

53
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,986
Heart attack.

54
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,299
- He had a heart attack.
- No, Booth, this man was murdered.

55
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,478
Hank Reilly did not die
from congenital heart failure.

56
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,903
He was murdered.

00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:28,893

00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,572
What is that?

61
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,030
- This is whisky.
- Well, it's a wake, OK?

62
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,761
- There's drinking involved.
- We should remain clear-headed

63
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,183
so we can solve the murder.

64
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:12,765
Code word, okay?
For "murder."

65
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,917
I want you to say "translation,"
you understand?

66
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,761
Translation, got it?

67
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:21,612
Someone translated Dr. Reilly,
and we have to find out who.

68
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:25,157
Bones, is there any chance
you just feel bad about

69
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:28,327
not knowing this guy
like the rest of us did?

70
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,193
So, now you're just making it about you
in saying that he was

71
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,458
translated instead of, I don't know,
dying of natural causes?

72
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,502
No, there is no chance of that.

73
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,340
What makes you think
he was translated?

74
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,103
The rose that his assistant placed
on his chest had fallen to the side.

75
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,619
So, I reached in to put it back
and I touched him.

76
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:51,053
- You touched him?!
- I touch dead people all the time.

77
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,217
I felt cracked ribs.

78
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,134
Left two through four.

79
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,071
- Drink up, will you?
- Why?

80
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,608
'Cause I'm hoping
you're gonna pass out.

81
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,568
We are talking about translation.

82
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,135
Bones, you ever think that,
I don't know,

83
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,189
if there was evidence
of foul translation,

84
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,326
that the coroner
would have spotted it?

85
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,122
- Yes.
- Fine, so, I'll tell you what.

86
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,563
Tomorrow morning we will go find
the guy who did the autopsy

87
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,317
and we'll ask him questions.

88
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,666
No, Dr. Reilly's scheduled to be
cremated this afternoon.

89
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,936
All the evidence will be destroyed.
We have to get an injunction

90
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:23,701
so that we can examine the remains.

91
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,598
Now? You want me
to take the body now?

92
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,660
- Yes.
- That family will be scarred for life.

93
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,806
Booth, the man has been translated.

94
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,099
Okay, fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

95
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:37,719
Triple fine, all right?
I'll call for an injunction.

96
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,696
In the meantime,
go into the family room there

97
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,271
where they're doing toasts, okay?
All right, there you go.

98
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:47,446
Put on a sad face.

99
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,242
No, sad.

100
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,370
Keep that face sad.
That's it. That's it.

101
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:59,251
I loved...

102
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,041
Hank Reilly.

103
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,686
I still love him!

104
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,525
And why not?

105
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,594
He was...

106
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,477
A good husband.

107
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,307
A good man.

108
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,519
The little things
are what life's about.

109
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:19,425
The routine.

110
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,195
Hank said I should ground Michelle.

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,875
But I don't want to be the enemy.
She's only been with me for a month.

112
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:27,613
Really, now?

113
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,789
Every morning I brewed his tea
for him steeped

114
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,870
just the amount he liked it.

115
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:38,465
What am I going to do now,
in the mornings?

116
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:40,666
Without Hank?

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,257
I'm Jonah Amayo.

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,113
Hank and I started
at the Jeffersonian at the same time.

119
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,054
He was head of Egyptology.

120
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,847
I lead the Caribbean department.

121
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,043
What are you doing?
Will you stop playing with the body?!

122
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:01,063
- Did you get the injunction?
- No, the judge turned us down.

123
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,118
Why?

124
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,697
Because both the paramedics
and the medical examiner said

125
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:08,445
that Reilly here died of heart failure.
No evidence of translation.

126
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,140
But I am contradicting them.
My record and credentials...

127
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,489
The judge said
he didn't want to grant a request

128
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:16,246
to an author of pulp mystery
books just because

129
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,123
she wanted to get a little
free publicity. There, I said it.

130
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,874
That man is a fool.

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,335
They are not pulp.

132
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,897
At least he was right about,
you know,

133
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,006
the paramedics
and the medical examiner.

134
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,778
I will get the judge the proof he needs.
Just guard the door.

135
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,408
Get away from the body.

136
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,783
Guard the door?

137
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,472
From what?

138
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,208
- You undressed the deceased?
- No, I didn't have to.

139
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,607
It was slit up the back.
I just had to untuck him.

140
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,325
There was no mention of this contusion
in the medical examiner's report.

141
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,162
- Meaning?
- This bruise was sustained later.

142
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,806
Corpses don't bruise.

143
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,786
Wait, so, Hank was alive
after he was declared dead?

144
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,459
Sure looks that way.

145
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:09,381
Where did the body go
after the medical examiner?

146
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,699
The funeral home.
For embalming.

147
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,929
We've got to talk
to the funeral director.

148
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:26,398
Hello?

149
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:27,753
You mind?

150
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:34,448
What?

151
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:37,117
- What?!
- The widow and the undertaker.

152
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,740
What, they were dancing?
What?!

153
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,508
Sexual intercourse.

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,249
How am I supposed to get
sexual intercourse from that?

155
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,923
- It's very obvious.
- Oh, is it? No, this is obvious.

156
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:49,676
This is my house now and I can do

157
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:52,007
- who I want in it.
- Obviously.

158
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,105
Okay, there you go.

159
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,553
So, you do this a lot there?

160
00:09:57,109 --> 00:10:00,057
- It's my job to comfort the bereaved.
- Well, it is also your duty

161
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,101
to report any damage
the body sustained

162
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,728
during your preparation of it.

163
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,235
When did you take that?

164
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,700
- You molested the body?
- No.

165
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,412
FBI.

166
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:16,114
You want to explain how the bruises
got on that body?

167
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,165
The infusion of embalming
fluid increases

168
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,077
the stainability
of bruises on the dermis.

169
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,705
Bruise not seen immediately post-mortem
often presents itself post-embalming.

170
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,917
- Okay, is it good enough for you?
- What about the rib breaks?

171
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,185
Rib breaks and sternum cracks,
which I noted in his file,

172
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,256
were the result
of Dr. Reilly's assistant

173
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,093
attempting to revive him with CPR after
finding him unconscious in his office.

174
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,497
May I go?
I have more work to do.

175
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:39,782
Right, right.

176
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,157
Sure, you have to go take care
of his mother now, too?

177
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,838
So, you still think
he was translated?

178
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:48,605
Those are not the ribs
that would break during CPR.

179
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,987
Maybe she was just bad
at resuscitation.

180
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,739
No, Booth, this is translation.

181
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,947
We need to do a full examination
of the body at the lab.

182
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,865
But we do not have an injunction.

183
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,501
This is a sad day

184
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:02,506
for all of us,

185
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,706
but I think it's important
that we remember

186
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,492
what we loved about Hank, you know?

187
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,089
His sense of humor, of course.

188
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:15,081
He was always quick with a joke,
good or bad.

189
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,037
Usually bad.

190
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,262
But he...

191
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,487
Oh, my God!

192
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,107
Oh, my God, Hank.

193
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:38,322
Hank is... Hank... Hank is...
he's leaving us.

194
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,532
Where is he going from here?

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Who knows?

196
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,812
But...

197
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,061
Oh... God... Hank.

198
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,714
It's not fair, you know?

199
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:58,842
You live life, and we... we die.

200
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,584
And we don't...

201
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,014
we don't love enough, and... and

202
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,977
I got to not do that anymore
'cause I'm...

203
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,097
I... I need to live and... and...

204
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:13,523
love.

205
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:26,951
Thank you.

206
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,386
Come on...
Hurry up, Bones.

207
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,114
- Why are you telling me to hurry up?
- Just hurry up. Walk with me.

208
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,047
Your Sequoia was, it was blocked
so I grabbed Angela's Matrix.

209
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,640
- Is there enough room?
- It'll be fine. There's lots of room.

210
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:42,219
Here we go, in the car.
Let me just get this stiff in here.

211
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,262
- Shouldn't we lie him down?
- No.

212
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,308
You get stopped, you got a corpse.
This way, he just looks drunk.

213
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,185
One, two, three. Get the legs in.

214
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,104
Grab the seatbelt, lock him in.

215
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,523
Watch it, Bones.
Watch the...

216
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,108
Wrap him in there.

217
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,526
He looks comfy.

218
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,153
Okay, you got him.
See you later.

219
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,083
- Aren't you coming with us?
- No, I can't.

220
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,282
I got to make sure no one
looks in the casket. Go, go.

221
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,320
Go! Drive! Go!
What are you waiting for? Go! Go!

222
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,046
What... what's going on?
- What do you mean?

223
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:34,020
Your toast?
The word "loony" comes to mind.

224
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,328
I was moved, and, you know,

225
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,044
emotional.

226
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:42,559
- Tell me what's going on, Jack.
- I thought his toast was wonderful.

227
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:46,840
See? I was just wonderful.
That's all.

228
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,472
We don't love each other
enough in this world.

229
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,595
At least we don't say it enough.
You spoke from the heart.

230
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,418
They should really make an announcement
about this whisky being 150 proof.

231
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,963
Amy, you were
Dr. Reilly's intern, right?

232
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,474
Graduate assistant, yes.

233
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:04,718
It must have been awful when
you found him lying on the office floor.

234
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,679
Was he complaining of chest pains?

235
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:11,715
- What are you, possessed by Brennan?
- He was fine all morning.

236
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,274
When he left for lunch, I said,

237
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,459
"Have a nice lunch," and he said,
"Thank you. You, too." And I said...

238
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,952
- You didn't go to lunch together?
- No, no. He had a lunch meeting.

239
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,080
Sushi. I hate sushi.

240
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,925
I've heard that the mercury in raw fish
can make you stupid.

241
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,861
Yeah.

242
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,118
- Who was his lunch meeting with?
- He wouldn't say.

243
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:34,274
I yelled for help, called 911,
and tried to get him breathing again...

244
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,762
- Okay, all right.
- Thank you.

245
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:51,124
I'm going to go freshen up now.

246
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:01,014
Brennan thinks Hank was murdered,
so he helped her steal the body

247
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,860
so Cam could take it back
to the Jeffersonian to have a look.

248
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,760
- Hey, you stole the body?
- No, no, no, we didn't steal it.

249
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:14,864
You see, we borrowed it, okay?
Cam and Bones think he was translated.

250
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,374
- What?
- Translated.

251
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,882
It's code for "murder."

252
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,086
That's how we're saying it today:
translated.

253
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,005
Okay, what if somebody
looks in the coffin?

254
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,507
That's exactly why I'm here.

255
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,911
Hi, Mrs. Reilly.

256
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:32,484
Would you excuse me, please?
I...

257
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:34,261
I have a few private things

258
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,977
to say to my son
before he's cremated.

259
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:40,897
That's really not a great idea
right now, ma'am.

260
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:42,399
Why?

261
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,967
Well, there's a...

262
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,647
The fact is... the undertaker...

263
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,120
He didn't graduate
at the top of his class, so...

264
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,414
But I just saw Hank earlier.

265
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,423
Yes. Yes, you did... but the...

266
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:04,938
the putty that they use
to fill in the face has sort of...

267
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:06,756
melted,

268
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,644
and, his nose is sort of

269
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,303
going to the side.

270
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:15,724
And his hair is like Hitler.

271
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,517
- Hitler.
- Hitler?

272
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,100
Listen, I really think
it would be best

273
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:23,560
if you let Mr. Tung fix him up
before you see your son.

274
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:24,733
There you are.

275
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:26,733
Turn around, Barney.

276
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,112
We can't see Hank, not like this.

277
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,774
- Like what?
- Like Hitler.

278
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:33,491
What?

279
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,995
Well, please.
We're going. Now.

280
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,048
Are there people drinking?

281
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,414
These fractures were definitely not
caused by CPR.

282
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,629
These breaks are
more randomly located,

283
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:51,192
and suggest a sharper impact
than a hard push.

284
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:52,844
Yes. He was stabbed.

285
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,817
You can see the entry wounds
hidden behind trocar buttons.

286
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,241
13 in total.

287
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,254
Each one sealing up
a cutaneous puncture site,

288
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,085
each one caused by a weapon
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.

289
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,562
Most likely...

290
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,625
this: standard medical trocar,

291
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,228
used in arterial embalming.

292
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:11,529
Could it just be
a poor job of embalming?

293
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,115
Impossible. Over half of these
are nowhere near a vein.

294
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,247
Hank was stabbed seven times
with a trocar while he was still alive.

295
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,412
So, Hank Reilly had a heart attack,

296
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:23,556
was declared dead by the paramedics
and the medical examiner,

297
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,543
and then sent to an undertaker...

298
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,545
Where he was stabbed to death.

299
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,266
You see, what I have here,
Franklin, is a real-time video link

300
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,527
video link
to the Jeffersonian forensic lab.

301
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,014
So, say hi.

302
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,726
Hello. I'm Dr. Camille Saroyan.
I'm not sure we met.

303
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,936
That's Mr. Reilly!

304
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,355
Why did you hide
all these stab wounds?

305
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,028
It's my job to make
the body presentable, I did my job.

306
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:49,303
I did my job.

307
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:50,777
I did my job.

308
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,622
Mr. Tung, what we need to know
is who stabbed Hank Reilly?

309
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:54,748
I did!

310
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:56,991
It was me.

311
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,493
You stabbed a corpse?

312
00:17:58,736 --> 00:17:59,786
It's crazy.

313
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:02,956
This whole thing is totally crazy.
Maybe I'm crazy.

314
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,583
I did acid in high school,
and it's probably why I'm not a doctor.

315
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,837
Listen. Just relax.
Just tell me what happened, okay?

316
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,422
It was late.

317
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,174
Everyone had gone home,
and the body had just come in.

318
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,770
I had cleaned and disinfected him,
and was about to administer

319
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,318
the pre-injection to flush his veins
before I began the arterial embalming.

320
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,934
I went in through
the right femoral artery.

321
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:23,309
And suddenly...

322
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,187
His eyes opened.

323
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,619
His body jerks up and spasms.

324
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,360
- You panicked and stabbed him?
- It was a reflex. I...

325
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,655
Have you seen those zombie movies?
They can really warp you.

326
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:38,241
Okay, you watched
zombie movies on acid?

327
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:40,368
- I was scared.
- I get it.

328
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,040
Sometimes I'm here in the night,

329
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,539
and I swear I see
one of these bodies move.

330
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:51,212
Let me just say, I totally get that.

331
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,882
Okay, guys, listen,
was Hank Reilly dead or alive?

332
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:56,903
It wasn't a full autopsy.
No need, because

333
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,659
he was declared dead
by the hospital.

334
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,264
Cause seemed reasonable,
so the ME just signed off on it.

335
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,045
- Can I go?
- No. You can't go.

336
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,208
Cam, how is it
that a guy can appear dead

337
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,978
to 2 sets of medical professionals?

338
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,023
There are several forms
of paralysis which mic death.

339
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,943
Embalming would have destroyed any trace
of paralytic toxins in his system.

340
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:15,651
Except...

341
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:27,837
A trace amount of the toxin

342
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:30,752
may still be found
in the vitreous humor of the eye.

343
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:43,765
All right, let's go.
You can go. Come on, out.

344
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:48,686
Vitreous humor
tests positive for tetrodotoxin.

345
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:51,847
One hundred times more lethal
than potassium cyanide.

346
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,317
- Naturally occurring.
- But he wasn't dead.

347
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,465
Yet. That occurs
anywhere from 20 minutes

348
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,179
to eight hours after ingestion.

349
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:01,765
Until then,
hearand respiratory rates mic death.

350
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,803
Tung hits a nerve
while tapping the femoral,

351
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,663
Reilly bolts up, still in a coma.

352
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,665
And Franklin Tung stabs
and kills him.

353
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,459
But somebody else
poisoned him first.

354
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,385
Hank Reilly was in a paralytic state
micking death

355
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,470
when Franklin Tung
inserted the trocar,

356
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,974
causing Hank Reilly to spasm
in such a way that he actually sat up

357
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,475
on the embalming table.

358
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:30,436
So technically, Franklin Tung
committed manslaughter,

359
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,147
- while somebody else committed murder?
- What did you find?

360
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,774
- Tetrushydrogen
- Tetrodotoxin.

361
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,177
- That's what I said!
- Tetrodotoxin does have limited

362
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,362
uses as a treatment for some
cardiac arrhythmias.

363
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,489
Hank had
a congenital heart condition.

364
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,117
- So is this tetrahockalin thing common?
- Tetrodotoxin.

365
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,413
- That's what I said.
- It's a controlled substance.

366
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,127
Angela, maybe you could access
the FDC database,

367
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:52,208
see if Hank
was ever prescribed tetrodotoxin.

368
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,877
- I need a computer.
- Use mine. Come on, in the car.

369
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:58,560
Anybody comes in here, do not
let them look in that casket.

370
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:00,216
Do you understand?
All right?

371
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:05,493
So, while I'm in here, you mind
if I erase a few parking tickets?

372
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:07,412
No, I'll tell you what.
I'm not gonna relax

373
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:09,828
until we get Hank's body
back in that casket. OK?

374
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,681
- Here's something.
- What?

375
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,317
3 milligrams of tetrodotoxin
was delivered

376
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,274
to the Jeffersonian three weeks ago.

377
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,042
Wait a second. Hank had
his heart medicine delivered to work?

378
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,113
No. It wasn't Hank.

379
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,275
Delivery was accepted by
Dr. Jonah Amayo in Caribbean Studies.

380
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:34,375
Dr. Amayo, I'd like you
to meet my associate.

381
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:37,850
I'm aware, Dr. Brennan.
The two of you are fairly well known.

382
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:39,660
Dr. Brennan
tells me the Jeffersonian

383
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:41,847
is shutting down your department
after this quarter.

384
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,171
I'm sure you've heard
of this thing called the economy

385
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,315
which is in another thing
called the toilet.

386
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,848
You were going to have to report
to Hank Reilly?

387
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,684
Until he died,
and everything went back to normal.

388
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,022
You think I'm happy Hank died?
He was my best friend.

389
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,705
Why did you order
three milligrams of tetrodotoxin?

390
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,236
- Why are you interrogating me?
- I work with the FBI, that's what I do.

391
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,490
- Where have you guys been?
- Not now, Sweets, please.

392
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,483
Your field is the anthropological study
of Caribbean culture.

393
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:11,608
How does a Class 1
neurotoxin assist with that?

394
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,789
I got it!

395
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,442
Neurotoxins are widely believed
to cause the trance state

396
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,371
in reported cases
of Haitian zombism.

397
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,421
Am I right? I'm right, right?

398
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,764
- Zombies?
- There are no such things as zombies;

399
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:24,300
just an island superstition.

400
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,669
And now you've managed to insult an
entire culture and their belief system.

401
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:29,054
She does that to everyone.

402
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,718
Dr. Amayo's work in voodoo
and Santeria is fascinating.

403
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,435
And a little scary.

404
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,462
You, you people need to work
on your small talk skills.

405
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:41,009
Excuse me.

406
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,237
- What was that all about?
- Fugu.

407
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,319
That's really not very nice.

408
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:52,794
Tetrodotoxin is biologically
derived from tetraodontidae.

409
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,172
- Puffer fish.
- So... what?

410
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:57,583
It's a Japanese delicacy
known as "fugu."

411
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,622
Hank Reilly had sushi for lunch
at a place called Sushi Momo.

412
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,436
King of the Funeral!

413
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:10,991
There.
So,

414
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,726
nobody looks inside the casket.
Okay, Mr. Tung?

415
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:16,894
How do I do that?

416
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,311
Just...

417
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:21,941
Well, Bones, how does he do that?

418
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,732
Say someone enters
and desires to gaze upon the visage

419
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:27,668
of their dead relative one more time

420
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:30,533
in a vain effort to say good-bye
to someone who can neither see nor hear

421
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,868
because there's no
such thing as a soul or spirit.

422
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:35,538
Just give him a reason
not to show the body.

423
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:38,638
"We are encountering
fluid seepage at the moment

424
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:41,961
and the body is not available
for viewing just now."

425
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:46,133
- I would never phrase it that way.
- I know, it's perfect! It's so gross!

426
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:48,885
I'm done.

427
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,722
I'm going to need some transport
for me and my friend.

428
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:56,184
- What friend?
- I meant Hank. I was being oblique.

429
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,700
Right after we get back from sushi.

430
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,938
"Sushi"? You're going for sushi?!

431
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:06,223
- So do you serve puffer fish?
- Fugu.

432
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:08,571
Blowfish?
No, we aren't licensed.

433
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,481
We're investigating
a tetrodotoxin poisoning.

434
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,256
- Fugu.
- We do not serve fugu. I promise.

435
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,975
Did someone die
who ate at my restaurant?

436
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,331
Dr. Hank Reilly.

437
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,375
He just had lunch
with us the other day.

438
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,212
- Do you know who he ate lunch with?
- It was a woman.

439
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,048
She told him something,
and he got very upset.

440
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,258
- Can you tell us anything about her?
- Not really.

441
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:31,427
She had a haircut like Cleopatra.

442
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,602
Excuse me.
I'm... I'm looking for my friends.

443
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:44,398
I apologize,
but we are encountering some

444
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,004
slight fluid seepage at the moment,
and the body

445
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:50,528
will not be available
for viewing just now.

446
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:51,653
Sir...

447
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,191
I'm a trained psychologist.

448
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,871
And you're obviously
under a lot of strain.

449
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,765
- You might say that.
- You know, dealing with grief

450
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,750
and loss every day
can take its toll.

451
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,084
You have no idea.

452
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:08,131
In some cases, one might even
take responsibility for the death,

453
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,633
as if it were their own fault.

454
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,859
- Are you messing with me?
- No. No, no.

455
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,888
I'm just saying I understand.

456
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,349
Human behavior can surprise us all.

457
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,070
You might think that you have
everything under control,

458
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,061
and then,

459
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,148
blindsided by the unknown.

460
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:28,526
- Totally.
- It's perfectly natural.

461
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,029
Okay, you have absolutely nothing
to feel guilty about.

462
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,197
Thank you.

463
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:36,868
Thank you. Thank you.

464
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:39,620
Were you very close to the deceased?

465
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:41,906
Yeah, but...

466
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,042
I'm a lot closer to his wife.

467
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,964
We'll be there as soon as we can.

468
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,053
Everybody was all "Hurry up, Cam."

469
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:54,969
Now, I'm twiddling my thumbs here
with a stolen body.

470
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,804
I can't lug him back on my own.

471
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,324
We'll come and get you right after
we talk to Cleopatra.

472
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,879
Have you seen the woman
that looks like Cleopatra?

473
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:05,265
What's going on?

474
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,440
I sense that you two
are holding something back.

475
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:09,836
Yes. Yes.
You are.

476
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:14,486
Okay, we stole Hank's body in order
to confirm that he was murdered...

477
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:15,661
Translated.

478
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:20,036
- You're totally yanking my chain.
- No. The undertaker stabbed him.

479
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:24,040
The same undertaker that's been telling
everyone that the body's been leaking?

480
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:28,234
Okay, I may have told him that
murder's nothing to worry about.

481
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,795
I didn't... I didn't know.

482
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,140
That's great. You know what?
If you want to help out, go

483
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:34,769
find Hodgins,
bring him back to the lab,

484
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:38,395
get the body and bring it back into
the casket without anyone noticing it.

485
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,482
Wait. What?!
Why?

486
00:26:40,607 --> 00:26:44,128
So that the poisoner doesn't figure out
what we're up to and run away.

487
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,724
There's a poisoner and a stabber?

488
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,149
- Shut up!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

489
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:52,735
All right? Stop.

490
00:26:53,124 --> 00:26:54,124
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,870
I'm sorry.

492
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,155
- Can you get lost?
- Why?

493
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,787
I can be devastatingly charming
if you aren't watching me.

494
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,646
We haven't really met.

495
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:31,278
I don't know too many people here.

496
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,068
- I'm Erin Miller.
- Seeley Booth.

497
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,575
I'm the Reilly family's
estate lawyer.

498
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,350
Right, right. You mind?

499
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,330
Sure.

500
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,542
You had lunch with Hank
the day that he died.

501
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,062
- That must have been terrible.
- Yeah. It was terrible.

502
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:51,387
It wasn't a very pleasant lunch.

503
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,765
You guys argued?

504
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah, but, you know, not personally.
Lawyer stuff.

505
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,510
I can't really discuss it.

506
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,510
No, no, of course not.

507
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:05,192
But you do know that,
professional arguments

508
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,476
don't count
in a situation like this.

509
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:11,167
- They don't?
- No. If it was just business, there's

510
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,142
nothing to be guilty about.

511
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,818
Hank would totally understand.

512
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,220
- Well, thank you, Mr. Booth.
- You're welcome.

513
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,277
He's really dead.

514
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,925
That happens here
in the autopsy room.

515
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,070
Bud, someday
you'll have your last lunch, too.

516
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:33,502
Yeah, but they don't usually look like
people after you get your hands on them.

517
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,150
Thank you so much.

518
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,572
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.

519
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,929
By the way,
Hank wasn't killed by his lunch.

520
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,040
What? Wait, it wasn't
the fugu in his handroll?

521
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:48,267
No. Toxin slowed his digestion,

522
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,269
and the remains were well preserved

523
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,078
by the formaldehyde and ethanol.

524
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,240
Tuna, salmon, yellowtail,
and eel cut roll.

525
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,943
Really?
What did he have for breakfast?

526
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,269
His wife said Hank didn't eat breakfast,
just a cup of tea.

527
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,320
I did find some stray tea leaves.
His strainer must not have worked well.

528
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:06,945
He still has a face.

529
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,275
He's smiling.
A bit too much, maybe.

530
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm a pathologist, not an undertaker.
I did the best I could.

531
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,878
Adjust his smile. Be my guest.

532
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,464
If there wasn't any sign of poison
in the food in his stomach,

533
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,541
it had to have come
from his morning tea.

534
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,216
Probably the best way
to deliver poison.

535
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,786
See, Cleopatra there is the family
estate lawyer.

536
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,908
- She handles the mother's will.
- She argued with him at his last lunch.

537
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:57,211
Business.
My guess: problems with the will.

538
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,257
You mean, because the old lady
is so close to death?

539
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:06,053
Yeah, it's not the nicest way
of putting it, Bones, but yeah.

540
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:10,302
Look at her, Booth.
It's amazing that she can still stand.

541
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:12,268
There are 2 heirs to
the money when she dies.

542
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,325
There's Hank
and his brother, Barney.

543
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,272
Do you think Barney killed Hank?

544
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,693
- Why don't you go ask him?
- Why?

545
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,404
Is it because I'm an attractive
and sexy young woman who

546
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,029
will loosen his tongue?

547
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,074
Definitely, of course there's that.
Also, he wants you to publish his book.

548
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,762
What a lovely voice
you have, Dr. Brennan.

549
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,692
Yes, I know.
Please call me Temperance.

550
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,518
So... tell me about your book.

551
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:56,574
Well, Temperance...

552
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,260
the latest one
is called Dark Tactical.

553
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,734
A real nail-biter.

554
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,881
A deadly game of cat-and-mouse
between two SWAT guys.

555
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,991
One's good; the other isn't.

556
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,913
Does that sound like you'd be interested
in presenting to your publisher?

557
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:15,331
No.

558
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,917
Too edgy?

559
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,170
The concept is contrived and tired.

560
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:25,758
That's what my publisher would say,
but in reality, it's...

561
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,800
- Too edgy?
- Too... yes.

562
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:32,556
Perhaps you should publish
your novel yourself?

563
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,425
Well, I can't afford that.

564
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,143
You have an inheritance coming.

565
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,850
Well, that's true.

566
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:39,897
 The whole thing, too.

567
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,615
You mean instead of
splitting it with Hank?

568
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,675
Splitting it?
You mean in half? No way.

569
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,631
Me and Hank were stepbrothers.
Hardly any of it was coming to me.

570
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,715
90% was going to Hank and Helen.

571
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,700
Nothing Mom
could do about it either.

572
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,952
What about now?

573
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,866
Well, half to Helen,

574
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:56,839
half to me.

575
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,126
I can publish my book.

576
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:03,196
To Hank Reilly.

577
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,132
- Admit it. Just admit it!
- Helen, please. Stop this.

578
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:10,225
Don't you call me "Helen,"
you little tramp.

579
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,173
I am Mrs. Reilly to you.
Mrs. Hank Reilly.

580
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,610
Please. Hank is gone.

581
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,602
I know he's gone!
He was my husband!

582
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,480
Which is why
I am Mrs. Hank's Reilly,

583
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,605
and you are Mr. Hank's skank.

584
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,319
Then show him some respect
for once in your life!

585
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,795
- What is going on?
- Just normal funeral stuff.

586
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:33,185
So you respected
my husband, is that it?

587
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,710
- Of course I respected him.
- I see.

588
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,985
And exactly how many times a week

589
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,985
did you respect him?

590
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,293
This is not the time
nor the place, Helen.

591
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,961
Get out of my house.

592
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,048
Go back to your
one-bedroom brothel and die.

593
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,394
Okay. Come on.

594
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:58,142
Give me his legs.

595
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,610
Down, down.

596
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:07,401
Can you do this without me?

597
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,619
- Why?
- Yeah, he'll help you.

598
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,038
You were nothing to him.

599
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,624
Then why did he want to make
love to me and not you?

600
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,965
Hank, you are my hero.

601
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,087
How about a little help here?
You really want to watch them fight?

602
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,300
Hold it! Come on, easy.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it.

603
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,290
Do you think this is the way Hank
would want to see his wake end?

604
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:37,749
No. This isn't about
you or you or you or you.

605
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:39,850
This is about him. It's about Hank.

606
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,567
You think he'd want to see this?

607
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:44,063
I'm pretty sure he would,
especially if they were in Jell-O.

608
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,523
He wouldn't want to see us fight.

609
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,777
He'd want us to... sing.

610
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,490
Only those tea, no bags?

611
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:20,165
No bags. Cam found loose tea
leaves in the stomach contents.

612
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:24,228
Here's another one.
Malty Orange Assam.

613
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:27,356
Throw it in there.
We'll test it for the fugu poison.

614
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:07,181
Hank Reilly
was killed by a cup of tea.

615
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,965
Do you think he's smiling too much?

616
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,190
I think he just looks like
he's enjoying the party.

617
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,472
His funeral?

618
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,159
Where are his glasses?

619
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,547
He wore glasses? Oh, God.

620
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,548
Before I leave, could I say
a little something to Hank now?

621
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:41,847
Yeah, sure. Step right on up.

622
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,670
He looks...

623
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,698
Happy.

624
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,661
- You did a wonderful job.
- Thank you.

625
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,624
How should I know what kind
of tea Hank drank that morning?

626
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,540
You said you brewed it for him
every day, part of your routine.

627
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,095
That was in the eulogy speech.

628
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,135
No one tells the truth
in a eulogy speech.

629
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,058
All right, then
who did make his tea?

630
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,726
Hank did it himself.

631
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:30,813
The water had to be
the perfect temperature.

632
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:34,236
Hank was
very particular about his tea.

633
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,450
If there's nothing else,
I'm exhausted.

634
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,575
- His wife was cheating on him.
- He cheated on her.

635
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,172
- The assistant is still in play.
- What about the lawyer?

636
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,216
She seemed very nice.

637
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:05,015
Yeah, all right. So we are far from
an arrest here. Understand, people?

638
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,910
Well, at least we got Franklin Tung.

639
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:09,125
He didn't mean to kill anyone.
That's the...

640
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,186
- Cam? You here?
- What?

641
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,935
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,177
This smoking thing with Michele...

643
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,486
How do people be parents?

644
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,322
Do you ever think that
this is her way of

645
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,074
trying to stop you from smoking?

646
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:26,490
Cam doesn't smoke, right?

647
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:29,329
You stop, she'll stop.
It's that simple.

648
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,010
Plus, she's doing you a favor.

649
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,082
Great, so
I go from a smoking issue to

650
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,587
a chocolate cake
and ice cream issue?

651
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,591
You know what? You just...
you give your best shot and that's all.

652
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,344
Nobody knows about the poison
in the tea except us, right?

653
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,598
The murder does.

654
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,945
When crops failed, the ancient
Pothigai in southern India believed

655
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,518
that one of them might be
possessed by an evil spirit.

656
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,450
They would find out which one
by passing around a poison

657
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:56,415
which would kill only demons.

658
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,527
The person who refused to drink
the poison was proven possessed.

659
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,970
Okay, is this another way
to get me to quit smoking?

660
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:06,970
Because it's done. I quit.

661
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,157
You know what? You are a genius.
Absolute genius!

662
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:11,163
I know.

663
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,244
And though the human remains of Henry
Reilly will not physically rest here,

664
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,995
his soul will remain with
the generations of his family here

665
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,974
and in heaven.

666
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,392
I'd like to add something.

667
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,707
I missed my chance at the wake.
I'd like to make up for it.

668
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:37,300
No objections from the family?

669
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:41,375
Hank Reilly specialized in Egyptian
embalming rituals and practices.

670
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,594
He was an expert in grieving.

671
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,955
Hank would appreciate
nothing more than

672
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,530
the most common
of funerary practices:

673
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:52,737
the raising of a glass.

674
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,576
It's not alcohol,
but an even more ancient drink:

675
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,418
tea.

676
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:03,048
Hank's greatest passion,
aside from sex.

677
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,219
I took the liberty of bringing
this tea from Hank's personal stash.

678
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,098
The same tea he drank
on his last day with all of us.

679
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,450
I can think of no better way
of saying "adieu"

680
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,872
than to share one last cup of tea
with Hank.

681
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,652
To Hank.

682
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:28,607
No!

683
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,201
Jeez, Mom, watch what you're doing!

684
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,910
- You poisoned your own son?
- What?

685
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,410
- Mom, what's going on?
- He wasn't my son.

686
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:42,801
It wasn't fair of your father.
He work it so you got nothing.

687
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:45,094
He got everything.

688
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,009
You killed Hank?

689
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,640
This is my fault.

690
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,865
Oh, God.
This is why I hate funerals.

691
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,335
This is why I love them.

692
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,215
I told Hank that Annie
was trying to get around the will

693
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,255
by siphoning money into a
separate trust for Barney.

694
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,735
But it was illegal.

695
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:08,658
If you'd kept your nosy trap
shut, Hank would still be alive.

696
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:13,505
Bob, this is all your fault.

697
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,580
You brought this on yourself.

698
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:18,498
Do what you're going to do.

699
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,951
What's the worst that could happen?

700
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,723
Mom, Mom, Mom...

701
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,852
One thing for sure, Barney,
your mother loved you.

702
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,066
She used her own heart medicine

703
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:43,565
to kill your brother,
so you would get your fair share.

704
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,674
She mixed it in his tea.

705
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:49,479
And she died because she ran
out of her medicine killing him.

706
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:53,287
Oh, Ma... I would've done fine.

707
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,440
Hank,
I didn't want the money this way.

708
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,910
I know you would have done
right by me. I know it.

709
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,088
Would you excuse me, please?

710
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:06,905
Of course.

711
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,796
He wants to be alone with
his mother and brother.

712
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:13,261
By that way of thinking,

713
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:16,014
he wants to be alone with every person
who has ever died.

714
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,143
- If I die, I want you to do me a favor.
- Well, you will die, It's inevitable.

715
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,480
All right, whatever, Bones.
When I inevitably drop dead before you,

716
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:25,308
I'd like you to come out and,

717
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,484
spend some time and talk to me
every once in a while.

718
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:30,362
Well, I'll feel foolish
knowing that you can't hear me.

719
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:32,781
Promise me.

720
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,870
I promise.

721
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,772
There you go.

722
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:45,015
You agreed. I didn't think you
would agree. Now, why did you agree?

723
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,791
I believe that if I pretended
you were still here,

724
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,798
 I'd feel better for a moment.

725
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:53,252
Also, speaking to you
would require me to

726
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:56,263
figuratively look at myself
through your eyes,

727
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,831
again temporarily.

728
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,001
I think that would make me
live my life more successfully.

729
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:07,223
You know what, Bones?
That is the best thing that anyone

730
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,998
has ever said about me.

731
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,835
I'll say it at your wake.

732
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,404
It's raining now. Come on.

733
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:14,720
Get on, umbrella. It's raining.

734
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:17,229
Just make sure when they put
me in the ground, I'm dead.

735
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:18,664
- No problem.
- All right?

736
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,089
Maybe, you know,

737
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:23,455
leave my body out for a few hours
and check on me every once in a while.

738
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,640
I'd rather refrigerate you,
or else you'd start to smell.

739
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,352
