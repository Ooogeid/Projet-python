1
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:07,293
Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins,
Mr. Vega, thank you for coming.

2
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:09,788
You get a "notice to appear"
from a federal judge.

3
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,302
- You appear?
- I assume

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,583
this has something to do
with the Grave Digger.

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,181
The only thing the 3 of us
have in common is that kidnapper.

6
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:19,101
My name is Heather Taffet.
I'm the United States Attorney

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,425
assigned to the Grave Digger case
last month.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,735
- What happened to Ms. Kurland?
- She was killed

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,321
in a car accident in Boston.

10
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:28,527
You think the Grave Digger had Kurland
killed because she was getting close?

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,015
She wasn't getting close.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,067
She was barely conducting
an investigation.

13
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,367
Nothing has moved in
the Grave Digger case in months.

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,108
It turns out something did move.

15
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,975
Some evidence has gone missing.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,894
You suspect that one of us
stole Grave Digger evidence?

17
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:43,376
From the FBI?

18
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,003
Mr. Vega is a former FBI agent

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,048
as well as a best-selling author
on the Grave Digger.

20
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,909
- You both contract out to the FBI...
- Let me make this very clear:

21
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,930
if any of you has any evidence
linked to the Grave Digger case,

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,141
I am ordering you as a federal judge
to turn it over to Ms. Taffet.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,644
Turn it over to me today,
and you get full immunity.

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,064
Look at that.

25
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,934
Oh, it's got to be Bones,
I guarantee ya.

26
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,237
Yep. I'm hurrying, Bones.

27
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:14,448
- Do you need directions?
- No, I do not need directions,

28
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,504
because I am driving.

29
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,121
My GPS can provide perfect
directions in several languages.

30
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,072
Well, get this.
Okay, Parker

31
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:23,811
got me this new watch

32
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,876
and it does the same thing.

33
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,454
- In several languages?
- No.

34
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,963
Then it's not the same thing.

35
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,350
I bet you are looking beautiful?

36
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:35,052
Because I am in the finest tux
that money can rent.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,804
I'm on my way home to get dressed,

38
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,433
you need to be there an hour and a half
before me to watch the tribute video.

39
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,061
My GPS indicates that it is
a 25 minute drive for you.

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,511
- This is my big night.
- All right, listen, don't worry.

41
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:48,855
I will be there when they crown
you super scientist.

42
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,235
I will be the guy
in the cocky belt buckle

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,353
and the snazzy rented tux.

44
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,784
- Someone's knocking on my door.
- How can there be a knock

45
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,012
at your door
if you're already driving?

46
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:05,040
- You're late.
- I know.

47
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,394
It took my longer
to get dressed than I thought.

48
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,836
But don't worry,
my GPS will get us there on time.

49
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:12,034
It's not a time machine, sweetie.

50
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,651
I call shotgun.

51
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,123
No.

52
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,337
I have taken Seeley Booth.

53
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,965
He has been buried alive.

54
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,642
He has 21 hours to live.

55
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:27,154
Bring the evidence
to the SW5 DC boundary stone

56
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,357
in return for which
you will receive GPS coordinates.

57
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,777
If you involve law enforcement,
I will know

58
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:35,196
and Seeley Booth will die.

59
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,634
This is my final communication.

60
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,869
What's going on?

61
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,291
The Grave Digger has Booth.

62
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,964
He's not here. I told you.

63
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,538
I was hoping it was like a prank call
or something.

64
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,770
- The door was locked.
- What does that mean?

65
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:21,679
I doubt that the Grave Digger
would take the time to...

66
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:23,957
Give me the shoe.

67
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:27,072
Would take the time to lock
the front door on his way out.

68
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,208
Yeah, especially lugging 190 pounds
of unconscious Booth.

69
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:39,892
He was dragged to the window.

70
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,012
Oh, my God.

71
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,808
Okay, all right,
we need to call the authorities.

72
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,753
We're in way over our heads here.

73
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,645
No. I read up on this guy.

74
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,437
If we want Booth back,
we need to pay the ransom.

75
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,149
The Grave Digger wanted evidence.

76
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,420
- What evidence?
- It has to be the same

77
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:59,411
that the state attorney and the FBI
think that I have, which I don't.

78
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,616
- What... What are you doing?
- They called in Hodgins, too.

79
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,452
- You think he stole the evidence?
- I know you didn't.

80
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,679
Bones - Season 04 Episode 14

83
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,162
- Could you stop that, please?
- I was just working off adrenaline.

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,978
How long ago did the Grave Digger
get Booth? What kind of time do we have?

85
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,456
I know you have
what the Grave Digger wants.

86
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,828
The evidence that the judge
told us about.

87
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,922
The Grave Digger
thinks that I have it.

88
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,783
But he's wrong. It's you.

89
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:45,997
Give it to me.

90
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,504
Who's there?

91
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,766
- Who's that?
- It's me.

92
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,369
Who's me?

93
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,272
Best buddy you ever had.

94
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,105
Your words.

95
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,233
Teddy?

96
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,366
This isn't real.

97
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,730
I'm gonna go with real.
Nice monkey suit, by the way.

98
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:56,498
I never would have thought
to go formal to a kidnapping.

99
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,031
Look, no... no offense,
but, you know, I've been...

100
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,600
I've been drugged, electrocuted,

101
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,987
stuffed in a Beatles toy.

102
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,007
You're...

103
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,177
You're an hallucination,
that's what you are... an hallucination.

104
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,051
That's nice.
I show up to help you,

105
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,016
and you toss me off
as a hallucination.

106
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,730
You're dead, Corporal.
I felt your heart stop.

107
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,229
No use crying
over spilt milk, Sarge.

108
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:22,621
You know what? This isn't real.
I am going to focus

109
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,443
on what is real, right?

110
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,673
Real,
like getting out of this place. Okay.

111
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,949
Nah, Sarge, it's too high.
How about that one?

112
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,396
I already saw that.
You're getting competive

113
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,038
with a hallucination.

114
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,042
What? Oh, right. Nah, still here.

115
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,659
You really haven't changed, Sarge.

116
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,924
Once you knew what had to be done,

117
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,598
nothing could stop you.

118
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:51,206
- Enough already, okay?
- Yes, sir, Sergeant.

119
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,559
I got this.

120
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,515
Hey, look at that, making progress.

121
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,153
There.

122
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:12,719
- That's everything.
- The judge was after a specific piece.

123
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,618
Something that you stole
from the FBI.

124
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,710
I remember that.

125
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,713
- That was embedded in your leg.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,915
Probably came off
the bumper of the vehicle

127
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,772
the Grave Digger used
to run me over.

128
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:33,139
That would be shortly before
he buried me alive.

129
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,282
With me.

130
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:39,017
Pretty close to
discovering the manufacturer.

131
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,105
Which will help us narrow down
the suspect pool.

132
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,233
Booth doesn't have
that kind of time.

133
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:50,112
- What is that?
- Evidence that the Grave Digger wants.

134
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,781
Sweets, you shouldn't be here.

135
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,950
The Grave Digger said
no FBI involvement.

136
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,911
- I'm a psychologist, not a agent.
- An FBI psychologist.

137
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,539
Dr. Sweets, get gone now.

138
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,976
You stole evidence?

139
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,224
You don't know what it was like...

140
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,554
being buried in that car.

141
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,640
- I do. I was there.
- I know.

142
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,947
And if we turn over that evidence,
we will never catch the Grave Digger.

143
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,666
Booth only has 19 hours.

144
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,734
OK, OK, then let's just take 10 of those
hours and see if we can do both.

145
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,157
I'm telling you the answer is there.

146
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,206
Ten hours.

147
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:55,302
Eight.
And Dr. Hodgins is never left alone.

148
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,893
- You don't trust him?
- No, I don't.

149
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,824
I scanned the new recording.

150
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,103
Bring the evidence to the SW5 DC
boundary stone

151
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,458
in return for which you will receive
GPS coordinates.

152
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,991
If you involved
law enforcement, I will know

153
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,077
and Seeley Booth will die.

154
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,975
This is my final communication.

155
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,616
Along with the recording that
the Grave Digger gave when

156
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,729
you and Hodgins were kidnapped.

157
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:21,620
You okay to hear that?

158
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,417
Temperance Brennan and Jack Hodgins
have been buried alive.

159
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:31,588
Wire transfer $8 million
to the following Grand Cayman accounts

160
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,418
or they will suffocate to death.

161
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,332
... and Seeley Booth will die.

162
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,596
... or they will suffocate to death.

163
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,562
Now, despite the voice scrambler,

164
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,986
I was able to extract
specific phonemes

165
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,982
by running the waveform through
a Fourier Transform.

166
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,730
Graphically, they're identical.

167
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,691
Can we hear the unscrambled voice?

168
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,901
No, the coding was too complicated.

169
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:56,397
But the voice scrambler
was triggered to compress

170
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,031
at a certain set level.

171
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,523
Now, in this case,

172
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,119
it was set to the volume
of a human voice.

173
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,454
So when the Grave Digger
isn't speaking...

174
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,957
The background noise
pops into the foreground,

175
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,713
uncompressed.

176
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,453
What is that?

177
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,845
I'm... still working on that.

178
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,720
Sorry, I...

179
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,922
We'll get Booth back.

180
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,740
You can't know that.

181
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:28,250
- I just think that...
- Just...

182
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:29,810
work, please.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,986
Let me try another algorithm.

184
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:39,265
Birds?

185
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,083
Gulls. Seagulls.

186
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,078
The Grave Digger was near the water.

187
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,003
Fresh one?

188
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,715
What?
Hallucinations can't help out a little?

189
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,867
- Give me that.
- You're welcome.

190
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,780
No, Sarge, pry with your legs.

191
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,683
Watch you don't hurt your back.

192
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:08,685
That can't be good.

193
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,276
Hang on, Teddy,
you're gonna make it.

194
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,358
Might want to close that up, Sarge.

195
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:27,582
Hey, guys.

196
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:31,208
There was no voice match, but
there was a point of origin on the call.

197
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,260
- Seagulls?
- I talked to Booth

198
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,008
an hour and 47 minutes
before I got the ransom call.

199
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,052
That merry-go-round...

200
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,981
The boardwalk.
King's Beach boardwalk.

201
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:46,196
I got it.

202
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,689
Vega lives in a penthouse apartment
just off the boardwalk.

203
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:01,655
You think this is my fault.

204
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,033
If you hadn't stolen the evidence,
he would never have taken Booth.

205
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,264
Rationally speaking,
it was inevitable.

206
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,817
It would have happened
anytime we got close.

207
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,374
Is that Vega's car?

208
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,788
- Who is that?
- It's Vega.

209
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:27,681
He's dead.

210
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:37,190
Looks like he was killed somewhere else
and then placed here.

211
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,824
We should take his body
back to the lab.

212
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,956
Obviously,
the Grave Digger killed him.

213
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:43,893
There's got to be evidence
that we can use.

214
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:45,858
Remove a body from a crime scene?

215
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,662
That would be a very bad idea.
Step away from the car, please.

216
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,745
Agent Perotta.

217
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,643
Look, if the water rises up
far enough,

218
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,625
I'll be able to get to that door
and open it.

219
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,420
What, the room isn't filling up
quickly enough for you already?

220
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,487
You were here for an interview?

221
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,423
He was writing
"Surviving the Grave Digger".

222
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:17,770
- He wanted to talk to us.
- At 5:00 in the morning?

223
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,357
It was a breakfast meeting.

224
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,449
- Were you following us, Agent Perotta?
- Yes, Dr. Brennan, I was.

225
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:25,421
You two are suspected
of stealing evidence.

226
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:27,491
This doesn't exactly
clear you of suspicion.

227
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,864
Well, was he under surveillance?

228
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:32,138
Because a fat lot of good
the FBI did him.

229
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:35,373
Well, it appears that he was the one
who had the evidence.

230
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,293
- Are we free to go now?
- Why not?

231
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,371
They have us under surveillance.

232
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:42,532
I'll be in touch.

233
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:55,268
Tell you what, you were always the guy
to be with in a tough spot.

234
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,234
You never said anything
like that, Sarge.

235
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,981
Mostly, you just grunted,
made me get coffee.

236
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:04,861
You think what's behind, hatch is gonna
be better than the last thing we opened?

237
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,114
I'll tell you what, I'm either gonna
drown fast or really, really slow.

238
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,413
Coming up pretty fast here, Sarge.

239
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,002
Vega's dead.

240
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:20,001
Vega's dead.
Right, like murdered dead?

241
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,753
We had no opportunity to

242
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,277
to examine the remains before
the FBI interrupted us.

243
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,799
What? FBI?

244
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,926
Yep, FBI Special Agent Perotta.

245
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,434
We're going to swing by,
pick up the evidence

246
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,315
and deliver it to the Grave Digger.

247
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:35,267
- You mean just do what he wants?
- We have no other choice.

248
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,624
You spoke to the FBI.

249
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,693
We didn't talk to the FBI,
they talked to us.

250
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,657
I don't think the Grave Digger's gonna
take that into consideration.

251
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:45,423
We still have time to catch
the Grave Digger and to save Booth.

252
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:47,237
- The odds are not acceptable.
- Why?

253
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,257
- Because we don't have Booth to help!
- Let's be clear here.

254
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,661
What we intend to do next
constitutes felony conspiracy.

255
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,936
Not you.
Me. I can do it alone.

256
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,622
No, no.

257
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,714
Nobody does anything alone.

258
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,606
Vega was alone.

259
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,676
What's the hell
is that supposed to be for?

260
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:14,439
It's a fulcrum, Sarge.

261
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,349
We... both work it together.

262
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,749
There, right there.
Ready?

263
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,577
- All right, get in.
- Real people go first, Sarge.

264
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:38,229
Get in before
I change my mind, will you?

265
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,567
Okay, get-get a grip, Sarge.
You're attacking your own hallucination.

266
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,445
Only you are not an hallucination.

267
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,281
You helped me open up that hatch.
I wouldn't have been able to open up

268
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,534
without you.

269
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,159
So what does that make me?

270
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,453
You are a ghost.

271
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,947
I'm a ghost?

272
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,242
Hey, why aren't you scared?

273
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:30,298
You being a ghost is not even
on the list of things that scare me.

274
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,336
I kept telling you, I said,
"Learn to pick a lock."

275
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,268
- You remember your response, Sarge?
- Yeah.

276
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,008
"Any lock worth picking
is worth kicking."

277
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:46,481
And I still stand by it.

278
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,680
Hey, please, stand by it.

279
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,613
Advice like that, it's a miracle
I lived as long as I did.

280
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,591
- You got a cuff link?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,527
Twenty.

282
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,256
What's that?

283
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:09,388
You were 20 years old when you died.

284
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:11,937
Still am. You, Sarge,

285
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:14,300
I got to say,
you've put a couple years on.

286
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,954
Is it true that the 30s is when your
body really starts going south on you?

287
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,726
- Hey, you got any kids, Sarge?
- Yeah, I got a boy.

288
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,568
What's his name?

289
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,070
Ah, you're probably
gonna take this wrong.

290
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,667
Why? What'd you do?

291
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,278
You name him something stupid,
like Cutter?

292
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,349
What, Tanner? Brady?

293
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,951
Oh, God, you didn't name him
Sebastian?

294
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:44,895
Parker.

295
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,781
I named him Parker.

296
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,177
That's my name.

297
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,523
It's your last name.

298
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,845
You know,
and your lock picking sucks.

299
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,557
You named your kid after me?

300
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,018
Yeah.

301
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,414
- What's he like?
- He's just like a kid, you know?

302
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,233
But, he's even better.

303
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,149
- Does he like you?
- Of course he likes me.

304
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,172
He loves me.
I'm his dad, you know?

305
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:14,991
He even got me this watch.

306
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,583
- What about his mom?
- Yeah, she... she likes me.

307
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,259
But...

308
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:23,204
she didn't love me.

309
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,441
- You loved her though?
- Of course I loved her.

310
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,175
I still do. I just...

311
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,629
I just don't like her too much.

312
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,308
You saw I picked the lock, right?

313
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,597
We're on a ship.

314
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,266
- Sarge?
- Yeah.

315
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,437
This particular ship ain't gonna be
floating much longer.

316
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,335
C-4 explosives.

317
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,119
There's a boundary
stone through the clearing.

318
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,443
This is weird...

319
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,880
Something nearby is
broadcasting a video signal.

320
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,971
There.
A camera.

321
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,138
Up in that tree.

322
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,797
That's how the grave digger will see
that we brought what he wants.

323
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:29,946
I might be able to hack into
the camera's broadcast frequency.

324
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,502
I got to say, doesn't seem
to be the smartest move

325
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:34,774
to just hand over this evidence.
We need to be rational.

326
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,199
We should maximize the chances
to catch the grave digger,

327
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,028
not minimize them.

328
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,296
Listen to me, Brennan.

329
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,410
Somebody you love is buried alive.

330
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,857
You're allowed to save them,
no matter how irrational.

331
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,706
- I don't love Booth.
- Yes, you do.

332
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,041
So do I.
So do all of us.

333
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:56,204
Just take my advice, and hand
over the evidence and get Booth.

334
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,654
Let's do it.
Come on, let's do it.

335
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,762
Watch your monitor.
Tell me if anything changes, okay?

336
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,098
- By anything, you mean...
- Anything.

337
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,590
Okay, I'm in.

338
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,183
I've locked into the video feed.

339
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:21,435
I hate this guy.

340
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,439
I mean, I really, really hate him.

341
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,156
I will find you!

342
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,639
Did you do that?

343
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,479
That's the grave digger.
It's the vial he's after.

344
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,930
God, and his receiver's
within a 500-yard radius.

345
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,498
He's really close.

346
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,727
Oh, Angela, this pointy
bit here just got way pointier.

347
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,229
- At what frequency?
- 2.2 something.

348
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,243
Oh, my god!

349
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:59,067
What? That signal's
not coming from the camera.

350
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,352
Get back!

351
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:02,323
Run!

352
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:03,448
Run!

353
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:05,198
Go, go! Go!

354
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,170
What the hell is going on here?

355
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,029
- You okay?
- Yeah. Come on.

356
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:25,652
We followed Dr. Brennan's
car to the boundary stone.

357
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,553
We arrived moments
after the explosion.

358
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,571
- What the hell were you people doing?
- We have nothing to say.

359
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:33,768
We found evidence at the crime scene

360
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,104
believed to be related
to the grave digger investigation.

361
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,949
I believe they returned
evidence to the grave digger.

362
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,764
Agent perotta, you will deny all
of these people access to this case.

363
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,951
May I make a request, your honor?

364
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,890
I'd like to see
Thomas Vega's remains.

365
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:48,533
- I need to examine them immediately.
- You will examine nothing.

366
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,786
You people will stay away from
anything to do with the grave digger.

367
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,203
We're in a ship

368
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,881
stuffed with toys and explosives.

369
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:08,294
And that make some
kind of sense to you?

370
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,998
What they do, Sarge,
is they sink ships for reefs.

371
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,826
They get school kids
to do all the decorating.

372
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:14,951
Why?

373
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,697
The fish.
Why else?

374
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,494
Fish love decorations.

375
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,355
Here's the transponder.

376
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:28,072
We have six hours
and 23 minutes here.

377
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:29,490
What, no ideas?

378
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,535
According to you, I'm already a ghost.
As a result, I got no sense of urgency.

379
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,560
Hang on.

380
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,495
Maybe we can use the transponder

381
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,665
- to send a signal.
- But that's the only fail-safe.

382
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,383
Once you disconnect the transponder,

383
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:41,525
nothing can stop the ship
from blowing to hell

384
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,504
in six hours and 22 minutes.

385
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,702
Sense of urgency now?

386
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,792
It's been almost two hours.

387
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,141
Why hasn't the grave digger
sent us Booth's coordinates?

388
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,099
I think we have to accept that the
grave digger isn't gonna release Booth.

389
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:59,391
- He's cleaning up.
- Cleaning up?

390
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,055
He destroyed the evidence,

391
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,567
now he's trying to destroy everyone
who had gotten close to him.

392
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,110
- Vega, agent Booth, you and Hodgins.
- It's over.

393
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:07,403
Booth's dead.

394
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,198
It's my fault.
We're out of options.

395
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,704
No. No, it's not over.

396
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:15,329
And I know exactly
who to ask for help.

397
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,879
So what's so important you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

398
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,583
Your brother has been
kidnapped by the grave digger.

399
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,258
Seeley's been kidnapped?
When?

400
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,575
Booth will be dead in six hours.

401
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,292
What I need for you to do...

402
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,933
is hijack the remains of a murder
victim and then bring them to me.

403
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,061
I'm in military intelligence.
We don't hijack dead bodies.

404
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,951
The victim's name is Thomas Vega.

405
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:45,516
So you want me to steal the remains
of a murder victim from the FBI?

406
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:46,400
Yes.

407
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,014
- As soon as possible, please.
- I can make a few calls...

408
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:52,073
No, this is not a situation
where you make a few phone calls.

409
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,763
That's who I am, tempe.

410
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:55,493
I am the guy who makes a few calls.

411
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,745
Booth has never turned
his back on you.

412
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,998
You are a selfish coward
and you never deserved him.

413
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,297
We can feed the transponder's
signal through the...

414
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,966
ship's antennae.

415
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,844
You taught me sometimes you
gotta stand and fight and sometimes

416
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,263
you gotta run like hell for help.

417
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:21,980
Hang on, teddy.

418
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:23,767
Stay with me.

419
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:24,772
Sarge?

420
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,701
Sarge?

421
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:34,227
We never should have
gone on that last mission.

422
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:40,641
I mean...

423
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:45,214
Taking out another sniper,
that was...

424
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:48,129
It was way beyond your capabilities.

425
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,170
It was...
You couldn't have...

426
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,392
That's why you're haunting me,
right? You're...

427
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,932
Can't an old army buddy just
show up to lend a helping hand?

428
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:04,892
Yeah.

429
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:11,949
You got a partner now?

430
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:14,572
You two tight?

431
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:20,473
Yeah, we're, uh...
You would, you'd like her. She's...

432
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:21,598
Her?

433
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:24,980
- Way to go, sarge.
- Look, just focus here, all right?

434
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,145
Corporal, all right, whoever...

435
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,944
is monitoring the... sinking...

436
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,743
of the ship should be able
to pick up the signal, right?

437
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,009
Very cool, sir.

438
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:46,863
You shorted it out.
It's useless now.

439
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:47,988
No.

440
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,817
No.

441
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,071
Look, don't worry, sarge.

442
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,406
Hey, at least we still
got this flashlight.

443
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,457
Vega's remains.

444
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,875
Thank you.

445
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,388
So, just to sum things up,

446
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,931
the ship's about to explode,
and now there's no way to stop it.

447
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:24,928
Rub it in.
I got you killed twice.

448
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,210
Where we going?

449
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:27,897
We got to get out of here.

450
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,944
Even if we get up out on the deck,
we're gonna have to jump into the ocean.

451
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,124
That's right.

452
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,726
Where if the fall doesn't kill us,
we'll get hypothermia and drown.

453
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:36,651
Oh, no, I get hypothermia and drown.

454
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,281
Who knows what'll happen to you.

455
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,457
If you die, sarge, i'm gone.

456
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:43,068
There's not a single person left
on the planet who will rember me.

457
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:45,083
It'd be like I was never here.

458
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,208
No.

459
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,139
- No?
- No, there's...

460
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:50,793
There's that girl.
She won't forget you.

461
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,458
You mean claire?

462
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,586
Yeah, claire.

463
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,661
You know, every day
on the anniversary of your death,

464
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:00,729
I go to your grave and I visit you and
there's always flowers from her there.

465
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:03,889
- You ever see her?
- From a distance, yeah.

466
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,600
- Why don't you talk to her?
- 'cause she blames me for your death.

467
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,978
- That's crazy.
- That's not crazy.

468
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,977
I blame me, too.

469
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,336
Here we go.

470
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,676
- Sarge?
- Yeah?

471
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:22,533
Tomorrow's the anniversary.
I need a favor.

472
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,601
If I survive this, anything.

473
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,665
I need you to tell
claire I loved her.

474
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,150
- You never told her?
- I was 20.

475
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,579
- I didn't know how to say it.
- Well, you say "i love you."

476
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,213
I mean, what's so hard about that?

477
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,216
What, you've never loved
somebody and didn't say it to 'em?

478
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,212
See? Maybe that's why I'm here.

479
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,960
Get you to say
I love you to somebody.

480
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:49,392
- We can get through here.
- Get through the solid metal wall?

481
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,841
No, the stairs.
You see? The stairs...

482
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,107
the thinnest interior bulkhead of
a ship is gonna be along the stairs.

483
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,860
We're gonna blast
our way through this.

484
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,073
Rigor indicates he's
been dead less than 24 hours.

485
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,903
About the same time
Booth disappeared.

486
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:07,027
Vega must have been killed just
after we were threatened by that judge.

487
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,621
Two full-thickness burns

488
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,706
to the posterior
triangle of the neck

489
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,193
corresponding with
a high-amperage stun gun.

490
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,585
Stun gun.

491
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,780
How did you pull this off?

492
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:21,175
It's masked as a military intelligence
operation, National security.

493
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:23,135
How long before
they find out the truth?

494
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,065
- Not long if you keep talking so loud.
- You're gonna get in trouble, Jared.

495
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,940
Definitely lose your job.

496
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,213
I'm aware.

497
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:31,338
These burn marks are
not in the usual place.

498
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:32,849
On all the other victims,

499
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:35,523
they were equidistant from
the inferior nuchal line.

500
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,443
This time they're angled
about four centimeters to the right.

501
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,524
This is deep.

502
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,323
The stun gun was held here
near his heart for an extended time.

503
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,826
Caused fatal fibrillation.
That'll be cause of death.

504
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:53,277
Here's a hairline fracture

505
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,960
to the olecranon process
of the right ulna.

506
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,045
- What does that mean?
- The victim damaged his

507
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,382
right medial and lateral epicondyles
as well as his coronoid fossa,

508
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,218
possibly consistent with a defensive

509
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,512
response to a posterior assault.

510
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,472
Our victim got
a piece of the bad guy.

511
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:11,600
He elbowed the assailant.
Striking someone that hard,

512
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,020
there's going to be damage,
at least broken ribs.

513
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:22,486
Got it.

514
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,029
Good job, kid.

515
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,966
What the hell is
that supposed to be.

516
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,460
A well-shaped charge.

517
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:28,826
It's a mermaid, get it?

518
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:31,006
It's not sexist 'cause
she's mostly fish.

519
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,131
All right.

520
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:33,256
Okay.

521
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,410
All we need now is a power source.

522
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,884
Right, that's what
the flashlight was for.

523
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,514
I have an injunction here reclaiming

524
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,350
- jurisdiction in this case.
- On what grounds?

525
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:58,564
One missing FBI agent is
not a case of national security.

526
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,794
Grab a coffee, guys.

527
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,656
Do you have the warrant?

528
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,339
Right here, signed by the judge.

529
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:14,866
I don't think there's any more
reason for us

530
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:17,047
to keep the truth from Ms. Taffet.

531
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:19,090
No, wait,
the grave digger said that we...

532
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:21,603
You've been in touch
with the grave digger?

533
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,881
The grave digger has agent Booth?

534
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,008
She can't seem to extend her arm.

535
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,301
What?

536
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,055
What do you think?

537
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,097
About what?

538
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,990
It's possible.

539
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,421
She had complete access
to FBI files and evidence.

540
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:43,275
Nobody wanted the grave digger case.
It's a career killer.

541
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,653
But with kurland out of the way...

542
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,072
Have you injured yourself recently,
Ms. Taffet?

543
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,988
What the hell does
that have to do with anything?

544
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,726
Don't let dr. Hodgins go.

545
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,970
Could I see the warrant, please?

546
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:01,760
Broken ribs.

547
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,654
She's the grave digger?

548
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,798
- It's her.
- Can you prove it?

549
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,758
No, we can't.
Is that a problem?

550
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:09,666
Not for me.

551
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,139
You got a place to lock her up?

552
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,956
Where's Booth?

553
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,897
- She's not gonna say anything.
- You haven't even asked.

554
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,141
Yeah, I've read extensively
on the grave digger.

555
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:27,861
I'm acquainted with the profile.
Very intelligent, very calm.

556
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:29,171
She won't speak.

557
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:31,615
- Then what do we do?
- You have to do spring cleaning on her.

558
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,688
What is that?

559
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,274
Is that some kind of torture?

560
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,688
Nothing.
It doesn't exist.

561
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:39,164
The government keeps secret, black,
illegal files on every U.S. citizen.

562
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,292
It's called spring cleaning,
'cause everything's

563
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,466
brought out into the light
and turned upside down.

564
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,744
O- okay,
that is complete paranoia, right?

565
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,507
I'll need access
to a secure terminal.

566
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,760
Follow me.

567
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,469
And only conspiracy nuts
call it spring cleaning.

568
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:58,636
Sarge?

569
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,729
Corporal Parker, I really need you to
stifle yourself at this juncture, okay?

570
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,188
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

571
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:06,191
I mean, if these two leads touch,
that explodes, you become Booth jam.

572
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,376
That's correct.

573
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,195
Or if, say, a bead of sweat
completes the circuit, then...

574
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,408
- Can I ask you one question?
- What is it, corporal?

575
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,437
It's just,

576
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:18,113
how are you gonna complete the circuit
from a 100 yards away, at which

577
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:19,872
distance you might
survive the blast?

578
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,832
One thing at a time, okay?

579
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,350
First time I've ever
heard of a cowardly ghost...

580
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:27,588
What a wuss.

581
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,471
I'd like to kill you.

582
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,389
I hate her.

583
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,092
I think I could murder her.

584
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,951
If any group of people could murder
someone and get away with it,

585
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,107
it'll be us.

586
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,401
I'm not gonna ask you any questions.

587
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm just gonna tell you
what's going on right now.

588
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,947
I went through your file.

589
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,447
As heather taffet, you have
lead a very tiny, transparent life.

590
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,078
But in 1998,

591
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,359
you married a man
named william burton

592
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:04,878
for exactly one month before
you had the marriage annulled.

593
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,615
Which was long enough to create

594
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,337
an entire identity,

595
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:11,632
a whole, untraceable identity...

596
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:16,431
which you used for
one thing and one thing only.

597
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,319
To rent a storage
locker in spring hill.

598
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,111
I gotcha, bitch.

599
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:42,496
- I got to get closer.
- You're too close now, sarge.

600
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,460
You're too close.
I'll get it.

601
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,396
I'll get it.

602
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,676
Teddy...

603
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,900
you got to get your hands
on some truth-telling drugs.

604
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:15,821
- What?
- Would you rather torture her?

605
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:19,177
- I know a little bit about that.
- No. What? We don't do that.

606
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:20,253
Booth will die.

607
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:22,077
Character is
who you are under pressure,

608
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,238
not who you are when
everything's fine.

609
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:26,363
We're the good guys,
we don't torture people.

610
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:28,667
Evidence is being compiled against
you as we speak,

611
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,294
Tell us where agent Booth is.

612
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,285
You don't want another
murder on your head.

613
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,566
That's not gonna work.

614
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:35,990
Her pathology necessitates
controlling the game.

615
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:39,367
- She's created her own morality...
- She's not gonna relinquish control.

616
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:41,764
They brought in everything
from her storage locker.

617
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,255
Okay, back to work, everybody.

618
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,444
- Teddy?
- Yeah?

619
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,540
I can't see very well.

620
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:54,180
I looked at the flash.

621
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,706
You're okay? Yeah?

622
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,716
I think I could use some help.

623
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:06,497
Is that light?

624
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,253
Did we find a way out?

625
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,126
- You always find a way out, sarge.
- I'll be your legs.

626
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:14,396
You be my eyes.
Come on, Teddy.

627
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,839
Which way, corporal?

628
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,595
Towards the light.

629
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,260
Oh, that sounds bad, huh?

630
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,057
"Move towards the light."

631
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,376
Hold up... These boots
were worn recently.

632
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:29,770
Hey, Jared,
can I see your black file

633
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,688
of spring cleaning or whatever?

634
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,777
- The contents are on my pda.
- Talk to me while you analyze.

635
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,190
Aedes sollicitans...
It's a common marsh mosquito.

636
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:43,127
- Blood's still in its gut.
- Indicating it was worn how recently?

637
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:45,567
At least in the last
24 hours for sure, but...

638
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:46,892
Wait a second.

639
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,289
I got some paint chips here.

640
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,136
Run it through the mass spec, see if
there's anything about that paint.

641
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:53,511
Yep. I'm on it.

642
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,068
You still with me, teddy?

643
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:57,193
Yeah.

644
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,191
But I got to tell you,
I feel like we've kind of...

645
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,567
been here before.

646
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:03,095
I'm sorry I got you killed.

647
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:06,932
I was so anxious to get off that shot,
take out my target, that I forgot

648
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,320
to tell you...

649
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,796
You told me to get down twice.

650
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,129
You gave the order,
and I didn't listen.

651
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:17,254
What?

652
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,861
Sarge... Stop.

653
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:22,787
I didn't come here to haunt you.

654
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:26,434
I came to tell you
it wasn't your fault.

655
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,474
Active amine hydrogen,
epoxy, hydroxyapatite and silica.

656
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,351
It's an obsolete composition

657
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,318
of deck coating used
by the navy prior to 1961.

658
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,944
So she was on a navy vessel
within the last 24 hours?

659
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,693
Yes. Yeah, an old one...

660
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,111
- Most likely decommissioned.
- Wait a minute, a ship?

661
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,279
Listen to this.

662
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:05,287
Taffet was a volunteer
at the aquarium.

663
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:07,618
They were prepping some
sort of old navy ship to be sunk.

664
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,146
- What?
- They're making some sort of reef.

665
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,896
The navy's not afraid
of explosions or sinking ships.

666
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,460
Plus, it'll really annoy my brother,
the army ranger, to be saved by a squid.

667
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,504
Brennan, they know where Booth is.

668
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:22,674
Jared is getting
a helicopter to take you there.

669
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,592
He's on an old navy ship.

670
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,637
You can put me down, sarge.

671
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:38,963
- You don't have to carry me anymore.
- Doesn't work that way, teddy.

672
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,824
Jared, can you hear me?
I'm patched through via cell phone.

673
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,264
Jared, I don't understand, why aren't
you here in the helicopter with me?

674
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:49,252
Typical navy red tape,
nothing to worry about.

675
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,381
But listen,
they couldn't cancel the detonation.

676
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:53,914
- Something wrong with the transponder.
- What do we do now?

677
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,482
The ship blows in 9 minutes...

678
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,982
The navy's only giving you five
to get there and get Seeley off.

679
00:38:58,107 --> 00:39:00,112
No, Jared! Booth could
be anywhere on that ship!

680
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,700
5 minutes is not enough time!

681
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,508
These guys don't negotiate, tempe.
They won't risk any more lives.

682
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,936
Are you all right?

683
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:09,061
It's all worth it as
long as you save my brother.

684
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:14,777
Rangers lead the way, sarge.

685
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:16,952
Rangers lead the way, corporal.

686
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,780
There. All right?

687
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,630
Sarge.

688
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,324
I knew what you did for me.

689
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:32,035
How far you carried me.

690
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,023
Sarge.

691
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,335
One more thing I got to tell you.

692
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:48,051
No way you're getting
the deposit back on that tux.

693
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:55,330
Booth!

694
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:56,810
Hurry! Come on!

695
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,107
Hurry, Booth! Come on!

696
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,505
Booth, come on! Hurry!

697
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,061
Thanks for coming to get me, bones.

698
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,936
You should have stayed
in the hospital another day.

699
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,507
No, I didn't mean...

700
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:46,234
getting me out of the hospital,
I meant...

701
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,140
coming out on
the helicopter to the ship.

702
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,740
Thanks for saving my life.

703
00:40:54,837 --> 00:40:56,097
I got you this.

704
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,459
Cocky! How'd you find that?

705
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,127
That's hard to find.

706
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:07,047
I read through your report.

707
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:11,023
Seems you would need two
people to do most of what you did.

708
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:13,595
I had help.

709
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,005
There was a ghost.

710
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,934
You were... injured,

711
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,771
drugged, disoriented,
breathing bad air.

712
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,940
There are no such things as ghosts.

713
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:28,458
Whatever you have to tell
yourself there, Bones.

714
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:33,213
Whose ghost?

715
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,827
He's buried over there.

716
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,286
The ghost?

717
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:40,592
Corporal Edward Parker.

718
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,567
He was slain while serving
his country.

719
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,020
He was 20.

720
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,256
He was just a kid.

721
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:50,742
Was it...

722
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:53,218
Your fault that he died?

723
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,625
No.

724
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,150
The fortunes of war.

725
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:01,542
It wasn't my fault.

726
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:05,756
You see that woman over there?

727
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,274
Her name is Claire.

728
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,818
I have a message for her from Teddy.

729
00:42:10,513 --> 00:42:12,459
What?
A message from a ghost?

730
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:14,100
You wait here, okay?

731
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:18,160
But you're gonna deliver a message
to that woman from a ghost?

732
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,791
Beautiful day.

733
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,183
Makes you glad to be alive,
doesn't it?

734
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:43,233
Yes, it does.

735
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:07,880
