1
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:26,859
Morning, Phil.

2
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,403
Tom, how you doing?

3
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,710
It's almost Friday.

4
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,657
Rough week to be selling insurance?

5
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,585
- You want me to tell you about it?
- No, thank you, Tom.

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,553
Excuse me.

7
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:56,431
- There's a bakery around here?
- Yeah, it is two blocks up,

8
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,867
and make a left.

9
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,257
Thanks.

10
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,377
My God.

11
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,443
He just ran in the street. I...

12
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:15,987
Did anyone else see that?

13
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,151
I couldn't stop...

14
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,694
Somebody call an ambulance!

15
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:43,992
.: Team UnderCovers :.

16
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,387
NCIS Los Angeles 1x23
- Burned -

17
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,206
Last night,
I'm having a drink at the place

18
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,059
Macy took me
after my first shootout.

19
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,229
Just wanted some alone time.
But this guy walks over.

20
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:12,271
Attractive, well-dressed, bonus points
for taking the lead. You know the drill.

21
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:13,568
All too well.

22
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,403
Guess what he used as his opener.

23
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:19,155
"Hi. My name is Mr.

24
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:22,201
"I Have No Idea What I'm In For.
Can I buy you a drink?"

25
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,579
See? There wouldn't have been
anything wrong with that.

26
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,455
That's not what he said.

27
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,615
"Hey there.

28
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,854
"Noticed your boots.

29
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:34,437
"Takes a girl with a unique style
to pull that off."

30
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,945
"Unique style"?

31
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,427
As in weird? As in ugly?

32
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:42,723
- The boots were completely normal.
- The boots don't matter.

33
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:44,398
He was running game on you.

34
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:45,781
What?

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,164
Game.

36
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,074
The art of seduction.

37
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,939
He offered to buy you a drink,
he'd be looking for approval,

38
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,518
- but he turned the tables on you.
- Putting me on the defensive.

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,903
And trying to earn his approval
on a subconscious level.

40
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,404
It's game.

41
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,197
That stuff doesn't work on me.

42
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,798
At least you didn't give him
your number.

43
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:05,306
Right?

44
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:11,967
Oh, boy.

45
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,670
Have you seen Callen today?

46
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,635
This guy buy you a drink?

47
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,873
Told me he'd let me buy him a drink.

48
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:52,416
Game.

49
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,628
Kept checking his phone
like he had better places to be.

50
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,630
- Game.
- Leaned in for a kiss

51
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,465
15 minutes after meeting me.

52
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:00,994
Definitely game.

53
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,963
At least you didn't let him.

54
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:05,505
- Right?
- No.

55
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,354
Who do you think taught Mr. Beal
to do that?

56
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:17,608
- What's up, Hetty?
- Agent Callen's in trouble.

57
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
He enacted

58
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,612
the Beauregard Protocol
via text message.

59
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,115
His current cover's been blown.

60
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:28,023
- How did this happen?
- That's not clear for the moment.

61
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,800
The only thing we know for certain

62
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,210
is that our operations
have been breached.

63
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:37,335
As of this moment,
we are not to make contact

64
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,588
with him...
That means you,

65
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,221
Mr. Hanna.

66
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,553
Callen's message to Hetty
also contained a location in Venice.

67
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,136
Intersection of Horizon
and Speedway.

68
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,453
That's two blocks
from his rooming house.

69
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,323
This is traffic cam footage pulled
from that intersection

70
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,175
approximately 15 minutes ago.

71
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,276
I'll call Deeks,

72
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,960
make sure LAPD knows
we'll be handling this discreetly.

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,827
Eric, pull up everything you've got
about this guy.

74
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,124
According to initial reports,

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,174
the dead man's name
was Michael St. Paris.

76
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:18,545
No criminal record.

77
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:20,795
Employed
by Northgate Elite Security.

78
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,853
They're a private investigation firm.
Specialize in surveillance work.

79
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,415
He was running a tail.
G caught him, so St. Paris bolted.

80
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:29,638
I'll call Northgate
and see who hired them.

81
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,774
Callen left the crash scene
almost immediately.

82
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:35,352
He must have stuck to blind spots and
moved fast, because no cameras got him.

83
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:38,918
Also, his phone went dead
right after he sent that alert to Hetty.

84
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,191
Off the grid.

85
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:43,659
Could this have anything to do
with Agent Macy's murder in Annapolis?

86
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:46,447
It's unrelated.

87
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,416
What's Callen going to do now?

88
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,337
What he does best.

89
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,788
Become a ghost.

90
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,888
So we can't find him.

91
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,333
Not until he's ready to be found.

92
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,658
Northgate said an unidentified man
hired them over the phone

93
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,510
to keep tabs on G's movements.

94
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,475
A single payment was sent
as a cashier's check.

95
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,045
Firm didn't ask any questions.

96
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:55,724
How long was the tail active?

97
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,988
G caught their man within minutes.

98
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:01,328
The firm was only tasked
with surveillance. No background.

99
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,258
They don't know anything about NCIS
or Callen's identity.

100
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,070
All they got from the man who hired them
was Callen's name and address.

101
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,486
Hey, buddy.

102
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,079
Buddy,

103
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:23,794
weirdest thing just happened.

104
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:28,007
Guy just called the store. Says he wants
to talk to my most recent customer,

105
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,486
which is you.

106
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:42,977
Yeah?

107
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:44,430
<i>Mr. Callen.</i>

108
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,276
<i>Or do you prefer</i>

109
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:48,051
<i>Special Agent?</i>

110
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,030
Sorry, bud. Wrong guy.

111
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,821
<i>The pay phone on Ocean Walk
and Sunset.</i>

112
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:56,675
<i>You got three minutes.
And Mr. Callen,</i>

113
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:59,340
<i>I know what the "G" stands for.</i>

114
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,688
- That's for me.
- All right.

115
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:27,897
Okay, I'm here.

116
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:31,111
- Who is it?
- <i>My name is Eugene Keelson.</i>

117
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,524
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure yet.

118
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:34,579
<i>We haven't.</i>

119
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:37,063
So, who are you?

120
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:40,262
Someone who knows more
than just your name and address.

121
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,149
<i>I have answers.</i>

122
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:46,015
<i>And the name
of the individual who hired me</i>

123
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,019
<i>to uncover every detail about you.</i>

124
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,104
I just got a message from Callen.

125
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:57,444
He's at a pay phone at the corner
of Ocean Walk and Sunset.

126
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:00,197
I'm initiating a trace

127
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:01,308
now.

128
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,850
Okay, I'll bite.

129
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,687
What do you know?

130
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:08,464
A wealth of information
that I think you'd be interested in.

131
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,900
What?

132
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,358
And I'm willing to share
this information in exchange

133
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:16,073
for a small favor.

134
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,811
What makes you think
you've found something I haven't?

135
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,578
<i>Because I have access to things
you don't even know exist.</i>

136
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,143
See, you haven't been asking
the right questions.

137
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:26,006
This goes deeper than your name,

138
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,293
your family.

139
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:29,829
<i>You've been asking who, when</i>

140
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,339
<i>maybe you should start asking</i>

141
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,462
why.

142
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:35,654
How small is this favor?

143
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,723
Caller disconnected.

144
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,142
Five seconds away
from triangulating his location.

145
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,185
He knew what we're doing
as we're doing it.

146
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:51,483
Impressive

147
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,752
Some people play checkers.
We both play chess, don't we?

148
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:58,552
You say you got answers.
Show me.

149
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,452
Underneath the pay phone.
You'll find an envelope. Open it.

150
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,147
Does that qualify as proof,
Mr. Callen?

151
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:25,768
How did you get this?

152
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:28,812
You need to decide if you're going
to do this favor for me or not.

153
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:34,234
What you want me to do?

154
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,062
You see the flash drive?

155
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,698
<i>Deliver it to some clients of mine.
Some Bulgarians.</i>

156
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,644
<i>The location is inside the envelope.</i>

157
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,624
<i>You give them the flash drive</i>

158
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,813
<i>in exchange for a cash payment.</i>

159
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,165
Who will the Bulgarians think I am?

160
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,291
Me.

161
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:53,855
- Will they expect an accent?
<i>- No, they think I'm American.</i>

162
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:55,985
<i>But, be warned,</i>

163
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,095
<i>if you are unable to convince</i>

164
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,427
<i>my clients that you are, indeed</i>

165
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,716
Eugene Keelson,

166
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,431
they will not hesitate to kill you.

167
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:06,299
<i>You having second thoughts?</i>

168
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:12,564
I've been set up before,
this is pretty much the way it feels.

169
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,170
<i>If I can get to you,</i>

170
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:18,821
<i>how easy do you think it would be for me
to get to the rest of your team?</i>

171
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,949
NCIS has been compromised.

172
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,852
<i>The only way you'll find out how badly
is by doing as you're told.</i>

173
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,667
Where do I bring the cash
after the deal?

174
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,181
<i>I'll contact you.</i>

175
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:36,954
<i>You have 30 minutes
to get it to the Bulgarians.</i>

176
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:40,387
<i>If you contact anyone else,
our deal is off.</i>

177
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,415
If you try to de-crypt the drive,

178
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,347
our deal is off.

179
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,766
- Keelson...
<i>- If you ever wanted to find out</i>

180
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,733
<i>the truth about yourself,</i>

181
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:51,853
<i>now's your chance.</i>

182
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,480
<i>Do you understand?</i>

183
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,318
<i>Your new outfit looks sharp,</i>

184
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,696
but I'd lose the baseball cap
if I were you, Mr. Callen.

185
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,162
I was able to triangulate the source

186
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,061
within one block of the pay phone,

187
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,666
but whoever it was
disconnected just in time.

188
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,847
Pre-paid burn phone, most likely.

189
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,202
Guy's probably already trashed it,
and now he's...

190
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,966
Server breach alert
in the Ops Center?

191
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,139
Hold on...
I gotta I.D. this and be sure.

192
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:27,221
- Is it related to Callen's call?
- No, no, no, totally separate.

193
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,559
Trojan horse virus. Conficker variant.
F-type strain.

194
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,396
This is a serious attack.

195
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,076
I'm opening firewalls to block it
from accessing any more of our system.

196
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,261
What's happening, Eric?

197
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:40,277
It's broken through the firewalls.

198
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:42,863
I'm losing control of a system.

199
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,093
Can you stop it?

200
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,343
It's starting to access our files.

201
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,869
I know,
I can route it in from another segment.

202
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:51,100
Turn the system off,

203
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:52,823
Which one?

204
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:54,291
All of them.

205
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,603
We're going dark.

206
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,539
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are officially

207
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:18,065
off-line.

208
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,817
We're blind.

209
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,875
And if G tries
to check in with us...

210
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,709
He'll get a standardized
prerecorded service error message.

211
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,057
He's out in the cold.

212
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:33,429
Alone.

213
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,066
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service at this time,</i>

214
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,318
<i>You have reached a number
that is not in service.</i>

215
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,596
<i>Please check the number
and try your call again.</i>

216
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,157
I'm Marinov.

217
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:51,934
Keelson.

218
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,658
My invitation said,

219
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,863
casual, but... okay.

220
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,685
Right there. Beautiful.

221
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:13,138
I recently spoke to our mutual friend
in Chechnya.

222
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,933
He says your source inside the FSB

223
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,893
has proven
quite valuable to the cause.

224
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,730
I don't discuss friends or sources.

225
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,439
Better for everyone that way.

226
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,275
I appreciate a man
who's all business.

227
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:27,820
I appreciate a good client.

228
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:29,988
You got some money for me?

229
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,080
Show me the flash drive first.

230
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,801
I want to verify the information.

231
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,598
Knock yourself out.

232
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:08,681
Satisfied?

233
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,105
- Looks accurate to me.
- Wonderful.

234
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:15,617
So, where's my money?

235
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,675
My money.

236
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,593
The problem is,
you already have it, Mr. Keelson.

237
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:22,686
Excuse me?

238
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,971
Last year,
the guard shift changes you sold me

239
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:27,254
for the airstrip in Chisinau?
They were wrong.

240
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:28,639
Wrong?

241
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,053
Like hell they were wrong.

242
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:34,720
That information was rock solid.
If you screwed it up, it's your problem.

243
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,946
You think you can play me
for a fool, Keelson?

244
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,178
All right, look,

245
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,272
a little misunderstanding? Obviously,
something got lost in translation.

246
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,588
We're all good.
Let's just...

247
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,444
we'll call it even.
Everyone walks away.

248
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,369
Sidewinder Rugged Appliance.

249
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,456
The most secure
portable IPS antivirus

250
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:47,648
URL geo-location
encrypted application filtering

251
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:48,960
in the world.

252
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,543
Let's find out how far inside

253
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,799
the castle walls
this Trojan horse rode.

254
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:55,949
I'm on it.

255
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:00,489
Agent Renko,

256
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,142
with Mr. Callen having gone

257
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,594
<i>Three Days of the Condor</i> on us,

258
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
I think we need

259
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,273
every able body we can muster.

260
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,235
Speaking of which, where's Sam?

261
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:16,507
Where indeed?

262
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,132
As far as fail-safe rally points go,
I've seen worse.

263
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,894
You said the same thing
when we picked this out five years ago.

264
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,764
Hoped we'd never meet like this, G.

265
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:44,891
Thought we'd never get made?

266
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:46,893
A man can hope, can't he?

267
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:49,771
First Dom...

268
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,653
then Macy.

269
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:53,598
Now this.

270
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,028
Something's going on, Sam.

271
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:01,422
Hetty's convinced
they're mutually exclusive.

272
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,287
You once told me we ain't working hard
enough, if nobody's trying to kill us.

273
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:06,547
I said that?

274
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:07,914
Really?

275
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,969
Make you feel better?

276
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,328
A little bit.

277
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,840
Who burned you?

278
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,507
A guy named Eugene Keelson.

279
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:21,793
Someone hired him
to find out about me.

280
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,628
He did his job well.

281
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,457
What is it?

282
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:30,082
It's a list of every foster home
I ever stayed at.

283
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:31,363
All 37 of 'em.

284
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,399
Some of those addresses
aren't even in my NCIS file.

285
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,527
Why contact you?

286
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,773
Wanted me to meet with some Bulgarians.
Pose as him.

287
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,099
Exchange a flash drive for a payoff.

288
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:46,346
I'm gonna guess
they didn't play nice.

289
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:49,791
After they downloaded the file,
there was no money. Just guns.

290
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,500
I was an insurance policy
in case things went south.

291
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,012
You thought going it alone with a group
of armed thugs seemed like a good idea?

292
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:00,860
Keelson implied
that NCIS had been compromised.

293
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,709
It's more than an implication.

294
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,462
Eric found a Trojan horse virus.

295
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,643
Had to take the Ops Center off-line.

296
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,024
This is as close as I've ever come
to finding out who I really am.

297
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:20,236
That's what I'm worried about, G.

298
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,665
I took photos.

299
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:35,690
Keep your head down.

300
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,179
Stay out of sight.

301
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:47,779
As far as I can tell, the Trojan horse
didn't get beyond Callen's files.

302
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:49,590
Keep looking.

303
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,149
Mr. Hanna. You know,...

304
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,362
I'm aware
you speak several languages,

305
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,864
but I don't recall having

306
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,200
used one you're unfamiliar with

307
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,682
when I instructed you
to not make contact

308
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:11,830
with Mr. Callen.

309
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,171
What makes you
so sure that I cont...?

310
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,961
It was a breach of protocol...

311
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:21,980
and one I understand.

312
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,677
So, what do we have?

313
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,824
The guy who burned Callen
is named Eugene Keelson.

314
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,011
Callen made a drop for him
with some Bulgarian heavies,

315
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:33,268
but it went all wrong.

316
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:36,773
This guy's got information
about G's past.

317
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,658
Things even NCIS doesn't know about.

318
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,338
That's what he handed over
to the Bulgarians.

319
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,611
Oh, this is encrypted big-time.

320
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,124
Without the mainframe,
this is gonna take a while.

321
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,807
These are the photos he took
before he made the drop.

322
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,245
We need to find everything
we can on Mr. Keelson

323
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,654
before he destroys this unit.

324
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,766
All the Eugene Keelsons I found
check out.

325
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:14,467
Same here.

326
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:18,938
This temporary server is Stone Age
compared to the Ops Center, but

327
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,983
I just got hits on the Bulgarians
from Callen's camera.

328
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:26,457
Luka Dimitrov...

329
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:28,825
Ilia Tagkov,

330
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:30,700
Kosta Daimov.

331
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,833
- It's a lot of "ov's".
- All shot and killed this morning,

332
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,121
except for this one...

333
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:37,224
Ruman Marinov.

334
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,811
All are former Bulgarian
military now involved

335
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,836
with organized crime in the U.S.

336
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:45,298
They're using a restaurant
downtown as a front.

337
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,002
How do you feel about goulash, Sam?

338
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:50,470
I thought goulash was Hungarian.

339
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,813
Actually,
the dish is eastern European.

340
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:55,684
It's got a lot of variations.
Essentially it's a stew.

341
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,603
But what they all have
in common is noodles.

342
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,263
Thanks for the tip, Martha Stewart.

343
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,688
Get me everything you have
on the Bulgarians' connections

344
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,318
to other crime organizations, ASAP.

345
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:24,101
We're closed.

346
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,088
On a Tuesday afternoon?

347
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:27,799
That's not a good sign.

348
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,179
I said we're closed.

349
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,933
Five employees, no customers?

350
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:40,603
This isn't gonna go down well
when I write my Zagat review.

351
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:44,837
I work for Ramon Casador.

352
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,865
How does Ramon enjoy life in prison?

353
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,276
Well, it's not exactly
his villa in Cartagena

354
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:58,705
but I hear for the right price,
the food's pretty decent.

355
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,389
Considering his holdings,
I'm sure he eats very well.

356
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:06,099
He has a small problem
that's affecting his digestion:

357
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:08,647
Eugene Keelson.

358
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:25,315
Mr. Casador wants to know what kind of
man he might be getting involved with.

359
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:28,809
He's heard rumors
you had dealings with him.

360
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:40,083
I'll tell Mr. Casador that you're busy
running your budding restaurant empire.

361
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,667
As far as information dealers go,

362
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,463
Keelson's the best.

363
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,425
Anything you want,
he can get it for you, for a price.

364
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,522
Anything.

365
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,715
And the price is high.

366
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,224
Any loyalties?

367
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:01,017
Only to the highest bidder.

368
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,310
He burned you.

369
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:07,327
Let's just say
he's going to be the victim

370
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,720
of an abrupt retirement
in the very near future.

371
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,281
Mr. Casador
will appreciate the info.

372
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:30,879
Okay, we're good.

373
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:50,775
Hello.

374
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,012
Hetty.

375
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,319
<i>Mr. Callen,</i>

376
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:57,198
is this your third cell phone
of the day?

377
00:26:57,613 --> 00:26:59,343
I'm keeping receipts.

378
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,469
<i>Good.</i>

379
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:03,288
<i>I'll expect
a detailed expense report</i>

380
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,073
for all of your necessities
while on the road.

381
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,585
And I do mean necessities.

382
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:12,846
Well, I'll cancel my suite
at the Chateau Marmont.

383
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:16,801
Did you find anything
on the Bulgarians?

384
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,803
Hetty...

385
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,972
I just broke the encryption
on the flash drive!

386
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,266
- <i>Hetty...</i>
- Uh, I have to go.

387
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,163
I got burned and I can't be involved
in the case. I...

388
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,313
I get it, Hetty.

389
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,547
<i>I do, too, Mr. Callen,</i>

390
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,462
<i>more than you realize.</i>

391
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:36,994
What? What's the matter?

392
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:40,700
I have no idea if the drive
is infected until I open it.

393
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,661
If you don't, we may not get
our only clue in the case.

394
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:47,181
"Live dangerously"
is my creed, Mr. Beal.

395
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:48,875
Go ahead.
Go ahead and do it.

396
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:54,011
Harmless.

397
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,726
It's a single file containing
a dossier and a travel itinerary.

398
00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,411
Who's "Andres Werner"?

399
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,519
CEO of Haupt Eisen.

400
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,766
It's one of Germany's largest
steel corporations.

401
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,728
Looks like he's in L.A.
completing a corporate merger.

402
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:13,232
Marinov's a major shareholder.
We're talking millions.

403
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:17,276
Millions that'll drop like a rock
if the merger goes through.

404
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:19,234
They're gonna hit him.

405
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,932
Callen gave Marinov the dossier.

406
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:24,689
He was coerced
into doing so by Keelson,

407
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,247
but we can't allow this man
to be killed as a result.

408
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:31,481
Werner's plane touches down
at LAX in an hour.

409
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,253
Werner! Get out of the car!

410
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,030
Federal agents!
Put the weapons down!

411
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,885
- Put the weapons down!
- This is gonna be some nasty goulash.

412
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:33,438
Renko?

413
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,483
You okay?

414
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:53,040
- Come on. You good?
- I'm good. I'm good.

415
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,126
I'm calling this in to the LAPD.

416
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:07,722
- Mr. Hanna?
- <i>The decoy car worked.</i>

417
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,445
Werner's safe.
Marinov hit us with his team.

418
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,863
Every one of them is down
except for the man himself.

419
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:14,479
Backup getaway car picked him up.

420
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,731
Have Kensi get out an APB.

421
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,441
She's on it.

422
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,979
<i>Are any of Marinov's men
in a condition to talk?</i>

423
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,982
They're not
in a condition to breathe.

424
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,658
We protected Werner, but we're back
at square one with Keelson.

425
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,141
Which unfortunately is nowhere.

426
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:41,107
What happened to protocol?

427
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:45,290
It went out the proverbial
damn window.

428
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:50,482
I've been thinking a great deal
about your situation.

429
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:54,959
Nate has misgivings
about your state of mind.

430
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,745
He's gonna have to get in line.

431
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:01,442
During this crisis,
he thought he should have a gun.

432
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:03,402
You didn't?

433
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,102
Perish the thought.

434
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:09,867
Walk with me.

435
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:14,303
This, um, Eugene Keelson

436
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:16,347
is a clever fellow.

437
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,543
It's rare for us
when we have an adversary

438
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:23,319
who knows more about our operations
than we do of him.

439
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:27,045
Despite Nate's misgivings,

440
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:31,472
I think we need
everyone's skills on board.

441
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,787
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

442
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,744
I told myself making
the Bulgarian deal

443
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:39,842
might help shed some light
on just how badly

444
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,881
Keelson had compromised our team.

445
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,585
Is that why I did it?

446
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,251
Or was it just an excuse

447
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:50,761
to find out about my past?

448
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,203
Only you can answer that,
Mr. Callen.

449
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:55,402
I can't.

450
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,877
Which is why Nate's right.

451
00:31:59,214 --> 00:32:00,876
I should stay off this case.

452
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,092
<i>Not good news, Hetty.</i>

453
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,029
I've been tracking the damage
Keelson's virus did to our server.

454
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,014
Callen's file
isn't the only one it got into.

455
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:16,225
- Who else was compromised?
- Everyone.

456
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,102
<i>And everything.</i>

457
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,746
Keelson's got information
on every one of our cases.

458
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:24,358
I'm talking NCIS worldwide.

459
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:27,986
Thank you, Eric.
I'll be back with you shortly.

460
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,619
I appreciate your noble return
to reason, Mr. Callen,

461
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:37,610
but things have taken a turn.

462
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,383
The whole of NCIS
has been compromised.

463
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,252
Like it or not,

464
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,332
you are back in.

465
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,522
Tell me Hetty isn't gonna
string me up for taking a call

466
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,206
- <i>from a burned special agent.</i>
- You're good, Eric.

467
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,972
You should see our new digs.
They are much more intimate,

468
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:13,488
albeit a tad shadowy,
cavernous and slightly spooky.

469
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,917
I need you to bring
our servers back online.

470
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,886
I want you to reactivate
the computer virus

471
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,846
that Keelson introduced
<i>to our system.</i>

472
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,793
- Are you serious?
- Very.

473
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:26,391
You're asking me to commit
technological malpractice.

474
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:29,637
Here we go.

475
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:44,288
The virus is reactivated.

476
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,857
Our servers are exposed again.

477
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,592
I'm detecting a foreign code
inside the firewall.

478
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,113
It's gotta be Keelson.

479
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,463
Open a new file.

480
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:55,866
Label it "Keelson",
put it somewhere he'll find it.

481
00:33:58,638 --> 00:33:59,412
Done.

482
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,662
Now include the following message:

483
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:04,076
"Call me.
I want to cut a deal."

484
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:05,283
<i>Anything else?</i>

485
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,211
Give him my active phone number.

486
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,180
We're set. Now...

487
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,591
can I ask why we're exposing ourselves
to this guy?

488
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:17,024
We must go to Keelson before he sells
the NCIS case list on the black market.

489
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,625
This is the only way
to lure him out.

490
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,419
Keelson likes money
more than anything.

491
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,739
If we can offer him enough of it,

492
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,856
he may just expose himself
long enough for us to take him down.

493
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,938
And what if Keelson

494
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:39,614
would rather die

495
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:42,239
than face prosecution
for his crimes?

496
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,690
The information he has
about your past

497
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,794
would likely disappear with him.

498
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:52,218
Are you ready to accept that,
Mr. Callen?

499
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:03,184
This is Callen.

500
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:04,477
What you offering?

501
00:35:04,784 --> 00:35:06,228
What, no small talk?

502
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,206
Why bother? You hate it.

503
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:11,567
Or did you forget that I know you better
than you know yourself?

504
00:35:11,914 --> 00:35:14,457
I can't let that case list get out
into the open market.

505
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:17,990
Our offer is $10 million
in untraceable U.S. currency.

506
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:22,443
The list would bring me more
if I auctioned it myself.

507
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:26,749
The longer you hold on to it, the bigger
risk you're taking. You know that.

508
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,040
<i>This is a guaranteed payday.</i>

509
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,173
Griffith Park Observatory.

510
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,529
<i>Be there with the money.
You've got one hour.</i>

511
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:39,130
- How will I find you?
<i>- I'll find you.</i>

512
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,181
I can't authorize $10 million.

513
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:49,145
I wouldn't ask you to.

514
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,538
I'm in position. Kensi?

515
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:09,208
I've got eyes on Callen,

516
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,877
but, so far,
no one's making an approach.

517
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:14,500
Renko?

518
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,593
I got nothing.
This guy Keelson could be anyone.

519
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:19,755
He'll show up.

520
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:22,763
Looks clear from here.

521
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,385
Wait a minute.

522
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:31,647
There's a guy in sunglasses approaching
Callen from the south side of the area.

523
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,590
Eugene Keelson?

524
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:43,409
Guess some tips are legit after all?

525
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,454
Everybody get down!

526
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,416
Get down!

527
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,876
Get out of the way!

528
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,545
Sam, that's him!
That's Keelson.

529
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,446
Eric, guy in the black jacket!

530
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,508
Turn over here.

531
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,668
I'm running facial rec,
but it's gonna take a while bef...

532
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:08,642
How'd we get a match that fast?

533
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:15,524
It's the driver who hit
and killed the guy tailing Callen

534
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,635
<i>this morning!</i>

535
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:18,800
- <i>Callen must've recognized him!</i>
- Who is he?

536
00:37:18,842 --> 00:37:20,253
<i>No name. No address.</i>

537
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:23,262
<i>We're looking at the only two images
of this guy that exist.</i>

538
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:41,270
Keelson!

539
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:48,933
You exposed yourself by coming here.

540
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,060
That's checkers, not chess.

541
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:54,772
Either you or Marinov
was going to walk away.

542
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,165
That left me
with one final loose end

543
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,430
to snip.

544
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:02,231
You won't get that chance.

545
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,235
You know,
these elements that play here,

546
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,610
they're way bigger than you and me.

547
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,911
You kill me,
you'll never know the truth...

548
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,028
who you really are.

549
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,736
Who hired me to find you.

550
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:25,248
Are you...

551
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:28,060
are you ready to live
the rest of your life

552
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:30,527
wondering what that "G" stands for?

553
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:40,986
Fire it up!

554
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,124
Poker? It's game.
They're all games.

555
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,983
- I'm telling you, I just...
- Games.

556
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:15,746
Have you ever heard
of "running game" on someone?

557
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,988
But that jacket you wear... takes
a unique kind of girl to pull that off.

558
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,628
Glad to see everything back up
and running.

559
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:38,018
You can surf the Internet for your,

560
00:40:38,428 --> 00:40:39,940
funny cat videos again.

561
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:45,541
At least my Web browsing
doesn't require a full system

562
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,611
purge at the end of the day.

563
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:52,449
I'm composing a letter
to Elizabeth Macy.

564
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,645
Someone else looking for answers.

565
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,528
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.

566
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:01,123
About what?

567
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:05,260
You didn't get the information
you were hoping for.

568
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,090
Keelson found answers,
I'll find them, too.

569
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,008
Someone hired him.

570
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,287
He's still out there.

571
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,748
And how do you feel about that?

572
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:23,178
I will be able to answer
that question eventually.

573
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:24,841
When?

574
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:27,027
After I track them down.

575
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,453
Hey, guys?

576
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:32,114
What is it?

577
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,322
This case isn't over yet.

578
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,535
I just found a local address
on Keelson.

579
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,453
- Where?
- Downtown.

580
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:40,052
Could be a safe house.

581
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:42,624
I checked out its electronic signature,
looks like

582
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,984
this place is filled
with some heavy-duty data servers...

583
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:48,579
And I think we've got the key.

584
00:41:52,462 --> 00:41:54,178
Data means answers.

585
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,725
