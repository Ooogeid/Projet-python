1
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,531
Look at that...

2
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:45,628
You're beautiful.

3
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,257
Two more?

4
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:56,132
You got it.

5
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,824
- I want to see you.
- Bad etiquette, Homes.

6
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,534
Can't be touching the dancers.

7
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:17,904
Look, guys.

8
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,695
We don't want
any problems tonight, okay?

9
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,664
I got no problems.
You got a problem?

10
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,625
All right. Settle it down
or take it outside, boys.

11
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,128
We got a zero tolerance
for trouble in here.

12
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:36,053
How about a dance?

13
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,599
I'm done for tonight. Sorry.

14
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:49,025
Dude, where's the beer?
The natives are getting restless.

15
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:54,497
- Where you going?
- I think I'm in love.

16
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,934
You want to grab
a coffee or something?

17
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:00,565
It's late.

18
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:02,246
- Decaf?
- Listen...

19
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:04,457
Look out!

20
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,337
.: Team UnderCovers :.

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,991
NCIS Los Angeles 1x10
[ Breach ]

22
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:49,643
I already sent the others upstairs.

23
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:51,838
Good morning.

24
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,075
Well, that's a matter
of perspective, Mr. Callen.

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,037
I've been doing some accounting
and I came across an anomaly

26
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,186
in your expenses.

27
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:04,052
This is a $1,400 restaurant bill
from Matsuhisa.

28
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,292
That's from the Miyagomi case.

29
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,819
It's not a mistake?

30
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,748
You actually spent $1,400
on raw fish?

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,692
Not me, my alias, Tony Z, did.

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,246
And is Tony Z going to reimburse me?

33
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:19,282
You'll have to talk to him
about that.

34
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,212
When I go undercover as a beach bum,
I eat at the Kogi truck.

35
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,373
When I'm going after high rollers,
I gotta hit it a little harder.

36
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,792
Try ordering soup, playa.

37
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,572
I'll tell Tony that.

38
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,529
You do that.

39
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,986
What are we looking at?

40
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:45,282
This footage is
from a gentlemen's club in Hollywood.

41
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,810
That's Petty Officer Mostel Renny.

42
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,724
The driver of the car

43
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,398
and P.O. Renny were killed.
The woman's still in the hospital.

44
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,496
It's tragic, but since when do we start
investigating DUIs?

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,341
Renny was there last night
with several other sailors.

46
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,349
All of whom are
Crypto Language Technicians.

47
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,035
Basically, the Navy's top secret
geek squad.

48
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,162
Any surveillance footage
from inside the club?

49
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,457
Pervs don't like to be filmed.

50
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:13,628
The driver of the car was
African-American, had no I.D.

51
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:17,215
- Probably left his wallet at home.
- The car was stolen weeks ago.

52
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,974
Might be a coincidence.

53
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,010
Maybe not.

54
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:22,956
I contacted the hospital.

55
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,431
The young lady is well enough
for questioning.

56
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,101
Sam, why don't you and Kensi
take the accident scene?

57
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:30,144
Crime scene.

58
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:34,857
Find Renny's friends, see if they know
anything. The address for the hospital?

59
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,099
Hollywood Presbyterian on Vermont.

60
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,424
Take Sunset.

61
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,696
I'll need anything
you can find out about the girl.

62
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,323
She's Ukrainian.

63
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,271
Thank you.

64
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,688
Problem?

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,463
We've got rubber in the street.

66
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:05,221
No skid marks. Which means
the driver didn't even try to stop.

67
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:10,479
Parking lot is too small.

68
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,895
There's no way to accelerate
that fast in this distance.

69
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,550
So, the driver
probably left the lot,

70
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,404
turned around, accelerated back,

71
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,109
- which means...
- It means Hetty's right.

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,118
It's a crime scene.

73
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,413
Katya Vitkoya?

74
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,457
Hi. My name's Callen.

75
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,674
I already spoke to the police.

76
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,421
I'm not a cop. Department of Transport
and Highway Safety.

77
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,631
Did you know Petty Officer Renny?

78
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,621
Maybe you could come tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I'm very tired.

79
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,545
Really?

80
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:50,016
'Cause they told me that you...
you just woke up.

81
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,520
You're from the Ukraine?
Where about?

82
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,023
Small town, Pavlivka.

83
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,775
- No one's ever heard of it.
- I know Pavlivka.

84
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,153
I spent some time in Balaklauski
a few years ago.

85
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,897
Really?

86
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,555
Years ago, even locals
weren't allowed to Balaklauski.

87
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,245
Were you... supposed to be there?

88
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,540
I was working on a big pothole problem
that they were having.

89
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:20,258
- How long you been in the U.S.?
- Not long.

90
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,798
Long enough for your visa to expire?

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,451
I'm applying for a student visa.

92
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,546
You're in school?

93
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,098
I'm applying for school, too.

94
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,476
Oh, yeah. Which one?

95
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,356
Look.

96
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,316
I'm not from Immigration.

97
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:43,819
I just want to know what happened
in that bar last night.

98
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,923
A man in the club grabbed me.

99
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,534
The guy who drove the car
was with him.

100
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,580
That sailor intervened,
but the club owner and...

101
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:57,399
a bouncer stepped in
before anything really happened.

102
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,864
<i>Still no I.D. on the driver</i>

103
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,803
<i>but Forensics got a hit
on a set of prints</i>

104
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,439
they pulled off the car window.

105
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,641
The guy's name is
Cesar "Chi Chi" Vargas.

106
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,936
<i>He's had run-ins with I.C.E.
and the DEA for smuggling everything</i>

107
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,222
from drugs to human cargo
across the border.

108
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,442
I'm sending you his photo
and arrest record...

109
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,153
- now.
- <i>All right, copy Sam and Kensi.</i>

110
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,766
See if they can get anyone at the bar
to make a positive I.D.

111
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,450
And find me a last known address.
Have them meet me there.

112
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,853
Was this the guy
that grabbed you at the bar?

113
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,659
You're sure?

114
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,634
The man was older and...

115
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:48,092
scruffier.

116
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,595
This guy was older.

117
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,932
And he was with the African-American guy
who crashed the car.

118
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,062
- They use a credit card?
- I already checked. Sorry.

119
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,106
Thanks.

120
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,335
Of course.

121
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,714
He knows more than he's telling us.

122
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,627
There's an alley out back.
I'll take the front.

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,536
<i>Hola.</i>

124
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,045
<i>Senior Vargas?</i>

125
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,166
<i>I'm going in, Sam.</i>

126
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:41,663
Go.

127
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,033
Clear.

128
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:54,909
Clear.

129
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,722
- Place is locked up.
- He must've been gone for awhile.

130
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,985
That might be
why it smells musty in here.

131
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,921
If I had a place on the beach like this,
I wouldn't go anywhere.

132
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,115
He's clearly past
his expiration date.

133
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,918
You found this guy in a fridge?

134
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,088
Weird.

135
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,539
When they said
NCIS was coming with a body,

136
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,124
I kind of expected Nate.

137
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:47,127
Well, Nate was busy,
but he sends his regards.

138
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,231
Really?

139
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:50,484
He's so sweet.

140
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:54,593
You know, he works so much.
I wish whoever was in charge over there

141
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,790
would just cut the guy
some slack, you know?

142
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:02,350
Right. Don't ignore the corpse.
He's still in the room.

143
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,456
Looks like he's been dead
for at least two weeks.

144
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,948
The cold temperature slowed
the decomposition,

145
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,751
but it certainly didn't stop it.

146
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,983
- Cause of death?
- Best guess at this point,

147
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,300
suffocation following
blunt force trauma.

148
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,304
Clean and quiet.

149
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:21,424
I'll know more once I open him up.

150
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,914
You two are welcome to stay
and wait if you'd like.

151
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:27,126
I don't usually have an audience,
but visitors are always welcome.

152
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,964
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Tempting.

153
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,299
But we'll pass.

154
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:36,316
Did you finish with the driver
from the club accident?

155
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,721
Another weird one.
He wasn't drunk.

156
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,599
In fact, he didn't have
any alcohol or drugs in his system.

157
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,278
- Nobody calling to claim the body?
- Not yet.

158
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,878
We haven't been able to I.D. him.
Still running his prints and dental.

159
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:55,139
But this might help.

160
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:05,031
At first, I thought they were
some sort of gang initiation.

161
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,293
- Looks like machete wounds.
- Last time I saw anything like this,

162
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,852
I was in Rwanda.

163
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,623
Do you guys know
if Nate is seeing anyone?

164
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,466
'Cause, you know,

165
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,628
I'm just...

166
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,184
wondering.

167
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,254
Renny's sailor buddies
didn't see anything,

168
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:28,200
although one of them said Renny
was hitting on the dancer, Katya.

169
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,497
I ran the driver's prints
through Immigration's refugee database.

170
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,476
I got a match...
Deng Oyat.

171
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,746
He's not African-American.
He's African-African.

172
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,175
Originally from Sudan,

173
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,065
he was placed with a foster family
in Toluca Lake 3 years ago.

174
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,704
He's one of the "Lost Boys".

175
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,294
Second Sudanese civil war
left two million dead

176
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,616
and around 25,000 young men
displaced or orphaned.

177
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,672
They became known
as the "Lost Boys" of the Sudan.

178
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,130
Agent Vaile.

179
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,093
Lucky ones managed
to get into the U.S.

180
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,771
and other countries
through humanitarian aid.

181
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:06,509
Well, maybe his foster parents
know who he was with last night.

182
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,184
That was Hollywood Presbyterian.

183
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:12,523
Katya Vitkoya
just signed herself out.

184
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,302
Looks like we'll paying her
a house call, Dr. Hanna.

185
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,541
Take Kensi.
I need to check something.

186
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:20,413
Want to share?

187
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,528
If it pans out.

188
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:34,395
32 hours.

189
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,499
Excuse me?

190
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,968
You had 32 hours
of overtime last week.

191
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,481
It was a busy one.

192
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,997
Apparently,
you've had a lot of busy ones.

193
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,117
You have seven weeks

194
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:54,724
of unused vacation time owing.

195
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,448
- I do?
- Were you planning on,

196
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,194
sailing around the world?

197
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,979
No, just been busy.

198
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,197
You know, working...

199
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,464
Just a...

200
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,161
a lot.

201
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,216
Yes, we established that back
at the start of the conversation.

202
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,834
I don't determine
the caseloads, Hetty.

203
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,146
No, but I do set the schedules,

204
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,344
so start packing.

205
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,301
On Monday morning,
you're on holiday for a week.

206
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,463
Where am I supposed to go?

207
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,811
I'm not a travel agent.

208
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,467
- What was that about?
- I've been banished.

209
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,275
I think something's up with Hetty.

210
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,049
What you think you're doing?

211
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:05,093
- What you doing?
- Pretty quick for an old man.

212
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,356
- It's a joke.
- Yeah, try again.

213
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:12,929
What's up, man?

214
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,128
Come on now.

215
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:27,922
You kidding me?

216
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:30,211
How does a stripper afford
a place like this?

217
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:32,371
Some of these strippers
make six figures a year.

218
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:35,075
- Oh, really?
- So I've heard.

219
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,196
Going on a trip?

220
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:42,297
- My sister is sick.
- You don't have a sister.

221
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,260
And you'd probably have stayed
in the hospital.

222
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,598
Does the name Deng Oyat
mean anything to you?

223
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:52,266
He's the guy who tried to kill you
and P.O. Renny last night.

224
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:56,395
- Sorry. I really have to go now.
- But you need to answer the question.

225
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:24,923
This is Nate.

226
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:27,579
He's a good listener.

227
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,142
Thank you.

228
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,894
How you feeling?

229
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,099
Fine.

230
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,925
Well, that's the adrenaline
pumping through your body.

231
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:39,855
And when it wears off in a while,
you're gonna start shaking.

232
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:43,518
Might even feel like you're gonna
throw up, but don't worry.

233
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:46,570
It's a natural reaction.
You're...

234
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:47,861
safe here.

235
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,951
- Who were those men at your house?
- I've never seen them before.

236
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,287
Any idea why anyone
would want to hurt you?

237
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:58,768
Any... ex-boyfriend...?

238
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:05,005
This is the man who almost killed you
outside the club. You recognize him?

239
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,303
He might have been with the man
who grabbed me in the club last night.

240
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,430
But I can't remember.

241
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,892
You suffered a concussion.

242
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,811
It's not uncommon for the events
immediately preceding that

243
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,771
sort of injury to be a little fuzzy.

244
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:23,982
You should probably go back
to the hospital.

245
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,442
- No.
- Do you want us to help you, Katya?

246
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:28,034
Do you?

247
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,353
'Cause if we don't,
you're probably going to end up dead.

248
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,784
Right now, we're your only friends.

249
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,244
And maybe this... Deng here...

250
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,257
maybe he wasn't trying
to kill Petty Officer Renny.

251
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,500
Maybe...
he was trying to kill you.

252
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:45,003
Why? I don't even know him, okay?
Or Renny or any of them.

253
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,917
She's hard to read.

254
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,227
Girl's been on her own a long time.

255
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,371
She's used to take care of herself.

256
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,409
It's a defense mechanism.

257
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,774
You bury your identity
to protect it.

258
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:12,087
Well, she might have seen or heard
something and not even know it.

259
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,432
Any word on our gunmen?

260
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,293
Car had no plates,
and Eric wasn't able to find the vehicle

261
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,787
on any street or traffic cams.

262
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:20,034
Perfect.

263
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,791
Where is Sam?

264
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:23,963
Thanks.

265
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:33,427
Here.

266
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:35,547
Thank you.

267
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,953
How'd you make out
Saturday on your S.A.T.'s?

268
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,431
710 in math.

269
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,196
That's nice.

270
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,232
It's not math I'm worried about.

271
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,484
400, writing.

272
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:53,989
It's getting there.

273
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:00,078
I still remember the first time
you took me to the sea.

274
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:03,805
The Gulf of Aden.

275
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,655
You were eight.

276
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,516
I'd never seen so much water.

277
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,666
The ocean made you feel safe.

278
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:14,551
Only makes me feel small.

279
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:17,512
What makes you feel safe?

280
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,598
Being around my friends.

281
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,907
I've told you before that

282
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:25,353
youth center has reputation
for teaching radical views.

283
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,065
Americans have a bad reputation
in some parts of the world.

284
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,796
In this country,
if I wear baggy clothes,

285
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,906
I'm a hip-hop gangster.

286
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,614
If I wear a taqiyah,
I'm a terrorist.

287
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,714
At the youth center,
I am just Mowadh.

288
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,525
You know this guy?

289
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,749
That's Deng.

290
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,269
Deng Oyat.

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,964
Is he in trouble?

292
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,542
Trouble?

293
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,384
He's dead.

294
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:02,833
- Crashed a stolen car into some people.
- I just saw him last week.

295
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,999
Why would he do something like that?
He doesn't even have a driver's license.

296
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,064
He was with another man.
Older, scruffy.

297
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,154
Might be passing himself off
as Hispanic.

298
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,206
You know him, don't you?

299
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:20,130
You know him?

300
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:22,355
I've seen him at the youth center,
talking to Deng.

301
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,945
He gives religious lectures.
His name is Safar.

302
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:27,582
What kind of religious lectures?

303
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,602
I don't know. I don't attend.
I keep telling you.

304
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,672
I only go there to play basketball.

305
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,090
Does Safar have a last name?

306
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,585
Jaddalah.

307
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,887
Born in Algeria, raised in Libya.

308
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,524
Safar Jaddalah's file reads like
a who's who of Islamic militant groups.

309
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,184
He's moved around a lot,

310
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:50,426
and he's suspected,
along with other Al-Qaeda members,

311
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:53,066
of having entered Sudan
to train the Janjaweed.

312
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,376
"Devils on horseback with guns."

313
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,418
They've traded in their horses
for SUVs and upgraded their weaponry.

314
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,301
So what's Safar doing in L.A.?

315
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,670
I doubt he's auditioning
for "American Idol".

316
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,405
Recruiting alienated
and impressionable young men,

317
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,768
just like that group
of Somali teens in Minneapolis.

318
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,734
Takes them back,
indoctrinates them, and...

319
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,507
gets them to fight his jihad.

320
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,714
Well, maybe he hired Cesar Vargas
to smuggle him into the country?

321
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,217
He probably came in
over the Mexican border,

322
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,126
passed himself off
as a Mexican-American,

323
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:23,054
and killed Vargas
to tie up any loose ends.

324
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,099
What's a religious fundamentalist
doing in a strip club?

325
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:29,900
The 9/11 hijackers did the same thing
before their attacks.

326
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,024
Well, last night's incident could have
been a glitch in an even bigger plan.

327
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,989
And Deng Oyat was prepared
to die to protect it?

328
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,322
Deng Oyat did
what Safar ordered him to do.

329
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,040
Alert Homeland Security,
and brief Director Vance.

330
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:47,714
I'll put Safar's face out there,
talk to the other agencies

331
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,917
and local law enforcement,
see if they have anything.

332
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:52,383
Find this guy.

333
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,901
How well does
this kid Moe know Safar?

334
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:00,831
- He doesn't. He knows of him.
- And how do you know the kid?

335
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,142
I brought him here.

336
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,234
From Sudan?

337
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,270
I was in Chad as part
of the Pan Sahel Initiative.

338
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,063
We were called into Sudan
to rescue some aid workers.

339
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:18,807
Moe's father was killed,
and Moe was injured during a firefight.

340
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,570
I figured it was
the least I could do.

341
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:28,395
How's Katya?

342
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:30,587
Scared, but tough.

343
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:33,375
She's clearly affected
by you and Kensi saving her.

344
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:36,773
She's not accustomed to having
people do anything for her.

345
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,422
She wants to go back to her house
and get some things.

346
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,383
I told her I had to talk
to you about it.

347
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:43,093
Maybe you could go over there.

348
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:11,821
I thought you might need
a few things.

349
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,496
You went back to my house?

350
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,406
Wasn't sure what you'd want so I...

351
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,147
I brought a bit of everything.

352
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,113
Let go of me!

353
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:27,906
Sit down!
You want to run, fine!

354
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,757
I'll call my buddies at ICE. I'll have
you on a plane to Kiev.

355
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,399
What do want from me?

356
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:35,038
The truth would be
a good place to start.

357
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:52,217
Your boss, Dallas...

358
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,660
all these are his?

359
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:56,118
Yes.

360
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:01,360
And for the men who were shy
and insisted on lights being off...

361
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,483
night vision.

362
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:04,859
Blackmail.

363
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,058
Who?

364
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,218
Anyone who might have
something to hide or...

365
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:13,868
something that Dallas wanted.

366
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:22,318
Know him?

367
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:26,755
- At the club?
- Yes.

368
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:27,997
At your house?

369
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,427
Dallas told us he was
a very special VIP.

370
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,889
They called him a buyer.

371
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,624
I don't like where this is heading.

372
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:40,691
Dallas's girls compromise
military personnel

373
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,754
with access
to classified information.

374
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,589
Dallas then decides
to sell that information.

375
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,228
And Safar buys it.

376
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,781
Maybe to help plan
a terrorist attack.

377
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,762
Why would Safar have
someone drive a car into Dallas' club?

378
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:55,981
Somewhere along the line,
the deal went sour.

379
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,538
We gotta get a look
at Dallas' video collection.

380
00:24:58,808 --> 00:24:59,890
Search warrant?

381
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,385
No, Safar finds out
the club's been raided, he's gone.

382
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:04,818
We'll never find out
what he's up to until it's too late.

383
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,976
Okay, so how do we get in?

384
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:08,797
Her.

385
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:42,563
Hello, there.

386
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:45,583
Lookie here.

387
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,061
<i>Hey, baby...</i>

388
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,763
Stand by, G, she's on her way in.

389
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,704
<i>How's Dallas reacting.</i>

390
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,004
Like his best girl just got back
and he didn't expect her.

391
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:15,208
Katya said Dallas' hard drive is
<i>in a storage area off the kitchen.</i>

392
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,368
Camera access.

393
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,531
None we could hack into.

394
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:20,995
Good luck.

395
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,431
Just a little bit crowded in here,
you know.

396
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:38,773
- Can Dallas see us.
- Well...

397
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:43,768
I'm sure he's been watching us
since I came over here.

398
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,429
All right, let's do this.

399
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,874
We are gonna have fun.
One for the VIP room.

400
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,536
Give us a good show.

401
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,181
All right.

402
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,026
Let 'em go through.

403
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,666
- She's coming through.
- Okay.

404
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:50,526
That's my girl.

405
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,133
Got at least three cameras,
Sam, possibly more.

406
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:04,307
We turn on the jammer, Dallas is not
the only one who's gonna lose picture.

407
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm gonna need
about a 20-second burst

408
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,857
to get me out the door
and down the hall.

409
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:13,483
<i>20-second burst,</i> initiating now.

410
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,113
- Go!
- Nineteen...

411
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,239
Security card.

412
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,625
Third door down on the left.

413
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,094
Twelve...

414
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,362
- Seven...
- He needs to be down the hall now.

415
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:39,352
Six...

416
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,935
Five...

417
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:43,211
Four...

418
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:46,366
Two...

419
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:47,747
One...

420
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,139
Zero. Jammer's off.

421
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:51,979
Tell me you're in the kitchen.

422
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,774
G, you reading me

423
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,236
We got picture, no audio.

424
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,580
Accessing computer now.

425
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,520
Where is he?

426
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,119
- Everybody out! Out!
- I got company, Sam.

427
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:32,979
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Kitchen's closed.

428
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:35,374
How's that for a lap dance.

429
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,503
You got a warrant to go
into my place.

430
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,102
FISA warrant.
Terrorism investigation.

431
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,484
I'm not a terrorist.

432
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm a patriot.

433
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,729
Is that why you fell out with Safar?

434
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,015
Is that why he attacked your club?

435
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,531
All good questions...

436
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:56,141
for my lawyer.

437
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:58,454
He's smug.

438
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,821
I hate smug.

439
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:03,319
Guy thinks he's going
to walk out of here.

440
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,979
- Is he gonna walk out of here?
- It depends what's on those tapes.

441
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:11,763
<i>There.</i> Him.

442
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,455
- Who's he?
- I think he's a senator.

443
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,688
Which one

444
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,053
Okay, maybe he's a congressman.

445
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,745
- Another one for the maybe column.
- What do we got?

446
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,768
At least a dozen identified,
including two senators,

447
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,095
the CEO of an aeronautical company,

448
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,349
a former child star
and four senior military officers.

449
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,482
And we are only
a third of the way done.

450
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:36,785
- Safar
- Not yet.

451
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:40,385
- Keep looking.
- You don't need to keep looking.

452
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:42,441
This investigation is over.

453
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,529
- They're shutting us down.
- All evidence, physical and electronic,

454
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,990
is to be sent to DOD.

455
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,247
What about Dallas?

456
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,147
We're under orders to release him
immediately.

457
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:10,913
We're putting together a good case here,
okay. A big one.

458
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:13,222
Hetty, Safar's up to something.
We can't stop now.

459
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:16,058
This is coming from on high.

460
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,331
When I say on high,

461
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,147
I mean those
with the political venom

462
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:24,967
to end the careers of each
and every one of us,

463
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,236
including Director Vance.

464
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,745
I can't believe this.

465
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:31,604
- All we need is a little more time.
- I know, I know.

466
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:34,493
If I may slip into the vernacular,
it sucks.

467
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,623
But when you hear from me again

468
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,333
in an hour or so,

469
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:41,858
you will

470
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,002
shut this

471
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:44,262
down.

472
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:50,200
Don't forget to release Mr. Dallas.

473
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:53,074
Guys, you've got to see this.

474
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,161
Fire it up on the big screen.

475
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:57,516
I don't think we want this up
on the big screen.

476
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,876
So look what I found
on Dallas' sleaziest home videos.

477
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:09,403
I'm guessing Safar's imam
would not approve of that.

478
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:11,140
Definitely <i>haraam</i>.

479
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:13,038
What's that?

480
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,953
- It's Arabic. It means forbidden.
- No, no! What's that?

481
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,955
Whatever it is,
it can't be good for you.

482
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:23,834
Come on,
I'm in up to my knickers now.

483
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:27,282
Dallas is an extortionist.
Once he got these guys on the hook,

484
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,632
there's no telling what information
he got out of them.

485
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:31,536
Technology, money, secrets.

486
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:33,825
He was a clearinghouse
for confidential information.

487
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:35,805
Safar must have known this.

488
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,789
He went to Dallas for something
specific weapons, intelligence...

489
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,308
maybe both.

490
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,125
Maybe as part of their deal,

491
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,816
Dallas offered Safar a night with one
of his girls, as a sign of good faith.

492
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,071
It's disgusting,
but perfectly probable.

493
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,405
So, Safar is being blackmailed
like everybody else.

494
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,463
But why would Dallas blackmail Safar
if they got a deal going.

495
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:57,788
Dallas is a criminal,
but he's not a traitor.

496
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,673
It's not like Safar could go
to the police.

497
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:02,540
- He could drive a car into the club.
- Interesting theory, but

498
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:06,014
Safar is a terrorist,
he's not Miss America.

499
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:07,629
Why would he care

500
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,755
if anyone had a sex tape on him,

501
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:12,188
despite the feculent content.

502
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:15,886
He's recruiting idealistic young men
to fight a holy war for Islam.

503
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,222
If a sex scandal
can bring down a Democrat,

504
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,975
what about a devout Muslim
on the road to martyrdom.

505
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:24,478
- Couldn't he just denounce it as fake.
- Publicly, sure.

506
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:28,733
I'm guessing if that got out, Safar's
sleeping on Salman Rushdie's sofa.

507
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:33,400
So you think you can lure Safar out
of hiding with this tape.

508
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,907
But you don't even know
where to find him.

509
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,502
I need to get a message to Safar.

510
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:52,630
Some of you listen to his teachings
and know how to reach him.

511
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,384
A friend of mine has
something he wants.

512
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,469
All the information he needs
is right here.

513
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:58,617
All right? Just plug it in.

514
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:02,224
My friend's number's on it.
Carry on, gentlemen.

515
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:16,686
Beginning to think
you weren't going to show up.

516
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:22,578
Hope you brought cash, 'cause,
I don't take travelers checks.

517
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,804
I am not paying you
or Dallas or anyone.

518
00:35:27,352 --> 00:35:29,737
Is that what you came out here
to tell me? Look,

519
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,170
you know the deal, Safar.

520
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:34,048
Either you pay me $50,000
or your little

521
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:37,635
sexcapade goes out on CNN, Al Jazeera
and the Home Shopping Network.

522
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,055
- Not if you're dead.
- Kill me, the tape still goes out.

523
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:42,399
It won't matter.

524
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:46,371
By then, you, the girl and Dallas will
all be dead, and I shall be forgiven.

525
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:51,170
That's your plan? What, are you going
to shoot me out here in broad daylight?

526
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,058
You won't even make it off the pier.

527
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,238
After I shoot you,
I'm going to shoot that elderly man,

528
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,867
then those children

529
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,303
and several of those young women,
before I have to reload.

530
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,246
By then, no one will be getting
in my way.

531
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,056
Point taken. Let's take a walk
and let's talk about this in private.

532
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:12,545
- Just leave them out of this.
- The time for words is over.

533
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,429
Gun!

534
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,796
Don't move!

535
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,808
Turn over!

536
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:28,146
Get up!

537
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,150
I am but one
in a legion of warriors.

538
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:37,736
True warriors don't use innocent kids
to do their dirty work.

539
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:39,925
You are the friend of Mowadh.

540
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:42,825
The man who killed his father.

541
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:43,907
What?

542
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,377
Who is using children now?

543
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,582
I'm not using anybody.
I gave Moe a new life.

544
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:51,584
And now, so have I.

545
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:55,421
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Sam, back off!

546
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,966
Not this way, not this way.

547
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,744
What's going on, man?
Where are you going?

548
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,165
I got your message to Safar.

549
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,248
- What else do you want?
- Listen. Hold up.

550
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,694
I'm not letting you get
until you tell me where you're going.

551
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,829
- You can't stop me.
- Wait a minute!

552
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,866
What are you going to do?!
Kill me like you killed my father?

553
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:26,958
Is it true?

554
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:31,402
- Did you murder my father?
- I was protecting innocent people.

555
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,655
Your father was working
with the Janjaweed.

556
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:37,529
- Everything you said to me is a lie.
- No, no. Come here. No.

557
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:43,552
I didn't lie to you.
I didn't tell you everything

558
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,540
because I wanted to protect you, man.
I know you're hurt, all right?

559
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:50,926
I'll tell you everything you want
to know about me, about your father.

560
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,436
Let's just go talk about this.

561
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,813
The time for words is over.

562
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:57,931
Good bye, Sam.

563
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:13,045
So, I got a lawyer for Katya.

564
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:15,049
Still not sure
how that's going to play out.

565
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,516
- Did Sam hear anything?
- No.

566
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:20,772
- What about the deal on Safar?
- Turned him over to the CIA.

567
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:23,467
They'll try to turn him into an asset,
put him to work,

568
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,098
find out what he was planning.

569
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:28,269
They also took
the blackmail material.

570
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,845
Do you think that will ever see
the light of day?

571
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:32,037
Not publicly.

572
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:35,338
But it will be put to use.
On the street it's called "blackmail".

573
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,106
In government, it's "leverage".

574
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,532
Speaking of leverage,

575
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:43,313
Hetty told me I had to give
in my case reports every Friday by 5:00,

576
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:46,323
and I was really counting on having
the weekends to get caught up.

577
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,211
- I'll talk to her.
- Awesome. Thank you.

578
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:50,938
You are my hero.

579
00:38:55,704 --> 00:38:56,774
Did you find Moe?

580
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:59,647
No. His foster family
has no idea where he is.

581
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,588
Youth center's claiming ignorance.

582
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:05,175
Got a hit on Moe's passport.
He's on an Air France flight to Paris.

583
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,803
- What time's it leave?
- Left.

584
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:11,100
By the time you told me
to start looking, it was too late.

585
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:13,851
That's all right, Eric.
Is Paris his final destination?

586
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,771
He's on a connecting flight from

587
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:20,398
Charles De Gaulle
to N'Djamena, Chad.

588
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:25,654
From there, he'll probably try
to slide across the border into Sudan.

589
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:28,994
- Why would he go back?
- He's looking for answers.

590
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,342
Keep tracking him.

591
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,741
Moe's father used to work
with the Janjaweed.

592
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,366
I killed him.

593
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:45,944
Does Moe know?

594
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,111
Now he does.

595
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:52,765
So what are you going to do?

596
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
Right now?

597
00:39:57,652 --> 00:39:58,802
Go for a run.

598
00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:05,277
Last time you said that, I had to drive
out to Joshua Tree to pick you up.

599
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:08,852
I'll bring my cell phone.

600
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,726
What's up with Hetty?

601
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:14,453
You, too?

602
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:31,388
So is this another money-saving cutback
or are you,

603
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,514
writing
your tell-all Hollywood memoir?

604
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:38,439
It's a eulogy for an old friend.

605
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,273
I'm sorry.

606
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:47,392
This was his typewriter.

607
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,931
It seemed fitting, almost poetic,

608
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:55,020
three hours ago.
Now, it just seems like a...

609
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:57,746
lachrymose act of folly.

610
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:01,917
I can't help you there.
Lachrymose-intolerant.

611
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:05,587
You would have liked him.

612
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,213
He was the perfect combination

613
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:11,526
of scholar, soldier,

614
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,242
and scoundrel.

615
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:15,722
Was he romantic?

616
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:23,751
No, I'm afraid he was married...

617
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,554
to his job.

618
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,027
He worked for the intelligence service
in England.

619
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:30,417
Never married,

620
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:33,483
no children, but a stellar career.

621
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:36,364
He died

622
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:38,753
alone in his office,

623
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:41,034
filling out paperwork.

624
00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:45,569
Something
you'll never have to worry about.

625
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,964
Is that why Nate's being forced
into exile?

626
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,462
That man
hasn't taken a vacation in years.

627
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,206
And what about you?
When was the last time you took

628
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:59,605
a day off that wasn't caused
by a bullet?

629
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:04,897
I don't want you waking up one morning,
wondering if it was all worth it.

630
00:42:05,778 --> 00:42:07,506
I'm sorry if I was...

631
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,979
a tad strident today.

632
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,688
I just want to make sure that...

633
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,523
you all take the time
to smell the roses.

634
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,743
How about Saturday?

635
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:37,054
There's a Rembrandt exhibit
at the Norton Simon Museum.

636
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:41,767
- I'll pick you up at 11:00?
- Rembrandt, Mr. Callen?

637
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,925
Don't get too excited.
I just go there to meet chicks, so...

638
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:47,981
Essentially, you'll be my wingman.

639
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:51,174
I relish the assignment.

640
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,508
If only it were true.

641
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:56,737
What about tonight?

642
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:02,505
I think I'm going for a run.

643
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,901
Just tell me we're not running
to Joshua Tree this time.

644
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:21,555
Bugger!

645
