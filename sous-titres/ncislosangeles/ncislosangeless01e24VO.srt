1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,297
- Who burned you?
- Eugene Keelson.

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,926
Guy's got information about G's past.
That even NCIS doesn't know about.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,221
If you kill me, you'll never know
the truth: who you really are.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,015
I just found a local address on Keelson.
This place

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,600
is filled with some heavy-duty data
servers, and I think we've got the key.

6
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,173
Clear.

7
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:04,891
Clear.

8
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:09,986
- Is this place what I think it is?
- Everybody's dirty little secrets.

9
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,406
Including Taylor, A...
whoever he is.

10
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:15,664
Document boxes.

11
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,421
Alphabetical by surname and initial.

12
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:21,491
Must be hundreds of them.

13
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,788
Lots of big names.

14
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,374
I'm gonna need the code number
or an angle grinder.

15
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:33,831
Damn.

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:34,874
What?

17
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,082
You think someone who makes a fortune
buying and selling information's

18
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,558
- gonna make it that easy?
- We're gonna need Eric.

19
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,787
See if they've got one on you...

20
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,119
or Hetty.

21
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,236
Nothing on me.
Two boxes on Hetty.

22
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:24,685
Guys...

23
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,523
You're gonna want to see this.

24
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,111
"File burn". It must be automatically
erasing the hard drives.

25
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,656
It's not gonna affect
the hard copy files.

26
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:38,199
Unless...

27
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,440
We gotta get out of here now!

28
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:43,871
- Move!
- That kinda burn.

29
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,186
I got it.

30
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,086
G, come on!

31
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,490
.: Team UnderCovers :.

32
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,715
NCIS Los Angeles 1x24
- Callen, G. -

33
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:35,715
After you powered up,

34
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:37,800
what did you press?

35
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,220
Nothing.
I didn't even touch the keyboard.

36
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,078
Maybe we triggered motion detectors.

37
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,144
I didn't see them,
and I was looking.

38
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,781
Okay... a timer.

39
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,190
If Keelson's not back
by a certain time...

40
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,151
And if he's stuck in traffic?

41
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,571
Cell phone. Dials up,

42
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,198
punches in the code, deactivates...

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,242
I didn't do anything.

44
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:12,043
If you could turn it off with a cell
phone, you could turn it on.

45
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,172
Maybe Keelson isn't the lone wolf
we thought he was.

46
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,208
Eric's gonna see what he can dig up
on Keelson's warehouse.

47
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,786
Phone records, utilities,
all the usuals.

48
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,986
Try to turn up another name.

49
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,404
We good?

50
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,075
Yeah, sorry.

51
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:46,715
This is the file he was working on.

52
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,170
Surveillance.

53
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,060
They're arguing.

54
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,007
Probably married.

55
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:02,419
Taylor.

56
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,221
Wonder
what his dirty little secret is.

57
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,018
Great.

58
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,604
450 A. Taylors in Los Angeles alone.

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,361
Gonna need a first name to...

60
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,821
This is where he got the addresses.

61
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,156
What addresses?

62
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,151
Every foster home I ever lived in.

63
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,088
Keelson gave me a printout, but...

64
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,528
this is where he got 'em.

65
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,907
They're all handwritten.

66
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,169
What's it doing in this file box?

67
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:42,466
Well, he left in a hurry. He could've
put them in there by mistake.

68
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,680
Keelson didn't make mistakes.

69
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,805
There's five more addresses here
in the back. I don't know any of 'em.

70
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,184
Maybe this is
our connection with Taylor.

71
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,895
Any of those five new addresses located
in a 6000 block?

72
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,859
We find a Bart's Mart located

73
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,528
on a 6000 block, at least
we got a place to start looking.

74
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:06,824
Bart's Mart.
67 stores in greater Los Angeles,

75
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:09,202
but only one on a 6000 block.

76
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,452
6464 Woodman Avenue, Van Nuys.

77
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:16,709
That's the apartment block
from the photo.

78
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,878
List of tenants, Eric.

79
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,463
Looking for Taylor, initial "A".

80
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:23,208
Close.

81
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,768
Data search on Steven John Taylor,
same address.

82
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,690
Steven John Taylor, aged 45.

83
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,226
No criminal record. Divorced.

84
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,878
Ex-wife's name's Amy.

85
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,354
A. Taylor.

86
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,023
He's a she.

87
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,903
Age 42. No children.
No current address listed.

88
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,281
Still using her married name.
That's unusual.

89
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,325
What's her maiden name?

90
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:52,365
I have to go right back
to the marriage certificate.

91
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,783
And her maiden name is...

92
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:02,477
Callen.

93
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:19,946
Mr. Hanna, Ms. Blye,
Taylor's apartment.

94
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,899
- Mr. Callen, my office.
- Hetty...

95
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:28,948
Go.

96
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,586
I much prefer

97
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:44,709
a good HB

98
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:45,798
to a Bic.

99
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,967
Press firmly enough,

100
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,012
and people don't have to read
between the lines to get the message.

101
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,974
The answer is no.

102
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,377
You don't even know
what the question is.

103
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,355
It's no to all of them.

104
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,569
Is there any mention of this
in your classified file? No.

105
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:09,738
Was I aware you had a relative? No.

106
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,200
Am I surprised? No.
Should you stay on this case?

107
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,649
Definitely no.

108
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,417
Is there any possibility
that this is a coincidence?

109
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,836
Keelson didn't think so.

110
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,844
- He had my details in her file.
- But he could be wrong.

111
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:28,367
Could be.

112
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,385
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.
You know the rules.

113
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:34,763
It would seem
that while Keelson is dead,

114
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,906
there is still the possibility
that your true identity

115
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,898
may have been compromised,

116
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,903
along with the integrity
of this unit.

117
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,649
This is the second time
you've taken me off the Keelson case.

118
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,452
Let's make it the last.

119
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,280
Should I read something
between the lines?

120
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,671
Bugger.

121
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:14,053
Hetty's gonna tell you
that I'm off the case.

122
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,012
She is?

123
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,431
Before she does, what have we got?

124
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,105
The warehouse is owned
by some two-dollar corporation

125
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,241
registered in Nevada. I'm still checking
names and the paperwork,

126
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,493
but they're all paralegals
3 times removed from Keelson.

127
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,195
She could be on her way up.

128
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,550
She will try calling again first.
What else?

129
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,315
I checked phone companies.

130
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,904
Phone lines in
and out of the warehouse.

131
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,490
And I found a dedicated data line,
like a fax line. But here's the thing...

132
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,349
What is the thing?

133
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,602
It's never had a call.

134
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:06,111
Ever!
The only charge on the phone bill

135
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,608
is for the line rental.
No calls in, no calls out.

136
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,234
Except for one this morning.

137
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,945
So someone dialed in
to trigger the explosives.

138
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:14,891
Yeah, ten-second call.

139
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,409
If it were me, I'd want to be close by,
make sure it all works.

140
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,706
Time-stamped video
puts him on the scene

141
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:27,141
30 seconds before the blast
with a clear view of the warehouse.

142
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,044
That's how I narrowed down
the search.

143
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:31,463
So he makes the call,
and you see a change

144
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,133
in the light on the left of the frame
as the building goes up.

145
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,468
He stayed another 30 seconds,
and left.

146
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,821
Not your typical reaction of someone
witnessing a building exploding.

147
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:41,015
A cell phone?

148
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,719
Still trying to get it.
But I did get a license plate.

149
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,721
That's the number, the address,
the guy, Carl Browning.

150
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,942
Rap sheet: grand theft auto,
burglary, assault and fraud.

151
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,215
This is Eric.

152
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:57,109
<i>What in the world's taking you so long
to answer the phone?!</i>

153
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,547
Taylor's got some noisy neighbors.

154
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,414
The neighbors
have got a noisy Taylor.

155
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:09,450
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:11,003
It's Mighty Mouse.

157
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,255
Huh, I was thinking Tom and Jerry.

158
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,837
No, no, it's the mouse.

159
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,349
Taylor hasn't got kids.

160
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,486
So what?

161
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:22,139
Cartoons?

162
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:24,058
Not cartoons.

163
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,349
The mouse.

164
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:33,852
- Clear!
- Clear.

165
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,110
Bedroom and bathroom
look a lot like this.

166
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,867
The whole place is trashed.
He turned the TV up to mask the sound.

167
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,960
Searching for something.

168
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,040
Guessing they didn't find it.

169
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:56,495
<i>Callen's got the information
and is on his way to Browning's house.</i>

170
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:57,716
What's the address?

171
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,829
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

172
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,668
Federal agent.

173
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,958
- You alone?
- No.

174
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,076
As a matter of fact, he's not,

175
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:36,934
Special Agent G. Callen.

176
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:39,425
Kort.

177
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:42,161
You know, Callen,
you're not missing anything.

178
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,138
No one ever calls me
by my first name.

179
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,829
It's 'cause no one likes you.

180
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,130
CIA do this?

181
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,083
We were late to the party, like you.

182
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:55,259
Place was already trashed,
television blaring.

183
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,701
And like you, we wanted to have
a chat with Mr. Browning.

184
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,282
Unfortunately for both of us,

185
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,486
Mr. Browning's done chatting.

186
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,129
Browning worked for Keelson.

187
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,695
Keelson's dead.

188
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:45,319
I got the memo.
Tell me, did he have a file on you?

189
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,843
But he did have one on you.

190
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,975
Ashes in the wind.

191
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:55,086
Scuttlebutt said you triggered
the explosion.

192
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,183
Browning phoned it in.

193
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,715
That's how you found him.
Phone logs.

194
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,628
How'd you find him?

195
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,863
Your backup just arrived.

196
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,202
A little late to be of much use,
I would have thought.

197
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,752
I mean,
if we weren't on the same side...

198
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,445
Trent Kort.
He's with the Agency.

199
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,200
We used to work together,
Callen and I.

200
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,244
Kort was explaining
how they knew about Browning.

201
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,210
We've been keeping tabs
on an Iranian.

202
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,212
Karim Akbari.
He lead us here.

203
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:43,761
Why is the CIA interested
in Karim Akbari?

204
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:47,803
Sorry. Classified.

205
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,139
Crime scene's yours, Callen.

206
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,250
Let me know if you find anything.

207
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,269
You, too.

208
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,988
- Crime scene?
- Browning.

209
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:02,651
Someone decided to make him
the light fixture.

210
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:04,242
Akbari?

211
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,362
Maybe.

212
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,823
So why did Kort give up Akbari?

213
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,242
See how we'd react,
if we're chasing the same guy.

214
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:13,075
Guess we are now.

215
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,833
Did you find her?

216
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:21,044
No one home.
Place was turned over. Pros.

217
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,421
TV on?

218
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,089
Mighty Mouse.

219
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,173
Woody.

220
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,801
Same pros.

221
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,434
Call Eric, see what he knows
about Akbari.

222
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,649
Hetty took me off the case.

223
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,151
<i>Full-court press,</i>

224
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,361
Karim Akbari, Iranian.

225
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,020
Got him.

226
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,013
But only for a second.

227
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,909
File got locked down.

228
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,869
By whom?

229
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,370
Our friends at Langley.

230
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,954
Kort just shut us out.

231
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,572
I'd send you home,

232
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,515
but I know that would just move you
from that chair

233
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,290
on to that sofa.

234
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,395
I'm still looking for a place.

235
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,891
I just got a rather

236
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:25,224
officious phone call from

237
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,002
a mid-level...

238
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,738
time card puncher at the CIA.

239
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:31,615
He wanted to know why

240
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,404
we had requested

241
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,538
access to a classified file

242
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,829
of an ongoing operation.

243
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,706
Have you ever heard of...

244
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:41,792
Karim Akbari?

245
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,586
I don't know anything about him.

246
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:46,129
That's not what I asked,

247
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:49,758
That was me.

248
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,719
Akbari was given to us
by a CIA operative.

249
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,430
I got Eric to run it,
we got red-flagged.

250
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,933
Sounds like the CIA
is stonewalling us.

251
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,189
I know a lot about stonewalling.

252
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,400
After I finished with the...

253
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:07,928
time card puncher,

254
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,820
I called the Director of the CIA,

255
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:11,945
who offered to brief us

256
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,524
on Karim Akbari.

257
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,574
The agent's name is Trent Kort.

258
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:28,020
Boathouse in a half hour.

259
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,008
She knows. You can't go.

260
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,891
- Where you going?
- To shoot someone.

261
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:53,071
I think you killed him.

262
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,949
And his entire extended family.

263
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:58,452
You wanted to see me?

264
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,045
You said you wanted to see me.

265
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,123
You're our operational psychologist,
Nate.

266
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:07,294
I've got personal stuff
going on in my life,

267
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,412
so you have to see me.

268
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:10,922
That's your job.

269
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:15,281
I'm missing something, aren't I?

270
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,837
- What to tell Hetty when she asks.
- What's Hetty going to ask me?

271
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:21,266
- Why you came to see me.
- And the real reason is...?

272
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:31,680
Shouldn't this be
in the evidence locker?

273
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:32,986
Aren't we breaking...

274
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,922
the chain of evidence or...?

275
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,035
You're off the case,

276
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,785
but you need to know the...

277
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,708
Could I go to jail?

278
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:49,294
- You've done something wrong?
- I think I'm about to.

279
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,841
I could do
some handwriting analysis.

280
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,553
You recognize
any of these addresses?

281
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,223
Every orphanage and foster home
I ever stayed at.

282
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,601
And these five addresses
at the back?

283
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:11,107
I could run a search,
see if they have anything in common.

284
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,313
In fact, I could...

285
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,130
do it right here.

286
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:23,961
And you could...

287
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,330
just happen to...

288
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,188
look over my shoulder...

289
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:30,748
if you wanted to.

290
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,922
Because... how would
I even know you were...

291
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,153
doing that?

292
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,261
Okay, snap up here.

293
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:40,720
Most of these are
government buildings.

294
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,848
That's the old
Allingham Street Orphanage.

295
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,683
Looks like that one's run
by the county.

296
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,676
So is the one in Torrance.

297
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,937
Let's just take a peek
at that list again.

298
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,026
Four of the five
addresses are either state,

299
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,250
city or county-run orphanages.

300
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,240
And the last address

301
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,658
is a private residence.

302
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,180
It's also the last entry.

303
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,981
If I were looking for answers,

304
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,346
I'd start
with the last address first.

305
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,924
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Hi.

306
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,962
I'm sorry to disturb you.

307
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:22,788
I was just hoping you might be able
to help me find someone who

308
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,716
possibly stayed here
a long time ago.

309
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:31,998
Her name's Amy.

310
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh, of course.

311
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,546
I remember Amy.

312
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,507
Such a beautiful woman now.

313
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,893
And you are?

314
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,199
I work for a law firm.

315
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,016
We believe she may have inherited
some property,

316
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:47,977
and I just need
to confirm her identity.

317
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,237
Well, then you'd better come in.

318
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,673
Thanks.

319
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,992
Such a long time ago.

320
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,140
25 years, at least.

321
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,880
She's here somewhere.

322
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,261
My "children".

323
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,968
Some of them not for long,
a few days.

324
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,147
Others a few weeks, months.

325
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:22,996
Amy was one who stayed a long time.

326
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,271
Hard to believe, huh?

327
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,299
So many.

328
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,643
Most of them from broken families.

329
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,255
Some orphaned.

330
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:44,579
Is, um...

331
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,061
is your photo up here?

332
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,897
Not here.

333
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:58,739
But someplace.

334
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:00,997
Many places?

335
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,264
Thirty-seven.

336
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,313
Oh, here she is.

337
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:11,733
This is Amy.

338
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:17,043
She must have been
about 15 at the time.

339
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:19,700
She stayed almost two years.
She...

340
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,928
She was a troubled girl.

341
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:27,674
Something in her past, I think,
that she kept to herself.

342
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:31,888
She still sends me
a birthday card every year.

343
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,728
Not all of them do anymore.

344
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:38,004
I used to worry
when I would just suddenly

345
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,926
stop hearing from someone.

346
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,059
And then one day I realized...

347
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:46,614
they probably just found their way.

348
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:51,369
At least that's what I hope.

349
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,039
That's the latest one.

350
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:00,336
Powerful emotion... hope.

351
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:04,320
Yes, it is.

352
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:10,680
Amy ever talk about her family?

353
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,977
It was a long time ago
to remember something like that.

354
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:18,123
That's okay.

355
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:22,306
- Thank for everything.
- Yeah.

356
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,150
You know, Amy...

357
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,327
Amy was an orphan.

358
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,325
But I do remember.

359
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:33,411
She said she had a brother.

360
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,130
Formerly a senior member of Savak,

361
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:53,215
the Shah of Iran's secret police
back in the 1970s.

362
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,725
Wasn't Savak trained by the CIA?

363
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,062
In 1979,

364
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:02,642
the Shah was overthrown
and went into exile.

365
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:06,863
There were rumors that his supporters
moved half a billion dollars

366
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,662
out of Iran into various
bank accounts in Europe

367
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,219
to be used to restore
the Shah to power.

368
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,994
But 18 months later,
the Shah was dead.

369
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,909
And the money was never recovered.

370
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,500
After the Shah's death, Akbari

371
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,036
started looking for it.

372
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:25,265
While he didn't find the money,
he did find this man...

373
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,048
Michael Lawson...

374
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,676
an American banker
who lived in Iran.

375
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,470
Akbari believed it was Lawson

376
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,935
who transferred the money

377
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,724
and had access to the account
numbers and passwords.

378
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:40,770
Lawson was found murdered
six weeks after the Shah's death.

379
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:42,204
Let me guess.

380
00:24:42,388 --> 00:24:44,858
Strung up by his feet
to a light fitting and tortured.

381
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,697
Keelson uncovered information

382
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,029
that suggested the money
was still out there.

383
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:53,205
Akbari found out,
came looking for Keelson

384
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,877
and found his associate,
Mr. Browning, instead.

385
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,378
And there endeth the briefing.

386
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,570
So, which one does
the CIA want the most?

387
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,743
Akbari or the money?

388
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,854
Akbari is a zealot.

389
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:11,832
If he gets his hands on that money,

390
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:16,369
his plan is to try and buy
nuclear weapons and invade Iran.

391
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,361
Not a good outcome for any of us.

392
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:22,562
We're all on the same side here,
Agent Hanna.

393
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,968
I'm glad to hear it.

394
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:27,442
I guess then you won't have a problem
telling me how you got onto Browning.

395
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,345
We intercepted a call
between he and Akbari.

396
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:33,448
Used it to trace Browning's address.

397
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:35,676
Got there too late.

398
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,552
Akbari was demanding information

399
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:42,280
about someone named...

400
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:43,800
Amy Taylor.

401
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,002
Happen to know who that is?

402
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,380
Your guess is as good as mine.

403
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:51,935
Yeah.

404
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:35,498
<i>Get off me.</i>

405
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:42,056
Federal agent.
No one move!

406
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:17,942
Eric, south on Lincoln, blue van.

407
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,138
I am in pursuit.
Need LAPD backup.

408
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,442
I'm on it.

409
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,322
Crap.

410
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,534
You need to come up to ops... now.

411
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,333
<i>Did you see it?</i>

412
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,887
Someone get an ambulance!

413
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>Okay, no problem.</i>

414
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:23,802
<i>Steve, where are you?</i>

415
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,237
Is this Amy Taylor?

416
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,129
<i>Who is this?</i>

417
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,726
I'm a Federal agent.

418
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:31,293
Amy, you need to listen to me.

419
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,142
Your ex-husband has been injured.

420
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:36,468
If he knows where you are, he told
someone, and they are coming for you.

421
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:42,947
Is this your car?

422
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm a Federal agent.
Give me your keys.

423
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:47,485
- Yeah, yeah.
- Give me your keys.

424
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:52,401
Come on.

425
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:55,985
Eric, check this number.

426
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,463
I need the location
of the cell phone last dialed.

427
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:04,956
Okay, call was to a cell phone
in South Central near the river.

428
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:08,075
Callen, I can only narrow it down

429
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:10,495
to a four-block radius
bordering Allingham Street.

430
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,351
Callen?

431
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,587
- Line must have dropped out.
- Then get it back.

432
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,109
Allingham Street... that's

433
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:22,445
one of the addresses
in the notebook.

434
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,461
Does Callen know that?

435
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,989
Yes.

436
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:30,578
Eric, the cell phone number

437
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,024
Callen had you trace...
who owns it?

438
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:38,502
He's found her.

439
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:22,046
Who are you?

440
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:23,631
I called.

441
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,883
I'm the federal agent.

442
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,135
My name is Callen.

443
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,057
Who are you?

444
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:36,776
I'm your sister.

445
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,900
I don't have a sister.

446
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,529
Now, who the hell are you?

447
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:01,159
Sam and Kensi are 15 minutes
from the orphanage.

448
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,317
Try Callen again.

449
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,956
My name is,...

450
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:09,927
Hannah Lawson.

451
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:13,232
And until the age of about 11, I...

452
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:16,213
I lived in Iran with, my...

453
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:17,963
father.

454
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,290
His name was Michael Lawson.

455
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:23,548
My mom...
She died when I was three,

456
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,211
so my father was...

457
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,108
he was just everything to me.

458
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,982
A while after we got back here,

459
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:36,491
my father showed me this...
this hiding place

460
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,540
in the house that were staying at.

461
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,328
Inside it was this...

462
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:44,504
this leather satchel. I don't know
why he showed it to me, but...

463
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:46,799
he said it was our...

464
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:48,464
secret.

465
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,277
And a couple of days later,

466
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,656
some men, they forced
their way into the house.

467
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,015
They were, uh, Iranian.

468
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,855
And they turned the television
on really loudly, and they...

469
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,516
tore the lighting fitting.

470
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:08,095
Eventually, the, uh...

471
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:12,905
All the lights blew out, and...

472
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:16,070
they couldn't see me
in the dark, and...

473
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,370
I ran away.

474
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,733
I just lived on the streets.

475
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,334
Finally...

476
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,806
Welfare picked me up,
and this is wh...

477
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,297
where they brought me.

478
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,762
I barely spoke for months,
'cause I was so terrified

479
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,942
that those men would come
and get me.

480
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,490
I just wanted a...

481
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,436
a different name.

482
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,974
Why my name?

483
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,620
You...

484
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,145
you had a sister.

485
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,967
Her name was Amy, and she...

486
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,318
she slept over there,

487
00:33:50,173 --> 00:33:52,027
and she was my friend.

488
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,239
I don't have a sister.

489
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,492
She told me about you.

490
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,806
- No.
- Yeah.

491
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,453
She said she used to push you

492
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:03,791
in... in a little cart, like,
a little red cart, and you

493
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,301
used to squeal
to go faster and faster.

494
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
<i>Faster!</i>

495
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,509
And one day, it crashed
and you hurt your arm.

496
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,140
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

497
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:24,436
And Amy cried, and you didn't.

498
00:34:25,058 --> 00:34:27,543
And then she swore
that she would always...

499
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,066
always protect you.

500
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,105
Come on.

501
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:04,601
Federal agent!

502
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:08,876
Come on.

503
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:14,356
I'm good.

504
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,603
It's Kensi.

505
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,126
<i>We're secure.</i>

506
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:32,942
<i>Callen and...</i>

507
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,666
<i>whoever she is...</i>

508
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,467
<i>are both fine.</i>

509
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,202
What happened to her?

510
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:48,413
We used to sneak out...

511
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,179
at night...

512
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,427
down to the river.

513
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,381
This one... one time she slipped.

514
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:00,740
I tried to save her, and it just...

515
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,430
just swept her away.

516
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:06,900
So I hid in her bed.

517
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,822
And they thought
Hannah Lawson had gone missing.

518
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,982
Both blondes,
both the same age... they...

519
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:22,948
didn't really know us,
and they didn't really care.

520
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,606
It was easy to pretend.

521
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:29,663
And about a month later,
they found her body.

522
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:35,168
And she was buried with my name.

523
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,087
Hannah Lawson.

524
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,739
And I lived with hers.

525
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,874
Amy Callen.

526
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:00,751
Done.

527
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:03,906
You sure you've got the authority
to sign jurisdiction in this case

528
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,051
- over to us, Kort?
- Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

529
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,160
She gives us the address,
we're done.

530
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:14,225
We have no more interest
in Ms. Lawson.

531
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:29,852
2175 Ellison Way, Marina Del Rey.

532
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,851
It's in a wall cavity
between the laundry and the bathroom.

533
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:34,788
It's in a leather satchel.

534
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,023
I'm rather fond of Los Angeles.

535
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,392
Maybe I'll put in for a transfer.

536
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:44,613
I hope not.

537
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,155
So, what's gonna happen when

538
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:56,416
he finds out the place
was demolished 15 years ago?

539
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,836
I'm not gonna hang
around to find out.

540
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,223
Me, neither.

541
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:21,062
She loved you so much.

542
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,947
You know, she cried herself
to sleep every night,

543
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,613
'cause she couldn't be with you.

544
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,401
What'd she call me?

545
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,143
Baby brother.

546
00:39:58,528 --> 00:39:59,553
No, I...

547
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:01,412
I mean...

548
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,638
Just baby brother.

549
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,653
You disobeyed my directive...
I can't let that stand.

550
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,730
And you wouldn't have done
the same thing?

551
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,684
I know my family, Mr. Callen.

552
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,447
Believe me when I say,

553
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,102
sometimes I envy you
not knowing yours.

554
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:42,564
I'm standing you down...

555
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,787
- Hetty, come on...
- For one day.

556
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,487
Use it wisely.

557
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:29,533
Something to share, Nate?

558
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,500
This first address...

559
00:41:37,988 --> 00:41:40,682
That was the first orphanage
Callen was sent to.

560
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:41,772
He was...

561
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:43,086
five years old.

562
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:48,380
I really can't understand
why they'd separate him from his sister.

563
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,685
Each address was entered
chronologically

564
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:01,101
all by the same person.

565
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,396
Why is that surprising?

566
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,153
It's an aging hand, Hetty.

567
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,155
Different pens, different pencils.

568
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:22,808
These addresses weren't all added
at the same time, but as they happened.

569
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,139
Every time Callen moved,

570
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:28,837
the same person wrote down
his new address.

571
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:33,175
You're saying someone...

572
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:37,888
someone was watching
Callen all those years?

573
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,482
The same person.

574
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:23,760
Happy holidays!
See you next season!
