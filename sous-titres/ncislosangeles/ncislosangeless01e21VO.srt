1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,630
It's an "Agent Needs Assistance" alert.
From Dom's phone.

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,134
Dom is missing, not dead.

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,976
Do whatever you have to do
to find him.

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,719
I gave Moe a new life.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,554
Everything you said to me is a lie.

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,447
- Good-bye, sir.
- Moe...

7
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:18,561
.: Team UnderCovers :.

8
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,344
NCIS Los Angeles 1x21
- Found -

9
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,539
<i>Kensi, we got something.
How fast can you be here?</i>

10
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>Can you translate this?</i>

11
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:10,887
<i>This should be translated.</i>

12
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:22,594
<i>G, we got a lead. You gotta get in here
right away. A video just came in.</i>

13
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,559
When?

14
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,950
What do we know?

15
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:28,439
This appeared
on a known jihadist Web site

16
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,293
less than an hour ago.

17
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,363
The evil empire of the West

18
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,822
hides behind its false words
of peace

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,817
and its United Nations...

20
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,797
The infidel war machine

21
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,965
designed solely to deny Islam

22
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:43,805
and destroy the Muslim world.

23
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,560
If you do not release our falsely
accused brother Ala a Din Keshwar

24
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,669
within 24 hours...

25
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:53,881
this man shall be executed.

26
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,792
Looks like it was uploaded
at an Internet café

27
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,310
- in Rabat, Morocco.
- Strip the hell out of that footage.

28
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,550
I want full audio
and visual forensics...

29
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,190
voice analysis and the works.
Identify what's in the room,

30
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,276
what's on their clothes,
background noises.

31
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:16,261
Send copies to FBI, NSA,
anyone who can help.

32
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,033
Kensi, find out who these people are.
Where do they operate? Where

33
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,640
are they getting their funding?

34
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,136
Put together whatever you can
about this Ala a Din Keshwar

35
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,023
- keep Director Vance in the loop.
- Got it.

36
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:29,545
- What about Dom's parents?
- What about them?

37
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,117
Shouldn't we contact them?

38
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,629
To tell what, "Your son's not dead,
but he's about to be executed"?

39
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,699
At the very least,
they could be praying.

40
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,360
- They need to know the truth.
- I'll have Nate speak with them.

41
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:42,263
Hopefully, by the time we talk to them,
he's been found safe and sound.

42
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:44,181
We need to secure a transport.

43
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,500
We can put together a basic outfit gear
once we're on the ground overseas.

44
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:51,147
Overseas where? We don't even know
where they took him.

45
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,244
Not yet, but as long as we're wheels up,
we can land anywhere

46
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:57,740
in the Middle East or North Africa soon
as we find out who this Ala a Din is,

47
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,677
who's got him,
and where he's being held.

48
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,104
And what happens
if we're halfway over the Atlantic,

49
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:05,202
and we discover that he's being held
in the Philippines or Indonesia?

50
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,976
- They had him over two months, G.
- But he looked strong.

51
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,842
He looked like he was hanging
in there?

52
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,538
All this time and we still don't know
who grabbed him, why they grabbed him,

53
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:26,724
or what they hoped to get out
of a brand-new agent.

54
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,894
Maybe he was a hostage
of opportunity.

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,397
They brought in Colombians
to snatch him. They hired pros.

56
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,720
You think someone's trying
to get to us?

57
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:38,843
If they have Dom,

58
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,812
they already have.

59
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,447
All you're giving me is excuses,

60
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,828
and I don't have time for it, Dick.

61
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,103
Monty,

62
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,207
you owe me and you know it.

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
Just man up.

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>S'cusez, General.</i>

65
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,091
<i>Non, demain est trop tard.</i>

66
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,293
<i>Maintenant!</i>

67
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,449
Listen up, you flaccid,
bureaucratic eunuchs.

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,976
I want full cooperation
from each of your agencies

69
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,061
and unrestricted access

70
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,583
to Tunisian airspace,

71
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,065
or by God,
my next call is to Fradkov,

72
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:19,814
and I will outsource
this whole damn operation.

73
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,452
Feel better?

74
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,329
You've done this before.

75
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,475
Where are we?

76
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,164
We are playing catch-up
in the dark with a ticking clock.

77
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,544
I may know someone who can help.

78
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,258
- So what are we waiting for?
- I'm certain he can help.

79
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,548
I'm just not certain

80
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,258
that he'll want to,

81
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,176
but he owes me a favor...

82
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,230
or ten.

83
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,971
Maybe if you ask him nicely.

84
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,349
It seemed to work
with the other men on the phone.

85
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,105
I doubt that any of them are gentle,
and they're certainly not men.

86
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,231
So who is this contact?

87
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,367
What do you mean she didn't give you
a name? What agency is he with?

88
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,598
She didn't say.

89
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,566
We're wasting time.

90
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:14,123
This guy could be
with Animal Control for all I care.

91
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,726
I trust Hetty.

92
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,294
How is the Duchess of Deception?

93
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,768
She's well.

94
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,214
How do you know her?

95
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:26,260
She helped me out of a jam here
and there back in the day.

96
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,741
- You know who we're up against?
- Not really.

97
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:32,975
Ala a Din is a brand-new player.
Nobody's even got a positive I.D on him.

98
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,477
Who's he work for?

99
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,370
We believe his group
is called TAJ...

100
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,226
Talib al Jihadiya...

101
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:41,108
and they are working very hard
to make a name for themselves.

102
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,820
Now, there were reports he was killed
after a bombing in Pakistan.

103
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,464
TAJ denied it.

104
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,927
But the latest rumor is,

105
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,627
he's been captured

106
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:52,870
by one of our own agencies,

107
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,705
but nobody's copping to it.

108
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,665
Do you know who has him?

109
00:06:57,398 --> 00:07:00,151
Defense Intelligence,
Special Activities Division,

110
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:02,378
National Clandestine Service...
take your pick.

111
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,593
Whoever's got him ain't sharing.

112
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,884
How we haven't heard any of this?

113
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,512
Nobody has.

114
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,224
My guess is, whoever's got him

115
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,348
is keeping his capture a secret, hoping
to smoke out the rest of his group

116
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,773
because the guys with the biggest
trophies get the most funding.

117
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,044
- Do you have any idea where he is now?
- No.

118
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,029
This is all I've got
on the TAJ terrorists.

119
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:30,116
They're thought to have training camps
set up in Sudan, Eritrea,

120
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:31,992
possibly even Somalia,

121
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,786
but nothing's been confirmed yet.

122
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:35,996
I'm sorry about your man.

123
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,916
No one deserves to go out like that.

124
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,403
He's not dead yet.

125
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:45,575
Good luck.

126
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,018
And...

127
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:52,073
tell Hetty they still had her picture up
in that bar in Velika Krusa.

128
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,132
She'll get a kick out of that.

129
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,204
No, there.

130
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,008
- The other one.
- Can you stop hovering?

131
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,332
I'm just trying to help.

132
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,575
You aren't. It's a computer,
it only takes one person.

133
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,034
Apparently not.

134
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:17,163
I haven't been able to find anything
on this Ala a Din character.

135
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,797
- Neither can Eric.
- Or you.

136
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,574
- Pointing fingers is not going to help.
- Maybe this will.

137
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,746
What is it?

138
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:25,055
Information
on suspected TAJ terrorists.

139
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,049
- See what you can dig out.
- Where you get it?

140
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,005
- Couldn't tell you if I wanted to.
- Okay, we've got video, no audio.

141
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,469
We haven't been able to find anything.
I mean nothing.

142
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,180
Ala a Din must be an alias.

143
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:37,016
- How much time do we have?
- 20 hours at the most.

144
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,060
We may be able to reset the deadline
if we can give the terrorists

145
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,948
some indication they're making
progress with their demands.

146
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,356
Stop the video.

147
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:46,300
Now zoom in.

148
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,821
Is that your friend Moe?

149
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,153
Thank you.

150
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:18,599
Moe's foster parents haven't heard
from Moe since he fled back to Africa,

151
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,461
the same night
that Dom was abducted.

152
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,761
Safar Jadallah recruited Moe
and the other boys

153
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:25,223
from the Ethiopian Youth Center
to become Jihadis.

154
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,176
- He's got to know something.
- No, he's in Guantanamo Bay.

155
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:30,871
It'd take 8 hours to get him here.
Let's question him there.

156
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,691
Okay, I'll give them a heads-up.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,159
Moe's father was Janjaweed.

158
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,409
Sudanese government hired them
to fight the rebels.

159
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,718
Only problem was, they were worse.

160
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,393
Hence, the nickname:

161
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:44,083
"devils on horseback with guns."

162
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,920
I killed Moe's father, saving
some aid workers. Maybe it's payback.

163
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,506
If Moe is part of Ala a Din's group

164
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,309
and they have Dom,
there's a good chance Dom is in Sudan.

165
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:57,633
There's also a good chance he's being
held in Chad or Libya or Somalia.

166
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:00,928
If we can't track Moe's movements
after he arrived in Chad,

167
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,518
we've no idea where he could be.

168
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,466
If we take a plane to Mamba Bay, Kenya,
we'd be within striking distance.

169
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,350
We're better working
the case from here,

170
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:09,233
using our time and resources
to find Dom.

171
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,653
- We should be there. We owe it to Dom.
- Let's just find him first, okay?

172
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,824
Having Moe involved, that's our first
big break. We have a place to start.

173
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,753
The Youth Center.

174
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:27,941
- May I help you?
- Federal agents

175
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:30,004
from the NCIS.

176
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,548
This is a Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act warrant...

177
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,050
But you've already searched here before,
two months ago.

178
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,303
Safar Jadallah
has already been arrested.

179
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,723
We're interested in a terrorist
organization, the Talib al Jihadiya.

180
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:43,209
We've got a runner.

181
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,521
Federal agent!

182
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:49,912
Stop!

183
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,958
Let me go!
Let me go!

184
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,095
Leave me alone!

185
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,250
- Stay still!
- Leave me alone!

186
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,176
Don't move!

187
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,561
Way to go, Flipper.

188
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,107
Think we can get something off it?

189
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,734
I sure as hell hope so.

190
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,643
I didn't order any room service.

191
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,407
Where is he?

192
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,577
- I don't even know who that is.
- Mowadh Dusa,

193
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,703
he goes by Moe.

194
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,830
Used to hang out at the Youth Center

195
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:13,834
until he went back to Sudan to become
a terrorist with Talib al-Jihadiya.

196
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,023
If you say so.

197
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,224
This man?

198
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:24,094
Special Agent Dominic Vail.
He goes by Dom.

199
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,508
He was kidnapped
and is being held by TAJ terrorists

200
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,182
who are threatening to execute him.

201
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,916
- I don't know anything about that.
- Why did you run at the Youth Center?

202
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,228
I was late for a class.

203
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,023
- Why you threw your computer?
- Slipped out of my hand.

204
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,983
And the knife
you pulled on my partner?

205
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,017
<i>I was just trying to hand it
over to him.</i>

206
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,242
He is smug.

207
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:43,320
<i>Can I go now?</i>

208
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,532
You know how I feel about smug.

209
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,284
No, it's good.

210
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,077
He thinks he's smarter than Callen.

211
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:52,474
So, what's the verdict?

212
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,823
Don't take your computer swimming.

213
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:59,588
To do this properly,
I should flush it with distilled water,

214
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,965
and dry it out with a desiccant
over several days.

215
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,478
I don't care about properly,
I care about quickly.

216
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,227
There's information on that computer
we need now.

217
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:08,876
I know.
But if I power this up,

218
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,731
and there's moisture
on the components,

219
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:13,180
I could fry the motherboard
and cause a lethal short to the CPU.

220
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,374
But if we don't,
we waste valuable time.

221
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,837
This computer may hold
the only chance

222
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,358
we have of finding Dom

223
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,950
in time to save him.

224
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:22,569
Come on.

225
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,009
Do it.

226
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,306
Son of a bitch! I...

227
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,998
I told you...

228
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:39,169
- Now what am I supposed to do?
- Fix it.

229
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,476
You help me,

230
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,507
I may be able to help you.

231
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,716
But if you don't,

232
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,823
it is out of my hands, and you are
on a one-way trip to Guantanamo Bay.

233
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,122
And I promise you,

234
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,594
their idea of water sports

235
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,892
- does not involve a day at the beach.
- Your threats...

236
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,318
do not frighten me.

237
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,579
You know the difference
between courage

238
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,276
and stupidity, Yari?

239
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:07,406
Do you know
why terrorists target youth groups?

240
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,872
Because young people
are impressionable.

241
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,580
It's a lot easier to convince teenagers
to be suicide bombers.

242
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,831
To become a martyr,

243
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,792
<i>shahid</i>,

244
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,988
is to die for what you believe in.

245
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,394
The old <i>Istishhad</i>
versus <i>Intihar</i> debate.

246
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,857
I got another one for you.

247
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,361
Do you know the difference
between suicide bombers and martyrs?

248
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:34,519
Trick question.

249
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,165
There is no difference.

250
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,730
We pick up both their pieces
in a sandwich bag.

251
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,679
It's kind of hard to make out, but,

252
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,539
that thing that looks like

253
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,625
a bowl of fruit salad...

254
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,157
that's what's left of the skull

255
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,618
of an 11-year-old boy,

256
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,764
who detonated a bomb
that was strapped to his chest.

257
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:05,631
I wonder if the heavenly virgins
dig the headless horseman look.

258
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,486
<i>Look...</i>

259
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,029
if you want to help this man,

260
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:14,765
you can trade him for Ala a Din.

261
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,059
How much time we're gonna waste
on this human detritus?

262
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,978
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.
- Well, that's too bad.

263
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,021
For your friend.

264
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,783
I can only imagine
the look in his face

265
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,943
when they cut off his head.

266
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,573
You will be an accessory to murder.

267
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,933
Sam, let him go.

268
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,387
I give him what he wants.
Why you struggling?

269
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,593
- You want <i>shahadah</i>?
- Stop it! This is it!

270
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,211
You want to be a <i>shahid</i>?
You're on your way to paradise.

271
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,214
Sam, listen to me,
he is no good to us dead.

272
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,385
He's no good to anyone.

273
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,681
For the record, you don't deserve
to die by my hands.

274
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,792
I messed up, G.

275
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:31,954
He'll live.

276
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:35,238
Thought bringing Moe here
was the right thing to do.

277
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,296
It was.

278
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:40,134
Think about where he'd be right now
if you hadn't taken him out of Sudan?

279
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,493
He'd be dead.

280
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,312
And Dom would be safe.

281
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:47,253
The only one who thinks
this is your fault is you.

282
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,610
You want to blame yourself,
do after we find Dom, okay?

283
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,280
Right now I need your "A" game,
big guy.

284
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,687
So does Dom.

285
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:00,848
You think this guy
Yari's gonna talk?

286
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:02,594
He might...

287
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,792
if you open a can of Jihad
on his ass.

288
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,988
The guy is an armchair terrorist
at best.

289
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:14,809
We made it pretty clear
we were not messing around.

290
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,267
Give me some good news, Kensi.

291
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,895
I have a resignation letter
from a former worker.

292
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,011
What's her name?

293
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:28,613
Great.

294
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,193
Send whatever you find to my phone.

295
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,824
Kensi found a resignation letter
from a worker at the center.

296
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:39,574
A woman by the name
of Ameenah Shah quit because

297
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,870
she disapproved
of what was going on there.

298
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:45,207
- Liking this woman already.
- Oh, come on!

299
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:46,507
Come on.

300
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,226
You know I despise your wardrobe?

301
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,221
Particularly those flip-flops.

302
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:56,051
Not to mention your surfboard
leaning precariously

303
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,372
close to my car,

304
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,930
the sand you track
into the Ops Center,

305
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,304
all the millions of dollars
of top secret technology

306
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,727
you use to play
your frivolous video games.

307
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,687
I only left my surfboard
near your car once.

308
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:11,216
Twice.

309
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,777
- But I don't do it anymore.
- But I tolerate it...

310
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:14,767
all...

311
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,420
for the most part.
And do you know why,

312
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:21,705
- Mr. Beale?
- My playful kitten-like personality?

313
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,008
I don't know why I just said that.

314
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:28,540
I make jokes when I'm nervous.

315
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,032
Use humor as a defense mechanism.
It's a bad habit.

316
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:34,506
I don't know why I'm talking.

317
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,244
I tolerate it

318
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:38,760
because you are unequaled

319
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,445
at what you do.

320
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,183
I am the way I am,
because I demand the best.

321
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,614
This is an elite unit

322
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,201
whose unparalleled success

323
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:53,021
rests on the superior skills
of those who work here.

324
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,201
And that's why I know

325
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:57,503
that if anyone can fix this...

326
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,281
it is you.

327
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:03,738
- I'm trying.
- I know,

328
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,287
I know, and I'm sorry.

329
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,734
I should have trusted
your judgment earlier.

330
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,289
And because I pushed you,
I may have buggered everything.

331
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,696
But I have complete faith in you,

332
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:16,093
Mr. Beale.

333
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:17,851
Do what you do.

334
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,332
That's for good luck.

335
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:25,937
Thanks.

336
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:36,646
Yes.

337
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,069
Come on, baby.

338
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:42,665
Come to Papa.

339
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,412
Thank you for coming
and enjoy the rest of your visit.

340
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,498
Have a good day.
Bye-bye. Thank you.

341
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,212
Ameenah Shah?

342
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:53,443
Yes?

343
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,004
I'm Special Agent Callen,
this is Special Agent Sam Hanna.

344
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,715
- We're from NCIS.
- We'd like to ask you some questions

345
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,384
about your time spent working
at the Ethiopian Youth Organization.

346
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,324
You know a young Sudanese man
from the center,

347
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:06,389
Mowadh Dusa?

348
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:10,727
I worked mainly
in an administration capacity...

349
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,550
- Organizing schedules, classes.
- Your resignation letter cited concerns

350
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:16,566
about some
of what they were teaching there.

351
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,568
Ideological differences
are not a crime.

352
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,528
They are if they lead
to terrorist activities.

353
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,322
I should be getting back to work.

354
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,015
The man in this video...

355
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:25,961
is a federal agent.

356
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,704
He is also a friend, and he will be
executed if we can't find him.

357
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,134
I'm sorry,

358
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:35,250
- but I know nothing about this.
- Ameenah,

359
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,478
you have a degree
in early childhood education.

360
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,214
Clearly, you care
about young people.

361
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,926
Something happened at that Youth Center
that caused you to quit.

362
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,653
Now, I think it's the same thing

363
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,097
that caused several of these boys
like Moe to disappear.

364
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,848
These same young men

365
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,435
are about to murder a federal agent,
and they will be terrorists.

366
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,189
This is your chance
to save a lot of lives.

367
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,918
There was a man...

368
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,074
who started
to teach religious studies...

369
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,949
that became more and more radical.

370
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,117
Safar Jadallah?

371
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,539
Yeah, we picked him up a while back.
Who else?

372
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:18,503
There was another man
who started to come around

373
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,588
after Safar got arrested.

374
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,658
He was very angry
that Safar was gone.

375
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,874
I think he donated money
to the Center.

376
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,931
His name was Kalil.

377
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,144
I don't know his last name.
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,312
I must get back to work.

379
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:39,399
<i>Shukran jazeerun</i>.

380
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:41,205
<i>Al'afw</i>.

381
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:44,988
- Yo.
- <i>Eric, it's Callen.</i>

382
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,291
I need everything you can find
on a guy named Kalil.

383
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,979
He was connected
with the Youth Center.

384
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:51,161
I have no last name,
but I believe he provided funding.

385
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:53,455
Yeah, yeah.
His name's in Yari's computer.

386
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,373
- You got it working?
- <i>Getting there.</i>

387
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,250
Yeah, here it is. Kalil Abramson.

388
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,834
<i>Heavy hitter in commercial real estate</i>.
Single,

389
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:01,987
envious bank account.

390
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,001
One outstanding parking ticket
for an expired meter on Robertson.

391
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,051
<i>Find him.</i>

392
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,785
- Here you are, sir.
- Okay.

393
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,399
Kalil Abramson.

394
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,647
Federal agents.

395
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:09,275
We'd like to ask you some questions
concerning your involvement

396
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,324
with
the Ethiopian Youth Organization.

397
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,260
It's one of my pet projects.

398
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,610
I'm very active in youth
and environmental issues.

399
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:17,831
But please have a seat, join us.

400
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,625
It's not a good idea, considering
your credit cards have been frozen,

401
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,931
along with the rest of your assets.

402
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,380
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

403
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,215
We'll explain
after you come with us.

404
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,260
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm
in the middle of a business meeting.

405
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,971
- Then why did you ask us to join you?
- I was being polite.

406
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,055
Well, I'm not.

407
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:37,767
You're under arrest on charges of
knowingly funding terrorist activities.

408
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,217
Well, then, I'm very glad
that I'm here in the company

409
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,005
of my attorneys.

410
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,350
We're going to need a new camera.

411
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,697
Kalil Abramson was tipped off.

412
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:01,471
He was surrounded by a wall
of lawyers before we even got to him.

413
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:03,746
He's not going to help us
if it means implicating himself.

414
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:05,842
He might if it mitigates
charges of conspiracy,

415
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:07,675
terrorism and the murder
of a federal agent.

416
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:10,722
There's no murder. Dom isn't dead.
Stop referring to him in the past tense.

417
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:12,820
It was just a worst-case
scenario for Abramson.

418
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,597
Forget about worst-case scenarios.
There's only one-case scenario.

419
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,492
That's finding and rescuing Dom.

420
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,955
Moe once told me he felt safest
with his friends at the Youth Center.

421
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,737
Maybe he's still in touch with them.

422
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:27,403
If they were culling potential Jihadists
from the Youth Center, it makes sense

423
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:30,765
- they'd want young men like Moe...
- There's a SEAL team on standby

424
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,715
aboard the USS Cole.

425
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,384
They're off the Horn of Africa

426
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,503
as part of NATO's
Operation Ocean Shield.

427
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:41,099
The minute we give them a location,

428
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,026
they'll hit it hard.

429
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,403
I've called in every favor
I can think of.

430
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:51,100
I don't think
I can go through this again.

431
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,821
- We're going to find him, Hetty.
- Do you really believe that?

432
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,533
Because we're not going
to stop looking until we do.

433
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,860
I'm going to hold you to that.

434
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,123
Extreme situations

435
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,751
occasionally require
extreme measures, Mr. Callen.

436
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,822
But at the end of the day,

437
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:15,267
one's methods are seldom questioned

438
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:18,884
when they bring
about the necessary results.

439
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:28,198
Keep moving.

440
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,439
Where did you learn
to speak English?

441
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,900
Television.

442
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,239
What's your favorite show?

443
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:47,915
What's your name?

444
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:50,418
You shouldn't have done that.

445
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:53,713
Why?
You're just going to kill me anyway.

446
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,090
- That's not certain.
- My country...

447
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:58,863
does not negotiate with terrorists.

448
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,179
So if you don't help me escape,

449
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:04,261
you'll be a murderer, too.

450
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:10,730
And I know you don't want
my blood on your hands.

451
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,607
How do you know that?

452
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:17,362
Because you're talking to me...

453
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:19,838
in English.

454
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,191
- You know this man?
- No.

455
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,968
Do you know this guy?

456
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:38,220
No.

457
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:41,763
One of you tipped off
Kalil Abramson.

458
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,555
Don't look at me, man.

459
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:05,785
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,436
I want to know which one
of you tipped off Kalil.

461
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,901
I don't even know who that is. And I've
never seen this guy before in my life.

462
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,419
Tell him. I don't know you, do I?

463
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,647
I didn't know that guy,
and I didn't tip off Kalil.

464
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,837
- I swear to God.
- Whose god would that be?

465
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:38,725
What makes you think
I believe in any of them?

466
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,421
You can't do this.
I've done nothing.

467
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:41,779
That's exactly what he said.

468
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:44,406
- Please. I... I can help you.
- You don't know anything.

469
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,866
And unfortunately,
you just saw me kill a man.

470
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:49,537
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I know about Mowadh Dusa

471
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,214
and the other boys
who left the Center and went to Chad.

472
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,000
- You know where they are?
- No.

473
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,935
Do you know
where they're holding Agent Vail?

474
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:58,463
But I know who does...
Kalil Abramson.

475
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,215
He paid to recruit the young men
to become Jihadis.

476
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:03,946
He bought their plane tickets,
their training.

477
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:06,163
He even paid the Colombians
to kidnap the agent.

478
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,680
He's the man behind all this.

479
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,910
He knows where your friend is.

480
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,103
- Agent Nassir, you all right?
- Fine.

481
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,730
- Did he talk?
- Yeah.

482
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,774
- Kalil Abramson's behind all of this.
- What about his lawyers?

483
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,110
It's gonna take more than lawyers
to save him this time.

484
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:42,542
Anything else from the TAJ terrorists?
Messages? Videos?

485
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,883
- Anything?
- Nothing.

486
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,626
We've got less than 40 minutes
until our 24-hour deadline.

487
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:50,139
What else have you got on Abramson?
You get anything of Yari's computer?

488
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,142
Money trail's hard to follow.
Kalil's been very careful.

489
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,103
Also,
he's also been traveling, a lot.

490
00:30:56,505 --> 00:31:00,441
Mostly in Europe, but on April 6,
he hops a plane from Athens to Cairo.

491
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,447
Then he goes from Egypt
to Khartoum in Sudan,

492
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,578
and then, pops up in Asmara,
Eritrea.

493
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,116
He's there for a couple days, then goes
to someplace called Berbera in Somalia,

494
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,744
- before heading into Yemen.
- It's a terrorist tour group.

495
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,531
Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia
are the same three countries

496
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,667
thought to hold training camps
for Talib al Jihadiya.

497
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,337
Dom's in one of those camps,
and Kalil Abramson knows which one.

498
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,299
- Can you turn on Kalil's cell phone?
- Way ahead of you.

499
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,341
Unfortunately, I haven't been able
to pick up any audio.

500
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:31,097
His phone's at his house in Malibu.

501
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,100
- Hasn't moved in several hours.
- Son of a bitch is sleeping

502
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,144
- while Dom's about to be executed.
- I'm open to ideas, guys.

503
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:39,365
Think. We're running out of time.

504
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:40,356
What about

505
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,586
extraordinary rendition?

506
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,195
No. Kalil Abramson obtained
his American citizenship six years ago.

507
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,739
Citizenship can be revoked
for acts of treason.

508
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,741
Rarely and only
after a lengthy process.

509
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,915
I've secured a fully crewed,

510
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,709
fully fueled C-130
at Edwards Air Force Base.

511
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:03,323
If you were to put Kalil Abramson
on that plane

512
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:07,133
under the guise
of an unlawful enemy combatant,

513
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,808
which he is,
for all intents and purposes...

514
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,073
On his way
to a black site for interrogation.

515
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:15,065
I've heard rumors
that Bondsteel in Kosovo

516
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,309
is particularly ugly.

517
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,103
You're suggesting torture by proxy?

518
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,354
No. Of course not.

519
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:24,141
But if Kalil thinks
that is what is happening,

520
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:26,573
well, I'm sure he'll start talking

521
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:29,739
- before you hit Barstow.
- None of which would hold up in court.

522
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,721
This isn't about building a court case.
This is about rescuing Dom.

523
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:35,578
Whether you rescue Dom or not,

524
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,952
Kalil and his lawyers
will come after us

525
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:41,723
with a vengeance, and Abramson
will walk because of it. Not to mention,

526
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:44,786
something like this could end the career
of everyone in this room.

527
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:47,923
Saving a fellow agent
is more important than any career, Nate.

528
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,511
I'm with Sam.

529
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,152
Me, too.

530
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:05,594
Someone once told me
that extreme situations

531
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,151
occasionally call
for extreme measures.

532
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:17,282
What the hell?

533
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,205
I really wanted
to be a magician anyway.

534
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,127
Far be it from me

535
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,155
to thwart your dreams of a career
in prestidigitation, Mr. Getz,

536
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:30,299
but if anyone is going to take
the fall for this, it will be me.

537
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,415
He's in motion...
Kalil... he's moving.

538
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,557
Let's do it.

539
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:49,752
- Do you know how much time I have?
- No.

540
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:55,783
Wait.

541
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,851
I want to send a message
to my parents.

542
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,123
I can't help you with that.

543
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:03,836
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,476
Eat your breakfast.

545
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:49,257
He's turning onto Broadway.

546
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,657
Looks like he's stopping.

547
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:30,002
Eric, he's headed
into the Palace Theater.

548
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,848
It's kind of early for a matinee.

549
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,141
Kalil Abramson bought
that theater a few years ago.

550
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:36,550
Supposedly he's turning it into a center
for the performing art

551
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:37,806
Wonderful.

552
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,263
The proceeds from tonight's performance
of Equus will be

553
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,047
donated to help support
your local Taliban.

554
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,393
<i>We need to keep an open line
to the USS Cole.</i>

555
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,437
<i>The minute we get Kalil
to tell us where Dom</i>

556
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,856
- <i>is they have to scramble that SEAL.</i>
- Copy that.

557
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,444
- We could use a layout of this place.
- Will do.

558
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:56,818
Got it.

559
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,055
Is anybody out there?!

560
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
We've got shots fired.

561
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,255
- <i>Sounds like it came from above.</i>
- I'll see if I can find a camera.

562
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:14,959
<i>I found a couple of security cameras
on the building next door.</i>

563
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,043
<i>I'm trying to access them now.</i>

564
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,093
My God.

565
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,017
<i>Kensi, what is it?</i>

566
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,063
I'm in the room where they were holding
Dom. This is where they shot the video.

567
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,670
Callen, he never left L.A.

568
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,893
<i>I've got two camera feeds.
They're from the roofs next door.</i>

569
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,244
Moe, wait a minute.

570
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,480
I've got Dom.
He's on the roof.

571
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,004
- Dom is on the roof.
- Moe is here, too.

572
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,423
<i>He's one floor above you, G.</i>
I'm going to the roof.

573
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,640
I got him, I got Dom.
He's alive.

574
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,624
Come on!

575
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,154
Get down!

576
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,969
- Come on!
- <i>Zoom in on camera B.</i>

577
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:31,901
- You got a shooter on the roof.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

578
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:06,987
Kalil's in the stairwell.

579
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:10,324
- You okay?
- Yeah. I knew you guys would find me.

580
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:14,078
Look out!

581
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,100
No! Dom! Dom's been hit!

582
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,924
Dom's hit! He's down!

583
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:28,342
Dom's down!

584
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,885
Eric, Medivac, now.

585
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,054
- Right.
- Hang in there, buddy.

586
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,315
I'm pinned down!

587
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:08,261
Kalil's down!

588
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:10,342
All clear!

589
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,886
- Medivac is en route.
- Keep your eyes open.

590
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,888
Come on!
Hang in there, Dom!

591
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,436
Come on.

592
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,588
They got his femoral artery.

593
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,982
- Where's the damn Medivac?!
- Medivac's on their way.

594
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:36,497
Come on!

595
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:49,339
All you're doing is pumping out
what blood's left in his body.

596
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,092
- Come on, Dom, fight, man!
- Sam...

597
00:41:52,784 --> 00:41:55,387
- He's gone, Sam.
- I ain't giving up on him, G.

598
00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:57,528
You didn't.

599
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,559
None of us did.
