1
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:20,061
Good morning.

2
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:22,271
- Good morning.
- How can I help you?

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,607
I was interested in leasing
a safe deposit box.

4
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:27,568
There are some requests in life
that are beyond my power.

5
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:32,115
Yours happens to be one
for which I am eminently... qualified.

6
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:34,002
Eminently qualified?

7
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,121
Means I'll have to ask you
a few personal questions.

8
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,135
Not too personal, I hope...

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,676
Curtis.

10
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:49,798
Just name, address and...
telephone number.

11
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:55,822
It's essential, I promise you.

12
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:58,015
Just banking regulations.
You know how it is.

13
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:00,393
Nobody move!

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,602
Away from the desk!

15
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:05,356
Behind the counter...
Let me see your hands!

16
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:08,109
The rest of you, on the ground.
Get on the ground!

17
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,404
- Now!
- You, down!

18
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,628
- Get down now!
- Face down!

19
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:19,704
Federal agent!

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,456
Drop your weapons!

21
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:37,430
Wrong move, lady.

22
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,307
Johnnie!
Johnnie, no!

23
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,558
Please don't.

24
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,715
.: Team UnderCovers :.

25
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,294
NCIS Los Angeles 1x15
- The Bank Job -

26
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,649
Not cool.

27
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,111
Definitely not cool.

28
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:34,985
You want me to handle this?

29
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,528
Knock yourself out.

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,458
It's stuffed.
It's a king cobra.

31
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,514
Its venom could kill a grown man
inside 15 minutes.

32
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,171
Thought they're bigger.

33
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,174
Not so big until he's stretched out
and locked onto your butt.

34
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,693
Looks like Jeffrey Dahmer's
evidence box.

35
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,097
Think this is Nate's?

36
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,393
- I'm thinking Hetty.
- Mine.

37
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,257
Sorry.

38
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:08,521
Mine.

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,666
We thought maybe
Hetty was having a garage sell.

40
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,944
What's all this stuff?

41
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,380
Just prized possessions,
sacred belongings,

42
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:15,833
heirlooms and memories.

43
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,072
Irreplaceable items
that can't be assigned a price.

44
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,740
This is priceless?

45
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,284
You're kidding?

46
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:26,080
A full set of 72 ultra jelly bracelets
from Roppongi, Tokyo?

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,960
G has a thing for ultra jelly bracelets
from Roppongi, Tokyo.

48
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,304
There was a break-in
in my apartment building,

49
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,631
and couldn't let the crooks
take my stuff, so...

50
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,461
What is the price on the black market
these days for a...

51
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:39,886
poppycock baby doll?

52
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,251
It's not just any poppycock baby doll.
This is...

53
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,371
It's Pete.

54
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,268
I keep my mementos

55
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,812
in a GSA class 6 fireproof safe

56
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:53,436
drilled to the floor of my den
under false wooden panels.

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,695
- You got to be protected.
- For Pete's sake.

58
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,575
GSA class 6 is military grade.
What do you keep in there?

59
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,019
It's classified.

60
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,995
What about you?

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,924
- Where do I keep my stuff?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,108
Here.

63
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:12,153
No, no, I don't mean memories.
I mean stuff, like this.

64
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,586
G doesn't have stuff.

65
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:17,298
Pack rats and hoarders are fascinating.
They tend to be closet romantics.

66
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,218
- Sorry. Did you just call me a hoarder?
- He said "pack rat" first.

67
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,167
Memories.

68
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:26,003
I still mourn the loss

69
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:28,684
of my most prized possession.

70
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,979
Traces of it are
still embedded in the asphalt

71
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,981
along a quarter mile stretch

72
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,275
of the <i>circuit de Monaco</i>
in Monte Carlo.

73
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,654
I don't even think
it was the most expensive thing

74
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,032
 I ever owned,
but it certainly was the fastest.

75
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,853
New case on deck.

76
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,956
Dude, is that a king cobra?

77
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,988
This happened last month
on Mutanabbi street in Baghdad.

78
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,046
Six marines wounded, one killed.

79
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,423
- An ambush.
- Followed by a robbery.

80
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,698
$5 million in U.S. currency.

81
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,220
Reconstruction funds
headed for local contractors.

82
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:07,223
The Jihadist Raiders Front
took credit for it.

83
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,601
I've heard of these guys.
Formed in 1994,

84
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,894
by Abu Al Jaleel.

85
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,628
The State Department consider
the Jihadist raiders front

86
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,034
to be one of the more high
profile terrorist groups.

87
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,589
They got cells
right across the Mideast.

88
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,903
How did they find out
about the shipment?

89
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,283
You need top secret clearance
to get access to those convoy routes.

90
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,660
Routes were leaked.
After the ambush,

91
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:30,746
Delta raided a safe house
used by the Jihadist Raiders Front.

92
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:33,364
One of the things they recovered
was a SIM card

93
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,043
with an L.A. phone number on it,

94
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:36,655
belonging to...

95
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,118
Staff Sergeant Chad Jeffcoat,

96
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,736
who just happens to be
a military customs inspector

97
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:44,468
with access to convoy routes.

98
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:46,704
They called him 3 days
before the ambush.

99
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,596
Address?

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,474
Rents a bungalow in Redondo beach.
Address is on your phone.

101
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,792
His shift starts in... an hour.

102
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,256
You really have a GSA class 6 safe
in your den?

103
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,322
I've to keep my valuables safe.

104
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,656
What valuables?

105
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,924
I have a mint condition
Patrick Ewing rookie card,

106
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,006
a football signed by the 1986
New York Giants,

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,064
and the entire run of
the Silver Surfer comic book series.

108
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,380
Plus tickets
for the Lakers-Knicks tomorrow night.

109
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,341
They're both spoken for.

110
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,464
What else?

111
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,304
- What else? Why "what else"?
- Because that was way too easy.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,664
And because that

113
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:34,285
- is your "I'm hiding something" laugh.
- There is nothing else.

114
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,520
No, there is definitely
something else.

115
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,933
- We're here.
- That can't be it.

116
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,438
Conversation's over.

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,152
- Is this a Navy SEAL thing?
- I'll show you a Navy SEAL thing.

118
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,099
I'm waiting.

119
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,664
I have a Michael Jackson glove
from the "Bad Tour" in '87.

120
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,680
He threw it out in the front row
at the Madison Square Garden show.

121
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,982
One of those white gloves?

122
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,671
He was the King of pop, G.

123
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,177
With the sequins.

124
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,680
- The king of pop.
- Why just one glove and not two?

125
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,509
If you have to ask,
you just don't get it.

126
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,226
Jeffcoat. Focus.

127
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:25,152
How are you doing?

128
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,131
Good morning.

129
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,010
Chad's a buddy. We're supposed to have
lunch, but he doesn't seem to be around.

130
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,289
- You haven't seen him, have you?
- No, not today, buddy.

131
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:35,871
Thanks.

132
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,130
Have a good day.

133
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:42,758
Hey, G?

134
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,489
Just the one glove?

135
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:49,801
Don't do it.

136
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:57,184
Blood.

137
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:00,745
It's a blood trail.

138
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,496
No discoloration.
That's still fresh.

139
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,359
Spent nine millimeter shell.

140
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:08,422
The shooter must have used
a silencer.

141
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,532
Otherwise,
the neighbors would have called in.

142
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,723
Jeffcoat's wounded, he runs...

143
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,245
Second 9-millimeter shell.

144
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:19,308
He takes a second round,
but he's still on his feet.

145
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,314
Runs towards the car.

146
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,067
Trail ends here.

147
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,882
Perp either finished him off,
or he got away.

148
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,800
How far can you get
with two rounds in you?

149
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,074
Not far enough.

150
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:33,242
So where's the body?

151
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,180
I always unlock the car with the remote
as I come out the front door.

152
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,372
Trunk or backseat?

153
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:40,561
Trunk.

154
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:43,115
I'm going backseat.

155
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,398
Less lifting.

156
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:07,734
<i>Nada.</i>

157
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,687
Guess Chad's not coming to lunch.

158
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:59,869
If you were Jeffcoat, where you'd hide
your most prized possessions?

159
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,939
Depends on
what my most prized possessions are.

160
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,688
No loose floorboards.

161
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:09,733
No wall safes.

162
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,610
Bedroom's clear.

163
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:32,923
Here.

164
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,149
Dishwasher door is jammed.

165
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,057
False panel?

166
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,693
That's one way to launder money.

167
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,073
Ten-K brick.

168
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,787
It's a great place to hide stuff.

169
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,324
Unfortunately,
I don't have a dishwasher at my place.

170
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,096
If Jeffcoat suspected he was in trouble,
he would've taken this and bolted.

171
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,584
Not put on his uniform
and headed in to work.

172
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,593
Could've leaked the convoy route,
got paid, thought he was in the clear.

173
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:14,006
Or he crossed the wrong person
along the way.

174
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,298
Yeah, but who?

175
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,717
And where?

176
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,708
250,000. Sequential serial numbers.

177
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,519
That kind of money...

178
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,231
A guy could buy
a lot of sequined gloves.

179
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,027
He wore it on stage.

180
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,890
It has sentimental value.
You can't put a price on that.

181
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,287
What's your opinion a man who owns
a sequined Michael Jackson's glove?

182
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:44,078
The King of pop?

183
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,747
I like him already.
Who is he?

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,667
What's the word from Treasury?

185
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,741
Serial numbers came from the shipment
of reconstruction funds stolen by

186
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:58,231
- the Jihadist Raiders Front in Baghdad.
- The attack was last month.

187
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,656
It's plenty of time for Jeffcoat
to get back to him.

188
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,124
One of the keys
you found on Jeffcoat's lawn

189
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,308
was generated by an airstrip
in the North Valley

190
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,352
that rents out hangar spaces.

191
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,403
- He own a plane?
- Nope.

192
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,318
Don't lose it.

193
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,456
And don't spend it.

194
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,148
What is this?

195
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:43,320
Blues.

196
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,867
May not look like it, but...

197
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,566
I got soul.

198
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,644
- Cool harmonica, huh?
- My harmonica.

199
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:54,562
Sorry.

200
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,549
It was sitting on the table.

201
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,381
- I thoug it was Dom's.
- No.

202
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:02,823
It was a gift from my dad.

203
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,550
You don't talk about him much.

204
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,459
We were living on a base

205
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,053
in the middle of nowhere.

206
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:39,254
And one night, I wanted to go out
with my friends to the movies.

207
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,319
He said no.

208
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:45,852
He left me at home to go and have a beer
with some guys in his platoon.

209
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,237
So, I snuck out anyway.

210
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:53,999
<i>Titanic.</i>

211
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:56,393
The movie.

212
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:58,203
I loved it.

213
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,180
I still do. And you can make fun of me
all you want, I don't care.

214
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,086
Anyway...

215
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:06,818
After that, I came home.

216
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:09,912
He didn't.

217
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,978
MP found his body on the side
of the highway the next day.

218
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,394
Coroner needed dental records
to identify him.

219
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,821
What about his drinking buddies?

220
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,219
Questioned. Cleared.

221
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,661
Shipped out.

222
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,370
The case was never solved.

223
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,184
I was 15, so...

224
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,712
I never got to speak to them.

225
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:44,744
Well...

226
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,429
He would've been proud of you.

227
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,606
You play this better than I do.

228
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,148
You should see me play my banjo.

229
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,792
Looks like we missed a party.

230
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:14,362
Via Baghdad.

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,312
From the looks of it, this is
the rest of the stolen five millions.

232
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:25,104
Ski masks.

233
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:26,902
Coveralls.

234
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:29,293
Never been worn.

235
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,408
Someone's planning on taking something
that doesn't belong to them.

236
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:36,787
Not gonna ask twice.

237
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:40,791
Schematics from the Certified National
Bank in downtown L.A.

238
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,454
Jeffcoat was tied to a bank crew?

239
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,550
Why rob a bank when you've already got
a bag stuffed with millions of dollars?

240
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,449
Salerno, you here?

241
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,553
Federal agents! Stop right there!

242
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,796
G, you okay?!

243
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:39,057
You really got tickets
to the Lakers game tomorrow night?

244
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,463
I wouldn't do that.

245
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,340
Bad idea.

246
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,884
The worst.

247
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,553
- He didn't read the sign.
- Got to read the sign.

248
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,143
What is it, Eric?

249
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,253
Kensi just called from the hospital.

250
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,491
The hostile that you wounded
in the shootout

251
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,202
just came out of surgery.

252
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,610
Michael Joseph Benelli.

253
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,112
Ex-con who specializes
in high-end heists.

254
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,618
- And the money?
- Just spoke with Treasury.

255
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,506
It the remaining $4.75 million
from the convoy attack in Baghdad.

256
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,538
How does an L.A. Bank crew
wind up with terrorist money?

257
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,500
Guys have skill sets.
They're always for hire.

258
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:50,358
A Jihadist terrorist group paid
these guys $5 million to rob a bank?

259
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,374
There was something
in the bank they wanted,

260
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,341
the money was just
a down payment for the job

261
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,342
There's more.

262
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,387
I just reviewed the security cam footage
from outside the hangar.

263
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,515
I got this from approximately
48 hours ago.

264
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,227
That's the mailman we saw
outside of Jeffcoat's bungalow.

265
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:07,801
Facial rec ID'd him
as Damien Salerno,

266
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,232
prime suspect in 14 bank robberies

267
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,227
over the last 15 years.

268
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,431
Finally caught him
on an unrelated tax charge,

269
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,340
released from prison in may 08.

270
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:18,843
- Wasn't Mike Renko on that case?
- Yeah, he was.

271
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,638
LAPD also thinks

272
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,370
he's involved in at least five murders,
but they can't prove it.

273
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:24,871
Jeffcoat makes it six.

274
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,057
I guess Salerno decided his piece
of the pie wasn't big enough.

275
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:30,816
He's what you call
mastermind and muscle

276
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:33,329
rolled into one felonious package.

277
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:44,547
Mr. Benelli?

278
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,184
Nice.

279
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,631
A nurse who wears black leather.

280
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,314
Looks like I made it to Heaven,
after all.

281
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,305
I need to talk to you.

282
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,485
You're not the cop that shot me?

283
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,571
No. You wouldn't be here if I was.

284
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,903
My kind of girl.

285
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,245
What do you think Salerno's going to do
when he finds out he lost all his money?

286
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,320
Why don't you ask him?

287
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,416
Cause you were the only guy
who walked away.

288
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,128
Then you're talking to a dead man.

289
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,487
Not if you work with us.

290
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,011
It took some digging,
but I think I figured out

291
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,411
why these guys are targeting
this particular bank.

292
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,166
Since 9/11,

293
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,569
the FBI has been trying
to cut off terrorist groups

294
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,157
from their financial assets.

295
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,857
Their most recent success

296
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:32,022
was freezing a series of bank accounts
used by the Jihadist Raiders Front.

297
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:33,148
The amount?

298
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,346
Over $50 millions.

299
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,027
Guess where those funds are located?

300
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,030
Certified National Bank,
downtown L.A. branch.

301
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:41,865
Raiders want their money back.

302
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,159
They hired the best heist team
to get it for them.

303
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,161
But Salerno doesn't come cheap.

304
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,787
He demands an up-front payment.

305
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,999
So they attack the convoy,
take the cash, and ship to Salerno.

306
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,818
Jeffcoat must have been
a middle man.

307
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,462
He had security clearance to leak
the convoy route to the Raiders.

308
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,714
He'd bring Salerno
in to hit the bank.

309
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,954
But no bank keeps
$50 million in its vault.

310
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,260
Don't need to.

311
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,929
Banks retain assets electronically.

312
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,816
You have the right account numbers,
swift codes, passwords,

313
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,059
you can shift money electronically
anywhere, anytime.

314
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,802
Then why pay a heist crew?
Why not hire a hacker?

315
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,351
Because banks have
unique security protocols

316
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:15,899
for funds frozen by the FBI.

317
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:17,761
You have to have physical access

318
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,703
to the actual terminal
to move the money.

319
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,072
But that's never stopped you before.

320
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:24,817
Most hackers don't have access
to the toys that I do.

321
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,528
I could makes all very wealthy
in about two minutes.

322
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,875
I mean, if you wanted me to.

323
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,884
Not that you'd want me to.
Not that I would want to.

324
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:39,503
I'm just saying, you know?

325
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,683
What exactly are you saying, Eric?

326
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,179
<i>I think this is an inside job.</i>

327
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,737
All right, Eric, thank you.

328
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,478
What's his name?

329
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,771
Whose name?

330
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,008
The guy in the bank.

331
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,632
The man who's gonna wire the money
back to this terrorist group

332
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:01,361
and then tell the cops that he was
ordered to do it by the bank robbers.

333
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,147
- I don't know what you're talking.
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

334
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,064
<i>I want the name of the guy
in the bank who's gonna wire</i>

335
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,537
<i>the $50 million
to the Jihadist Raiders Front.</i>

336
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,872
The bank robbery was just a front...

337
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,333
An excuse so no one will suspect
the man on the inside.

338
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:19,139
I'm tired.

339
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,214
I need to sleep.

340
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,093
Sleep on this.

341
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:27,095
You're facing
a lot of years in prison.

342
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,264
We can cut you
a better deal than Salerno.

343
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:36,604
- Eric?
- <i>Yeah, Kensi?</i>

344
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,857
- You're on speaker.
- I'll take it from here.

345
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:44,821
He's not going to tell us.

346
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,114
It was a long shot.

347
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:49,367
- <i>I was hoping he'd cut a deal.</i>
- Will this guy lead us to Salerno?

348
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,555
Not willingly.

349
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,871
He's terrified of crossing him,
for good reason.

350
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,956
Then
maybe he'll unwillingly take us to him.

351
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:56,471
Already on it.

352
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,215
Guys, message from Mike Renko.

353
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,943
He says he's got someone
who can help us with this case.

354
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:05,413
Meet him at the boat shed.

355
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,034
On our way.

356
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,439
What's the prognosis, Doc?

357
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,919
Benelli's entire value system
is based on the use of violence.

358
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,741
The threat of Salerno finding him
will be too much to bear.

359
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,494
He's gonna run back to his boss
and beg for his life.

360
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,705
Good thing I tagged him
before he woke up from surgery.

361
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:39,581
GPS and audio taped under the, uh...

362
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,420
shoulder bandage?
That was smooth.

363
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:48,465
Up top. Come on.

364
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,137
I need to get this tail started.

365
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,890
And you need to get out
of the office more often.

366
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:02,410
Ever vigilant
Special Agent Mike Renko.

367
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:04,523
Late night clubbing, rock star?

368
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:07,218
I was working undercover
with a bunch of tweekers.

369
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,696
Freaking guys never sleep.

370
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:12,105
- What you got for us?
- Detective Matt Bernhart.

371
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:15,453
He's a buddy of mine in LAPD.
Busted Salerno eight years ago.

372
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,035
You still have friends in LAPD

373
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:19,181
- after the thing with the cop?
- And her horse?

374
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:22,210
You didn't tell Hetty about that,
did you?

375
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,546
- How could you do that?
- It wasn't technically illegal.

376
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,423
- But it was disturbing.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,551
So, Bernhart?
He's a good guy?

378
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,514
I heard hesitation.
Sam, did you hear that?

379
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,724
I see it, I hear it.
Hell, I can even smell It.

380
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,538
Bernhart's been known to walk
outside the lines a little bit,

381
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,646
- but he always gets results.
- So, he's dirty?

382
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,137
When you're a cop,
there's a fine line

383
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,366
between being dirty and effective.

384
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,403
We'll pass.

385
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,572
This case is already
hot enough as it is.

386
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:54,659
First, this guy's your best chance
at getting close to Salerno.

387
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,743
Second of all...

388
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:58,746
he's here already.

389
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:05,211
Detective Matt Bernhart,
Special Agents Callen and Hanna.

390
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,929
- How you doing?
- Good.

391
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,466
- Hey, man, what's going on?
- How you doing?

392
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,898
Good, good.

393
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,234
All right.

394
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,737
Why don't you tell
these guys about Salerno, Matt?

395
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,284
All right.

396
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,307
He's getting old.

397
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:24,731
He's not pulling heists anymore.
He's planning them.

398
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,149
He's sending a crew in,

399
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,817
and getting a cut of the score.

400
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,278
- Good to know.
- Now, Salerno's point man is

401
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,206
usually this psycho whack job
by the name of Johnnie Manning.

402
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,987
Johnnie Manning...

403
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,411
he wasn't one
of the guys at the hangar.

404
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,331
It's lucky for him.
Thanks for the heads-up, guys.

405
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,334
Wait. That's it?

406
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:45,960
You're kidding me.

407
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,020
- Thanks, pal.
- Thanks.

408
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:13,446
Callen, it's me.

409
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,937
Benelli's back
at the North Valley airstrip.

410
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,451
- Looks like he's waiting for someone.
- We're on our way.

411
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:20,745
Hey, Hetty.

412
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:27,241
A Mossberg M590.

413
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:30,105
Matte black finish 8-round capacity.

414
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,936
Not my favorite weapon, but it's...

415
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,028
it's a useful tool in a tight spot.

416
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,722
It's not

417
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,652
loaded?

418
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,519
Just checking.

419
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:49,153
I do prefer it
with the upper Picatinny rail

420
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,359
and the modified
standard heat shield,

421
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,738
but then my tastes are more refined,
no doubt,

422
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,073
than reprobate bank robbers.

423
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,286
I'm sorry for asking, Hetty,
but, wouldn' the recoil be just...?

424
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:02,745
It's a bitch.

425
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,696
No. I'm good. Good.
More of a...

426
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:10,609
surveillance guy. You know,
with the headphones and microphone.

427
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,770
Kensi talked to me about

428
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:16,092
her dad today.

429
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,096
Tragic.

430
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,266
You know, it's still an open case.

431
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,237
She said she still had
some questions who were supposed

432
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,604
to be with him that night.

433
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,327
They're out there somewhere.

434
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:33,067
What happens when she finds hem?

435
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,478
How do you know she has into ready?

436
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,589
- What do you got, Kensi?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

437
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,132
He's just waiting.

438
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:10,396
- <i>Hello, Mick.</i>
- Lerno, where are you?

439
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,357
Where's my money, Mick?

440
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,151
<i>I did everything I could to keep it
safe, you got to believe me.</i>

441
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,827
I hear law enforcement got it.

442
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:21,199
What did you do, tip them off,
cut yourself a deal, Mick?

443
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:22,702
<i>No. Salerno, no.</i>

444
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,577
Kensi, do you see Salerno?

445
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,664
- He's got to have eyes on Benelli.
- No, I don't have him.

446
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,042
He could be anywhere.

447
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,835
So, now it's a sprint? See who gets
taken down first, me or the bank.

448
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,376
<i>Are you nuts? You're still
going through with the bank?</i>

449
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,743
It's not like I can give them back
their down payment, now, can I?

450
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,572
<i>The Jihadist Raiders Front
is expecting this job</i>

451
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:43,397
<i>to get done in the next five days.</i>

452
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,890
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't taken down Jeffcoat.

453
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,518
We could've pulled the bank job
and walked away.

454
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm still pulling it.

455
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,314
You want me to show you
how much I need your help?

456
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,696
- <i>Guys, Benelli's down</i>. Benelli's down!
- We're moving in!

457
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
Shot came from the north.
High <i>ground, north gate.</i>

458
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,189
<i>I can't see him.</i>

459
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:15,211
<i>I can't see him, Sam.</i>

460
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,874
<i>North gates clear.</i>

461
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,899
<i>He is not here.
He is gone.</i>

462
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:32,294
All right, everything Salerno had on
Certified National Bank is right here.

463
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,458
Got the game plan, escape route.

464
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,109
Everything but the date and time
they plan on making their move.

465
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,736
What are the chances Salerno's gonna
get a new crew together?

466
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,243
Either he goes trough with this,

467
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:44,808
or he's gonna be looking
over his shoulder the rest of his life.

468
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,855
We identify
the inside man at the bank,

469
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:49,871
then the Jihadist Raiders Front will
lose the key piece in this whole plan.

470
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,081
Just combed through a list
of the bank's employees.

471
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:55,543
Ran them through some vectors.
No red flags like criminal records,

472
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,546
except for one who sticks out.

473
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:00,682
Meet... Curtis Lacross.

474
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,404
Okay, did his college year
abroad in Egypt.

475
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,270
He's active on jihadist web sites
with a radical bent,

476
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:11,475
and he's made seven phone calls
to Baghdad in the last month,

477
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:14,137
all to satellite phones
that are now disconnected.

478
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,660
So Raider's tactic.

479
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,172
They issue new phone numbers
every 14 days.

480
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:20,196
Makes them impossible to track down.

481
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,484
Curtis is also single.

482
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:26,324
He got active membership
to four different online dating sites.

483
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:39,103
Am I the only one who wonders
why there is a suspect in every case

484
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:40,843
who happens to be a bachelor?

485
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:44,217
Seeing how criminals tend to be males
with antisocial proclivities...

486
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:48,335
And also wonders why that always seems
to be the vector that we go after first.

487
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:51,849
The lowest hanging fruit
is the easiest to pick, Agent Blye.

488
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:55,834
Seriously, Curtis is gonna take time
to get close to.

489
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,865
Salerno and his crew could hit this bank
at any point in the next 5 days.

490
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,866
As despicable as the man is,

491
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:03,277
Salerno isn't
our primary target here.

492
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:05,571
The Jihadist Raiders Front is.

493
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:09,242
We need to confirm
who's working inside the bank

494
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:13,573
and make sure they give up
everyone else involved,

495
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,826
both here and in Baghdad.

496
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:18,042
And the clock is ticking,

497
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,254
Mr. Callen.

498
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,800
You ever thought
of getting a safe deposit box?

499
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:46,172
Time to dial in the Kensi charm.

500
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:48,311
Yeah, always me with the charm.

501
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:51,977
- Jelly bracelets.
- For good luck.

502
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,003
<i>Okay, Eric,</i> Kensi's going in.

503
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,352
All right, Sam.
<i>Accessing the bank cameras now.</i>

504
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,914
You went too far, Johnnie!

505
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,416
Hey, say my name again,
you're next! Roll with it.

506
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:41,876
Sam, I'm down.

507
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,133
I'm going in.

508
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,034
Cell phones on the ground
in front of you!

509
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,006
Let's go! Move!

510
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,828
Anybody that works here, line up
behind the counter. Let's go. Come on.

511
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,346
Move! Let's go!

512
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,509
We're moving
to the back<i> of the bank.</i>

513
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,853
Single file line. Now!

514
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,105
Eric, I'm going around the back.

515
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,806
<i>All right, Sam,</i>
I'm gonna disable the fire alarm

516
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,069
and locks, so you can get
inside the bank's emergency exit.

517
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,926
You want to live, do not look at me,
do not look at my colleagues.

518
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:13,091
Do you understand?
Let's go! Now!

519
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,033
Get back!

520
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:15,826
Two minutes!

521
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,256
Speak to me, Eric.

522
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,872
LAPD's on their way.

523
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,325
Move it!

524
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,781
All right. This is it.

525
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,667
You know what to do.

526
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:32,218
Now!

527
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:37,118
Come on!

528
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:38,391
I...

529
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,420
never got the call.

530
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,104
There's been a change of plans.

531
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,532
The cops are onto us.
Salerno pulled it up.

532
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,483
You want your money,
we gotta do it now.

533
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,308
Him.

534
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:53,941
Curtis?

535
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,242
- What is this?
- You're about to find out.

536
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:58,408
My name is Connor Lavery.

537
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,913
I'm the manager of this branch.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

538
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,416
Just... please just...

539
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,445
tell me what it is you want me to...

540
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:05,668
Get your hands up!

541
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:11,007
You're gonna take us to your office.
Right now, Connor.

542
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:11,943
Let's go.

543
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:17,947
<i>Approaching back door.</i>

544
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,642
- The door's locked, Eric.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

545
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,478
It looks like the bank upgraded
their security system last month.

546
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,997
I'm going to need some time
to work my way around it,

547
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,184
- breach their server.
- As quick as you can.

548
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,567
What do you want me to do?

549
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:38,280
Account 6441865-313.

550
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:40,502
There should be
about $50 million in there.

551
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:42,855
You will transfer everything
in that account

552
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:45,274
to this bank, using your pass codes.

553
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,250
Istanbul?

554
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,003
Do what he says, and you might see
your wife and kids again.

555
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:52,130
Come on.

556
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,675
Going as fast as I can, Sam.
We're almost there.

557
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:04,539
Come on.

558
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,438
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Almost, almost.

559
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:12,568
- It's done.
- We're good, let's roll.

560
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:15,552
- I copy.
- Copy that.

561
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,640
Follow me.

562
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,040
- Come on, Eric!
<i>- Three seconds, Sam.</i>

563
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:33,047
Get down! Get down!

564
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:42,628
Go!

565
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:07,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
Curtis has left the building.

566
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,796
On behalf of the LAPD, I'd like to say
it's a pleasure doing business with you.

567
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,558
- You're good.
- Yeah?

568
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,346
And you have no idea
how much it pains him to admit that.

569
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,718
I'm a man of many flaws.
Taste in friends is not one of them.

570
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:28,853
- Most of the time.
- This is my idea of a good time.

571
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:31,497
- He's growing on me.
- Yeah, does a good psycho.

572
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,566
Well, there's worse ways
to make a living.

573
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:34,935
All right.

574
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:38,659
Show ain't over yet.

575
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:42,256
Okay, everybody,
this operation is concluded.

576
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:45,440
Many thanks to all of you at the LAPD
for your help with this op.

577
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:49,344
Remember, the bank employees do not know
this was an undercover operation.

578
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,517
They've all been transported back
to the precinct for questioning.

579
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:55,542
Impressive performance.

580
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:58,215
Not quite Oscar-winning,
but definitely worthy of a nomination.

581
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:00,885
At least I made Curtis believe
it was real.

582
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,345
Next time, I'll be the bad guy.

583
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,430
All right.

584
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:05,938
Fine by me.

585
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,350
Got it, Eric.
We're on our way.

586
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:12,211
The GPS tracker you slipped
into Curtis' shirt is up and run.

587
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:15,190
All right, LAPD's gonna question
all the bank employees. Stay with them.

588
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,359
Where do you think
Curtis is gonna lead us now?

589
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,571
We'll find out.
Guess the jelly bracelets worked.

590
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:46,307
Looks like he's here
to meet someone.

591
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:50,687
Tell me you have control
of that wire transfer.

592
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,806
We can't let the Raiders
get a hold of that money.

593
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:53,979
<i>I'm getting close.</i>

594
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:56,341
Still trying
to figure out the subtleties

595
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:58,567
of the Turkish electroctronic
banking system.

596
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:00,903
<i>Okay, Mr. Subtle.</i>
<i>We'll, stay on it.</i>

597
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:28,055
Kens, have all the bank employees
been released yet?

598
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,033
Half an hour ago.
LAPD's not too happy about it.

599
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,796
From what they can tell,
none of them were involved in the heist.

600
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:34,561
<i>Thanks.</i>

601
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:43,279
That's Lavery, the bank manager.

602
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,906
Wasn't how I thought it'd go down.

603
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,951
You never said anyone was gonna
get killed! They shot that woman.

604
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,161
She was a Federal Agent.
She left them no choice.

605
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,247
So, now we're both
accessories to murder.

606
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:56,133
That's not
the only problem we've got.

607
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,626
Transfer hit Istanbul.

608
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,479
Problem is, money's disappeared.

609
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,367
- What? How'd this happen?
- You tell me.

610
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:07,715
You think I stole it? I'm supposed
to be on a plane to Syria in 2 hours.

611
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,523
You were always in it for the money!

612
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:12,369
I was supposed to take my cut
and go back to work Monday morning, so?

613
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:13,392
Where did it go?

614
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:16,645
It can't be.

615
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,858
I think I look pretty good for
a guy who took 2 shots this morning.

616
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:22,811
What is this?

617
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,405
For the first time today,
it's exactly what it looks like.

618
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:53,599
CBP has just apprehended
Damien Salerno.

619
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:57,019
He was, quote, "trying to get
over the border into Mexico".

620
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,396
He's with Renko now, hopefully
telling him everything he knows

621
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:02,274
about the Jihadist Raiders Front.

622
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,485
That is great news.

623
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:08,738
You still haven't found
a satisfactory spot for your stuff?

624
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:13,599
I was going to rent
a safe deposit box, but...

625
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:17,164
what happens when I want my stuff
and the banks are closed?

626
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:22,336
I've done a pretty good job,
I think,

627
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,866
of letting go of my attachment
to most physical objects.

628
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:28,572
But I've never been able
to let go of

629
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:30,886
my antique jewelry collection.

630
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:33,317
It's in a safe place,

631
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,749
and I could certainly
make room for your things.

632
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,271
I would never want to take away space
from your collection.

633
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,270
Well, that would be impossible.
I have an entire...

634
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:46,201
warehouse in Santa Monica,
devoted to it.

635
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,034
Thank you.

636
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,490
But...

637
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,131
it's just certain things...

638
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,664
you want to keep within arm's reach.

639
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:01,301
Well, in that case,

640
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:04,827
we have extra space
in the archives room in back.

641
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:08,002
Your things would be safe
and close by.

642
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:13,485
Thank you very much.

643
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:08,303
What can I do for you this evening?

644
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:11,445
- A quarter mile stretch of asphalt.
- Circuit de Monaco. Monte Carlo.

645
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,698
- Not your the most expensive thing.
- But it was definitely the fastest.

646
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:17,319
Gentlemen,

647
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:20,177
I'm late
for a very important meeting.

648
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:24,589
- Ferrari?
- Aston Martin?

649
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,215
1955 Porsche Spyder.

650
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,360
A work...

651
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,916
of art.

652
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,309
I just never got used
to the understeer.

653
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:48,398
- I have this safe at home.
- GSA class 6.

654
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:52,242
It's fireproof
under the fake floor boards in the den.

655
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,870
I keep a few things
under lock and key.

656
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:57,226
Like tickets
to the Lakers-Knicks game tonight.

657
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:59,233
I thought those were spoken for.

658
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:02,056
I want to see how you'd handle
the Mickael Jackson glove situation.

659
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:04,087
- With the sequins.
- Yeah.

660
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:06,500
And?

661
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,571
And I am cutting you a break...

662
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,897
- again.
- I like you cutting me a break.

663
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,589
Very nice, and I'll even let you
wear the glove.

664
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,881
Gonna take a pass on that one.

665
00:43:16,088 --> 00:43:18,059
