00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,305
Positive reinforcement
has been proven to work.

4
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:00,332
I prefer negative reinforcement.
Silent treatment, the cold shoulder.

5
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:02,099
You make people squirm,
they'll perform.

6
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,414
It's also an acceptable
form of human conduct.

7
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,143
Which I want nothing to do with.

8
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,805
You know, like... Im'ing
or poppin' and lockin'.

9
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,697
Whatever. It's still the best operation
report you'll ever see,

10
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,144
- whether you want to admit it or not.
- Let me see this.

11
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,586
This is nice.

12
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,614
Got the color-coded tabs.
You got the highlighted bullet points.

13
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:25,400
Wait a minute.
Did your mom help you with this?

14
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,438
I warned you
about bringing up my mom.

15
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,606
Very nice. I'm sure
Hetty will give you a gold star.

16
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,575
I can't wait to see what you do
for your science fair project.

17
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,160
Maybe we could build a volcano.

18
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,182
- Maybe I should just...
- Throw me in one?

19
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,487
That's not what I was going to say.

20
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:42,008
Well, glad to see you two
are closer than ever.

21
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,500
Mike Renko, back from the dead.

22
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,639
- How was the vacation?
- Very funny.

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,617
Answer me this. How come
I'm squatting in a bush for two months

24
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,781
smacking bugs while you guys
are out cruising the beaches?

25
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,466
I guess you have the face for it.

26
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,134
You smoke out any bad guys?

27
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,971
I've been chasing this militia group.
Call themselves ELE.

28
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,056
"Enhancing Law Enforcement."

29
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,352
It's been a tough one,
but I finally got an informant.

30
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:11,023
He can help us link them to a couple
weapons gone missing from Pendleton.

31
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:14,469
Looks like you got
your bunkmate back, G.

32
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,111
Love boat sails again.

33
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,828
Not with me on board.

34
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,838
No, I'll be staying with a...

35
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,074
friend.

36
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,827
- Right.
- Wait a minute.

37
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,499
Back in town less than 24 hours,
and you're staying with a "friend"?

38
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,834
- It's...
- Astonishing.

39
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,505
Astonishing that a person
of such modest appearances and charm...

40
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,421
Questionable personal hygiene...

41
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:38,710
Is, you know,
wracking up tail like...

42
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:41,878
Wants you. Upstairs.

43
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,348
She said one point
for whoever gets up here first.

44
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,044
Are you punking us?

45
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,360
- 'cause you better not be.
- No, sir. I would not do that.

46
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:06,499
- Then, where is she?
<i>- I'm everywhere, Mr. Renko.</i>

47
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,957
<i>Or have you been on assignment
so long you've forgotten?</i>

48
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,466
- She's in Washington.
- I apologize

49
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,007
for not being with you,

50
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,985
but the political world beckons.

51
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,176
Of course, our work doesn't stop...
while Washington tinkers.

52
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,469
So, let's get to it.

53
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:25,199
<i>Mr. Beale, please play the tape.</i>

54
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,363
<i>The man against the glass
is a Marine reservist</i>

55
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:33,230
<i>who worked at an armory
at Camp Pendleton.</i>

56
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:36,161
Does anybody else
think this is weird?

57
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:38,434
- We all think it's weird.
- Just checking.

58
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,679
<i>I heard that, Mr. Callen.</i>

59
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:43,615
- How?
<i>- Marine Lance Corporal</i> Edward Mackaye.

60
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:47,927
<i>Mackaye was garroted
at the Cabrillo marine aquarium.</i>

61
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:50,914
<i>The entire incident
was caught on something called</i>

62
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:55,049
<i>a fish-cam, which broadcast 24/7</i>

63
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:58,013
<i>- on the Internet.</i>
- Now, this Mackaye, he's a reservist.

64
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,007
Wouldn't that be
a case for local PD?

65
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,426
I'll leave
that for Mr. Renko to explain.

66
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,198
<i>Case is yours, Mr. Callen.</i>

67
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,291
Mackaye wasn't just punching
a time card.

68
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,145
He was my informant
on the weapons case I've been following.

69
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,587
I've got it all here.

70
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:19,741
Over a three-month period,
six Dragon antitank missiles disappeared

71
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:23,349
somewhere between the manufacturer
and Afghanistan.

72
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,118
Interchangeable warheads.
Small, portable,

73
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,323
scary as hell.

74
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,955
We narrowed it down
to an armory at Pendleton.

75
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,833
Prime suspect is
private Scott Riley.

76
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:36,577
Now, Riley is very smart.

77
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,659
We have not been able
to hang anything on this guy.

78
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:41,632
Haven't been able to figure out
how he got the Dragon off the base.

79
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,343
Pull up everything you've got
on Mackaye.

80
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,159
That's when we approached
Corporal Mackaye.

81
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,963
A good Marine. Stand-up kid.

82
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,791
He worked in the armory with Riley.

83
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,188
He was supposed
to be eyes and ears only.

84
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,661
Let us know if Riley was up
to anything suspicious.

85
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,817
And how is this connected
to the militia group?

86
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:04,029
We knew ELE was in the market
for heavy firepower.

87
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:07,091
I've been trying to track down
their base of operations for months,

88
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,993
but these guys just keep moving around.
Mostly border areas.

89
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,475
- Just like the coyotes.
- Exactly.

90
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:16,208
Illegals come across,
ELE is right there waiting for them.

91
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:19,662
We pulled phone records
going back a decade.

92
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,839
Turns out our private Riley...
has a history

93
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,750
with two of ELE's suspected leaders.

94
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:28,596
This is Malcolm Tallridge,
the charismatic founder.

95
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,413
His number two, John Bordinay.

96
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:33,304
Paranoid nut job.

97
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:35,352
Brains and muscle.

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,307
We think that this is Bordinay
behind the gun.

99
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:40,610
This video was leaked onto the web.

100
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:47,406
Last summer, these guys chased
20 people into the desert.

101
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,909
All of them died of thirst,
including three children.

102
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:52,611
It doesn't bother them.

103
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,579
The deaths prove their point:

104
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,599
the situation's out of control,
and they need to engage.

105
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,283
They claim to be protecting
our freedom.

106
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,631
We were hoping to lock these guys down
before they did something really crazy.

107
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,273
Like arming themselves
with Dragon missiles?

108
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,816
I think maybe they just have.

109
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,093
Welcome to DC, Henrietta.

110
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,792
Director Vance.

111
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:36,580
Door-to-door service.
How out of character.

112
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,541
Well, people can change.
And I owe you one big-time.

113
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,754
You do, especially for forcing me
to leave the children in charge.

114
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,057
How much trouble can
they get into in eight hours?

115
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,857
Is that how long I'm going
to be here?

116
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:52,516
Good gracious. You told me
they had a few questions

117
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,744
regarding the security
of your slush fund.

118
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,145
Think of it more along the lines
of a friendly fireside chat,

119
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,065
about the efficacy
of the funding disbursement

120
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,601
process for the federal
joint-task force system.

121
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,653
Why don't they just throw me
in a well and see if I float?

122
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,662
This isn't a witch hunt, Hetty.

123
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:14,068
I recall the same thing
being said to my predecessor

124
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,506
before she disappeared.

125
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,926
Last I heard of Macy,
she was working out

126
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,540
of a Quonset hut in Djibouti.

127
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:40,167
Mackaye wouldn't have gone
into the aquarium to meet anyone.

128
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:43,021
Not while it was being cleaned.
Now, what I'm thinking is...

129
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:45,941
that someone was after him.
So, he goes into the aquarium,

130
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,838
to hide. Bad guy goes after him,
and... splat.

131
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,279
Mackaye makes
his guest appearance on fish-cam.

132
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,700
So, Riley comes to the beach,
our "eyes and ears" follows him.

133
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,177
Eyes and ears gets made.
Bad guy goes rogue, he panics,

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,039
- takes him out.
- Why would the bad guy be here?

135
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,291
I mean, there's no target to attack.

136
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,464
People are too spread out,
it's far too exposed, and it's...

137
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,673
lousy with law enforcement thanks
to the port across the way.

138
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,859
Could you fit a Dragon missile
into a sail bag?

139
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,373
With room to spare.

140
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,639
What are the chances
Riley windsurfs?

141
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,299
Security footage from Pendleton.

142
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,480
So, Riley leaves the base in his SUV
with his windsurfing equipment

143
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,692
on the roof rack. And the guards
check everything: the front, the back,

144
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,844
everything,
but they never open the sail bag.

145
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,780
Riley goes to the beach
and covers his tracks.

146
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,969
Or maybe that's where he delivered
the weapons. They take his sail bag,

147
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,157
he takes theirs.

148
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,078
Return to base, repeat step one.

149
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,206
Six times, which is probably
why Renko got nowhere.

150
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,110
<i>You hearing this, Kensi?</i>

151
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,919
Yeah. I'm staring
at Riley's rig right now.

152
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,463
<i>- Parked outside his apartment.</i>
- Where about Riley?

153
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,132
I haven't seen him yet.

154
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:53,664
You know what?

155
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,633
I'm going to go have a sniff around,
<i>see if he's been moving explosives.</i>

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,829
Bad idea, Private.

157
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,594
- You started without me.
- Oh, god.

158
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,402
You wandered off
to observe the scenery.

159
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,404
I was checking Riley's mailbox.

160
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,573
What, no thanks for saving your ass?

161
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,784
My ass didn't need saving.

162
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,827
- Sure it did.
- I'm pretty sure it didn't.

163
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:04,705
Give me your hands.

164
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,957
If anyone's ass
deserves saving, it's yours.

165
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,143
I thought you were stealing my sail.

166
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:12,902
So you garrote me?

167
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:15,840
- You whack my head into a car?
- It's a tough neighborhood.

168
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,666
You could have had
a friend or a gun.

169
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,107
Turns out, you had both.

170
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,833
Why don't you just tell me about
your involvement with ELE?

171
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,060
Who?

172
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,191
The guys you sold the Dragons to.

173
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,349
Should she be alone in there
with him? I mean, he's huge.

174
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,243
Riley's bigger and stronger, but...

175
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:44,911
she's meaner.

176
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,790
We searched his apartment.
There's nothing of value there.

177
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,577
Eric and Dom combed through
his bank accounts, his credit cards.

178
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:56,009
If this guy was getting paid,
he's had some serious self-control.

179
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,918
Riley manages to get a Dragon off
a secure base on 6 different occasions.

180
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,471
That's smart.

181
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,464
But when your guy Mackaye follows him,
Riley kills him on fish-cam?

182
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,949
- Not so smart.
- It's impulsive, desperate.

183
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,734
I don't know. I just get the feeling
the game's changed.

184
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:19,446
He's lying, he's stonewalling,
and he is messing with me.

185
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,364
Sounds like you on a second date.

186
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,159
Nothing you'll ever have
to worry about.

187
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,944
Even used a different cord
for his creepy garrote MO.

188
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,428
There is one thing I'm sure of.

189
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,614
He stole the missiles...

190
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,713
and he killed Mackaye.

191
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,912
This guy is part Tim McVeigh,
part 9/11 bomber.

192
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,468
He will never betray his cause.

193
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,928
- Freeing America?
- But he's a follower,

194
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,388
not a leader.

195
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,724
I think he's afraid of something.

196
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,564
Or someone.

197
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,409
Get out.

198
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:14,000
Private Riley?

199
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,450
Thank you.

200
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,510
He's all yours, boys.

201
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,608
See you tomorrow, Scott.

202
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,677
We'll be talking some more.

203
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,613
What are you looking at?

204
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:08,625
It's a nice cattle car.

205
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:12,010
But you couldn't afford upholstery
for the whole thing? Is that it?

206
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:18,022
I've been in a cell for three days.

207
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,709
Okay? I want a shower,
a shave and a clean uniform.

208
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:23,903
- You shouldn't have dishonored it.
- I have rights, you know.

209
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,282
You signed those away.
Uncle Sam owns you.

210
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,868
You messed with him.
I hope it was worth it, Corporal.

211
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,397
"Hope it was worth it."

212
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,580
Listen to this guy.

213
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,058
Check out that MP outfit.

214
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,656
You think he made
those chevrons in shop class?

215
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,258
- Why don't you leave me out of it?
- Why don't you leave me out of it?

216
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,649
Look at you.
Get you two a room together?

217
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,258
How many MPs does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

218
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:54,975
50.

219
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,752
One to screw in the light bulb,
49 <i>to stand guard.</i>

220
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,952
That is the worst joke
I have ever heard.

221
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:02,859
No kidding. What is Callen doing?

222
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,153
Psych 101: forging a bond with Riley

223
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,593
by creating a common enemy in Sam.

224
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,148
- <i>You want another?</i>
- No!

225
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,869
Why don't MPs take showers
before they go to battle?

226
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,605
'Cause they're just gonna wash up
on the shore anyways.

227
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,032
You got a little smile.

228
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,294
Got a little smile there.
How you doing?

229
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,803
That's good to hear
you still know who you are.

230
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,887
- You having a good time in Washington?
- The last person to have

231
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,228
a good time in Washington
was General Jubal early

232
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:42,064
in 1864. He was attacking it
at the time.

233
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,569
<i>The patients</i> haven't burned down
the asylum yet?

234
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,079
So far, so good.

235
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,115
<i>- And how's Mr. Callen doing?</i>
- He is operational.

236
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:53,076
Operational?

237
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,995
Renko's operation against the militia,
we had a breakthrough.

238
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,707
What kind of a breakthrough, Eric?

239
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,669
These guys won't install a landline
or talk on a cell phone, but Riley

240
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,838
uses his laptop to search porn,
fringe propaganda sites and...

241
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,794
247 addresses on Google Maps.

242
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,980
<i>This is a crackpot,
cockamie the operation.</i>

243
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,519
<i>I leave for a few hours,
and you all turn into lunatics!</i>

244
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,675
These militia groups
are far more paranoid

245
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,588
than you could possibly appreciate.

246
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,526
Now this is what I want you to do.

247
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,049
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

248
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,595
It wasn't me.

249
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:38,762
Good lord!
Good lord! Damn! Damn!

250
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,029
Hetty, it's Nate. We did
a full risk analysis in every component,

251
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:50,383
and we ran it by Director Vance,
and he signed off.

252
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:52,824
And why didn't you inform me?

253
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,971
<i>You were in a Senate hearing.</i>

254
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,975
<i>You have no idea
what you're up against here.</i>

255
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:02,103
<i>Your risk assessment is useless.</i>

256
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,814
<i>The dangers are unquantifiable.</i>

257
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,750
Mr. Callen could be...

258
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,902
killed, or worse.

259
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,687
Ms. Lange?
The committee is ready for you.

260
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:15,470
Shut... it... down, Nate.

261
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,530
Hetty, it's... <i>too late.</i>

262
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,406
Miss Lange.

263
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:29,219
I have something here.

264
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,778
Riley's hits on Google Maps...

265
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,385
all 247 of them
are federal buildings.

266
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,324
They're
Immigration Processing Centers.

267
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,739
I think we might have
a list of potential targets.

268
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:44,437
You work out every day?

269
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,094
You probably have time
for that, being an MP.

270
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,420
Work out, play dress-up.

271
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,071
Chasing guys like me around,
instead of America's true enemies.

272
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:55,615
I'm a true patriot.

273
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,334
I'm proud of my country.

274
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,703
It's just the government that sucks.

275
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,013
What the hell? Someone's shooting.

276
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,232
What took you so long?

277
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,151
- I got here, okay?
- Just get the keys.

278
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:33,850
Give me the gun.

279
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,365
- What's going on?
- It's not your problem, buddy.

280
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,221
- Who are you guys?
- Not your problem!

281
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:51,546
Wait.

282
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:53,648
- Damn it.
- Wait!

283
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:54,841
Idiots.

284
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,215
What about me?
You can't leave me here.

285
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,262
- Leave me out of it, remember?
- Unlock me!

286
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,681
I can help us. I got friends.

287
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:05,377
- You know what? We all got friends.
- Listen to me. This guy is connected.

288
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,145
He's got people
all over the country.

289
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,824
He can help us.
He's got weapons, he's got food,

290
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:11,357
safe places to stay, you know?

291
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,192
They will never find us.

292
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,943
Riley's taking the bait.

293
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:21,366
Callen has done in two hours
what easily could have taken two years

294
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:24,454
to accomplish.
Infiltrate a paranoid extremist group.

295
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,707
- Party's over, boys.
- Nice job, fellas.

296
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,148
Clear this out of here.

297
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:55,151
- Got the GPS locator?
- Signal's strong and clear.

298
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,858
- Change of clothes?
- In the back.

299
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,945
Come on, let's go!

300
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:37,970
Please tell me
we're not going camping.

301
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,412
- Are we going camping?
- No, we're not camping.

302
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:41,823
'Cause I hate camping.

303
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,332
Hold your fire, Jay! It's Riley!

304
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:52,250
- Give me the pistol.
- I don't think so.

305
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,795
The man that we are going to see does
not take kindly to strangers with guns.

306
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,417
You've gotta be kidding me.

307
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,766
I'm being shot at
by a Jonas brother.

308
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,811
<i>And I think I'm about to meet
the rest of the family.</i>

309
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:17,066
Point that thing at me again
and I will break your neck.

310
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,530
- Take me to Malcolm.
- He hates strangers.

311
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,305
Fine, it's your funeral.

312
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,909
It's Jay, I'm coming back.
There's company.

313
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,829
Is there gonna be a bathroom
where we're going?

314
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:31,959
You can go in the woods.

315
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,711
I knew it. I save your life
and you take me camping.

316
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,898
At least where I come from,
they got toilets.

317
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,734
And TV and fun!

318
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,688
At least where I come from,
we know how to shut our mouth.

319
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,471
At least I don't have
an Appalachian goatee.

320
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,328
At least I can grow one.

321
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,281
Nate, you got a minute?
I think you need to hear this.

322
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,072
Ten years ago, Hetty worked
with an agent named Sullivan.

323
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,203
He was killed
infiltrating a militia group.

324
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,550
- That explains her reaction.
- Yeah, but there's something else.

325
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:18,076
She personally recruited him...
to NCIS.

326
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,930
She was an operations manager
on the joint task force with Miami PD.

327
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:26,594
She wrote his recommendation letter
to get him the job.

328
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,802
Said the he was the best young detective
that she'd ever seen.

329
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:34,074
"Composed, confident

330
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:36,604
and mentally suited to the rigors
of undercover work."

331
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,875
Remind you of anyone?

332
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,362
- I'm sorry, this is a private meeting.
- Jack,

333
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,543
it's okay.

334
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,467
Why on God's green earth
did you not tell me, Leon?

335
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,459
Excuse me, Senators.

336
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:56,678
There are very few ways to infiltrate
a militia, you have to jump at...

337
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,250
The reason you can't get in

338
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,128
is they're crazy
and paranoid and dangerous.

339
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,464
Callen is not Sullivan.

340
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:07,132
Now, we deal with terrorists,
cartels and gangs every day.

341
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:09,136
No reason to think
that this'll be any different.

342
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,966
Will you please escort Miss Lange
back to the hearing

343
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,458
- so she can finish her testimony.
- Right this way, ma'am.

344
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:19,064
I'll take care of it, Hetty.
I promise.

345
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:23,088
Some promises you can't keep, Leon.

346
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,577
There's been a lot
of traffic through here, guys.

347
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:37,196
I'm thinking about, at least,
five different vehicles,

348
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:38,575
maybe one heavy truck.

349
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,328
I found Callen's earwigs.

350
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,758
G's worried he's gonna get searched.

351
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,830
Guess the paranoia's contagious.

352
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,913
Okay, here we go.

353
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:30,968
That's one of the Dragons.

354
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,683
That's Malcolm Tallridge,
the founder of ELE.

355
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,644
Nasty guy next to him is John Bordinay,
his right-hand man.

356
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,440
Malcolm, Bordinay.

357
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,358
Riley, who's your friend?

358
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,320
He was on the transport.
His buddies sprung us.

359
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,030
- Where's the buddies?
- Dead.

360
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:56,618
I think we just hit the mother lode.
All missiles are right in that cabin.

361
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:01,004
Killed a Marine,

362
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:04,210
got yourself caught
and took out a transport?

363
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,149
Then you brought a outsider here?

364
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,428
- How many ways you gonna expose us?
- It's safer this way.

365
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,330
No one gets picked up,
no one answering questions.

366
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,084
This is
the entire militia organization.

367
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,017
We need back-up now.

368
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,400
Done.

369
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,059
On their way.

370
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,939
Callen will get the hell out of there
first chance he gets, right?

371
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:28,526
If he keeps his head down,
we're home free.

372
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,902
Yeah, piece of cake.

373
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:33,512
He's right.

374
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,454
Don't fire unless you have to!

375
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,504
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

376
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,445
Don't shoot him!
Do not shoot!

377
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,319
What do we do now?

378
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,718
I don't want trouble, Malcolm.

379
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:07,166
You all seem
like patriotic citizens.

380
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:09,858
You know how to hold up
your end of a deal, am I right?

381
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,825
Who's in the woods, son?

382
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:13,238
You tell me.

383
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,990
I just want the keys
to that truck and I'm gone.

384
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,408
No one gets hurt.

385
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:19,869
Don't worry,
they're not gonna shoot us.

386
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,658
I'm not sure about that.

387
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:28,346
Call them off, Malcolm!

388
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:30,797
Go ahead, shoot the kid.

389
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,382
He's willing to die for his cause.

390
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,718
Is that what you want, Jay?

391
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:40,532
He'd rather not, Malcolm.

392
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:44,769
What do you say you and I have
a conversation? We talk about this?

393
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,102
I need Director Vance on the phone.

394
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:50,362
No, we need that back-up now!
I have an agent in distress.

395
00:26:50,404 --> 00:26:52,277
I'm getting the ETA,
they're on their way.

396
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,736
- Maybe Hetty was right.
- Hetty's always right.

397
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:57,626
Jay is a kid.

398
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,099
Now, you don't need
that kind of press.

399
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:02,953
Not gonna be real good
with your recruitment effort.

400
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:07,295
What is Sam doing?

401
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,545
Keep your cool.

402
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,615
I'm not armed!

403
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,163
I'm with the ATF.

404
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,325
We have the camp surrounded.

405
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:20,386
I'm authorized
to negotiate a settlement.

406
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,736
We don't want another Ruby Ridge.

407
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,996
<i>We know about the Dragons.
We know about MacKaye.</i>

408
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:28,835
<i>We've had agents watching you
for three weeks.</i>

409
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:31,621
- <i>I'm here to talk.</i>
- What on earth is he doing?

410
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:34,651
- The other guy's an agent?
- Yeah, Agent Callen.

411
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,987
Everybody's standing down,
no one's coming in.

412
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,989
You and I have 30 minutes
to make a deal.

413
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:44,397
Hope backup gets here fast.

414
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:45,934
Eyes open.

415
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,576
- It sounds like you have us in a bind.
- It's textbook negotiation.

416
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:54,361
He's giving the illusion
that he has a bargaining chip.

417
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,589
But he doesn't.

418
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:58,759
Let's see how good you are.

419
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:00,622
Go get your friend, then we'll talk.

420
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,265
Let him through.

421
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:11,604
G, I'm coming to you.

422
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,893
I hope you have
a better plan than this.

423
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:17,945
Move those bodies.

424
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,692
Okay, everything's good.

425
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:35,170
Now what?

426
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:39,258
You think the ATF's gonna come in guns
blazing when there's hostages involved?

427
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,593
You have to wait 30 minutes to see.

428
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,586
Jay, come here.

429
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:50,510
Come here.

430
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:56,943
Hey, come on, man.

431
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,902
- You didn't need to do that.
- G!

432
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,690
- How long was I out?
- Few minutes.

433
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,640
I've been kicking you
the whole time.

434
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:30,308
In the side of the head?

435
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:35,022
Why aren't we dead?

436
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,691
Because they wanna find out if
they're surrounded by 50 agents.

437
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:39,275
 How long is that gonna take?

438
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,072
I'd say the time it takes to pack up
and realize no one's shooting 'em.

439
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:45,449
Think they'll do that before
or after they kill us?

440
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,492
After, definitely after.

441
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,453
You want explain yourself?

442
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,409
Explain myself?
I saved your skinny ass.

443
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,417
Let's see, I had a gun
and a hostage before you got here.

444
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,231
Now I'm, I'm chained up
to a stove with a concussion.

445
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,556
- That's a nice save.
- Ten more seconds, 

446
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,385
you'd have a dozen
new bullet holes in you.

447
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:05,677
Now what?

448
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,763
I was hoping you had some ideas.

449
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,546
I'm thinking I want my gun
and my hostage back.

450
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,960
Excuse me.

451
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:16,592
Sorry to pull you out.

452
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:18,915
How bad?

453
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,262
They have Callen and Sam.

454
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,886
Back-up is en route.

455
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,076
That's it?

456
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,625
The LA field office
is doing everything they can.

457
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,750
There's nothing more
you can do here.

458
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,051
We should know more soon.

459
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:43,071
Chopper's at 23 minutes out.

460
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,649
This is gonna be over in ten.
They're already packing up the missiles.

461
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:47,136
We gotta buy them some time then.

462
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,916
- You got any ideas?
- Drive another car into the camp?

463
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,932
Think that's gonna work again?

464
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,764
Take a look at this.

465
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:02,025
How's your Morse code?

466
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,114
That was the last one.

467
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,459
This just keeps getting better.

468
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,154
Is it flickering?

469
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,171
It feels like it's flickering.

470
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:24,443
That's because it's Morse code.

471
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:27,227
- Got it.
- What?

472
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,635
That bobby pin.

473
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,219
I started wearing it in the '90s.
Haven't used it since.

474
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,301
That's the most well-trained display
of standard

475
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:35,142
operating procedure
I've ever seen from you.

476
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:36,879
Oh, no.

477
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:39,062
- What?
- I dropped it.

478
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:42,109
- You dropped it? How could you drop it?
- Well, it kind of sprung.

479
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:44,693
Oh, I got it. I'm good.

480
00:31:45,658 --> 00:31:48,178
- Just keep reading the code.
- Keep your head still.

481
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,999
It's still. Am I good?

482
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:55,829
Kensi says the choppers
are 20 minutes out.

483
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:59,168
How do you know
it was Kensi not Renko?

484
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,543
Kensi versus Renko...

485
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,378
Who remembers their Morse code?

486
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,006
Can you send it back?

487
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:10,871
Yeah, I can send it back. It's called
training and paying attention.

488
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:15,763
- You said I was well-prepared.
- Must've been Stockholm syndrome.

489
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:28,320
"Maskelyne?"

490
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,642
- <i>What the hell is "maskelyne"?</i>
- "Maskelyne"? I don't know.

491
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:33,411
Maybe it's a code word.

492
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,285
Incoming! It's Hetty.

493
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:37,760
Hetty, it's all of us.
Please don't yell.

494
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:39,039
<i>I'm not yelling.</i>

495
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:40,541
What don't I know?

496
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,252
Backup will be there in...
18 minutes.

497
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,545
<i>Hetty, we don't think
they can last that long.</i>

498
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:50,082
<i>And Nate got a message from</i> Kensi
from Callen in Morse code

499
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:51,992
about something<i> called "Maskelyne".</i>

500
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:55,860
Maskelyne!

501
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:59,053
It's not a thing, it's a who.

502
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:02,627
He was a magician in World War II.

503
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,898
He invented subterfuge.

504
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:09,307
He could make an entire squadron
of tanks disappear.

505
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:13,083
He tricked the Nazis
into believing that

506
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,533
a handful of men
was an entire division.

507
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,859
- Smoke and mirrors.
- <i>Now, listen.</i>

508
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,986
These militia groups... They already
believe they're being pursued

509
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:24,418
by the full force
of the United States government.

510
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,664
- So we play to those fears.
-<i> Exactly.</i>

511
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:35,419
I've jammed all the radio signals
in the area.

512
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:38,015
They'll start futzing with the dials
to try to find the frequency.

513
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,640
And hopefully stumble upon us.

514
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,226
Now, the idea is to make them think
that they're surrounded.

515
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,004
- One becomes ten.
- Yeah.

516
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:46,462
Mr. Secretary.

517
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:48,772
Henrietta.

518
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:50,944
What can I do for you?

519
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,477
Desmond, I need a favor.

520
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,059
A small one.

521
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,649
All teams in place?

522
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:01,097
Teams one, two, three taking positions
north, northwest and southwest.

523
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:03,040
Teams four<i> and five,
snipers in position?</i>

524
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:07,271
<i>Sniper one, target identified.
Sniper two, target in sight.</i>

525
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,878
<i>Roger, sniper three, target identified,
militia leader. Permission to engage?</i>

526
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:12,913
- Malcolm, are you hearing this?
- Yeah.

527
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:14,468
Kensi, go.

528
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,180
<i>Man, we got gunfire, gunfire.</i>

529
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,125
- You think we can make a run for it?
- No.

530
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:39,158
Want to try it anyways?

531
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,203
Drop it.

532
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,207
- We're not going to go through this.
- Nice face.

533
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:48,739
You know,
they're not very nice to you out there.

534
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:50,420
At least I'm not a complete liar.

535
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:53,548
At least I'm not running around
with a bunch of wannabe Rambos.

536
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:56,551
You ought to be
with your friends playing Guitar Hero,

537
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,822
or down at the beach
picking up chicks.

538
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:01,373
Not camping out with a bunch
of the<i> Hills Have Eyes</i> psychos.

539
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,499
What do you think the missiles are for?
Self-defense?

540
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,432
There comes a time when you got
to choose which side you're on.

541
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,098
Malcolm!

542
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:26,572
There's 20 agents...
They're on the access road.

543
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:27,970
They're coming for us!

544
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,657
You're sure about that?
You sure you didn't just imagine it?

545
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,894
They're coming. I swear.
We need to get out of here.

546
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,211
Looks like they bought it.

547
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:49,581
He's not going to stop.

548
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,500
- He'll stop.
- No, he's not.

549
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,964
You're right, he's not.

550
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,255
- All right, Agent Callen.
- Appreciate it, Agent Hunt.

551
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,563
So, I spoke with the Special Agent
in charge,

552
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:49,390
and he spoke with the US Attorney.
And they said you could go home,

553
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:50,705
for now.

554
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,312
You have anywhere you can go?

555
00:37:57,197 --> 00:37:58,595
Can I call my mom?

556
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,569
626

557
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:07,667
555

558
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:09,290
01

559
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:10,687
10

560
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,040
At least I know
how to dial a cell phone.

561
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:18,628
At least I'm not going to jail.

562
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,414
At least I didn't accidentally join
a militia.

563
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:27,472
At least I...

564
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,599
finally woke up
and saved your behind.

565
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,398
At least you're on my side.

566
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:49,601
Hi, mom.

567
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,797
F-22s. Nice touch.

568
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:00,805
Whatever funding I procured today,

569
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:04,674
- we just blew on an air show.
- There goes my slush fund.

570
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,366
You knew.

571
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:13,123
- You knew that I would go to...
- I had a suspicion.

572
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,470
You...

573
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:19,522
You... You baited me.

574
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:23,652
You pulled me out of that hearing,
and you baited me

575
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,528
to going to the SecAF,
so you wouldn't have to.

576
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,782
I didn't think he'd do it for me.

577
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:30,619
And that way,

578
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,551
I could spend my political capital,

579
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:36,456
so that you wouldn't have
to spend yours, Leon.

580
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,470
Sullivan was a good agent.

581
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:50,397
He would have become a great one.

582
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:52,597
Like Callen.

583
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,380
I'd never lost
an agent before Sullivan.

584
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,981
But you saved two today.

585
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:04,109
You should feel good.

586
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:21,960
You know, that was really stupid.
Coming in to get me.

587
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,750
You're calling me stupid?

588
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,836
You wanted to "Butch Cassidy" me.
You wanted to run for it.

589
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,894
Yeah, wasn't my best idea.

590
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,970
You wanted
to "Custer's last stand" me.

591
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,069
You wanted to "Alamo" me.

592
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,704
You going to put
that in your little report,

593
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:40,542
color-coded tabs?

594
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,326
Tabs marked: dumbass idea.

595
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,318
Nice job,

596
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,231
Special Agent Hanna.

597
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,646
You said it.
You feel good?

598
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:01,046
Cheapens the work.

599
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,304
