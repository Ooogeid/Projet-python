1
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:09,581
<i>That's our program. Thanks for tuning
in to "Jazz" on Starry Night...</i>

2
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:13,331
<i>SIG Alert from earlier
this evening...</i>

3
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:03,062
.: Team UnderCovers :.

4
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,057
NCIS Los Angeles 1x13
- Missing -

5
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,023
- You can't sing both parts of a duet.
- Says who?

6
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:24,500
- Not in a competion.
- That sounds like second place talking.

7
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,840
Look, I was clearly
the better performer last night.

8
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:29,593
You can ask Kensi,
Hetty, Nate, Eric.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,950
Come on, man.
They saw it with their own ears.

10
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,637
A table of impartial observers
would beg to differ.

11
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:38,159
- Those women were seriously hammered.
- And you let them vote.

12
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:42,428
"To All the Girls I've Loved Before"
is a karaoke classic.

13
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:44,505
I just made it my own,

14
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,814
and my fans clearly
appreciated the effort.

15
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,610
You held your nose
during Willie Nelson's parts.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,986
That was very original.

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,532
"My Funny Valentine"?
What, are you kidding me?

18
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,658
No, I hear that's in heavy rotation
at the senior center.

19
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:01,078
It's a jazz standard.

20
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,664
Well, just be glad you're not Nate.

21
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,708
Julio, Willie.

22
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,085
Valentine.

23
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:10,838
- Is Hetty here yet?
- Nope.

24
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,089
Backstreet's back.

25
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,385
Is any coffee?

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,346
Nate, friends...

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,808
do not let friends sing boy bands.

28
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:24,936
Who has an extra pencil?

29
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,651
You sure you're not still drunk?

30
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,069
Maybe.

31
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,614
Anyone know how long this,
seminar thing is supposed to go?

32
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,659
Last year was six and a half hours
before the first bathroom break.

33
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,655
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:43,411
Has anyone seen Dom?

35
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,458
No, but that's one way to avoid
a hangover: don't show up for karaoke.

36
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,711
Don't show up for work. 30 seconds,
he's going to be rookie meat.

37
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,151
Your watch is slow, Mr. Callen.

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,695
The crowd goes wild!

39
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,699
"Wanted, Dead or Alive."

40
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:02,598
An inspired choice, Hetty.

41
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,885
Well, there's no magic quite

42
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,815
like the quixotic combination
of the Messrs. Cognac

43
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:11,529
and Bon Jovi.

44
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:17,697
But given our various states
of post-inebriation,

45
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,017
I will waste no time

46
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,074
in welcoming each
and almost every one of you

47
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:25,709
to our mandated annual

48
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,207
workplace safety evaluation.

49
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,514
Where is Mr. Vail?

50
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:34,090
I just called him,
and it went straight to voice mail.

51
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,424
- Didn't get the memo.
- Maybe...

52
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,272
we should postpone this,
until we're all here.

53
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,724
I'll prepare a makeup session
especially for Dom.

54
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:48,089
Have no fear,
it will consume his entire weekend.

55
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:49,999
Number two pencils.

56
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,231
The tools of ignorance.

57
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:55,023
Let's open our books to page one

58
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,360
and begin.

59
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,947
Sorry. Off.

60
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:03,743
"A safe work environment...

61
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,370
is not just a goal."

62
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,623
That's me. Sorry.

63
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:10,333
Phasers on stun.

64
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,461
Does the word "vibrate"
mean anything to you people?

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,471
If you're behind this, Mr. Beal...

66
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,512
What?

67
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,802
It wasn't me.
Pinky promise.

68
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,557
It's an Agent Needs
Assistance alert.

69
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,059
It's coming from Dom's phone.

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,227
Let's find him.

71
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,414
Broadcast for 15 seconds,
and then it stopped.

72
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,065
Maybe he pocket-dialed it.

73
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:41,267
There's almost no chance
that Dom's specific four-digit sequence

74
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,740
got entered accidentally.

75
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,671
And it would've had to happen twice.
The sender has to enter the same code

76
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:48,204
- to turn it off.
- Straight to voice mail, first ring.

77
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,082
So, the alert got turned off,
and so did his phone.

78
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,611
Turn it back on.

79
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:56,712
It's not responding.
Battery's either dead or was taken out.

80
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,172
What about a GPS lock?

81
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,520
Alert wasn't broadcast long enough.
I can't get a position.

82
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,630
Dom's home phone
is not answering, either.

83
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,012
What about the GPS in his car?

84
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:09,001
All right, I got it.
Just south of downtown.

85
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,685
An alley off 18th and Santa Fe.

86
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,035
What the heck
was Dom doing down here?

87
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,414
It's his usual shortcut.

88
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,831
He takes the alley
to avoid the long light at Santa Fe.

89
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,679
Oh, my God.

90
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:10,748
Hit me up, G.

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,176
Check for traffic cameras in the alley,
in this parking lot, anywhere nearby.

92
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:16,751
See if there was anyone tailing Dom.

93
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,377
Looking now.

94
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,839
This is just how we found it
about 45 minutes ago.

95
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,728
No body.

96
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,553
IPod, cash, house keys,
laptop still here.

97
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,848
- This wasn't a robbery.
- Did anybody see anything?

98
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:33,623
No witnesses at all.
That's not surprising, though.

99
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,819
This part of town's no-man's-land
till rush hour kicks in around 7:00.

100
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,482
A guy stopped at a light
on 18th called it in.

101
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,150
Bullet holes have
a raised edge from the outside.

102
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,944
Shots came from inside the car.

103
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:46,947
There's a lot of blood
and a lot of glass.

104
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,075
Okay, so Dom comes through here.

105
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,534
He stops for some reason.

106
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,870
Somebody sneaks up,
smashes the driver's window.

107
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,748
Second assailant smashes
the passenger-side window,

108
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,924
forces his way in,
throws it in park, they struggle.

109
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,789
Bang, bang, bang.

110
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,075
He's been here what, a few months?

111
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,049
What does he know about shortcuts?

112
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:09,386
There are traffic cams
at every intersection downtown.

113
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,305
Near your alley,
and in the parking lot,

114
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,473
no video at all.

115
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,476
Cameras everywhere
on Dom's route but this spot.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Was he taking this shortcut
to and from work?

117
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,189
- Car's pointed East.
- That means he was headed home.

118
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,399
Well, in that case,
this happened last night.

119
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,065
Why did we get an Agent
Needs Assistance call this morning?

120
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:27,967
He must've gotten his phone
this morning, even just for a second.

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,175
Something went wrong
when they took him.

122
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,980
Bad guys got sidetracked somehow.

123
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,829
Guys?

124
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,546
Onboard camera was activated.

125
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,292
Hard drive has
a bullet hole in it, though.

126
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,711
Techs might still be able
to pull some footage off it.

127
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:44,604
You know what?

128
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,716
No one bleeds this much
and survives.

129
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:54,622
Ty, could you look at this?

130
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:58,602
Poor little fella.

131
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,883
Who'd want to shoot you?

132
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:03,482
You talk to your computer parts?

133
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,249
Do you talk to your plants
when you water them?

134
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,595
Just my orchids,
but they can be tricky.

135
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:11,434
Hard drives are like people, okay?

136
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:14,349
Take one to the casing,
and it's like getting shot in the butt.

137
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,453
Hurts like hell,
but not going to kill you.

138
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:18,416
But take one to the platter, like...

139
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,316
it's like getting shot
through the heart.

140
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:23,428
Wait.

141
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,754
Is this from Dom's car?

142
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,194
He's supposed to bring in a cooling fan
from an old G-4 tower today.

143
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,492
We're building a PC together.
Rule is, spare parts only.

144
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,160
He's...

145
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:43,203
a pretty good geek.
You know, for an agent.

146
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,420
Just see what you can get off it.

147
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,658
As far as Dom's demeanor
is concerned,

148
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,828
I noticed nothing unusual
in the past few days.

149
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:58,787
What about his laptop?

150
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,581
From what we can tell, untouched.

151
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,842
That's not surprising.
Dom's a stickler for security.

152
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,339
- What about witnesses?
- There's no witnesses, Hetty.

153
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,092
Why did this happen?

154
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,886
I mean, why Dom?

155
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:15,930
Right now, we have no idea.

156
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,602
FBI, DEA and ICE...
they've all called to offer their help.

157
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:22,981
Work them.

158
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:26,476
Cross-reference threats
to their agents.

159
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,970
See if there have been
any similar abductions.

160
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:33,625
Do whatever you have
to do to find him,

161
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,521
by whatever means necessary.

162
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,197
You ever been here before?

163
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,537
Me, neither.

164
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:55,767
It's not unusual to wait
a considerable period of time

165
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,639
before visiting
the residence of a colleague, okay?

166
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,192
Dom went straight
from college at MIT

167
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:13,104
to NCIS training at FLET-C to us.

168
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,239
Guy in a hurry
to get his life started.

169
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:24,135
You know, he told me
he was so excited to come to L.A.

170
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:26,924
that he didn't even stop at his folks'
place to pick up his stuff.

171
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,788
We really never got to know him.

172
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,719
Don't go there.

173
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,718
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean like that.

174
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,060
So, who calls to tell them
that he's missing?

175
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:47,277
Maybe the Director, maybe Hetty.

176
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,358
I never had to make
one of those calls before.

177
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,120
He didn't come home last night.

178
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:05,122
Why two monitors?

179
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,375
Internet, game console.

180
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,741
Dom tapped into the parking
garage security system.

181
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,152
Building's got cameras.

182
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,554
All his e-mails ran
through the secure server at NCIS.

183
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,069
There's nothing suspicious here.

184
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,438
No indication that he thought
anyone was targeting him.

185
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,566
What about his personal stuff? Open up
his browser, go through his history.

186
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:34,401
You want to do this?

187
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:42,434
It's gadget blogs, news sites,
tech reviews.

188
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:46,092
- And he doesn't even clear his cache.
- We don't all need private browsing.

189
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,293
He hasn't been around long enough
to make enemies, Sam.

190
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,755
So, what are you saying?

191
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,755
- It was random?
- Maybe.

192
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,216
I mean, bad things
happen in this town.

193
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,218
Wrong place, wrong time? Come on, G.

194
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,318
He's a kid.

195
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,183
Driving down an alley
in a bad part of town.

196
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,980
- It's as good as anything else we got.
- Which is a lot of nothing.

197
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,518
You know as well as I do,

198
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,894
no one gets snatched up for nothing.

199
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:12,648
We got something.

200
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,153
So, we've got three cameras
in the parking garage,

201
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,347
all Internet enabled.

202
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,740
Four digit password,
eminently hackable.

203
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,314
For how far can you go back?

204
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:27,145
The DVR, they are connected to records
continuously for five days,

205
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:28,205
and then resets.

206
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,690
So, we've got one,
two, three angles,

207
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:33,443
and here's Dom's car
coming and going lots of times.

208
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,088
When's this from?

209
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,548
Last week.

210
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,195
And that one?

211
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,164
Yesterday. Why?

212
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,179
Put 'em both on screen for me,
side by side.

213
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,137
New camera.

214
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,748
And it's mounted right
above Dom's parking spot.

215
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:59,093
Where's the footage
from that camera?

216
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:03,073
There isn't. It's not connected
to the building's system.

217
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,034
But if that camera's new camera,
should have footage of who put it up.

218
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,918
- That's not Dom.
- It's from two days ago.

219
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,860
His shoulders are hunched, tense.

220
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:21,008
His body language definitely suggests
he's conscious of being watched.

221
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:25,178
The installer knew other cameras were
there. His face is hidden intentionally.

222
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,098
Why not disable the cameras
if you're worried about being seen?

223
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,477
You shut down 3 video feedssomeone from
the office is gonna come down and check.

224
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,306
Okay, see that antenna?
The new camera's wireless.

225
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,983
It's designed to be monitored
from a laptop nearby.

226
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,695
All right, the image isn't clear,

227
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,627
but is this photo grab good enough
to run through facial recognition?

228
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,569
- Doubt it.
- Do it anyway.

229
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:51,663
You and me set up on a target
to run surveillance, how long?

230
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,584
I don't know. Two, three weeks to chart
a guy's habits, patterns.

231
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,752
Minimum.

232
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,046
Dom gets snatched up two days
after that camera gets installed?

233
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,733
All right, so it all came
together quickly. What is your point?

234
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,485
Pros are deliberate.

235
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,145
Whoever did this
was obviously professional.

236
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,281
Why would they break
operational security?

237
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,855
Maybe they paid a premium
to get this done quickly.

238
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Why Dom?

239
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:33,318
He's a rookie.

240
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,708
He's never been with any agency
other than NCIS.

241
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,337
You said it for yourself. He wasn't
on the job long enough to make enemies.

242
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:44,016
Maybe it's not about Dom.

243
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,177
Maybe it's about us.

244
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,010
We've got enemies.

245
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:52,891
Lots of 'em.

246
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,849
So maybe somebody wants
to send us a message.

247
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,355
Dom's the easiest one to grab.

248
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,498
I told him.

249
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,443
Change your routes, vary
your timetables, stay alert for tails.

250
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,669
What were you gonna do? You're gonna
pick him up in the morning

251
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,508
- drop him off at the end of the night?
- He was the new agent.

252
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,600
We were supposed to watch out for him,
G.

253
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,870
Dom's phone just came back on.

254
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,458
Audio and video from Dom's phone.

255
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,475
Waiting on the GPS lock.

256
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,263
- What is that?
- Looks like a hand.

257
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,183
Come on, Eric. Where is he?

258
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,509
Triangulating.

259
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,112
It's north. Maybe in the Valley?

260
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,108
No, still north.

261
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:45,443
Santa Clarita?

262
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:51,074
- Private residence, Valencia.
- Tell Kensi to meet us in the car.

263
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:23,482
Clear.

264
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:26,058
- Clear.
- Clear.

265
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,887
Clear.

266
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,639
Clear.

267
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:05,804
Clear.

268
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:08,110
No Dom.

269
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,662
We're too late.

270
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,015
It's like a makeshift hospital here.

271
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:40,536
I hate hospitals.

272
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:42,039
No I.D.

273
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,729
Shocking.

274
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:48,358
Whoever put this in
hit the vein on the first try.

275
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,986
It was a pro.
A doctor, a nurse.

276
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,148
Yeah, whoever it was they tried
pretty damn hard to save him.

277
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,490
Not hard enough.

278
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,506
This is Dom's phone.

279
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,339
Why leave the phone behind?

280
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:00,593
Why not?

281
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,248
Took the battery out
so we couldn't track it.

282
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,635
Okay, so...

283
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:06,793
this guy comes to,

284
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,297
sees the phone,
drags himself across the carpet.

285
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,831
Make one last call.

286
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:17,721
Incomplete.

287
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:20,599
Yeah.

288
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,393
But he activated the GPS for us.

289
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,559
- This IV's got a serial number on it.
- Here.

290
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:38,575
Eric, it's coming to you.
Run it through facial recognition.

291
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:41,912
Every available database.

292
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:50,491
These guys try to take Dom,
he fights back, one of them gets shot.

293
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:53,981
Buddies brought him out here to fix
him up, but he lost too much blood.

294
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,660
IV, bandages, morphine.
Leaving the phone behind.

295
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,332
They didn't leave him here to die.

296
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:02,781
Wait.

297
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,438
If Dom wounded him
before being abducted,

298
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:09,356
it could mean that the blood
we found in the car wasn't Dom's.

299
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,817
I like the sound of that.

300
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,302
Let's get it tested.

301
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:14,802
Keep hope alive.

302
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,829
Yeah.

303
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:27,612
News, Eric?

304
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,081
Bad and good. No luck on facial
recognition for Mr. Valencia,

305
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:34,589
and Ty couldn't pull any video off
the hard drive from Dom's car.

306
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,299
Too much damage to the platter.

307
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,879
That's bad and bad.

308
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,053
Well, there's no video, but...

309
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,227
I managed to salvage the audio.

310
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:43,573
Here goes.

311
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:47,018
- <i>Agarra el brazo.
</i>- It's in Spanish.

312
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,870
Grab his arm. Grab his arm.

313
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,405
<i>Se est suelto.</i>

314
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,190
Help. He's getting loose.

315
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:55,777
I can't hold him.

316
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,802
My gun.

317
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,446
<i>Rafael, espera.</i>

318
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,532
Rafael, wait. I'm coming in.

319
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:09,332
That's it.

320
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,530
I should have called him
and made him come with us.

321
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,865
But, you know,
he never wanted to drive with me.

322
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,164
Said I took to long to get ready.

323
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,374
You listen.

324
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:56,030
Guilt is the strongest emotion,

325
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,505
the most powerful

326
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,159
emotion we exhibit.

327
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:02,757
It's so easy to feel and it's

328
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,346
impossible to dismiss.

329
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,045
It's also a strong motivator,

330
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:08,288
but

331
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:11,124
it tends to cloud our judgment.

332
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,358
I'm talking from experience.

333
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,570
Agent Sullivan?

334
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:28,115
Oh, God, I don't know how many days

335
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:30,892
I second-guessed myself
after we lost him.

336
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,671
Remember that you are
a strong woman.

337
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,090
Sometimes it just gets to be

338
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,663
too much, you know?

339
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,856
Yeah. Sometimes.

340
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,750
But don't think

341
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,449
for a minute

342
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,840
that they can do it without us.

343
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,712
It's time

344
00:22:02,602 --> 00:22:04,044
to follow this through.

345
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,007
Guys, we got a hit.

346
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,338
We got a match
on the dead Latino dude.

347
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:21,911
Frederico Gomez,

348
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,299
Colombian national.

349
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:24,926
Here come his vitals.

350
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:27,232
Crap, they're all in Spanish.

351
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,224
Wanted on multiple charges:

352
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:30,795
kidnapping for hire,

353
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:32,267
prueba de vida,

354
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,020
proof of life abduction,
from Bogota to Medellin.

355
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,106
Cross-reference for any known
associates named "Rafael".

356
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,525
The name screamed in Dom's car.

357
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,236
Rafael Taro.

358
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:44,863
Has a brother, Jose.

359
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,741
Let me guess...
the Taro brothers make a power trio.

360
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:48,867
Big time.

361
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:51,538
Looks like the Taro brothers
and Frederico were involved

362
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,733
in a number of abductions
in South America,

363
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,541
mostly businessmen
snatched for ransom.

364
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,501
That says"hermana".
They have a sister.

365
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,753
Yep.

366
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,543
Emigrated to the U.S.
seven years ago.

367
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,592
She's a nurse at Valencia Hospital.

368
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:09,121
Closest hospital to where you found
Frederico Gomez' body.

369
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,346
I hate hospitals.

370
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,254
Serial numbers from the IV bag
trace back to a shipment

371
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,904
made to Valencia Hospital.

372
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:17,215
I hacked into the hospital
personnel database.

373
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:18,788
The firewall might well be made

374
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,696
of Swiss cheese
from the hospital cafeteria.

375
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,400
Please tell me Claudia lives nearby.

376
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:25,360
Better. She's a critical care nurse.
Works today.

377
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,974
Let's go.

378
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:38,416
She doesn't show up for her shift.
Where the hell is she?

379
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,060
Maybe she never left home.

380
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,163
Eric will have the address.
I'll call him.

381
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:46,424
Claudia Taro?

382
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,516
You running, that means you have
something to hide. That right?

383
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:07,695
Where's our friend?

384
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:08,967
I don't know!

385
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,740
I want a lawyer.

386
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,992
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a magician.

387
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,008
It's the only chance you have
of making your fingerprints disappear

388
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,997
from the vials of morphine
we found at the scene.

389
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,721
Frederico was hurt bad. He...

390
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,373
needed to go to the hospital.

391
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:25,046
But your brothers
wouldn't allow that?

392
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:28,109
I knew he wasn't going to make it.

393
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:30,564
But I thought if I just

394
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:32,804
helped them this-this one time...

395
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,558
Oh, maybe that'd be it?
That you'd never have to see them again.

396
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:39,651
I never had anything to do
with their business.

397
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,397
I came to L.A. to get away

398
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,386
from them, but they don't care.

399
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm still their little sister.
They-they want me back home.

400
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,237
What did they say?

401
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,497
Nothing.

402
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,408
Only about a package

403
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,705
they had to deliver.

404
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,203
That package is an NCIS agent.

405
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,665
A package that has a family and a name,
Claudia.

406
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,043
Who, unlike your brothers, has
something to contribute to this world!

407
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,226
- You okay?
- Fine.

408
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:14,762
You saw him,

409
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:17,432
didn't you?

410
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:19,070
Claudia?

411
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,271
What did they do with our friend?

412
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:28,421
You had a choice what to become
when you came here,

413
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:29,986
and you became a nurse.

414
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:33,656
I'm guessing that's
'cause you wanted to help people.

415
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,716
You wanted to make up for things.
Things that your brothers

416
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,427
did that you had nothing to do with.

417
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,042
Our friend helps people, too.

418
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:46,997
People like you...

419
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,002
and those that you take care of.

420
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,467
To keep them safe
from people like your brothers.

421
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,145
They brought him in with Frederico.

422
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:05,980
He'd been shot,

423
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,440
but it was a minor

424
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:08,702
flesh wound.

425
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:11,350
I patched him up.

426
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,490
When they left,
they took him with them.

427
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,201
That's all I know.

428
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,286
How did they contact you?

429
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:23,495
On my cell.

430
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,291
What time?

431
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,405
Around 10:00 p.m.

432
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:38,638
Eric!

433
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,723
- Give me the love.
<i>- Okay.</i>

434
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:41,975
213-

435
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:43,295
555-

436
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:45,463
- 7862.
- <i>Running it now.</i>

437
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:51,041
Oh, so not feeling the love.
It's a burn phone.

438
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,069
No GPS. The best I can do is get you

439
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,639
<i>the nearest cell site.</i>

440
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,831
<i>The call came from the Alameda Corridor.
Near the L.A. River.</i>

441
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:09,085
That's a lot of ground to cover.

442
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,421
Too much ground.

443
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,784
If I'd only ridden him harder.

444
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:44,620
If you'd ridden him harder,
he may have washed out.

445
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:46,806
Either way,
this wouldn't have happened.

446
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,089
Maybe. Maybe not.

447
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,169
I don't know how you keep
a lid on your feelings.

448
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:54,505
I just focus on the case.

449
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,425
It's not natural, G.

450
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,146
Neither is that.

451
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,443
Why you choose to live in this area
is yet another Callen mystery.

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,645
The atmosphere stimulates my brain.

453
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:12,486
Mine's about to explode.

454
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,028
So, LAPD sent the description of Dom
and the Taros to all their units.

455
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,538
- Nothing yet.
- Well, with all...

456
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:22,718
the gangs they're dealing with,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

457
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:26,211
Informants won't be of any use.
Taros came up for this job special.

458
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:29,623
They don't have any criminal connections
locally. Not on the street level.

459
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:33,338
Even if we find where they keep him,
chances are we have to shoot our way in.

460
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:36,359
You know the odds of a hostage surviving
in a raid like that?

461
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:40,927
- Let's call them.
- And say what?

462
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:44,357
Please tell us where you are
and give us our friend back alive?

463
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,669
Something like that.

464
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:51,062
A swap.

465
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:54,983
Family ties are strong.

466
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:56,943
They might just take the risk.

467
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,737
Just got to get Claudia on board.

468
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:08,996
You're asking me
to betray my family.

469
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,165
We're asking you to do a good thing.

470
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:14,384
We're asking you
to help us save our friend.

471
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:22,974
If someone was at your hospital,

472
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,306
someone hurt really bad,

473
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,224
who witnessed a crime committed
by your brothers,

474
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:30,601
would you help them?

475
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:33,813
Or would you let them die
to save your brothers from jail?

476
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:39,822
Please.

477
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,706
Frederico's dead.

478
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,181
Your sister is alive... for now.

479
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,284
- Who is this?
- Doesn't matter.

480
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,499
- What do you want?
- A trade.

481
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,947
Let me talk to her.

482
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,757
Here's the deal, Raffie.

483
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:03,535
You want to see your sister
back home, safe and sound,

484
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,502
you meet me in two hours
<i>at the intersection...</i>

485
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:08,533
We do this my way
or we don't do this at all.

486
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,621
I'm waiting, Raffie.

487
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:13,554
<i>There's</i> an abandoned hospital

488
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:15,664
on Soto, south of Ninth.

489
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:18,403
There's a boiler room
in the southeast corner.

490
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,344
Be there <i>in one hour!</i>

491
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:28,553
Thank you.

492
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:37,478
Thank you.

493
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:54,480
It was a community hospital
that shut down five years ago,

494
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:57,123
vacant ever since.
The boiler room is in the basement.

495
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,253
It's 50 feet across,
ceiling's 25 high.

496
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:01,495
Accessibility?

497
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,685
One door on the ground floor,
which is where you will enter.

498
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:08,029
There's a staircase that leads you
to the boiler room floor below.

499
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,303
To the north, there's a hallway
that leads to the basement.

500
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,718
Now, the building is six stories high
and three stories below ground.

501
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:18,394
- A warren of corridors and rooms.
- Lots of places to hide.

502
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,813
- Lots.
- Visibility?

503
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,008
DWP readings indicate
minimal activity.

504
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,985
My guess would be
a few low wattage maintenance fixtures.

505
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,029
- Windows?
- A series on the east side.

506
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,727
There might be just enough illumination
from the moonlight

507
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,777
to make out figures,
but not much else.

508
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:37,663
Their turf. Their staging. Their
lighting. And a little over 30 minutes.

509
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,925
- Not good.
- Very not good.

510
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,627
What we need is a satellite.

511
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:46,797
With high-resolution
optical stabilizers and infrared.

512
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:48,715
I'll make a phone call.

513
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,926
Is there anything else?

514
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:52,845
Luck.

515
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,016
- A little luck.
- I'll see what I can do.

516
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:59,507
Kensi, we're going to need Claudia.

517
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,242
In position, Eric.
Which way in?

518
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:19,663
Satellite's online. I have one heat
signature inside the boiler room.

519
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:21,019
Only one?

520
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,666
It's a huge complex.

521
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,311
<i>Three subterranean layers,
lots of concrete,</i>

522
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,170
<i>protective shields in X-ray rooms.</i>
Dom could be anywhere.

523
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,299
And so could the other Taro brother.

524
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,013
I'm going in.

525
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:51,048
Raffie?

526
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:53,204
I'm here.

527
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,716
Come down.

528
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,227
Steps.

529
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,870
Where's my friend?

530
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,705
<i>Some place safe.</i>

531
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:03,173
Keep coming.

532
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:05,334
Where are you?

533
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,544
Move to the far end of the room.

534
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:09,814
Stop.

535
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:15,519
I delivered my part.

536
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,027
- Where's my friend?
- Some place safe.

537
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:22,309
Let her go, or he's not going
to be safe much longer.

538
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,389
Sam, I have another heat signature
<i>west of the boiler room.</i>

539
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,178
<i>It's weak.
Possibly hostile, probably subterranean.</i>

540
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,200
- Okay. Which way in?
- The courtyard.

541
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:34,680
There's... a bathroom window.
It's <i>the fifth window in.</i>

542
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,373
- He's not going to get to Jose in time.
- He'll make it.

543
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:55,426
Come on.

544
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,816
<i>Sam</i>, he just turned east.

545
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:01,567
There's no way east.
There's only a stairway down.

546
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,560
<i>Heat signatures don't show elevation.</i>
He could've gone down to go east.

547
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:05,478
<i>Take it!</i>

548
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:15,696
- Eric, where is he?
- He should be there, ten feet away.

549
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,197
I've got nothing.

550
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,367
He must be on a different level.
He's headed for the boiler room.

551
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,685
Take the hallway to your right.
Go fast!

552
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:26,931
He's on the move, Sam, headed north.

553
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,710
You're not getting anything
till I see my buddy.

554
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:34,215
Why is that heat signature
stronger than the other?

555
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,901
It's not stronger by much, but...

556
00:35:35,943 --> 00:35:38,703
it could be closer to the satellite,
<i>which means that he could be...</i>

557
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:40,421
<i>Sam, he's right above Callen.</i>

558
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,807
Put the gun down.

559
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:47,262
<i>Put it down!</i>

560
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,860
Go! Go!

561
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:55,986
Take off the hood.

562
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,899
<i>Buy me a little time, G.</i>

563
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,897
I didn't think
you'd be bringing Claudia.

564
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:09,291
What are you, FBI?

565
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:10,659
You LAPD?

566
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:15,798
I just want to know
what name to put on the tombstone.

567
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,802
Diversion in three, two, one.

568
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:43,703
Cover me.

569
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:09,976
Where is he, Raffie?

570
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,125
Where is he?

571
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:14,898
I want a deal.

572
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:19,194
What do you want, Raffie?

573
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:20,474
Nothing for me.

574
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:22,898
For Claudia.

575
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:29,982
You don't take her in.

576
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:34,822
You don't put nothing on her record.

577
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,048
You never even met her.

578
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,061
You have my word.

579
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:44,970
She walks.

580
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:47,197
Your friend

581
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:49,850
is in San Bernardino.

582
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,055
Hook Creek Road.

583
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,797
There's a blue van.

584
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,150
We took the money.

585
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,196
We left him inside.

586
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:05,115
Why did they want him?

587
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:07,613
I don't know.

588
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:11,496
I never saw them.

589
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,671
I never met them.

590
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:54,873
Go.

591
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,828
At the end of the day, we all deal

592
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,911
with things in our own way,
don't we?

593
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:25,313
Good night, Mr. Callen.

594
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:20,145
