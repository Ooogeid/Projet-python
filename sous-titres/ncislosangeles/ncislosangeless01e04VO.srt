1
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:43,021
Bolt the cap.

2
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,064
Takes the exit!

3
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,052
Hey! What are you doing?

4
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,433
.: Team UnderCovers:.

5
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,451
NCIS Los Angeles
1x04 [Search and Destroy ]

6
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:25,782
Karen... Yes, I love you.

7
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,204
It's the one I've been waiting for.

8
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,011
Does Karen have a last name?

9
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,204
I can't remember.

10
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,131
You can't remember?

11
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,218
God bless her
she has just put me over the top.

12
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,595
I now have 1,000 Facebook friends.

13
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,415
Worked so hard for this.

14
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,621
Friending everyone
I've gone to school with,

15
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,247
worked with, dated or met.

16
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,811
The toughest part for me was

17
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,411
trolling through the hundreds
and hundreds of random members

18
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,107
for anyone willing
to accept my invite.

19
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,044
You know how many criminals
cruise the Internet

20
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,601
picking through your chat logs
looking for intelligence information?

21
00:03:57,856 --> 00:03:59,447
You're not on Facebook, are you?

22
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,781
MySpace?

23
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,966
Linkedin?

24
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:02,825
Twitter?

25
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,811
- Friendster?
- Friendster...

26
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,371
- I'm an undercover agent.
- I love Friendster.

27
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,674
- It's not normal.
- You're telling me what's normal?

28
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,354
I've never even seen you wear pants.

29
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:13,533
I meant Dom.

30
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,273
Friendster's only popular
in Southeast Asia now.

31
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,269
Three of the coolest people
I've ever met are from Myanmar.

32
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,748
And normal's relative.

33
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,477
More often than not, online
social networking communities

34
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,071
are a pathetic attempt
to fulfill the needs of the...

35
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:28,100
inter socially challenged.

36
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,746
You know, people fearful
of face-to-face risk taking.

37
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,898
Just a... theory.

38
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:37,860
What is this, Mr. Callen?

39
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,657
That is a knit... combed cotton.

40
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,408
With a bloodstain.

41
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,433
I would never bleed on your wardrobe,
had to be a bad guy.

42
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,228
Good, bad or ugly, I don't care.

43
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,570
The point is, you neglected
to tell me about it,

44
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:56,695
and now it's set long enough
so that it might be permanent.

45
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,563
It's just a shirt.

46
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,344
This is not just a shirt.

47
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,577
This is a Saville Row 100%

48
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,915
polished Egyptian cotton,

49
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,819
hand-stitched with pearl buttons.

50
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:14,344
That thing you're wearing
is just a shirt.

51
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,274
But it's a comfy shirt.

52
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:22,090
Your new color scheme is black.

53
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,925
I can live with black.

54
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:33,833
Late night?

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,842
Agent Blye has been on assignment.

56
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,177
How did it go, dearie?

57
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:48,356
It went... very well.

58
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,152
We gathered very important intel.

59
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,595
That's wonderful.

60
00:05:53,162 --> 00:05:55,225
You can return
your outfit to the wardrobe.

61
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,308
Your clothes are waiting
in your locker.

62
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,002
Nice try, Hetty.

63
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,738
Director Vance is
on the system in five. Move!

64
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,564
Hey, Eric?

65
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,046
Why don't you make Hetty
one of your Facebook friends?

66
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,347
She's friend number 251,
she writes me every day.

67
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,813
In Greek.

68
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:22,302
<i>The man you're looking at
is a former marine.</i>

69
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,158
<i>Walton Monroe Flynn.</i>

70
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,263
<i>He's currently working
for Citdential Security,</i>

71
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,857
<i>one of the largest
private security firms</i>

72
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,724
<i>contracted
by the US government in Iraq.</i>

73
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,250
<i>Ten days ago, Flynn killed
an Iraqi business man</i>

74
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,063
<i>that he was supposed
to be protecting.</i>

75
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,839
<i>He went into hiding. Citdential found
out that he was on his way to L.A.</i>

76
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:43,487
<i>Tried to take him
at the airport this morning.</i>

77
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:46,864
<i>They made a mess of it.
One of their men ended up dead.</i>

78
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,993
- Cowboys.
- <i>That's why the DOD wants us involved.</i>

79
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,388
<i>We can't have
private security contractors</i>

80
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,863
<i>operating like a police
force on home ground.</i>

81
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:59,284
<i>It's a political hot potato,
so do not drop it.</i>

82
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,003
We'll find him.

83
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,942
<i>You can start with Citdential's CEO.</i>

84
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:05,764
<i>His name is Peter Caldwell.</i>

85
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,979
- <i>Congratulations on the milestone.</i>
- Thank you.

86
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:20,233
Facebook. He's friend number 500.

87
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,479
Just kind of honor.

88
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,347
After I became CEO, I personally
recruited Flynn from the Marine corps.

89
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:35,767
He was not only an operator
but an Arabic speaker, we need them.

90
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:40,623
Three months ago, he started
exhibiting behavioral problems.

91
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,460
What sort of behavioral problems?

92
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,043
He was trigger happy,
started drinking heavily.

93
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,590
You left him on the line?

94
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:49,426
- An oversight.
- Understatement.

95
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,138
So, what happened
in Baghdad, Mr. Caldwell?

96
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:56,515
Flynn was part of a security detail
protecting an Iraqi businessman.

97
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,806
Nasir Amini was a key player
in the country's stability,

98
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,929
especially with the start
of the US troop withdrawal.

99
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,742
Flynn snapped, took Amini out.

100
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,282
He got away before
we could stop him.

101
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,734
Flew out of the Middle-East
via Istanbul.

102
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,975
We got a report
he was headed for L.A.

103
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,248
We tried to apprehend him
this morning.

104
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,307
- That didn't go so well.
- Aimes was a good friend.

105
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,713
- Flynn didn't need to kill him.
- Flynn was one of our best.

106
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,048
He's trained to kill quickly
and efficiently.

107
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:32,116
He's even more dangerous
now that he's mentally unstable.

108
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,219
We'd like to help you find him.

109
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,648
I think you guys have done enough.

110
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,370
Let us take it from here.

111
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:45,790
This is the security cam
footage from LAX.

112
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,423
- Looks stressed.
- Travel can do that,

113
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:51,560
particularly if you're
on the run for murder.

114
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,971
- Background?
- Broken home.

115
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:57,618
Dad busted in a drug conspiracy
when Flynn turned seven.

116
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,750
Mom was a drunk.

117
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,362
- That's a great start.
- Well, it gets better.

118
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,248
String of foster homes,
a few trips to Juvi.

119
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,662
He signed up for the Marines
the day he turned 18.

120
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,548
The military gave him the family

121
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,899
and structure that he had never had.

122
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,055
The only other choice
would've been a gang.

123
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,191
Why'd he pick one over the other?

124
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,401
It was a chance
to get away from it all.

125
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,938
Gangs give you structure,
but they keep you in the same place.

126
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,584
Military's all about starting over.

127
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:30,152
Unless... you start
to repeat your behavior.

128
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,437
Flynn's military record shows
commendations for bravery,

129
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:36,396
but there's also a handful
of side trips to the brig.

130
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,544
Run the video, Eric.

131
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:45,686
Flynn bolted from the terminal
with two citdential agents on his tail.

132
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,465
Outside the terminal, they chased him
across three lanes of traffic,

133
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:55,750
where a third citdential picked him up
as he ran into a parking garage.

134
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,958
Flynn evaded the agents
in a stolen car.

135
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,826
Chase wound up on the roof.

136
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,897
When the agent started firing,
Flynn mowed him down with the car

137
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,071
and took off on foot.

138
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,340
- Brutal.
- Any other insights, Nate?

139
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:13,714
Nada.

140
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,663
The question is, where did he go?

141
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:22,462
The logical answer would be, as far away
from the airport as possible.

142
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:26,083
Spock said, "logic is the beginning
of wisdom, not the end."

143
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,211
Double back.

144
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,796
Fast-forward, Eric.

145
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,715
There's our guy.
He went back to the terminal.

146
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,889
He was waiting
for someone to pick him up.

147
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,114
Gotta love <i>Star Trek</i>.

148
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,281
Double espresso is speaking to me.

149
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:01,334
Been hearing voices
from caffeinated beverages long?

150
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,349
Only since brownies started
giving me the silent treatment.

151
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,408
Couple things you guys
should know about.

152
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,047
Citdential sent over Flynn's psych
profile. It's juicy stuff.

153
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,663
- Baited breath. What else you got?
- Hetty's in the kitchen.

154
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,426
All indicators point
towards a psychotic break.

155
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,504
My guess is undiagnosed PTSD,

156
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,540
- complicated by his upbringing.
- What about his upbringing?

157
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,188
Possible abuse in foster homes.

158
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,621
Didn't know who his parents
were or where he came from.

159
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,727
A childhood that can cause
major psychological...

160
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,785
I get it.

161
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,856
Something I don't get is...

162
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,019
he might have had
a breakdown in Iraq, but...

163
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:40,491
he certainly was lucid
about his trip to L.A.

164
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:43,274
He could've got off plane
on the East Coast, but instead,

165
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,625
he flew straight here.
He's in L.A. for a reason.

166
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,876
Rag-top jeep. Surf racks on the roof.
Bumper stickers on the rear.

167
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,938
Rear license plate
is blocked by the spare tire.

168
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,380
No plate on the front.

169
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,347
What kind of bumper stickers?

170
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:00,043
"I had a handle on life
but it broke."

171
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:04,330
"Don't steal, the government hates
competition", and my favorite:

172
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,975
"Be sincere, whether
you mean it or not."

173
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:10,151
- Speaking of the driver...
- No facial,

174
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,022
tats on the left arm, male.

175
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:13,303
Or female.

176
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:14,557
- Man.
- Woman.

177
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,002
More on the tats.

178
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:22,866
Tabori style.

179
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:27,538
It's a traditional form of tattooing.
They use needles instead of a gun.

180
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,353
Only a couple of places
do that kind of work.

181
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,031
Orange suggests impulsiveness.

182
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:36,152
The... surf racks,
an adventurous nature.

183
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:39,800
The jeep is youth.
Or the pursuit of youth.

184
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,846
Bumper stickers... A sense of humor,
maybe contempt for authority.

185
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,216
- The tats?
- Well, I can go one of two ways.

186
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:50,455
To an older generation, they're a sign
of rebellion, and to someone younger,

187
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,230
because they're so ubiquitous,
it might mean conformity.

188
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,557
So, basically, you don't have squat.

189
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,088
I'd say it's more
of a broad spectrum of possibilities.

190
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,143
- That's what they call squat.
- There's something else.

191
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:07,918
A link to L.A.
A really, really good link to L.A.

192
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:11,943
Flynn's former foster brother
owns a gun shop in the valley.

193
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:16,097
Thanksgiving must be a hoot.

194
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,122
You looking for someone?

195
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,514
One of my pit stops as a kid
was a couple blocks from here.

196
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,659
Wonder if I'm passing
anyone I used to know.

197
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:43,456
Not that it matters now.

198
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,564
If it didn't matter,
why brought it up, G?

199
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,504
Be there in a second.

200
00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,975
What was your first like?

201
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:01,757
We're talking tats?

202
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,374
We're talking tats.

203
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,137
San Diego, I was 16, nervous as hell.
Didn't really know what to expect.

204
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,681
Afterwards, it just kind
of felt like a man, you know.

205
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,934
I don't know how else to explain it.

206
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,936
We're talking tats?

207
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:15,673
Yeah.

208
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,317
What can I do for you?

209
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,029
This your work?

210
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,991
Did it about two years ago.
Chick named Cherry.

211
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,958
Does Cherry have a last name?

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,870
World's full of people
with no last name.

213
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,852
Sting, Prince... Bruno.

214
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,628
Cops?

215
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,482
- Would it make a difference?
- I don't have time for this, okay?

216
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:45,915
She paid in cash.
That's all I know.

217
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,132
If you don't mind,
I have a customer waiting.

218
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:56,311
- Can't be many places left.
- Nowhere you're ever gonna see.

219
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:04,301
Why would Chad Ellis' gun
store be closed on a weekday?

220
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,623
Better question is...

221
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,889
why is the door unlocked
if the store's closed?

222
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,576
Careful, Dom.

223
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,166
Lucky escape for the cat.

224
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,975
For Chad, not so much.

225
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,905
I cross-checked the name "Cherry"
with orange jeeps, through DMV,

226
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,507
and I got a hit on a Cherise Dawson.

227
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,960
From there it was cake.

228
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:00,829
Opened her electronic
belly up like a pop-up book.

229
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:04,854
Work and home addresses.
Phone numbers and logs.

230
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,605
E-mail address entry
and we are just getting warmed up.

231
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,926
Guess where she went to high school.

232
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,693
Ridgewell High
in Springfield, Missouri.

233
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:13,847
Who else went there?

234
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,306
- Feeling the love?
- Right.

235
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,644
Walton Monroe Flynn.
And... You ready for this?

236
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,864
- She's one of your Facebook friends.
- Not mine.

237
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:26,076
Walton Monroe Flynn's.
A few months ago, he "friended her".

238
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,731
Now, for you older guys,
that's the...

239
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,250
lingo for when someone
asks you into their friends list.

240
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:35,702
What's the lingo for when someone
smacks you with a flip-flop?

241
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:41,745
So, for a couple weeks,
he played the "catch up" game...

242
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,565
You know, nothing revealing...

243
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:47,197
- And then, it stopped.
- Well, that's not unusual.

244
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,635
After the first blush
of curiosity wanes,

245
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:52,010
the realization sets in most
of these old acquaintances

246
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,919
have nothing in common any more,
and communication ends.

247
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:58,345
Ah, but here is the fly
in the psychological ointment.

248
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,754
A week ago,
Flynn contacted her again.

249
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:05,440
Said he was coming to L.A.,
wanted to re-connect in person.

250
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,092
Put Flynn and Cherise up
side by side.

251
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,370
- What are you thinking, G?
- She looks innocent.

252
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,123
No, he's using her.

253
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,377
Might be for money, it might for
a place to crash, but he's using her.

254
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,488
You could be right.

255
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:30,465
Something's bothering me
about the gun shop murder.

256
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:34,594
Coroner said
that Chad Ellis was beaten to death.

257
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,223
There were two pistols missing
from the inventory.

258
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,475
If this is what Flynn wanted,
why not just take them? Why torture him?

259
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:44,406
He was an interrogator in Iraq.
He could've gotten a taste for it.

260
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,110
Maybe.

261
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,854
We should keep a quiet read
on our two leads, see what shakes up.

262
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,988
Would you like
her house or her work?

263
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,544
Now, you're sure about
this census taker thing?

264
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,476
No, not just census takers, Sam.

265
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,998
Census takers for a community action
organization for social justice.

266
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,160
Look, Cherise is a tattooed
Venice hippie chick.

267
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,594
She'll practically invite us
to move in.

268
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:24,578
Not home.

269
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,640
Or she is, hiding up like Chad.

270
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,222
- Clear.
- Clear.

271
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:05,941
Ginseng iced tea...

272
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,105
Soy milk... veggie burgers...

273
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,961
... half a cheese steak sandwich.

274
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,595
Left us a present.

275
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,161
- Cherise?
- Yeah?

276
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,687
Oh, my god, is that you?

277
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:52,106
Regina Sanders? Ridgewell High?

278
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,443
Come on, I haven't changed
that much, have I?

279
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:59,906
All right, I do have to confess,
I have had a little work done,

280
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:01,467
but I'm still me.

281
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,695
A little more in some places,
a less in others,

282
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,147
depending on what body part
we're talking about.

283
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:12,085
- You don't remember me, do you?
- I'm sorry.

284
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,091
No, it's fine. It was
a huge high school

285
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,214
and I wasn't exactly
"miss popularity".

286
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,050
- I have to go to work...
- This is so cool we met like this!

287
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,269
I have so been thinking
about senior year recently.

288
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:24,361
Ever since I got an invite
on Facebook from Walton Flynn.

289
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,474
Remember him?

290
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,450
Kinda.

291
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,670
I was his lab partner
in chem for, like, a semester.

292
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,858
Whoever thought
that he would remember me?

293
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,384
I do admit I did have
a little crush on him.

294
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:41,455
But I did have a crush
on pretty much anyone who wore pants.

295
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:44,017
Except for Darlene Caporale,
but that was...

296
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,077
a different story.

297
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,424
Right? So, have you spoken
to Walton since graduation?

298
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,030
No. I don't mean to be rude,
but I am late for work, so...

299
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,357
Absolutely! Amazing to see you!

300
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,017
Well... Okay, bye!

301
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,611
What do you got?

302
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,517
Our girl practically jumped out
of her skin when I mentioned Flynn.

303
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,296
Indications he might've been here.

304
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,085
Eric's checking some fingerprints
we pulled off an empty bottle.

305
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:17,011
- What's the plan?
<i>- Eric's monitoring the home phone,</i>

306
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,524
<i>cell, Facebook page.</i>

307
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,446
We're about finished wiring the place,
and then we just wait and watch.

308
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,975
All right. Wait and watch.

309
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,535
Wait and watch.

310
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,975
- Is that a frog?
- It's a swan.

311
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:58,984
From where, Chernobyl?

312
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:13,501
Is that a wing?

313
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:16,657
- It's a wing.
- Why are there three of them?

314
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,054
There aren't three of them.
That's the tail.

315
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:22,068
"The tail"? Nothing.

316
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,630
I just didn't know
that swans had tails.

317
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:31,558
They do.

318
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,719
A duck has a tail, right?

319
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:36,583
Maybe.

320
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,443
It could be a duck then?

321
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,531
Keep it up.
You're going to have to duck.

322
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,480
I'm just staying.

323
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,581
- What?
- Is everything okay?

324
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>- Great.</i>
- Cherise just pulled into her street.

325
00:22:58,809 --> 00:22:59,753
Got her.

326
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:18,089
<i>- We can take it from here, unless...</i>
- Thank you.

327
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,492
Company.

328
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:38,142
Eric, we've got an SUV behind us.

329
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:47,502
License plate: three, India, delta,
whiskey, six, seven, four.

330
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:48,394
<i>I got it.</i>

331
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:52,309
- Think that's our man Flynn?
- I don't know, but if it is,

332
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:54,099
he's not alone. There's two of them.

333
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:58,299
It's a fleet vehicle registered
to our Citdential Security friends.

334
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:02,021
<i>Didn't Sam make it clear to those guys
this is our investigation?</i>

335
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,156
- What do you want me to do?
- I got it.

336
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,945
What is she doing?

337
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,607
We've been made.

338
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,491
You boys need me
to call a tow truck?

339
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:41,737
- We're good.
- Okay.

340
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:03,093
No sign of Flynn.
Not even a phone call.

341
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,756
Cherise was home all night.

342
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,231
So why is this guy here?

343
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,388
We need to be more proactive
than just a stake out.

344
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,885
- What are you thinking?
- We get close to her at work.

345
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:14,012
Who's good at video games?

346
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,213
Back in the days, I was pretty money
at "Donkey Kong".

347
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,810
Nate's profile did suggest
that she's attracted to bad boy types

348
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,083
who need saving.

349
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:30,028
Did he?

350
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,731
These were on sale at Lucky Brand.

351
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:40,653
They... already have rips,
so a few more...

352
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:42,242
won't matter.

353
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,697
And this is the latest drivel
from what they call

354
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:48,401
"the music scene".

355
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:51,154
I thought we were going all black?

356
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:56,658
Sometimes damaged goods
can actually be more valuable

357
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,933
because of their unique qualities.

358
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,699
- Is that right?
- It's a thought.

359
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,778
I will try
and take good care of them.

360
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,007
Don't try.

361
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:14,312
Just do.

362
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,216
For your Ultrasoft interview:

363
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:21,575
resume and a little dirty laundry
on the manager.

364
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:23,110
It should work like a charm.

365
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,598
I'm sorry, Mr. Wells.
We really don't have anything for you.

366
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,826
You haven't even looked
at my resume.

367
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,746
I'm sure you're very qualified.
Let me guess.

368
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:35,693
You've been gaming
since you were a boy,

369
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:38,350
experience on all platforms
and genres.

370
00:26:38,392 --> 00:26:41,808
You have previous employment
in the field, glowing recommendations...

371
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,640
- Am I close?
- Very.

372
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,401
Unfortunately, that's also the...

373
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:50,602
the history of the other 22 applicants
on the list ahead of you. So...

374
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:51,818
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:56,630
I guess we'll both be sorry.
I'll be out of a job and...

376
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,695
you'll be in trouble.

377
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:02,683
I do like your confidence,
Mr. Wells.

378
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:04,836
You know what? I'll even bite.

379
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,251
What do you have
that no one else does?

380
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,086
What's under that resume
you haven't read.

381
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:26,936
Where did you get this?

382
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:29,438
Where's not important.

383
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:33,026
That I won't talk
about your creative tax return...

384
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:34,713
is.

385
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:38,531
Shall we?

386
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:46,757
All right, this is you.

387
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:51,544
Let's see if you're as good a gamer
as you are an extortionist.

388
00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:15,598
<i>Welcome to Warrior Wing.</i>

389
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:22,701
Possible motive
for the killing in Iraq.

390
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,584
Amini wasn't a fan
of the American military presence,

391
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,673
and especially
the private security firms.

392
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,051
He wasn't shy about letting
everyone know it, too.

393
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,710
<i>- Eric, you there?</i>
- Callen's in trouble.

394
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,659
- Got a situation here.
<i>- I'm pulling up your computer now.</i>

395
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:40,259
Bug problem...
really big bug problem.

396
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,935
All right, you're up
against a devil-droid.

397
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,890
You have to transform yourself
into a dweed.

398
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,309
I already feel
like a dweeb sitting here.

399
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,481
Not a "dweeb", a "dweed".

400
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,634
It's a combination
between a dwarf and a steed.

401
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:54,982
Alright, grab
your treasure torch and...

402
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:58,569
<i>Okay, not good. Not good.</i>

403
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,699
<i>You have used up 17 virtual
life-forces. One more and you die.</i>

404
00:29:06,742 --> 00:29:08,913
We need to go to plan B,
Eric, and fast.

405
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,668
All right, you got it.

406
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,626
<i>- You hear that, Sam?</i>
- On it.

407
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,291
Mission accomplished. Lights out.

408
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:44,199
Listen up, everybody,
it's a building-wide power outage.

409
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,915
Engineering says they're not going
to have it up anytime soon.

410
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,078
- I guess we got the day off.
- Yeah.

411
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,554
She's just left the building.
You've got about 20 seconds.

412
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:10,683
Is that a real 20 seconds,
or 20 seconds give or take?

413
00:30:12,107 --> 00:30:13,519
More like five now.

414
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:32,386
Yeah. Great. I'm trapped
<i>under the next car over.</i>

415
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:35,298
Do I have to do
all the heavy lifting around here?

416
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,373
Sorry.

417
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,193
It sounds like the starter.
Let me take a look.

418
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,678
- Thanks.
- No problem.

419
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,280
- Your solenoid's fried.
- Is that bad?

420
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,909
Well, you could tow it to a mechanic
or I could switch it out tomorrow.

421
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:12,412
- You can do that?
- I can.

422
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,969
Well, you're a geek and a gear head.

423
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:18,739
- Yeah, I also cook.
- Nice.

424
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,285
I'll tell you what.

425
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,053
Let me give you a ride home.

426
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:25,633
- Which way you headed?
- You've done enough. I call a cab.

427
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,314
We geeks need to stick together.

428
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,264
I'll grab my bag.

429
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,410
All right.

430
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,563
Sweet!

431
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:40,139
I'll bet you didn't realize you'd have
to work so hard on your first day.

432
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,636
How can I thank you?

433
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:44,755
Depends on how threatening you think
a bathroom and a beer would be.

434
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,780
Considering my boyfriend's
gonna be home any second,

435
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:51,026
I don't think I have
a lot to worry about.

436
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:52,618
- Yeah.
- Sounds good.

437
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,291
In position.

438
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,057
Back lane's covered.

439
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,852
I hope he realizes how lucky he is.

440
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:20,566
Well, we hardly knew
each other in high school.

441
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,983
When we reconnected out here,
it just happened so fast.

442
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,773
I still can't believe it.

443
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:38,513
Heads up, people.

444
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,667
Our boy's here. Lock and load.

445
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:45,046
<i>Soon as you say the word,
I'm coming through the front door.</i>

446
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,298
He's entering the house.
Stand by everyone.

447
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,350
Hey, babe.

448
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,506
Hey, baby.

449
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:04,393
Steve works with me. He gave me
a ride home when my jeep died.

450
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:06,321
You want me to get you a beer?

451
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:10,868
First day, I didn't realize
I'd be dealing with "Talisman IV:

452
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,366
warlords of the Venusian moon"
and a solenoid, so...

453
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,118
Never go into the gaming thing.

454
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,561
Yeah, well, it's just...

455
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:21,444
something that kept me away
from dealing with all the crap at home

456
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,054
when I was a kid, so...

457
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:27,343
- Good to meet you.
- Thanks.

458
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,759
Army. Don't hate.

459
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,814
Can't hate anyone who served.

460
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,358
- Iraq?
- Two tours.

461
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,183
It's rough.

462
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:43,270
Not as rough as after.

463
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,400
Come on. What is he waiting for?

464
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:49,777
Why isn't he giving us
the signal to go in?

465
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,994
Stand by.
We've got some action out here.

466
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:03,580
G, company, front door.
Coming in hot and fast.

467
00:34:03,622 --> 00:34:05,459
Dom, maintain your position!

468
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,352
Get down!

469
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,510
Stand down! Stand down!

470
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:17,263
Holster your weapon!

471
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:19,140
Holster your weapon.

472
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:20,182
We're okay.

473
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:42,204
- What was that?
- Collecting our man.

474
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,299
- We were doing our job.
- You were doing our job.

475
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:47,293
If you'd done it in the first place,
we wouldn't be cleaning up your mess.

476
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,400
Stop!

477
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,588
We jumped the gun, all right?
Our bad.

478
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,021
But he killed one of our own.
You know how that feels.

479
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:55,509
I also know about the rules
of engagement and a code of conduct.

480
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,976
Now, get out of here
before I forget.

481
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:06,505
You okay?

482
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,817
You're not a game tester, are you?

483
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:21,243
Did Flynn say
why he came to see you?

484
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:26,332
Well, I wanted to believe
it was because he liked me.

485
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:27,750
Maybe he does.

486
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:31,670
It was the SIM card.

487
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,256
He gave you a SIM card?

488
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,800
I downloaded it for him.
It was encrypted.

489
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,962
He pretended like
it wasn't important to him,

490
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:47,137
but he wanted me
to decode it for him.

491
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,327
I couldn't. I mean,
the card was damaged.

492
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,615
I'm a tester not a programmer.
What did he expect?

493
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,224
Everything he told me was a lie.

494
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,780
Maybe not everything.

495
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:04,662
It's him.

496
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:06,791
Are you okay?

497
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,365
<i>I'm sorry, okay?
I'll explain everything</i> later.

498
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:10,730
Put your friend on.

499
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,633
I didn't do what they said I did.

500
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:26,141
Why don't we meet somewhere and you
can tell me what really happened?

501
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:28,435
I've got unfinished business.

502
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:29,935
What kind of business?

503
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,356
<i>Gotta cut the head off the snake.</i>

504
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,901
Then I'm a ghost.

505
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:37,111
Tell Cherise...
tell her I'm sorry.

506
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:40,531
You ought to tell her yourself.

507
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,644
<i>You and I both know
it doesn't work that way.</i>

508
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:49,864
Tell me what?

509
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,920
He told me I'm supposed
to stay away from you.

510
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,360
I guess he really does like you.

511
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,608
This SIM card is pretty messed up.

512
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,339
But it has something to do
with what Citdential was doing in Iraq.

513
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:11,246
Flynn may have lost it in Baghdad, but
whatever he's doing here is different.

514
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:15,116
- This is planned.
- Enlarge that Citdential logo.

515
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,630
Bigger.

516
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,945
He's going to take down
Caldwell... Citdential's CEO.

517
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:25,910
Cutting the head off the snake.

518
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:31,956
Get me Caldwell's schedule. And I need
to know what's on that SIM card, now.

519
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:36,462
Right.

520
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:40,132
He's giving a speech
on Middle-East security for a conference

521
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:43,285
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
on Hollywood Boulevard.

522
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,273
Couldn't be more public.

523
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:48,599
When Caldwell gets out of his car,
he's going to be completely exposed.

524
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,237
- The perfect place to make a hit.
- Wait. I got it.

525
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:54,217
The SIM card's a video.

526
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:00,887
One hell of a video.

527
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,744
<i>Okay, Kensie,
we're outside the Roosevelt.</i>

528
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:20,474
<i>Here comes Caldwell.
Talk to me, Kensie.</i>

529
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,836
Eric, do we have
any more camera angles?

530
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,343
Wait! I've got him.

531
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,597
Flynn on the move.

532
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,819
Flynn, drop your weapons!

533
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,903
Stand down! Keep your positions!

534
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,739
You know what this is about,
Caldwell.

535
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,602
They need to see
the SIM card video now.

536
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,784
I'm already on it.

537
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:58,487
There's an electronic billboard
across the street at Mme Tussuad's.

538
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:00,203
Can you do it?

539
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:01,988
Maybe.

540
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:05,575
You don't have to do this.

541
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,845
If I'm going down,
this son of a bitch is going with me.

542
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,703
We decoded the SIM card.

543
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:15,578
<i>Callen, it's on the screen
across the street... Madame Tussuad's.</i>

544
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:18,845
Look! Behind you!
Look at the screen!

545
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:25,445
Take him out!

546
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,886
Guess that leaves just you.

547
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:55,015
Video is from a mini cam
that was mounted on Flynn's gun.

548
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,227
Kind of like a dashboard cam
in a cop car.

549
00:39:57,474 --> 00:40:01,356
So Caldwell takes Amini out
and sets up Flynn to take the fall.

550
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:04,880
Then, tortures his foster
brother Chad Ellis to death.

551
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,529
Shrinks have a term
for someone like that, doc?

552
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,224
Really screwed up.

553
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:17,574
DOD will do your intake locally,
then they'll ship you off to D.C.

554
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,042
For protective custody
until the trial's over.

555
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,474
Yeah, right.

556
00:40:22,112 --> 00:40:25,205
And one day,
we'll both live in the burbs,

557
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:28,449
barbecue with our neighbors
and coach little league.

558
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,662
I don't know.

559
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,158
Teaching your son how to play baseball
sounds pretty idyllic.

560
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,599
Yeah, it does.

561
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,941
But that's why we do what we do,

562
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,394
so others can live those lives.

563
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:50,437
When Caldwell goes on trial,
if he goes to trial...

564
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,337
He'll do whatever it takes
to keep you from testifying...

565
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:56,479
Protective custody or not.

566
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,749
The man does have access.

567
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:05,647
Probably got half the joint chiefs
on his speed dial.

568
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:13,846
What are you doing?

569
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:39,530
How clever.

570
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:42,550
A duck.

571
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,483
