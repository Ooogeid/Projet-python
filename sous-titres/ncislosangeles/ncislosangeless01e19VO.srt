1
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,971
Now we're talking.

2
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:15,807
That's right.

3
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:17,137
Right here.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,275
Right here! Yeah!
Now we're talking. Yeah, please.

5
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,918
Right here, baby.
Over here.

6
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:30,988
Over here, yeah.

7
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:32,943
Over here, Kelli.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,868
Kelli, you're beautiful.
Come on, right here, Kel...

9
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:39,497
Over here, Kelli. You look beautiful.
Right here. Beautiful.

10
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,086
Bupkes.

11
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:56,013
Where you going?
Snooki from Jersey Shore is pulling up.

12
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,057
Hey, somebody call 911.
Over here.

13
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,577
What the hell?

14
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,394
.: Team UnderCovers :.

15
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,441
NCIS Los Angeles 1x19
- Hand-to-Hand -

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,937
- Okay, shot caller, call your shot.
- I'm thinking...

17
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,191
of new and innovative ways
to expose your weaknesses.

18
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,878
I have an H.
You have an H-O. Shoot...

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,121
Top of the key, off hand, glass.

20
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,141
- It's the same shot as before.
- No, this is a bank shot now.

21
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,430
With the off hand.

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,121
The key's not to over, think it.

23
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,482
It's a concept I'm sure
you'll have no problem embracing fully.

24
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,005
Same shot twice.

25
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,258
Hey, I don't break the rules,
I just bend 'em.

26
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:17,029
Listen, I love the rules,
the letter and the spirit.

27
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,096
They're the foundation
of civil society.

28
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,170
Ball.

29
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,570
Knock yourself out.

30
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:23,935
Guarantee you I make this shot.

31
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:30,566
The humanity!

32
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,239
You want to take a shot?

33
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,865
I prefer the <i>attaque au fer</i>,

34
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,827
when the tip of my foil scores

35
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,817
a direct hit against the unguarded chest
of my opponent.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,422
Come on, Hetty, one shot.

37
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:47,625
Save the planet.

38
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,656
Boys' games can wait,
a dead Marine can't.

39
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:52,812
<i>A l'étage</i>.

40
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:55,129
Upstairs. We get it.

41
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:58,305
That better be wastepaper
you're using.

42
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,274
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,188
Lance Corporal Daniel Zuna. Stationed
without incident at Camp Pendleton

44
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,618
until last night.

45
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,485
Taken by a member of the paparazzi.

46
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,086
That'd be "paparazzo",
then wouldn't it, because "paparazzi"

47
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,214
with an "I" is plural.
So paparazzo...

48
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:23,449
These were taken last night near
an alley outside of a night club called

49
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:25,777
Four-Twenty on Hollywood Boulevard.

50
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,791
Four-Twenty has an incredible DJ.

51
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,088
What? A girl's got to get her freak
on now and then.

52
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:36,799
Preliminary autopsy

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,969
indicates Lance Corporal Zuna died
from massive blood loss.

54
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,012
Gunshot?

55
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,638
No. No signs of physical trauma.

56
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,558
But here's the freaky part.

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,643
He bled out through his eyes,

58
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,270
ears, nose and mouth.

59
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,353
Lance Corporal Zuna
was on a two-week leave.

60
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:55,234
Spends a lot of his off time
at an MMA gym

61
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,208
called the Blood & Guts Warriors.

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,405
MMA, Mixed Martial Arts.

63
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,372
The victimhas been on leave after
coming off a guard duty rotation

64
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,175
at a bio-lab facility, so

65
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,524
assume he may have been exposed
to a biohazard.

66
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,789
Hazmat assured me

67
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,184
there's no contagion,

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,125
but due caution is advised.

69
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,037
We need to track Zuna's movements
while he was on leave.

70
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,436
Sniff around Zuna's gym. See
what you can find out from his buddies.

71
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,552
We can always bring them in later
if we have to.

72
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,045
Meanwhile, Sam and I will be

73
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,723
wearing gloves in an alley outside
of Hollywood Boulevard.

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,309
Substantial pooling.

75
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,629
It's more like a lake.

76
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,156
Don't go too close.

77
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,719
You don't have to say
"biohazard" twice.

78
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:50,873
It's close to the club.
You think he was waiting somebody?

79
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,365
Didn't have a stamp on his hands.

80
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:56,393
He never even went inside.

81
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:59,090
He was worried enough to come armed.

82
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,703
Average body holds six quarts
of blood.

83
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,888
- Looks like Zuna lost every last drop.
- And then some.

84
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,264
<i>- Hit me, G.
</i>- Eric?

85
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:10,518
Does Zuna's preliminary autopsy
report estimate blood loss?

86
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,711
<i>Let's see.</i>

87
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,106
Yeah. It estimates the victim lost
half his blood supply.

88
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,857
This is more than three quarts{\
of blood}.

89
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,778
Call the pathologist, see
if Zuna's toxicology report is in yet.

90
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,861
All right, hold on.
I'm checking now.

91
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,138
Before a fight, some fighters like
to boost their blood supply.

92
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,553
It adds red blood cells
and increases endurance,

93
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,873
they store up their own blood,
and they re-inject it.

94
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,408
It's called blood packing.

95
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:36,248
So Zuna gained a tactical advantage
by bending the rules.

96
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,296
- And it cost him.
- Maybe.

97
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,347
It does explain the excess blood
in the body and on the ground.

98
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,393
So, do you have a theory
on why a healthy guy

99
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,763
with no signs of trauma
would bleed out in an alley?

100
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,010
<i>Guys, toxicology's back.</i>

101
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,268
<i>Zuna had high levels of heparin</i>

102
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,051
in his system.
It's a blood thinner.

103
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:57,766
He's says that amount of heparin would
have caused unstoppable hemorrhaging.

104
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:00,789
<i>Made the blood</i> seep out
the most porous membranes in the body,

105
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,445
eyes, nose,

106
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,297
ears.

107
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,657
But nobody packs their body with blood
and willingly takes blood thinners.

108
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:10,369
Looks like Hetty can stop worrying
that he was exposed to a biohazard.

109
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:13,387
Yeah, and we can start worrying
about who the murder is.

110
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,898
Don't wait! Don't wait! Gil!

111
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,517
He gives you his back, get hooks in.
Start working for the rear naked choke.

112
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,686
- Yes, sir. Sure.
- Let's go. See it again.

113
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,105
There you go.

114
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,525
You want to train,
it's 60 bucks a month.

115
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,952
You bring your gear, no women's locker
room, you have to change in your car.

116
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,000
I mean, hi.
I'm not here to train. I'm a frie...

117
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:50,576
wasa friend of Daniel's.

118
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:52,870
You heard what happened?

119
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,085
Still can't believe it.

120
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,612
I just thought I'd come see this place.
He was always talking about it.

121
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:03,493
Danny was a hell of a fighter,

122
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,801
even better man. I'm Victor Janklow.

123
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:08,219
Tracy.

124
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,261
You his girl?

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,711
I guess.

126
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:13,348
We only just started dating, but...

127
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,410
it was intense.

128
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,522
So, how can you guys keep training if,
you know?

129
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,347
We're Marines. It's how we do it.

130
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:24,827
I was Danny's platoon sergeant.

131
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:27,886
He talked about you a lot.

132
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,447
Yeah, probably only half
of what he told you was true.

133
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:31,408
Bad half.

134
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:36,119
I thought if I saw where he trained
would help me stay connected.

135
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,603
- You know any of the guys?
- No, never met 'em.

136
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,924
Come here. Hey, guys, come here.

137
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:42,811
Come here!

138
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,893
This is Corporal Craig Mangold,
retired.

139
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,648
This is Corporal Dale Johnson,

140
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,045
Corporal Nelson Shabazz,

141
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,055
and that's Jason Wyler.

142
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,224
This is Tracy, Danny's girl.

143
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,726
Yeah? How'd you find out?

144
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,646
Police called me.
My number is in his cell phone.

145
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,773
Danny had a lot of girls' numbers
in his cell phone

146
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,734
Well, I guess mine was just
the last one dialed.

147
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,358
Come on, Jason.
We're all feeling bad.

148
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,228
Maybe it was a mistake coming here.

149
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,411
You come by here anytime, okay?

150
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,916
- Thank you.
- Thanks for stopping by.

151
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,506
I'm sorry about Jason.
He's...

152
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,260
- wound a little tight.
- It's okay.

153
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:35,084
If you want to talk,
there's some things I...

154
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,393
- Maybe a drink sometime.
- Sure.

155
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:49,987
One for Danny?

156
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,039
The pathologist says the heparin
was injected an hour before he died.

157
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,677
Means he lost a lot of blood
very quickly.

158
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,131
Surprised he didn't lose consciousness
sooner.

159
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,528
His staff NCO said
he was one hell of a fighter.

160
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,299
Which is especially interesting,
given his slight stature.

161
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:13,719
Daniel Zuna was essentially
the runt of the Warriors Litter.

162
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,930
Not physically strong,
more of a scrapper.

163
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,973
Never turn your back
on the small guy.

164
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:25,355
You know,
when I was surfing in Vietnam,

165
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:27,206
they called me "khong lo",

166
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:28,859
"the giant."

167
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,465
This giant was forced to develop

168
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,230
the ability to take
a lot of physical punishment

169
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,704
and keep on fighting.

170
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,539
That explains the blood packing.

171
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,953
Zuna was desperate to prove himself.

172
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:47,734
In my experience,
relentless behavior like Zuna's

173
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,578
is almost always driven
by some major-league personal demons.

174
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,738
Does "major-league personal demons"

175
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,593
actually appear in the DSM-IV?

176
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,143
Sometimes I feel like
I'm getting too technical,

177
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:59,431
so I like to throw
in the occasional colloquial term.

178
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,220
Okay.

179
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,020
Blood & Guts Warriors,
or in layman's terms,

180
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,438
the badass kickboxers.

181
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:10,734
The Warriors fight as a team,
mostly taking on other gyms in the area.

182
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,113
Victor Janklow and Craig Mangold

183
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,381
are former Marines.

184
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,784
Janklow was their platoon sergeant
when they all served together in Iraq.

185
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,740
He lost an eye, left the Marine Corps.
Now he owns the gym,

186
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,791
and all the other guys train there.

187
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:28,089
Dale Johnson and Nelson Shabazz
are active-duty Marines.

188
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:29,976
Both served with Zuna.

189
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,670
What about Jason Wyler?

190
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,966
He strikes me as kind of a wannabe.

191
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,112
Wannabe Wyler is the only one
who wasn't a Marine.

192
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:39,680
- I got nothing on him yet.
- Keep looking, Khong Lo.

193
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,308
Something about him
set off a warning bell.

194
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,112
Maybe it was his baby blues.

195
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,395
Or his fluffy hair.

196
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,815
What about Zuna's phone records?

197
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:51,817
Let's see.

198
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,637
In the last few days,
he called several of the Warriors,

199
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,363
and his former commanding officer,

200
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,241
- guy named Scott Davis.
- What about the last call he made?

201
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,349
That was it... to Davis.

202
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,205
He left the Marine Corps
as a lieutenant.

203
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,750
Talk to Davis,
find out why Zuna called.

204
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:09,835
Kensi and I will hit Zuna's crib.

205
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,212
That's colloquial for "house".

206
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:14,631
I knew that.

207
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,401
Zuna wanted to meet this week.
I told him I was too busy.

208
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,588
- Were you?
- Truth is, I resented the call.

209
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,477
Dan Zuna was trouble
when he was in my command.

210
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,056
Trouble how?

211
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,823
When I was his lieutenant,
it was my duty

212
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,735
to mentor him, but as a civilian,
it's a different story.

213
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,529
What about the others,
Mangold, Shabazz, Johnson?

214
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:40,574
Every man in Staff Sergeant Janklow's
platoon was a fine Marine.

215
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,576
Except Lance Corporal Zuna.

216
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:45,204
If you have to know,
Zuna had a drug problem.

217
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:49,433
- It never appeared on his record.
- I never reported it.

218
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,928
We were taking casualties every day.

219
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,171
There was no letup in sight.
Those were the dog days.

220
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,076
You need all the Marines
you could muster.

221
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:59,413
I gave him a warning.
I told him to get it together

222
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:01,220
or take an other
than honorable discharge.

223
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,797
Did your platoon sergeant
know about this?

224
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,517
If Staff Sergeant Janklow knew,
he never let on.

225
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:09,297
Maybe Zuna kept it from him,
but I don't know how.

226
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,547
It's amazing
what you overlook in war.

227
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,351
Platoon was tight.

228
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,337
Still are, from what I hear.

229
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,190
I lost two men
in a firefight in Fallujah.

230
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,074
It's a miracle I didn't lose more.

231
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,284
What does this have to do with Zuna?

232
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:26,120
Zuna was driving the Humvee.

233
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,336
I don't know
if he was high or not, but

234
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,867
somehow he got lost
in the back streets,

235
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,873
he drove us straight
into an enemy strong point,

236
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:35,676
we got pinned down, and we had
to fight our way out. And after that,

237
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,874
the unit was never the same.

238
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,176
Thanks for coming.

239
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:43,578
You never told me.

240
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,683
How Zuna died.
Was it the drugs?

241
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:50,355
Someone pumped him
full of blood thinner.

242
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,797
He died in an alley.

243
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,473
Bled out all over the pavement.

244
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,486
I know what you'll ask me.

245
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,532
Did anyone in his squad blame him
for what happened in Fallujah?

246
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,908
Blame enough to kill him?

247
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,855
It's been a long time.

248
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,972
Long enough
to forgive in my book, but...

249
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,179
it's a fair question.

250
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:21,661
This is Zuna's place.

251
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,339
You want to do the honor?

252
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,384
- What, no key?
- What's the challenge in that?

253
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,975
Why does everything have
to be a challenge for you guys?

254
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,360
Lock has a double-sided cylinder.

255
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,105
You saw it coming up the walk.

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,857
Pain in the ass, aren't they?

257
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:43,447
For some.

258
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,543
Crappy furniture, brand-new TV.

259
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:58,631
Man had his priorities.

260
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:00,424
Laptop.

261
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,015
Left on and not password protected.

262
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,261
This is going to be easy.

263
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,242
Maybe he's got nothing to hide.

264
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,815
It's like a pharmacy in here.

265
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:25,218
Oh, my God, you scared me.

266
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:27,824
How'd you get in here?

267
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,618
Danny gave me a key.
What do you do here?

268
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:31,620
I live here. Spare room.

269
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,454
Danny's laptop?

270
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,780
I e-mailed him some photos.

271
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,440
Private photos.

272
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,382
Like the two of you watching the sunset
at Santa Monica Pier,

273
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,509
or the kind where you're not wearing
anything?

274
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:50,229
Certain kind of person
finds private photos like that,

275
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,974
they end up on the Internet.

276
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:55,513
So, definitely, uh, X-rated then,

277
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,522
Nobody under 17 admitted?

278
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,043
Well played.

279
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,901
Danny said he met a girl.

280
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,279
Said that she was hot.

281
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,281
You think he meant me?

282
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,441
I sort of assumed he had others.

283
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,036
No, no, no.
He, uh...

284
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,672
He definitely meant you.

285
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:20,198
Talked about how you two
used to party pretty hard together.

286
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:23,456
One thing leads to another,
next thing you know,

287
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,210
out comes the camera.

288
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,573
Right. Except for,
he said your name was Kate.

289
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:34,641
So, who the hell are you?

290
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,094
I met him at a party.

291
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,439
Paid him for some stuff he never
delivered. I came to pick it up myself.

292
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,492
- Is that why you're here?
- No, 'cause I don't do drugs.

293
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,404
Maybe Danny's connection never came
through. You know who his supplier is?

294
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,857
I was hoping it was you.

295
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:55,329
Or maybe you found what you were
looking for before I got here.

296
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,294
Maybe you found some cash.

297
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,001
Maybe you should empty
those pockets.

298
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,155
Did you call for a cab?

299
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,135
That would be me.

300
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:18,096
Thanks for stopping by.

301
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,840
Nice save with the cab.

302
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,316
Dirty pictures.

303
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:50,236
Nice touch.

304
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:52,398
Except it didn't work.

305
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,402
Had to switch up to a drug buy.

306
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,699
And he was interested.

307
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,076
You should consider investing in some
of those green tree air fresheners.

308
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:02,587
I'm just saying.

309
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,816
Thanks.

310
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,127
That was my snitch money
for the entire month.

311
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,553
Hetty's gonna blow a gasket.

312
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,619
Yeah, Eric.

313
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,490
<i>Whoever Kensi's been talking with</i>

314
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,346
it's not Jason Wyler.

315
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,537
I've checked every known database.
There's only a driver's license.

316
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>No Social Security number,
school records,</i>

317
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,818
immunization,

318
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,074
not even a library card.

319
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,046
Your Jason Wyler doesn't exist.

320
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:42,361
Anything new on Wyler?

321
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,271
Still tracking his alias.

322
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,981
Maybe he killed Zuna.

323
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,229
He shared his house.

324
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,698
He must have known he was blood packing.
He could have introduced the heparin.

325
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:53,613
Lieutenant Davis said Zuna
had a drug problem in Iraq.

326
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,876
Maybe it was a drug deal gone wrong
between him and Wyler.

327
00:17:56,918 --> 00:18:00,036
We can't answer the why
until we know who Wyler is.

328
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,794
Nate, check for any recent
drug-related activity at the gym

329
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:04,332
or involving MMA fighters.

330
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,115
These guys are looking to get an edge.
Methamphetamine, ephedrine, cocaine.

331
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,664
All likely stimulants
to appear in that environment.

332
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,842
Not to mention
performance-enhancing drugs.

333
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,093
Check it anyways.

334
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,262
And the paparazzi footage?

335
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,623
Literally thousands of shots.
I'm still sifting through it.

336
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,225
I'm still stuck on Wyler.

337
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:24,251
Stuck. Smitten.

338
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,291
- Whatever.
- He's hiding behind an alias,

339
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:28,721
he's carrying a weapon.

340
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,859
From the first moment I saw him,
he seemed hinky.

341
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,365
- Warriors are down a fighter.
- You might want to try out.

342
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,451
I need to backstop you.

343
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,562
Better hurry up,
I got to get that open spot

344
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,996
before somebody else does.

345
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:45,210
Sounds like you're headed
for the gym.

346
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,428
DeMarco Williams.
Striker.

347
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,446
Standup fighters tend to get
their asses handed to 'em around here.

348
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:57,639
- I've got ground game, too.
- Really?

349
00:18:58,665 --> 00:18:59,741
Is that right?

350
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:02,682
Word is you are looking for a new man.
I'd like to show you what I've got.

351
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,186
- You ever fight outside North Carolina?
- Not yet.

352
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:09,639
But I'm looking forward to giving West
Coast a little taste of home cooking.

353
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,692
Well, you know, we've got
a spot open on tonight's card.

354
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,113
Let's see how you do.

355
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:17,365
- Cool. Appreciate it.
- Did I just hear that right?

356
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,764
DeMarco Williams, Jason Wyler.

357
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:23,917
- I thought I was getting Zuna's spot.
- You're still a little green, Jason.

358
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,985
This guy walks in off
the street and takes my place?

359
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:27,541
- Wait, fellas.
- Hold it.

360
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,002
Williams has a lot of fights under
his belt. He's had 27 bouts, 26 KOs.

361
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,673
- What happened in that last fight?
- Forfeit. Guy never showed up.

362
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,694
All right, listen,
I kept my head down,

363
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:38,510
I did my training,
I deserve my shot.

364
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,956
Okay. You want to fight your way in?

365
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,224
You and Williams tonight.

366
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,101
Winner joins the Warriors.

367
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,320
Have fun, gentlemen.

368
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:02,786
Wyler's seen me, so I'm gonna be
watching from the ops center.

369
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,865
But Kensi will be in the crowd.

370
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,190
This guy doesn't stand
a chance going toe-to-toe

371
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,753
with you, so he's gonna want to grapple,
get you on the ground.

372
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,924
It's okay. I'll sprawl and brawl,
stay on my feet and outlast him.

373
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:17,254
Outlast? This isn't Survivor.

374
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,633
Look, he tries an armbar,
slam his head. Don't wait.

375
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:23,612
In the SEALs, we learned combat
techniques from a lot of martial arts.

376
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,854
- I know my countermoves.
- Sam, take him out.

377
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,472
Take him out fast.
The longer this thing goes,

378
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:31,354
the better chance he has
of getting lucky.

379
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:35,364
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?
- G, I'm gonna be okay.

380
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,906
Trust me.

381
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,661
Trouble, Mr. Callen?

382
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:48,091
He's not ready.

383
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:50,373
I beg to differ.

384
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,796
But Sam's technique is splendid.

385
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:55,045
I'm not talking
about his technique, Hetty.

386
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:58,789
- He's reluctant.
- Because he has nothing to prove.

387
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:02,292
There's no joy in a blood sport
for a man like Sam

388
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,930
who's been tested
so many times in battle.

389
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:09,684
Wyler's not going to hold back.

390
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,928
- But you think Sam will.
- Sam doesn't want to hurt him.

391
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,180
And I think
that makes him vulnerable.

392
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,859
Sam knows what he has to do.

393
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,864
I just hope he does it.

394
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,369
The body versus the mind.

395
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,898
There's a fight, indeed.

396
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,620
<i>Introducing first,
from the red corner,</i>

397
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:42,351
<i>weighing in at 185 pounds,</i>

398
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,732
<i>he hails from Los Angeles,
California, with 19 wins,</i>

399
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:48,974
<i>15 by the way of KO,
and only four defeats.</i>

400
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:52,185
<i>He is Jason Wyler!</i>

401
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>His opponent,
from the blue corner...</i>

402
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,656
Full 1080 p resolution
on the security cam.

403
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:59,985
- We got a great angle.
- On the big screen.

404
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:04,497
<i>... record of 26 wins...
26 KO's and one forfeit.</i>

405
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,933
<i>He hails from Raleigh,
North Carolina.</i>

406
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,600
<i>Please welcome...</i>

407
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:13,164
- <i>DeMarco Williams!</i>
- Janklow, I need to talk to you now!

408
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,504
All right, gentlemen,
it's the first round.

409
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,017
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

410
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,174
Let's get it on.

411
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,733
Not good.

412
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,359
Come on, Sam.
Don't hold back.

413
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,377
No spiking.

414
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,993
We need to take care of this...

415
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,891
What are you doing, DeMarco?
Come on!

416
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,480
Stay down! Stay down!

417
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:01,773
That's it.
That's it. He's done.

418
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,693
- That's the end of round one.
- Fight's over, Hetty.

419
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,321
But it's the first round for us.
Sam's in.

420
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,075
Winner by knockout,
DeMarco Williams!

421
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:15,477
- DeMarco Williams!
- I'm done, Janklow!

422
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:22,252
<i>Thanks for coming out.
Come back tomorrow night for</i>

423
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,451
<i>another night
of hard-hitting action...</i>

424
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,960
Mangold, wait.
It's got to stop.

425
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,926
Do you hear me?
Why? 'Cause you say so?

426
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,318
I didn't take orders from you
in the Marine Corps,

427
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,692
and I sure as hell ain't taking orders
from you now, Corporal.

428
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:41,484
Are you okay?

429
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,656
Hotheaded son of a bitch.

430
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:44,877
What happened?

431
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,348
Nothing.

432
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,028
It was nothing.

433
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,910
Janklow and Mangold just had it
out in the office.

434
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,775
<i>I couldn't tell what it was about.</i>

435
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,351
Kensi, where's Sam?

436
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:01,536
You did North Carolina proud.

437
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,799
A little rusty, but I felt good.

438
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,199
Looked like, uh, you pulled
a couple punches out there tonight.

439
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,306
Don't want to show my "A" game
until I have to.

440
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:12,177
Always keep a little in reserve.
That's a good strategy.

441
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:14,074
He's coming out now.

442
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,805
Janklow's with him.

443
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:19,982
Look, make sure you alternate heat
and ice on those bruises tonight.

444
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:23,356
We'll see you first thing in the morning
for training. Welcome to the Warriors.

445
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,854
- Thanks.
- All right.

446
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,732
I worked hard for that spot.

447
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:33,880
Guess not hard enough.

448
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:35,813
Trouble.

449
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:37,535
Janklow just went back inside.

450
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,579
Wyler came out.

451
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,780
Stand by. Let Sam handle it.

452
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,501
So, how much, huh?
How much for you to walk away right now?

453
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:46,836
Nobody buys me.

454
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,136
Really? 'Cause if you stick
around here, you're going

455
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,500
to be looking over your shoulder
every minute, every day.

456
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,968
Is that supposed to scare me?
I already kicked your ass.

457
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:57,931
Stop it.

458
00:25:58,184 --> 00:25:59,265
They're fighting.

459
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:05,419
Bigger problem.

460
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,107
LAPD's on scene.

461
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:09,406
LAPD?

462
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,599
How'd they get there so fast?
Who called them?

463
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,363
I don't know,
but they're taking them in.

464
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,531
We cannot risk blowing Sam's cover.

465
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:19,223
Eric, call Parker Center.
Get me the chief of police.

466
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,121
LAPD is screwing up our undercover.

467
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,459
Watch your head.

468
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,388
You might need a stitch.

469
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,474
Come on, Wyler.
What's your angle?

470
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,270
Why you want in the Warriors so bad?
Hang out with Marines?

471
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:49,024
- That it?
- Wyler, on your feet.

472
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:53,152
Well, well, well.
Tell you what.

473
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:56,483
It's, uh...
it's been nice

474
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:59,284
meeting you, Williams,
but I think I'm going to take off.

475
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,283
Williams, you're sprung, too.

476
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,705
Wait. What?

477
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,294
- Who are you?
- I was just going to ask you.

478
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:15,338
So, let me introduce you.

479
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,552
Special Agent Sam Hanna,

480
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,222
NCIS, meet... Detective

481
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,141
Marty Deeks, LAPD,

482
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,116
who's undercover.

483
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,645
Ain't that a kick in the head?

484
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,608
So,
I put a call to the West L.A. station,

485
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,701
had them hide
two black-and-whites around the corner.

486
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,674
Need you off the street,
so I picked a fight in the alley.

487
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:47,468
LAPD swooped in, arrested us both.

488
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,116
Figured they wouldn't release you
for 24 hours

489
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:52,378
and that might buy me the time
I need back at the gym.

490
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:55,882
Now, you guys...

491
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,602
You guys are some serious operators.

492
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,601
'Cause when, when I go in deep,
I'm on my own.

493
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,750
But not you guys.

494
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:09,501
No.

495
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,617
I tell you what, our...

496
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:14,459
safe house doesn't have
a view of the water...

497
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,982
except for, of course, when the...

498
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,509
plumbing backs up.

499
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,909
But I bet you got some sort
of a situation room, too. Yeah?

500
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:28,539
Lots of technical support,
lots of cool hardware

501
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,337
plasma TVs, maybe a guy at a keyboard
typing in some logistics.

502
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,125
I mean, not right next door, but...

503
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,475
but close.

504
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:37,965
Am I right?

505
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,631
- Monterey Park.
- Culver City.

506
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:40,968
That is adorable.

507
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,043
Both talking at once.

508
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,266
And you

509
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:50,686
well, at first, I wasn't too sure
about you, but that,

510
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,841
that Internet photo thing really
sold me. So, riddle me this...

511
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:55,608
did you preplan that,

512
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:57,151
or maybe...

513
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,987
maybe that happened in real life.

514
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:02,624
Crashing in his spare bedroom?

515
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:04,736
Is that the best you can do?

516
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:07,370
You are lucky I didn't shoot you.

517
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:08,579
I was vamping.

518
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,540
Are you in the mood to share?

519
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,275
That depends on if the mood is
reciprocated, 'cause I got to be honest

520
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,062
- not feeling a lot of love right now.
- Sorry for the left hook.

521
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,899
That's okay. You aren't the only one
that pulled their punches.

522
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:24,866
Okay.

523
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,058
LAPD's been getting intel
on the gym for about six months.

524
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,018
We think it's a possible distribution
point for the Juarez Cartel,

525
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,226
so heroin, coke, meth.
It's essentially a mini-mart for drugs.

526
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:37,360
It's what you want,
when you want it.

527
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,484
Now, Warriors,
it's a tight-knit group,

528
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:41,654
but I managed to work
my way in through Danny Zuna.

529
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:45,408
Zuna's autopsy turned up negative
for illegal drugs.

530
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,119
That's because Zuna's jones were
steroids and prescription painkillers.

531
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,618
Zuna was literally two days away
from introducing me

532
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,791
- to his supplier when he died.
- When he was murdered.

533
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:00,715
He was acting pretty paranoid
like something was eating at him.

534
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:04,195
We're working a homicide, and all
you have is possible drug distribution

535
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,262
and some loose connections
south of the border?

536
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,182
These past 24 hours have been tense.

537
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,857
Okay? This thing's coming
to a head. I can feel that.

538
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,465
Thanks for all your help, Deeks.

539
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,433
Thanks for...?

540
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:18,191
What, are...
are you kidding me?

541
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:22,585
I was undercover on this thing first.
You guys should be backing me up.

542
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:25,714
This is a Los Angeles Police
Department investigation.

543
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:29,460
Because the case
involves serving Marines,

544
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:32,578
it falls under NCIS jurisdiction.

545
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:36,406
That said, let's call
this a joint operation,

546
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:39,504
- and you'll both stay undercover.
- I have to run this by my boss.

547
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,131
I already have.
Ruben says "hi".

548
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,415
Pull up the unit's service records.

549
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:52,301
Logs, reports, anything you can find
from their deployment in Fallujah.

550
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:56,117
You ready for round two, Detective?

551
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:57,663
Ring that bell.

552
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:05,655
The conquering hero.
What's up, Williams?

553
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,811
Newest Warrior.

554
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:14,830
- What's up, Devil Dogs?
- You a Marine?

555
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,543
- Second Regiment, Lejeune.
- I knew it, man.

556
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,461
I could tell how you carried yourself.
What was your MOS?

557
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,242
3381. Food service.

558
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,754
You were a cook?

559
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,841
0311. Infantryman.

560
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,343
Knuckle dragger.

561
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:31,514
Although I did cook up a pretty good
ass-whupping for Wyler last night.

562
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,975
Whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry, Wyler.

563
00:31:34,254 --> 00:31:35,851
Except for the ass-whupping part.

564
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:38,940
Laid him out like Sunday supper.

565
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:44,067
We might have something.

566
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,370
Turns out Lieutenant Davis
was disciplined

567
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:49,349
- after the Fallujah ambush.
- The incident he blamed on Zuna.

568
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,561
But the investigation was shelved,
because a week later,

569
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:55,079
Davis was wounded by a sniper
and repatriated home.

570
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,411
From weak in the knees
to a Purple Heart. Go figure.

571
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:01,605
If you read in between the lines,
Davis was not the most popular leader.

572
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,404
Buried deep in one of the reports

573
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:05,881
is a disciplinary reprimand by Davis
to one of his men,

574
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,622
who...
"verbally attacked him

575
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,594
and accused him
of being a widow-maker."

576
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,367
What's the Marine's name?

577
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:12,775
Corporal Craig Mangold.

578
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:16,074
I searched through the photos leading up
to the discovery of Zuna's body.

579
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:17,410
Whole lot of <i>nada</i>.

580
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,902
What about
after they found his body?

581
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:23,424
Paparazzi went on a feeding frenzy
until the cops shut down the alley.

582
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:26,996
All these were taken after that.

583
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:34,561
There.

584
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:38,387
Lieutenant Scott Davis.

585
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:40,906
We're going to need
his current address.

586
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,362
It's a pretty nice house for a 28-year
old former Marine Lieutenant.

587
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:55,765
Daddy's money or something else?

588
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,118
Our drug connection?

589
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,439
NCIS, federal agents.

590
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,498
He's over here.

591
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,817
They're clear.

592
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,099
You think Mangold beat us here,
took Davis out?

593
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:16,910
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, his name's...

594
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,668
Mangold.

595
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,303
Find Davis.

596
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,764
Looks like LAPD's already got
a BOLO on him.

597
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,209
<i>I'll try using his cell as a GPS.</i>

598
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:44,991
Word travels fast.

599
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:48,321
Chief of detectives called me
as soon as you ID'd Mangold's body.

600
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:50,444
- So how is it laying out?
- Zuna and Mangold

601
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,739
suspected that Davis was responsible
for their friends dying in Iraq.

602
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,034
So Mangold's upset over Zuna's murder,
thinks that Davis killed him.

603
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,954
But when Mangold gets here,
Davis spots him, shoots him first.

604
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:05,093
<i>Callen, I'm tracking Davis.
He's pulling up to the house.</i>

605
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:07,761
Davis is here.

606
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,174
Federal agents.

607
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,259
Out of the car.

608
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,354
- What the hell?
- Your hands behind your head

609
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:19,140
- I didn't do anything.
- Turn around, hands behind the head.

610
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,280
- You people crazy?
- Behind your head.

611
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,729
Your place or mine?

612
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,272
We can manage okay.

613
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,566
Come on, Callen,
at least let me hear his story.

614
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,063
We'll take it from here.

615
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,861
What story?
What have I done?

616
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,020
Thanks, Deeks, for everything.

617
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:36,804
What, no hug?

618
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,657
I didn't kill Daniel Zuna.

619
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,942
He was waiting for you
outside the nightclub.

620
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:46,696
That's right,

621
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,430
we know you were there.

622
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,297
And by the length of

623
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,185
the miniskirt on your lady friend...

624
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:56,385
I'm guessing she wasn't your wife.

625
00:34:57,257 --> 00:35:00,456
If you got anything you want to say,
now would be a real good time to say it.

626
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,165
Zuna called, said he needed to see me,
so did Mangold.

627
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:06,604
Didn't know what they wanted.

628
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:08,437
The problem is...

629
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,149
they're both dead.

630
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,400
Craig Mangold's dead?

631
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,611
Found him at the side of your house.

632
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:15,613
That's two murders
with premeditation.

633
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,865
Suddenly, this becomes
a death penalty case.

634
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,619
- I'm not saying anything else...
- You were an officer, not a grunt.

635
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:24,879
If they came after you
and you killed them in self-defense,

636
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,958
there's a chance you walk away from this
but you've got to get out in front of it

637
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:29,877
- now.
- I didn't kill anyone.

638
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,253
Not even in Fallujah?

639
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:37,493
Officers said you led them
into an ambush.

640
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:42,473
- Called you the widow-maker.
- I made some mistakes.

641
00:35:42,904 --> 00:35:44,697
I was 24 years old, for God's sakes.

642
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:47,003
I got over there and saw things
you couldn't imagine.

643
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:49,772
Those were bad days, very bad days.

644
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:52,672
Hard to tell the friendlies
from the insurgents.

645
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,619
Somebody had to make the decision.

646
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,489
You didn't always make
the right one, did you?

647
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:05,746
We were driving and I got
to this intersection, and...

648
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:09,124
I got confused.
The streets all looked the same.

649
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,253
I told Corporal Zuna to turn,

650
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,964
but he said he didn't want to,
he said it was the wrong way.

651
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,884
I ordered him to turn down that
backstreet, and I got those men killed.

652
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:24,626
A week later, I got shot, and
I'll tell you something, I felt lucky.

653
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,732
Got me the hell out of there.

654
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,273
I think if I'd have stayed,
my men would have killed me.

655
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:51,542
Pretty big admission he thought he was
going to get fragged by his own men.

656
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,702
When you told him Mangold was dead,

657
00:36:56,744 --> 00:36:59,008
his reaction appeared
to be totally honest.

658
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,886
His brow never furrowed, he never
looked away, not even for a moment.

659
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:05,055
And when he talked about his fears
of being killed by his own men,

660
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,035
it not only felt genuine, but

661
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,310
it seemed as if it was the first time
he'd ever even admitted it...

662
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,229
to anyone.

663
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:17,654
- Eric.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

664
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,403
Bring up Janklow's service records.

665
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,238
- We're on our way back.
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

666
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:24,074
Keep him company.
Let's go.

667
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,457
Janklow wasn't wounded
in the Fallujah ambush.

668
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,543
That means he was still in Iraq
when Davis was shot by the sniper.

669
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,445
If his men thought Davis
was a widow-maker,

670
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,947
you can bet Janklow did, too.

671
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,342
And a week after Fallujah, Davis
is shot by a sniper while on patrol?

672
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,177
Who else was with him
on that patrol?

673
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,242
Zuna, Mangold, Johnson

674
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,643
- and Shabazz.
- Everybody but Janklow.

675
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:51,766
Warn Sam.

676
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,278
Mom, I told you
not to call me at the gym.

677
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:03,999
Fallujah was Davis' fault.
Now Mangold's dead.

678
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:07,117
Janklow killed him and Zuna.
Get out of there now.

679
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,114
Mom, I'll call you
when I'm done, okay...

680
00:38:10,864 --> 00:38:13,457
So, I got a buddy in personnel

681
00:38:13,906 --> 00:38:15,084
at Camp Lejeune.

682
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:17,211
My mom gave me that phone.
Don't break it.

683
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,597
Sam's phone's been shut off.
Battery is disconnected.

684
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,739
Eric, pull up the camera in the gym.

685
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>Something about you
didn't sit right with me.</i>

686
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>- Little too good to be a grunt.
- So you had</i>

687
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,680
- your buddy check me out. So what?
- The records show you were there

688
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:33,769
- exactly when you said.
- All right, then.

689
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:36,835
Then I called some men I know
in the Second Marine Regiment

690
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,234
they never heard of you.
Nobody else down there has, either.

691
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:43,319
Looks like you only exist on paper,
Williams.

692
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:46,530
We've got a problem.

693
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,376
Eric, find Deeks.

694
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:52,903
Watch the door.

695
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,758
So let's start with your name.

696
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:00,921
Your real name.

697
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:04,133
Why don't you tell me about Fallujah,
Platoon Sergeant?

698
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:07,031
- So that's what you're here about?
- That and Lieutenant Davis.

699
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:08,968
Lieutenant Davis was an amateur.

700
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,181
If I hadn't done something,
he'd have killed us.

701
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:12,891
There's no clock on a battle.

702
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:14,435
It's a waiting game.

703
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,789
You're up two, three days,
your adrenaline's pumping.

704
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,412
It's only a matter of time
before your body betrays your mind.

705
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,275
You don't want your men
falling asleep out there.

706
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,862
You're damn right I didn't.

707
00:39:25,205 --> 00:39:26,752
Or every man's at risk.

708
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:29,048
You had to do something,
keep 'em awake,

709
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,451
keep your men sharp.

710
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,245
It's the only way to give 'em
an edge for that long.

711
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,594
But the drugs didn't stop coming
when you got home.

712
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:38,683
You think 'cause you're home, everything
just goes back to the way it was?

713
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,950
You kept the supply coming.

714
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:45,132
Painkillers, uppers, downers,
steroids, whatever they need.

715
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:48,552
Yo, I want to cancel my membership,

716
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,554
- turn in my key.
- Wyler, not now.

717
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:51,597
Take him.

718
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,610
Deeks.

719
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm good.

720
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,489
<i>Timed that pretty well, Deeks.</i>

721
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,074
<i>Good job.</i>

722
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,792
<i>You're not so bad yourself.</i>

723
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:24,087
Janklow injected Zuna with heparin,

724
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,870
told him it was steroids
to stop him confessing to Davis.

725
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,343
Mangold tried to warn Davis
that he may be next,

726
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,971
Janklow followed him and killed him.

727
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,481
Which is just about the time

728
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:34,598
that Deeks showed up
to save your butt at the gym.

729
00:40:34,914 --> 00:40:37,249
Yeah, that's exactly
how it happened.

730
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:39,478
He's not a bad operator, Deeks.

731
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:41,922
He's all right.

732
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,170
- Where are you going?
- Little light workout,

733
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,444
- iron out some of the soreness.
- I don't think so.

734
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:51,198
- We've got unfinished business.
- What are you talking about?

735
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,014
I believe you had H-O, I had H.

736
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:56,286
Have fun.

737
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,414
No, no, no, no, I have H
and you have H-O.

738
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,799
No, no, no, no, no.

739
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,424
Call your shot.

740
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,973
Strong hand, straight in,
nothing but net.

741
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:07,923
Let me see.

742
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:10,743
The humanity!

743
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:20,657
Detective Deeks?

744
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:23,188
Hetty.

745
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,860
Who doesn't have a last name.

746
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:30,419
Lange.
Hetty Lange.

747
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,468
- Can I get you anything, Ms. Lange?
- I've already had tea,

748
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,721
thank you.

749
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,474
And it's Miss,

750
00:41:42,218 --> 00:41:43,709
and I prefer Hetty.

751
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:45,586
Hetty it is.

752
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,386
I imagine you're still smarting from

753
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,969
where the chief of police
just ripped you a new one.

754
00:41:57,403 --> 00:41:59,570
- How did you know that?
- Because I just experienced

755
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:03,270
something similar from my director.

756
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:05,209
It seems

757
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,109
we need to coordinate
our operations a little better.

758
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:11,804
My boss wants to assign

759
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,003
a liaison officer from LAPD,

760
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,215
and your boss thinks
it's a good idea.

761
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,121
But you guys don't need
a liaison officer.

762
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,429
I agree.

763
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:25,876
I told him we already have one.

764
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:56,698
Who are you guys?

765
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:02,120
How did you get
all this information?

766
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:05,068
The only thing missing here is...

767
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,132
No need to date it.

768
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:21,107
