NCIS Los Angeles 1x18
- Blood Brothers -

3
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,603
Oh, man.

4
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,848
Do I have to remind you
of the nunchaku incident?

5
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:24,894
You get hurt, you're driving yourself
to the E.R. That's all I'm saying.

6
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,104
Freeze

7
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,170
right there.

8
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,356
This is yours?

9
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,192
Yes.

10
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,371
It's my dragonhead <i>kwan dao</i>.

11
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,260
You know, one of the 18 arms
of Wushu.

12
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:38,950
That's like those little Chinese
dumplings? I love that stuff.

13
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:39,952
No,

14
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:43,246
Wushu is the Chinese
martial art with

15
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,091
18 arms or weapons.

16
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,456
I prefer the steel whip

17
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,960
or the meteor hammer,

18
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:52,156
but you have to stay
in practice with all of them.

19
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:53,140
No doubt.

20
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,667
I mean, you never know
when a horde of murderous Mongols

21
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,677
are gonna come galloping
over Laurel Canyon.

22
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,992
All hands on deck.

23
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,563
You gave him

24
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:11,065
- a whistle?
- Oh, do I look as if I've gone daft?

25
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,985
I'd sooner give a chain saw
to a spider monkey.

26
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,446
At least I took his Segway away.

27
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,907
- I'll speak to Mr. Beale.
- Sooner than later,

28
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,327
okay, because the next time he toots
that thing, he won't be using his lips.

29
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,448
Maybe you can use
your Wushu dragon breath.

30
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:27,957
Dragonhead

31
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,381
<i>kwan dao</i>.

32
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,597
Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Wendell Dobbs.

33
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,984
 Dobbs was promoted to a job
in logistics 18 months ago,

34
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:45,352
after his second tour
in Anbar Province, Iraq.

35
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:48,351
It's a lot of entry wounds.
Some serious lead-slinging.

36
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:49,729
What were they using?

37
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,953
AK-47s, multiples.

38
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:54,285
Most popular gun
in every conflict around the world,

39
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,453
but still very rare in the U.S.

40
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,821
Eric, do we have any video footage
on the shooting?

41
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,828
Got this
from the supermarket security camera.

42
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:09,457
The plates were stolen, but I've got
Kaleidoscope looking for the vehicles.

43
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,342
they probably stole the vehicles
for the drive-by so they could dump

44
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,545
- and torch them after.
- Back to the shooting.

45
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:20,509
Dropped the magazine.

46
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,596
Mags typically aren't expendable.
So they're either sloppy...

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,259
Or very well-equipped.

48
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,364
Where the hell are they getting
Kalashnikovs with extra mags?

49
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:32,537
Gang violence in the military
is an ongoing problem,

50
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,912
and SECNAV is pushing hard to rout out
any and all offenders, but

51
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,196
I don't see any indications of gang ties
in Wendell Dobbs' service record book.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,354
LAPD said there's an escalating war
between the gangs,

53
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:44,983
a lot of jockeying for drug turf.

54
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,453
Yeah, where an edge in firepower
makes a big difference.

55
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,983
Dobbs was in uniform, so it's unlikely
a case of mistaken identity.

56
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,708
He clearly wasn't a random victim.

57
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,193
He was targeted.

58
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,455
- Question is: why?
- How do we want to play it?

59
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,185
I'll go put in a call to Dobbs' C.O.
and his medical officer.

60
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:02,084
I'll swing by the crime scene,
see if I can track down any witnesses

61
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,607
who are willing to talk.

62
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:06,222
Well, looks like we're going
to pay our respects

63
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,463
to the family.

64
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,233
May we speak with you, sir?

65
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:18,799
Come in.

66
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,069
Thank you.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,620
Proudest day of my life...

68
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,893
when Wendell graduated
from boot camp.

69
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:36,836
Did your son have any enemies
you were aware of?

70
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,089
Yeah, some terrorists
in Fallujah and Abu Ghraib.

71
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,967
Any old relationships
that could have come back to haunt him?

72
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,216
Meaning what?

73
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,298
He was an ideal son

74
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,098
and an outstanding Marine.

75
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,434
We're not trying
to disrespect your son, sir.

76
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,853
We're just trying to find
and prosecute his killers.

77
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,264
And you'd better find them
before I do.

78
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,940
Pardon me, gentlemen.

79
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,034
Where's Lil'Mac D?

80
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,786
I need to talk to him.

81
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,215
Get out of my house,
before I throw you out.

82
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:16,074
- Cool your ass, old man, before I...
- Before you what?

83
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,378
You might want to think
about what you doing.

84
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,765
You best tell Lil'Mac D
we're looking for him.

85
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,280
Let's roll.

86
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,252
Move it, move it.

87
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,459
Sorry about that.

88
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,620
Who's Lil'Mac D?

89
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:55,831
I assume they mean my younger son,
James.

90
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,612
Kids don't go by their given names
anymore. It's always

91
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,334
Lil'this, Doggy that,

92
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,630
Mac Daddy Love Handles.
It's ridiculous.

93
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,943
Wendell has a brother?

94
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,691
Yeah, James.

95
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,528
Wendell was his rock...

96
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,489
but when he went to the war,

97
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,997
James got in with the wrong crowd.

98
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,102
Wendell left a job he loved...

99
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,160
leading his Marines in battle,

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,805
to take a non-deployable billet back
here, just to help James and me.

101
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:23,949
I was

102
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:26,821
diagnosed
with diabetes six months ago,

103
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,231
but I told him
I don't need a nursemaid.

104
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,162
A man should never outlive
his children.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,333
Get down!

106
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,181
Stay down!

107
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,408
You okay, sir?

108
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,097
I'm okay. I'm okay.

109
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,271
You good?

110
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,341
Good.

111
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,006
A champagne-colored
Chevy Impala lowrider.

112
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:15,659
Thanks, Eric.

113
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:19,525
and call me if you get any IDs
on that other picture I sent you.

114
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,019
Thanks.

115
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,944
Found this on the fridge.

116
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,798
Suntiago Equipment, Inc. Looks like
a pay stub with James' name on it.

117
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,296
7.62 by 39.

118
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,386
Same weapons and ammo
that killed Wendell.

119
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,973
- They're firing cheap reloads.
- Maybe the Taliban's having a sale.

120
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,522
What's Suntiago Equipment, Inc.?

121
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,387
That's where James works.
It's a

122
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:49,301
heavy equipment outfit, backhoes,
bulldozers, that sort of thing.

123
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,329
They're out by the airport.

124
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,824
Why would James' gang
want Wendell dead?

125
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:56,027
I don't know
what any of this is about.

126
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,348
It may be best if you stay elsewhere
for a few days.

127
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,996
- We'll find somewhere for you to stay.
- Hell, no.

128
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,766
This is my house.

129
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,932
I've been living here longer than most
of those punks. I'm not leaving,

130
00:09:05,974 --> 00:09:07,401
unless it's in a body bag.

131
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:11,421
Just find my son before something bad
happens to him, too.

132
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,552
We're trying, sir.

133
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,730
I ran Callen's covert little

134
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,718
happy snap against
our and LAPD's databases.

135
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,397
Rashad Hollander,

136
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,695
aka Slide,

137
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,960
dishonorably discharged
from the Army in 2007 for...

138
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,030
Let me guess: gang activity.

139
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,687
Bingo.

140
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:38,285
Managed to compile a pretty
impressive rap sheet since then.

141
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,917
As has Wendell's prodigal brother,
James.

142
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,893
James seems like a petty thief,
whereas Hollander appears

143
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,753
to be well on his way to becoming
a full-fledged sociopath.

144
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,082
Both Rashad "Slide" Hollander and...

145
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,732
James "Lil'Mac D" Dobbs have

146
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:54,969
links to the 82nd
Street Black Posse.

147
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:58,722
They been expanding into the territories
rival with increasing violence.

148
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,389
So what does this have to do
with our stellar Marine, Wendell Dobbs?

149
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,561
That's the part
we haven't figured out yet.

150
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,059
Check out the Humvees.

151
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,919
Looks like they've seen some action.

152
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,282
Something tells me we need
to play this on the down-low.

153
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,134
I think I just became James' cousin.

154
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,617
I'll buy that.

155
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,266
Hey, guys, your supervisor around?

156
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,273
That guy.

157
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:29,659
Excuse me.

158
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,003
How you doing?
Keith Dobbs.

159
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,549
This is my buddy, Ernie.

160
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,190
Ronnie Miller.

161
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,457
- How can I help you gentlemen?
- I'm looking for my cousin, James,

162
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,508
- James Dobbs.
- That'd make two of us.

163
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,605
Your cousin hasn't been here
since Friday.

164
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,297
He'll have to look for a new job
if he doesn't check in soon.

165
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:47,950
His brother was killed last night.

166
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:49,523
Wendell?

167
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,568
- You know James' brother?
- A little.

168
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,195
I gave James the job as a favor
to Wendell. What happened?

169
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,364
Looks like a drive-by shooting,

170
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,745
but police
are still looking into it.

171
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:01,643
Oh, man.

172
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,030
That's messed up.

173
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:06,425
I'm so sorry.

174
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,797
That's cool you gave him the job
as a favor.

175
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:09,877
Yeah, well,

176
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,384
it was the least I could do.

177
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,788
Wendell had a big part in helping me
secure my military contract.

178
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:19,654
He wanted to keep jobs in California.
I was the lowest bid in the State.

179
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:21,930
You see the Humvees.

180
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,174
I repair the vehicles
coming back to U.S. bases

181
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:26,643
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

182
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,020
They take serious abuse

183
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,231
in the desert over there, so we get them
back in shape for service here.

184
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,788
It's been a real godsend
in this economy.

185
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,903
You have any idea
where we can find James?

186
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,500
- We're really worried about him.
- Not a clue.

187
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,504
Any coworkers, or...

188
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,801
- friends, buddies?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,244
He was my night watchman, so,

190
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,997
to be honest, I never saw him.

191
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,040
You bring back weapons
and stuff, too?

192
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,542
No, just vehicles.

193
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,677
Humvees, mostly.

194
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:54,866
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

195
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,676
Well, thanks.
I appreciate it.

196
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,386
Again, my condolences.

197
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:01,553
Thank you.

198
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,155
Ernie?

199
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,686
Do I look like an Ernie?

200
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,569
So a Marine gets his brother a job

201
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,100
with a company
that refurbishes equipment from the war.

202
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:17,327
Then that same Marine is gunned down
by gangbangers armed with AK-47s.

203
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,915
These Humvees aren't the only things
being brought back from Iraq.

204
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,118
Yeah, it sounds like Wendell's
figured out a way

205
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,857
to supply L.A.
gangs with Kalashnikov rifles.

206
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,938
Think we better have Eric
check this place out.

207
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,877
And Ronnie Miller.

208
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,398
We got to get to James
before anybody else does.

209
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,630
Well, he can't go home.

210
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:40,582
And forget about the streets,
especially with your own gang after you.

211
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,715
He's got to be holed up somewhere.

212
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,790
His brother got him the job here.

213
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,058
Maybe he's always looking out
for him.

214
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,429
No place safer
than big brother's house.

215
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:07,899
TV's on.

216
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,582
- If he's hiding, he won't answer.
- Not even for Wendell's old buddies?

217
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:25,929
Wendell?

218
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,583
It's Gordie, baby. What's up?

219
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:30,557
I got your Xbox.

220
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,079
I got to tell you,
I'm getting pretty good at <i>Call of Duty</i>.

221
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,803
Easy! Easy. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

222
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,570
Who are you?

223
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,779
I'm Gordie. Gordon? Gordo.

224
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,200
- James, right?
- What are you doing here?

225
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm here to see your brother.

226
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:49,787
Yeah? Where's the Xbox, then?

227
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,829
Federal agent!

228
00:13:58,788 --> 00:13:59,555
Gordo?

229
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,116
And you were complaining
about Ernie?

230
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,518
Who killed your brother, James?

231
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:16,772
You don't have to be afraid.
We're here to help.

232
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,315
I'm not afraid of anything.

233
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,234
Why hiding out
at your brother's place?

234
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,819
I wasn't hiding. I was chillin'.

235
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:23,869
Your brother's dead,

236
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,824
and your boys put about 30 rounds
in your father's house this morning

237
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,078
with me and my partner inside.

238
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,953
And you were just chillin'?

239
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,810
Where are Slide and the gang
getting their guns?

240
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,563
- I don't know.
- Was Wendell

241
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:38,352
using Suntiago Equipment
to smuggle weapons to the gang?

242
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,990
No way. Wendell was clean.

243
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,024
He was a war hero. You can't say
nothing bad about my brother.

244
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,718
But you can dishonor him
by acting like some punk-ass thug, huh?

245
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,006
What about the owner
of Suntiago Equipment, Ronnie Miller?

246
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,933
Is he bringing in the guns?


247
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,002
I don't know anything
about no guns, okay?

248
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,979
- So stop sweatin' me.
- Okay.

249
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,976
Let me ask you a question.
If you're so tough,

250
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,483
why not enlist?

251
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,777
Your old man did.
Your brother did.

252
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:05,245
What were you?

253
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:06,363
Scared?

254
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,493
I tried, OK?

255
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:13,036
I tried.

256
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,959
I got a heart murmur.

257
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,907
I don't feel it.

258
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,696
I didn't even know
that it was there, but they...

259
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:26,883
wouldn't let me in because of it.

260
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,494
Look,

261
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,642
we both know your gang buddies
killed your brother Wendell.

262
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:36,990
Why?

263
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,213
- I don't know.
- Why are you protecting them?

264
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,486
I'm not protecting nobody
but myself.

265
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,403
Where I come from, you're either
a gang member or you're a gang victim.

266
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:47,738
And my brother,

267
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:49,205
Well,

268
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:53,089
he couldn't be looking out for me
when he was off fighting in the war.

269
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,830
You hungry?

270
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,124
You like Thai food?

271
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,962
I'm thinking Thai.

272
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,326
Sure.

273
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,248
Thai food?

274
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,421
Want to shed a little light here?

275
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,267
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

276
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,103
Maybe.
Maybe he does.

277
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,835
He doesn't want to talk,
but he hasn't asked for a lawyer.

278
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,775
He knows he's safer here
than anywhere else.

279
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,991
Because he knows who killed his brother.
He does, Sam.

280
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,350
But this goes way beyond murder.

281
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:32,374
We have a Gunny Sergeant
who may be supplying

282
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,950
automatic weapons to L.A. gangs.

283
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,536
He's going to tell us.
He just needs a little more time.

284
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,206
The more time it takes,

285
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,083
the more likely his gang
start using those AKs again.

286
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:42,474
When it gets out...

287
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:45,639
Then maybe we need to be out looking
for them instead of leaning on this kid.

288
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,631
Let him some time with Nate.

289
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,635
If you want to keep questioning him,
that's cool, but I head back to Ops.

290
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,568
You know I don't like people
sneaking up on me.

291
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,635
I tread lightly.

292
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,613
I don't sneak.

293
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,486
- Are there any new developments?
- No.

294
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,458
And what about
our unfortunate Gunny Dobbs?

295
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,678
Still trying to convince James
to tell us about his brother's killers

296
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,810
and where they get their guns from.

297
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:26,493
Moe and Dom, and now this young man.

298
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,548
This one isn't hitting
too close to home, is it?

299
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,924
The problem isn't Moe, Dom or James.

300
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:35,804
It's the other ten million.

301
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:40,308
You know what the leading cause of death
for young black men in this country is?

302
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,329
- Homicide.
- That's right.

303
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,956
Usually at the hands
of another young man with a gun.

304
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,346
You can't take it upon yourself

305
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,194
to save all of them.

306
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,574
But at least I can save this one.

307
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,507
Sam?

308
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,332
In the last six months...

309
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,792
Suntiago Equipment has repaired
and refurbished

310
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,661
hundreds of vehicles returning
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

311
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:14,735
All of which came back
via military air transport,

312
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,953
of course,
effectively bypassing customs.

313
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,475
- No customs check?
- No,

314
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:22,051
and it wouldn't be too hard
to fill those vehicles up

315
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,928
with black market weapons
before shipping them home.

316
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,593
So Gunny Dobbs helped
Suntiago Equipment

317
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,901
get the Humvee contract, then got James
a job there as the night watchman.

318
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,635
Eric, tell them what you found
on our friend Ronnie Miller.

319
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,294
It's not only what I found,
but what I didn't find.

320
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,390
Ronnie Miller used to be
Royad Markovic.

321
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:41,468
Serb?

322
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,206
Maybe changed his name
to sound more American?

323
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,000
Royad Markovic died in '89.

324
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:49,753
By the time we get a warrant
to search Suntiago Equipment

325
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,964
and Ronnie Miller's personal residence,
any evidence could be long gone.

326
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,227
What about

327
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,703
a FISA warrant?

328
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,513
You'll claim this under a Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant?

329
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,886
Well, why not?

330
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,809
AK-47s are a foreign weapon.

331
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,410
They're bought on the black market.
They're smuggled into the country.

332
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,501
Their profits
are probably being used

333
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,804
for terrorist activities, no?

334
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,493
Okay.

335
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,987
I'll buy that.

336
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,075
I thought you're staying with James.

337
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,539
Well, I figured I'd let Nate
have a crack at him so we could...

338
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,573
work on some other angles.

339
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,468
Checked the whole yard.
There's nothing.

340
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:36,399
I told you people.
I run a legitimate operation here.

341
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,696
I don't import weapons.

342
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,970
If it's legitimate,
then why'd you change your name?

343
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,514
America's a melting pot.
I wanted to melt in.

344
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,642
And what about the real Royad Markovic?
The one who died in Zagreb?

345
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:49,185
Royad was a friend of mine,
a business partner.

346
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:52,774
We had our own heavy equipment business,
but he was killed in the war.

347
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,642
I was bankrupt,

348
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,666
so I came here, and I started over.

349
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,699
A new country, a new life.

350
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,272
This isn't sounding good for you.

351
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,290
- What do you got, Eric?
<i>- There's been a gang shootout downtown.</i>

352
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,070
<i>They were using automatic weapons.</i>

353
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,632
<i>TB Two is inbound
to the crime scene south of downtown.</i>

354
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,592
<i>TB Two, Police Three.
Please maintain 1,500 or above.</i>

355
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,600
<i>Wilco on the altitude.</i>

356
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:25,314
<i>Uh, Shop Three-Two-Four,</i>

357
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,451
<i>be advised we have Code 20 overhead.</i>

358
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,183
<i>PB Three, perimeter is secure.</i>

359
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:33,106
<i>County coroner is on the scene,
for 17 victims.</i>

360
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,076
<i>You're good for Code Four.</i>

361
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:36,396
<i>Roger that.</i>

362
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:38,472
<i>We'll take a last look
and depart the area.</i>

363
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:39,819
<i>Thanks for your help.</i>

364
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:52,778
AK-47 mag.

365
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:15,706
... a number of bystanders
were caught in the crossfire.

366
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,739
The death toll stands at four...

367
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,744
It's one of the gangbangers
from Dobbs' house.

368
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:29,980
The one that knocked on the door.

369
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,102
Looks like our gang war
is heating up.

370
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,044
I'm guessing a couple
of these guys are friends of yours.

371
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:54,046
- What happened?
- Same that's going to happen to you.

372
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:57,203
Maybe your father if we don't take care
of this right here, right now.

373
00:21:58,611 --> 00:21:59,401
How?

374
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,985
By telling us where we can find
who's responsible for this,

375
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:04,197
- where they're getting their weapons.
- I don't know.

376
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,622
They shot
your brother with AK-47s...

377
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:09,744
pumped about a pound
of lead into his body

378
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,497
and you don't even have the guts
to tell me who else was in that car?

379
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:19,714
You want to know who else was in the car
the night my brother got killed?

380
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:22,319
You really want to know?

381
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:28,305
It was me.

382
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:31,222
Yeah, that's right.

383
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,247
I was there.
I saw it.

384
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,076
I saw everything.

385
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:39,699
Slide said that, uh...

386
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,923
he wanted to show me something.

387
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,476
And he did.

388
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:48,325
He made me watch
as they gunned Wendell down.

389
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,340
Why?

390
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:06,870
Why'd they do that?

391
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,425
Wendell wanted me out
of the gang and away from

392
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,031
Suntiago Equipment.

393
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,617
Slide didn't like him interfering.

394
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:18,980
Interfering with what?

395
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:21,531
Is Ronnie Miller bringing
the guns in through his company?

396
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,309
I don't know, all right?
I just work the gate at night.

397
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,972
When Slide found out,
he got real interested and...

398
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,410
he just... he told me
to let him in sometimes.

399
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:33,866
To do what?

400
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,415
I mean, I guess steal stuff, you know?
That's what I thought they were doing.

401
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,544
- You don't know.
- No.

402
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,340
I just work the gate.

403
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,382
I don't ask questions,
and they don't tell me.

404
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,817
And your boss didn't know
what Slide was doing.

405
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,455
No, and neither did my brother.

406
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,242
I didn't think it was
anything big, though.

407
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,569
I just thought Wendell
was overreacting.

408
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:01,272
Now he's dead, and I'm next.

409
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,440
We'll protect you.

410
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:05,026
You can't protect me any better
than my brother could.

411
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:07,385
You're right.

412
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,548
Because sooner or later,
we all end up on our own,

413
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,074
with no one at our back.

414
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:18,404
At that point, you have
to decide which side you're on

415
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,250
and whether you're going
to run or fight.

416
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,222
Now, you choose to stick
with Slide and his gang,

417
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:24,879
you'll wind up dead, just like JJ.

418
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,429
Try running from Slide and his crew,
and you'll probably wind up dead, too.

419
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,672
Because they're going
to hunt you down like a dog.

420
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:37,064
But if you stand and fight with us,

421
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,752
I promise you...

422
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,422
we will take these guys down,

423
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:44,369
and you won't have
to run or hide again.

424
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,819
What makes you think you can take
Slide's gang down when the cops can't?

425
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,636
We're not cops.

426
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,236
<i>Dread day in Los Angeles
with a shootout earlier this morning</i>

427
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,133
<i>outside an illegal
Hollywood after-hours club.</i>

428
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,328
<i>Two men, believed to be members
of a Colombian drug cartel,</i>

429
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,609
<i>were riddled with automatic gunfire
while sitting in their car.</i>

430
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:19,392
James is the only way to get
to the gang that killed his brother.

431
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:22,979
Look, Slide... Rashad Hollander
is extremely dangerous,

432
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,023
and after this shootout,
he's going to be

433
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,660
even more paranoid and jumpy,

434
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:28,735
which is going to make him
more prone to violence.

435
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,619
Which is why we have to act now,

436
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:33,562
get those killers and their automatic
weapons off the street.

437
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,833
Okay. What's to say
Slide doesn't kill James

438
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,721
the moment he sees him?
He's your only witness in any of this.

439
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,505
Slide's already lost three guys,

440
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:42,448
including JJ,
who was his right-hand man.

441
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,882
He's in a turf war with the Mexicans
and the Colombians.

442
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,502
He's going to take help.

443
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,877
I know you guys are
going to do it anyway, but

444
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,974
I just want it on the record

445
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,384
that I think this op has
an unacceptable risk level.

446
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:57,247
There are too many dangerous variables,
especially with this short of a setup.

447
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,517
That said...
I hope you kick some ass.

448
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:02,429
I'll prep James.

449
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,214
I'll get Eric working
on the tech spread.

450
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,302
I'll download
some more profiles on Slide.

451
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,437
Maybe there's something there
you can use.

452
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:09,609
Thanks, Nate.

453
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,887
You want to be briefed on this?

454
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,720
I don't know. Do I?

455
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:17,579
I can run it by Director Vance,
if you'd prefer.

456
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:19,327
Oh, Lord, no.

457
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:21,371
One of the reasons I'm here

458
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,290
is to protect him
as a designated fall guy.

459
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:26,733
"I had no previous knowledge

460
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,503
"of the operation, Mr. Secretary.

461
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,088
"That madwoman

462
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,507
went off her rocker
and acted autonomously."

463
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,842
You're the first line of defense?

464
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,136
Yeah. You got to get by me first.

465
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,396
And Mr. Hanna?

466
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,808
Will be as safe as we can manage,
as will James.

467
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,726
Bring them both back, hmm?

468
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,433
Go with God, Mr. Callen

469
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:48,871
or whoever it is
who watches over you.

470
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:51,985
I have a guardian angel.

471
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,828
She's tiny,

472
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,307
but very tough.

473
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,714
All right, Sam's button cam is up.

474
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:59,344
Where are we with the schematics
on this building?

475
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:02,764
The building's old. I'm not sure
they're even available, but I'm trying.

476
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,161
Long time no see, Lil' Mac D.

477
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,456
Well, looky here.
Mr. Night Watchman.

478
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,242
We all been wondering
where Lil' Mac D been hiding.

479
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,337
Turns out the little bitch
was on his honeymoon.

480
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,425
Yo, this is my cousin, Sam.
Just got out here from New York.

481
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,513
I don't care
if he's your imaginary friend.

482
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:45,292
You shouldn't have brought him.

483
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:48,639
Your cousin, huh?

484
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,924
Where's your little white girlfriend at,
cuz?

485
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,012
He's my parole officer.

486
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:00,539
Parole officer.

487
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,490
We got us a genuine badass here.

488
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,204
Sam did four years up in New York.
Sing Sing.

489
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,620
- That supposed to impress me?
- I'm looking for some work, man.

490
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,603
- Try Burger King.
- James said you was...

491
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,735
Man, shut the hell up.
I ain't talking to you.

492
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:15,035
I've been calling you, Lil' Mac D.

493
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,547
Yeah, I've been...

494
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,689
I've just been dealing
with my brother's funeral and stuff.

495
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,602
- I heard about JJ.
- Yeah?

496
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,469
You hear how many Mexicans
we smoked?

497
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,725
- Yeah.
- And the Colombians.

498
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:32,033
Tore them up.
They was all like...

499
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,450
Think you can run
with the big dogs, cuz?

500
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,310
- What you think, Tiny?
- He don't want none.

501
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,894
Let's see what you got.

502
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,677
It's okay.
They're just jumping him in.

503
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,331
- We lost our feed.
- <i>Yeah.</i> I'm working on it.

504
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:13,644
- These things aren't indestructible.
- Neither is Sam.

505
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,040
What's up, big man?
Wha's up? What's up?

506
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,190
That's enough!

507
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:48,729
I said that's enough!

508
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,136
You just got owned, fat boy.

509
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,531
Welcome to the clique.

510
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,137
- Eric, talk to me.
<i>- Camera's been damaged.</i>

511
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,779
<i>Trying to get the picture back up.</i>

512
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:27,218
I need to know what's happening
in there. At least get me audio.

513
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:28,636
I'm trying.

514
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:32,567
You need to go to work, man.

515
00:31:33,214 --> 00:31:34,543
What about my cousin?

516
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:36,727
Got a job for him, too.

517
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,398
Let's go. Get the hell out of here.

518
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:43,516
Let's go! Let's go!

519
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,965
James is leaving.

520
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,952
<i>James is on the move,.</i>

521
00:31:58,136 --> 00:31:59,556
Where are they taking him?

522
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,075
It's okay.

523
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,254
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd already be dead.

524
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,346
Look at that.

525
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:25,587
Puppet.

526
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:29,577
Tiny.

527
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,899
That's some serious firepower.

528
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:33,518
You got some more?

529
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,453
You know how hard it is
to get these?

530
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:37,580
I thought
maybe you were selling them.

531
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,915
- You thought wrong.
- Where you get these?

532
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,917
- Craigslist.
- Hope you got a good price.

533
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,957
- Nice and cheap.
- And why's that?

534
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,595
They look like the real deal,
but they're actually knockoffs.

535
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:49,280
That's why Butterfingers here
is having a problem locking in his clip.

536
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,844
- What makes you such an expert?
- I used to move guns.

537
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,971
- Yeah?
- What you think I was in jail for?

538
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,849
And I bet that ammo you're using
is crappy reloads, too.

539
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:02,188
Seriously. I think you got ripped off.
I wouldn't fire one of those.

540
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,023
It's more likely to blow up
and kill you.

541
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,797
Fool, we've been busting these
like freaking Rambo.

542
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,571
It ain't no problem.

543
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,798
Not yet. But how many rounds
went through there?

544
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,449
I bet it's less than three clips.
Just wait.

545
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,793
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

546
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:19,941
'Cause you ain't getting one.

547
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,493
I swear to God, Tiny,
if your uncle jacked us on these,

548
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,677
I'm driving to Miami myself
to kill him.

549
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,657
- You got these from Miami?
- That's right.

550
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,521
My uncle Boney got six of 'em
from South America.

551
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,173
Would you shut up, Tiny?

552
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,106
You could drive.

553
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:48,936
Let's go.

554
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,643
If these guys mount a 50-cal
on that thing, I'm going to retire.

555
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,752
- They're in a Humvee.
- I'll stay on them

556
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:14,328
- with the traffic cams.
- <i>Alert LAPD and Highway Patrol.</i>

557
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't want anyone pulling
that Humvee over.

558
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:31,113
Yo, Lil' Mac D, open the gate!

559
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:54,146
Eric, we're at Suntiago Equipment.

560
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,045
Look over there.
Check out those Humvees.

561
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:24,997
- You see anything?
- No, lost them behind the Humvee.

562
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:29,167
Eric, Kensi and I are going in.
We need additional backups at Suntiago.

563
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,337
- Nobody leaves this lot.
- I got it.

564
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,226
Hey, yo, I got something.

565
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:47,192
That's just bloodstains.
Keep looking.

566
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:56,362
This it right here! 622!

567
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:14,660
Come on, man. Hurry up!

568
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,090
I think it's dead.

569
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,478
You're gonna flood it, man.
Look out, man.

570
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,168
Come on, man!

571
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:32,502
- You know anything about Humvees?
- I know enough to steal 'em.

572
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:35,734
- You could get this thing started?
- Why don't we try another one?

573
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,192
- Because I want this one.
- Why? What's so special about this one?

574
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,823
{\What's it got,
like }There's satellite radio
or something?

575
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:44,285
- Can you get it started or not?
- Probably be easier to call Triple-A.

576
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,497
Probably be easier
if I just shot you in your head.

577
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,378
I doubt that'd get this started.

578
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,281
- It's the battery.
- Open the hood.

579
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,437
- It's under the passenger seat.
- Now, how you know that?

580
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,148
- You an expert on Humvees, too?
- Like I said,

581
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,725
I know enough to steal 'em.

582
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:18,611
I spent 20 minutes one night trying
to find the battery on these things.

583
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,280
Now, you want me
to get this started or not?

584
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,948
I'm need some jumper cables.

585
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,535
Go find some cables, man.
You, too! Both of y'all. Go!

586
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,835
Did our backups
just drive right by us?

587
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,504
- Impossible. They're nowhere near you.
- Then we've got company.

588
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,555
- What the hell is this?
- I supposed to know? It's your party.

589
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,850
You! Get out of the car now!

590
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,269
Tiny, check it for jumper cables.

591
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,108
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

592
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,600
- Shut up and get on the ground!
- You're on my property!

593
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,027
- I got jumper cables!
- Hook 'em up.

594
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:08,806
Take it.

595
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:13,332
Now's your chance
to get some street cred.

596
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,114
Kill him.

597
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,299
We start shooting out here,
the cops will be all over us.

598
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,843
- We'll never get out of here.
- You think you getting out of here?

599
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,951
Puppet. Swap out the Humvees.

600
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:36,897
Time to man up, boy.

601
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,948
- You killed my brother.
- Don't do it, James.

602
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:47,450
Put the gun down.

603
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,077
Do it.

604
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:55,666
Do it. Pull the trigger.

605
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:04,633
That's what I thought.
You can't do it.

606
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,992
- Come here and smoke this sorry p...
- Drop the guns!

607
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,727
Federal agents! Drop your weapons!

608
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,199
Get down!

609
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,546
Go! Go!

610
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:16,028
- You good?
- Right as rain.

611
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:24,588
Good job.

612
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:27,806
Showed the same sort of courage
your father and brother did as Marines.

613
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:30,177
- They would both be proud of you.
- Thanks, man.

614
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:39,457
Not much more of this Humvee
we can pull apart.

615
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:49,279
Bingo.

616
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,606
Looks like heroin.

617
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:00,624
- It's about a kilo.
- May I?

618
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:01,995
Sure.

619
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:07,258
Fresh from the poppy fields.

620
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,943
We thought Slide was using his overseas
connections to smuggle in guns.

621
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,558
Turns out it was drugs.
Packed away nicely

622
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,931
into Humvees coming back
from Afghanistan.

623
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,774
James would let them
into the compound,

624
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:20,102
then they'd swap out the Humvee stashed
with the drugs.

625
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,563
A foolproof plan
Gunny Dobbs stumbled upon.

626
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:26,024
We send our young men
to slay the terrorist dragon,

627
00:41:26,837 --> 00:41:30,666
and what do we get back,
but the dragon we were sent to slay.

628
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,739
It's hard to believe,

629
00:41:33,215 --> 00:41:35,678
but it was a beautiful country
once upon a time.

630
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,202
- You've been to Afghanistan?
- I spent a wonderful Christmas there

631
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:42,935
in the Bamian Valley
with a local Pashtun family.

632
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:44,398
When was that?

633
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:46,705
Well, it must have been...

634
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,056
1979.

635
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:54,845
Didn't the Russians invade Afghanistan
Christmas 1979?

636
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,937
So they did,

637
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,300
Mr. Callen.

638
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:03,937
My mistake.

639
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:07,948
I meant 1978.

640
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,201
Of course you did.

641
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,877
How silly of me.

642
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:20,938
Oh, dear.
