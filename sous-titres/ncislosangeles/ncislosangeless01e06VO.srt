1
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:38,565
Lemon drops?

2
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,358
Not really my thing,
but keep 'em coming for everybody else.

3
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,354
If you ever get tired
of these downtown party Ho's,

4
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:45,270
I'm around.

5
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,754
I didn't think
the Marines made that much.

6
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,718
- You're not from here, are you?
- Seattle. How'd you know?

7
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,304
L.A. girls never ask
where the money comes from.

8
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:57,038
Gonna take a lap.

9
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,821
Catch ya, Amy.

10
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,321
What's up?

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,687
Top of the world, Dawg.

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,212
What's up?

13
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:39,385
Brandon Valdivia.

14
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:42,274
No way. It's not true.

15
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:44,549
Where's Brandon?

16
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:09,378
.: Team UnderCovers :.

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,182
NCIS Los Angeles
1x06 - Keepin' It Real

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,203
- Is this an argument?
- No, it's a difference of opinion.

19
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,163
I happen to be right,
you happen to be wrong.

20
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:31,296
Which makes it an argument.
And for the record,

21
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:32,752
I'm right, you're wrong.

22
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,903
Operators are made, they're not born, G.
Skills can be taught.

23
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:39,042
What was that guy's name?
Swishman?

24
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,534
- Fishman?
- Swisher.

25
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,978
- Swisher.
- Chuck Swisher.

26
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,718
Used to sit and study
the ops manual in the UC van.

27
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:48,476
Knew the regulation book
backwards and forwards.

28
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,909
Terrible operator.

29
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,554
Who used to overcompensate
for his lack of undercover skill

30
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:54,381
by knowing everything
about surveillance.

31
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,989
That doesn't make him a bad agent.

32
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:59,325
Teachers learn to be teachers.
Cops learn to be cops.

33
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:02,190
And somebody taught LeBron
how to dunk from the free throw line.

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,254
SEALs learn to be SEALs, G.

35
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,250
That's right, you couldn't swim
when you enlisted, could you?

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,290
How long did
they let you wear the floaties?

37
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:13,600
I will take a lazy natural operator
over an all-night studier

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,734
any day of the week.

39
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,320
Too late. I already did it.

40
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,047
Nature versus nurture...
quite the conundrum.

41
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:25,329
You cannot use the word
"conundrum" before 9:30, Hetty.

42
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,573
9:31, which means,
Mr. Callen, you're late.

43
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,793
- So are you, Mr. Hanna.
- Late for what?

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,538
Corporal Brandon Valdivia.
25, single...

45
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,731
went off the roof
of the Downtown Apex last night.

46
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,432
Valdivia was stationed
at a supply unit at Camp Pendleton.

47
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,394
He just returned from a deployment
in Iraq three months ago.

48
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,466
Diagnosed PTSD, possible
suicidal ideation, anxiety disorder.

49
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,441
And because
of his mental health history,

50
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,017
LAPD has already ruled it a suicide.

51
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,737
We're investigating because...

52
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:01,824
Valdivia's family is tight
with their congressman.

53
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,118
The congressman calls SecNav.

54
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,271
SecNav calls the commandant
of the Marine Corps,

55
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,541
who calls Director Vance.

56
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,835
It's the proverbial
"Pentagon Shuffle".

57
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,535
Downtown Apex
is a high-end party spot.

58
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:18,119
They mix a meaningful mojito.

59
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:21,047
They have the most marvelous pool
on the roof.

60
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,856
It stays open all night,
and it's kept at a balmy

61
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,746
92 degrees.

62
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,646
Have you people
never heard of a "staycation"?

63
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,904
Did Valdivia have any kind of record,
in the service or out?

64
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,447
Not even a parking ticket.

65
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,700
- Did he have a room at the Apex?
- No, but...

66
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:46,410
I got a hit

67
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,256
on some turn-on service notices
for gas and electric.

68
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:52,343
The social security number
matches Valdivia's.

69
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:55,580
Looks like he had an off-base apartment.
Culver City.

70
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:59,049
What's he doing with an apartment
90 miles from Pendleton?

71
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,378
Certainly not taking a staycation.

72
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,658
So you think Hetty was born or made?

73
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:19,192
Hatched.

74
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:21,258
How long
we been working together, G?

75
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,172
- Two years.
- Three, next month.

76
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,414
The longest you ever had
the same partner was?

77
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:28,404
Your point?

78
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,651
We complement each other
because I'm a natural...

79
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,028
I'm natural, you're made.

80
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,502
I'm the natural operator.

81
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,028
If you're natural,

82
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,652
- then I'm supernatural.
- That doesn't even make sense.

83
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,277
Let's see
if Valdivia left anything for us.

84
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:55,579
Clear.

85
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:58,822
Clear.

86
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:02,818
ESPN.

87
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,284
Military Channel.

88
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,547
I win.

89
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,497
- Beer and mustard.
- You sure you don't live here?

90
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:17,056
Meaningless sex with an endless stream
of beautiful women.

91
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,579
How empty.

92
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,131
This guy look depressed to you?

93
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,325
No suicide note.

94
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,350
It's like a post office in here.
What do you think this guy was sending?

95
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
"Guitar Hero"?

96
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,570
What?

97
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:36,044
Receipts for the last
two weeks for 20, 40, 60, 80...

98
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,714
160 copies of "Guitar Hero".

99
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:44,277
All paid for in cash.

100
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,518
A bunch of mom-and-pop shops.

101
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,991
Two and three at a time.

102
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,409
Why buy multiple copies
of a video game?

103
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,186
'Cause it kicks major ass.

104
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:57,249
I'll tell you one thing, this guy,
Valdivia, was overpaying big time.

105
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,318
Basically, we've got a dead Marine
with no skill at volume buying.

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,544
You've a little faith.
We've got receipts.

107
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,629
Ever play "Guitar Hero"?

108
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:12,277
I prefer the real thing.
Django Reinhardt, Gabor Szabo...

109
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,253
a little Hendrix thrown in
for good measure.

110
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:16,889
Dominic Vail, I am liking you
more and more every day.

111
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,105
Speaking of video games...

112
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,695
Brandon Valdivia
went off the roof here

113
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:24,818
and landed here,

114
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,839
227 feet down.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,032
Normally, determining cause of death
in a high fall is about launch speed.

116
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,682
This one is more about angle
and placement.

117
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:37,375
Valdivia landed on his back,
relatively close to the building.

118
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:42,051
Arms spread, in what's known
as the "upturned crucifix" position.

119
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,340
That's a long way down.

120
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,097
His body could've flipped
over during the fall.

121
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,096
- Unlikely.
- But not impossible.

122
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,135
Also, he had a broken jaw.

123
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,263
- From the fall?
- Not if he landed on his back.

124
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,975
And there was no bruising on the face,
which indicates the break was fresh.

125
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,207
He was punched.

126
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,842
Brandon Valdivia was unconscious
before he even went over the rail.

127
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:04,044
So someone knocked him out
with a shot to the jaw

128
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,483
and threw him off the roof.

129
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,547
Our suicide just became a murder.

130
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:32,522
It'd take someone pretty strong to throw
a 200-pound Marine off the side.

131
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,144
I got one camera up on the roof.

132
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,020
I'm on it.

133
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,855
It's even better at night.

134
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,156
- Most things are.
- I am the events coordinator

135
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:47,586
for the hotel.

136
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,320
Did you know Brandon Valdivia?

137
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,072
Everybody knew Brandon.
It's so sad.

138
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,991
Was he a guest
at a lot of these parties?

139
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:56,637
Guest? He was the host.

140
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,402
For the last three Saturday nights,
Brandon paid for everything.

141
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,539
- How much are we talking?
- Open bar,

142
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,518
hors d'oeuvres, tray-passed shots...

143
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:07,795
This week, $27,000 in cash.

144
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,090
- That didn't surprise you?
- Who questions cash?

145
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:13,673
Don't ask, don't tell.

146
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,598
Amy was his waitress.

147
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,806
I'll be right back.

148
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,947
You waited on Brandon Valdivia
last night?

149
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,092
He wasn't drinking.

150
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:25,063
Did you see him
with anyone in particular?

151
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,548
Just this guy
he always hung with. Alex,

152
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,584
I think.
I don't know his last name.

153
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,028
You ever see Brandon and Alex
ever get into it or anything?

154
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,198
Fight? No. They loved it here,
especially Alex.

155
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:39,202
You know, all you meet in this job
is Eurotrash and wannabe actors.

156
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:43,086
Brandon was different. He cared
about who I was, where I was from.

157
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:47,085
He had a lot of money, but mostly
he seemed like a nice, smart guy.

158
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,674
Now, he's gone and that sucks.

159
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,466
I got customers.

160
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,652
<i>Your Alex</i> is most likely
Alex Walder.

161
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,009
He's Valdivia's rackmate.
They were deployed together in Iraq

162
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,669
and now they're assigned
to the supply unit.

163
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:09,524
The staff NCO in charge is...

164
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,884
Gunnery Sergeant Jerrold Mulhearn.

165
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,840
But he ships so much gear
out of Pendleton

166
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,661
that they call him "Gunny Pallet".

167
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:18,621
Like a pallet. Okay.

168
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,823
Great.

169
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:25,013
Sam and Callen are headed to the base
and Kensi's coming back here.

170
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,041
The quality's lousy.

171
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,919
Not good enough
to run facial recognition.

172
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,342
What about the elevators?

173
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,869
Accessing last night's footage now.

174
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,759
Anyone pushing the top button
went to the roof.

175
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,472
Hello!

176
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,911
If only your vocabularies

177
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,354
could be augmented as much.

178
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,414
Busted...

179
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:00,866
We move more gear out of here
than any other dock in the Marine Corps.

180
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:03,050
100,000 tons a year.

181
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,647
Everything from TOW missiles
to toilet paper.

182
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,123
That's impressive.

183
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,971
Any idea who would want to see Corporal
Valdivia take a swan dive off a roof?

184
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:12,514
Not a lick.

185
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,907
Kid was too stupid to have enemies.

186
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,485
I mean, no offense to the dead, but,

187
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:21,047
that rock couldn't pour water out
of a boot with instructions on the heel.

188
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:24,377
- What about his hoochmate?
- Lance Corporal Walder?

189
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,183
Dumber than a box of hair.

190
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:29,294
Went into sick bay this morning.
Probably swallowed his toothbrush.

191
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:33,370
- Those two get along?
- Yeah, like <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>.

192
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:37,664
Walder followed Valdivia around
like a little lost puppy.

193
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:39,593
Till last week.

194
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:42,408
They got up in each other's grill,
ended up rolling around on the deck.

195
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,174
Figured I either had to pull them apart
or turn a hose on them.

196
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,081
- Know what that was about?
- No. I just wanted it to stop.

197
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:50,879
Appreciate it, Gunny.

198
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:54,388
You look like you can still
handle yourself. You Marine?

199
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,255
Navy.

200
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:56,964
Been out a while, though.

201
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:59,884
Well, I'm just an old box kicker, so
you can take this with a grain of salt,

202
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,735
but was a time when you could make
most of these kids into regular Marines.

203
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,582
Now, if they aren't
gangbangers or convicts,

204
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,096
they're just some other kind
of major knucklehead.

205
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:11,143
It's almost getting
too hard to be worth it.

206
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:12,396
I hear you.

207
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,709
I said...

208
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:14,946
"almost."

209
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:16,663
Yeah, right.

210
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:19,403
Brain-dead?

211
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,615
Gunny Pallet said Walder
went to sick bay.

212
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,470
No, I checked. He's not there,
and he's not in his rack.

213
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,209
Get me an I.D. on Alex Walder's vehicle.
Tell me if it's left the base.

214
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,001
Checking that for you right now.

215
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,467
Why buy multiple copies
of the same video game?

216
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,675
When I see multiple purchases,
I think one thing...

217
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:41,633
resale.

218
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:44,428
People buy stuff
and sell it online all the time.

219
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,443
All right, so first,
we search for the item,

220
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,381
and then we see
who has the most active listings.

221
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:52,311
Biggest local seller is
B Dog V in Culver City.

222
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,436
Brandon Valdivia.

223
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:57,887
He was buying the games
for an average of $129,

224
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,037
but selling them
for half that at auction.

225
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,072
Buy high, sell low?
That doesn't make sense.

226
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,653
Maybe they were fakes.

227
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,081
No, his feedback is perfect.
100%, right there.

228
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,705
Maybe we're looking
at the wrong side of the equation.

229
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:18,549
Can you compare the retailers
where Valdivia bought the games

230
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:19,505
to each other?

231
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,839
Well, we already know
they were small operations.

232
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:26,238
They aren't... owned by the same family,
if that's what you mean.

233
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,977
They're spread out
all over L.A. County.

234
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,807
No discernible geographic pattern.

235
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,726
What about where the stores got
the games? Distributors, wholesalers.

236
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,108
All right.

237
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,149
Different wholesalers.

238
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:43,199
A few had the same distributor.
They all use different banks, but...

239
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:47,282
each bank is... wait for it...

240
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:52,376
on the Secret Service
Counterfeit Currency Alert.

241
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:55,791
Different banks, different reporting.
That's why he went to different stores.

242
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,923
And that's why it took Treasury
two weeks to issue an alert.

243
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,248
Valdivia bought all those video games
with what the Treasury

244
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,023
is calling top quality
counterfeit bills.

245
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,355
<i>- I got to call you back.</i>
- Thanks, Eric.

246
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,653
He bought them with the fakes,

247
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,832
sold them online,
got real money in return.

248
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:14,381
Not a bad little plan.

249
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:18,820
Where is a 25-year-old Corporal getting
high-quality counterfeit Benjies?

250
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,412
Quality's too good
for them to be homemade.

251
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:22,899
He was probably buying 'em.

252
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:28,073
Take a look at your laptop.
I'm streaming you something now.

253
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,430
<i>I've got a search going through
Kaleidoscope. And I got a hit</i>

254
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,327
<i>- on Alex Walder's car.</i>
- Where?

255
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,038
It just went off Pier 60
in San Pedro.

256
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,874
<i>Trying to locate any survivors.</i>

257
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,615
<i>The accident was caught
on a dockside security camera.</i>

258
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:43,088
<i>Stunned onlookers watched in horror
as the car went of the pier</i>

259
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,709
<i>in the Los Angeles Harbor.</i>

260
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,138
Valdivia gets tossed off a building,

261
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,646
Walder takes a long drive
of a short pier.

262
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:34,530
And somehow they're all connected
over counterfeit hundreds.

263
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,547
- You're going in, right?
- The police divers can handle it.

264
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:40,403
But you're a SEAL.

265
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:43,081
You've been looking a little pale
lately. Maybe you should go.

266
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,543
Too many bullet holes in me.
I'd sink.

267
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,937
The tide's going out. The body
could have floated out after impact.

268
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,908
The current would have pulled him
away pretty quick.

269
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:56,578
You got <i>any more security
camera angles here at Pier 60?</i>

270
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,736
Already checking.

271
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,997
And the Secret Service wants
to talk to you about counterfeit bills.

272
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:02,417
Stall them.

273
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:03,418
Too late.

274
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:12,329
Natalie Giordano, Secret Service.
I like your club house.

275
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,096
You guys got a secret handshake
and a stash of girlie mags?

276
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:19,843
Just Callen.

277
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,938
Nice to meet you,
Callen just Callen.

278
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,528
These are the bills
that Valdivia passed.

279
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:33,333
1995 series.

280
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,336
Rotating serial numbers.

281
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,166
Beautiful craftsmanship.

282
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,745
Portraits, vignette,

283
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,051
ornaments, lettering, script,

284
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,404
scroll work.

285
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:46,211
Not some Photoshop job, either.

286
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,676
These were printed
in a press with real plates.

287
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,343
These are seriously tight.

288
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:56,075
We need to get
into the distribution network,

289
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:57,973
and find out who sold
these bills to Valdivia.

290
00:16:58,057 --> 00:16:59,502
We're tracking a murder.

291
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,587
Generally, hundreds show up
in Las Vegas near the casinos,

292
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:07,315
where no one bats an eye at big bills.
That's where I'm stationed.

293
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:10,414
- You ever get up to Vegas?
- Now and then.

294
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:15,579
Hundreds are double hard
to counterfeit, because they have

295
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,675
to beat the pen.

296
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,538
On counterfeit notes,
the detection pen reacts to the starch

297
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,217
in the paper and turns brown.

298
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:24,936
So the printing quality is amazing,

299
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,056
the paper is... not so much.

300
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:29,789
That's why Valdivia passed it
at the mom-and-pop stores

301
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,338
less likely to use the pen.

302
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:33,745
So, I say it's an open book
on everything we find.

303
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,533
I catch my counterfeiter,
you catch your murderer. Who knows?

304
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,929
Maybe it's one and the same.

305
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:39,826
Isn't it great to share?

306
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,433
Well, regardless,

307
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,687
I will be staying here until we get
a collar on whoever printed these.

308
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,756
Can you recommend
any good restaurants nearby?

309
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,420
FYI, no salads.

310
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,793
I think room service
is probably your best bet.

311
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:57,702
Room service? Really?

312
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,477
She did leave that door pretty
wide open with the restaurant thing.

313
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,225
Could've drove
a truck through it, G.

314
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,946
I don't date law enforcement.

315
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,474
You might want to make
an exception this time.

316
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,043
You know the rule.
If they got their own handcuffs,

317
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:11,607
- I'm out.
- I think you're making a big mistake.

318
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:13,976
The room service she wants to order
isn't on the menu.

319
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,460
Eric, tell me something good.

320
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:19,220
Got into the traffic cams
on the pier. I pulled this.

321
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:22,363
It's not the best image,
but it's good enough to see.

322
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,933
Nobody in the driver's seat.

323
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,712
A few people on the pier,
they see the car go over.

324
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:29,272
They run toward the crash.

325
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,237
Except that guy.

326
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:33,776
He's walking away.

327
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:35,943
Zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom...

328
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:40,638
I ran him
through facial recognition.

329
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:43,244
Hello, Alex.

330
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:48,407
We've got a broadcast beacon
from Walder's phone, begins at the pier.

331
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,918
He checks his voice mails,
then switches off his phone.

332
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,927
He's only done this four times,
but it's enough to track a pattern.

333
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:56,711
It runs North up the 405
to the 10 East.

334
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,175
He could have hitched a ride,

335
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,136
or jumped in the back of a truck.

336
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,167
Nine minutes ago,

337
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,481
someone checked
Walder's cell phone voice mail

338
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,371
from a pay phone
on Wilshire and Western.

339
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,527
He's using pay phones now.
He thinks it's harder to trace.

340
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,356
He's moving East, and fast.

341
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,325
I mean, what is Walder doing?

342
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,859
What a good Marine
is supposed to: improvising.

343
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,738
Bring up the L.A. Metro map.
I want to see the Purple Line.

344
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,729
He's on the subway.

345
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,116
Next stop's the last one:

346
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,951
7th and Fig.

347
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,204
A block away from the Apex Hotel.

348
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,583
- Why is he going back there?
- Maybe he left something behind.

349
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:37,623
Walder?

350
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,303
Don't do it. Don't do...

351
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,816
Get your hands behind your back!

352
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,902
What's the matter with you?
You're trying to jump off the roof?

353
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,947
What do you have here?

354
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:01,943
What is this?

355
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,751
Are you crazy?

356
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,900
Then you must've been
real scared then.

357
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:20,091
So scared you thought jumping off a roof
was better than getting caught by us?

358
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:24,845
Who'd you think we were?

359
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,737
Why'd you go back to the roof?

360
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:30,518
I wanted to honor my friend,
to be close to him one more time.

361
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:33,254
- You shouldn't have thrown him.
- I didn't kill Brandon.

362
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,148
He was my best friend.

363
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:38,238
Everyday in Iraq I was sure we weren't
coming back, but Brandon was like,

364
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,236
"Dawg, keep your head
down and follow me."

365
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:43,534
And I did.
I did, and I came back home.

366
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:45,741
Your gunny said he had
to pull you two apart.

367
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,994
I was just trying to get him
to stop having the parties.

368
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,787
Stop spending the money.

369
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,122
I told him.

370
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,207
He was going to get killed for it.

371
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,542
Killed by who?

372
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,255
There was this kid.

373
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,284
Jason.

374
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,859
He was a couple of years older than me,
and I lived with him in a foster home.

375
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,058
He looked out for me.

376
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:15,187
Not for any other reason
than it was just the right thing to do.

377
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,666
He used to make up
these "G" names for me:

378
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:22,236
G-Money, G-Ride,

379
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,689
G-Force...

380
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:25,531
One night,

381
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:29,410
our foster dad got drunk
and he beat him to death.

382
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,539
I felt bad 'cause I didn't do anything
to help him.

383
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:40,796
I still do.

384
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:45,670
Who killed Brandon, Alex?

385
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:49,038
Rick.

386
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,292
Rick Pargo.

387
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,483
That was pretty damn cool, Callen.
Any of it true?

388
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,196
Rick Pargo. You know him?

389
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,013
Blast from the past.

390
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:12,034
He's pretty well known
by our guys at Treasury.

391
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:14,964
Commercial printer. Charged with forgery
and counterfeiting.

392
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,610
Seven times, and no convictions.

393
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,149
I mean, we've been
after this guy for years.

394
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,769
Eric, see if you can place
Rick Pargo on the hotel rooftop

395
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,840
the night
Brandon Valdivia was killed.

396
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:26,467
Checking that for you right now.

397
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,721
He is terrified.

398
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:32,760
You're kidding?

399
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,785
So, why go back to the place
your friend was murdered?

400
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:39,194
He said he wanted
to honor his friend.

401
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:41,421
Fear is a primal instinct.

402
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:46,010
It overrules everything,
including cerebral concepts like...

403
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:47,640
like honor.

404
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:49,823
Whatever took him back
there was so important

405
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:51,438
that he had to suppress his fear.

406
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:53,994
Until he ran into you guys and...

407
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,814
then the fear kicked back in.

408
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:59,040
I don't blame him, 'cause I'd probably
want to throw myself off a roof

409
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:01,450
if I saw you guys coming at me, too.

410
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,676
You left a few things out, Alex.

411
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,216
- What? No.
- You heard of "Good Cop, Bad Cop".

412
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:09,462
This is called "Bad Cop, Bad Cop".
He can do things

413
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,562
to you to make waterboarding
feel like a sponge bath.

414
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:14,595
You said you went back to honor him.
What do you know about honor?

415
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,741
We were on patrol in Baghdad.
Clearing buildings.

416
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,291
We were
in this huge old print shop...

417
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,776
had presses and plates
and everything.

418
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,861
Took a look at the plates.

419
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,240
They're for making American money.

420
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,745
Hundred dollar bills.

421
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:35,880
We took a set of plates,
hid 'em with our gear.

422
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:37,667
Smuggled 'em when we came back.

423
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:40,123
- Where'd you find Rick Pargo?
- He found us.

424
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,981
Someone must have told him.

425
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,795
We gave Pargo the plates,
he made some test batches, but...

426
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,672
- The paper wasn't good.
- Let me guess.

427
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:49,758
Brandon was supposed to destroy
the bills, but he laundered them online.

428
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:52,242
One more question.
What's this?

429
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,931
Brandon gave it to me
when he was killed.

430
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:58,170
It's a serial number generator.

431
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:00,956
Agent Giordano,
we're in the middle of something here.

432
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:03,985
I thought we were going to share.

433
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,141
It generates a new serial number
on counterfeit bills.

434
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,202
This is a good one, too.

435
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,593
Saddam had master forgers
working all over Iraq.

436
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,497
That's why they're printing
1995 series bills.

437
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,252
They're using old plates.

438
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:28,088
It's a hell of a case
you guys stumbled into.

439
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,819
You're a bartender.

440
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,698
You work at a little place
in the Valley.

441
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,984
Yeah, I'm also
Alex Walder's girlfriend.

442
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:41,117
The things we do for our country.

443
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:45,572
I once had to hide in a cake.

444
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:50,568
Never mind.

445
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,904
That brute, Pargo,

446
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:57,003
will undoubtedly frisk you,
so a wire is out of the question.

447
00:24:58,534 --> 00:24:59,597
Ah, a watch.

448
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,540
Tank style, leather band.

449
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:07,251
Microphone and transmitter
smartly concealed within.

450
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,147
I like.

451
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:12,966
Rick Pargo is in many respects
a classic narcissist.

452
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:15,742
He's beaten seven cases
against him in the past.

453
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:19,689
I consulted on one of them
and I saw him in the courtroom.

454
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:23,935
He literally acts like he's above the
law, and that makes him very dangerous.

455
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,376
Okay, I'll tread lightly.

456
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,582
Pargo will construe
any conciliatory gesture as weakness.

457
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:33,612
It's best if you consider at least
one well-timed bold gesture.

458
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,363
Like kicking his ass?

459
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,948
One more thing,

460
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,629
courtesy of our colleague
from the Secret Service.

461
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,704
Have you met her?

462
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:46,031
I have not yet met Agent Giordano,
but...

463
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:49,508
I'm under the impression
from multiple sources...

464
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,340
that you could take her.

465
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:09,941
- I'm looking for Rick Pargo.
- Who's asking?

466
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,768
- Alex Walder's girlfriend.
- Never heard of him.

467
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:29,501
This way.

468
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:34,923
You a cop?

469
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,806
- I can't hear her.
- This guy's not taking any chances.

470
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:46,726
- How long do you want to give her?
- A minute, then we go in.

471
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,348
Enjoying yourself?

472
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,972
Are you?

473
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,401
You got my number generator?

474
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,904
- It's safe, like Alex.
- Alex is dead.

475
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,239
So you think.

476
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,450
I believe you might be interested
in seeing this.

477
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,419
Born operator.

478
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:17,423
Well, then maybe we'll call Alex

479
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:20,031
and tell him to bring
the number generator over here,

480
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:22,931
if he wants to see you alive again.

481
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:28,560
Hold it.

482
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,772
- Move away.
- My boyfriend's an idiot.

483
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,315
I'm just here to make a deal.

484
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:36,150
That was really impressive.

485
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,861
I think I like you.

486
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:39,320
All right.

487
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,352
With the number generator in place,

488
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:47,120
I can print 20 million
in under two hours.

489
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,330
What stopped you before?

490
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:50,178
Paper.

491
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:52,625
Yours can't beat the pen, can it?

492
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,335
That's why I'm here.

493
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,713
I have access
to a primo paper source.

494
00:27:57,204 --> 00:28:00,323
- Let's say I'm interested.
- If I introduce you,

495
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:03,189
how do I know
I won't end up like Brandon?

496
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,756
You think I killed Valdivia?

497
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,906
I'm just a businessman.

498
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:12,889
And I'm just a debutante.

499
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:17,326
I got a partner who was supposed
to come through with the paper.

500
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:20,945
So far he hasn't.
That's what got Valdivia so impatient.

501
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:24,532
Now, Valdivia's not with us anymore.

502
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:29,409
4:30.

503
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:33,581
Just so you know,

504
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:37,045
if this goes South,

505
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:40,089
I will not hesitate to kill you.

506
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,430
What, you want to frisk me again
before I leave, Rick?

507
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:51,893
We're in.

508
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:04,857
Gordon Taymis...
youngest son of a prominent...

509
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:07,674
Canadian paper-making family.

510
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,412
You think I ought to wear a tie?

511
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,207
You're disillusioned.

512
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,891
Your father wears a tie.

513
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,149
I thought Canadians were
all supposed to be happy.

514
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:20,676
Never mistake politeness
for contentment.

515
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:25,732
What are the three "P's"?

516
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,092
Let's see, we've got printing press.

517
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:29,514
Patent green ink.

518
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:32,433
And paper, of course.

519
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:35,938
What's the, power requirement for...

520
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,148
a ten-ton intaglio press?

521
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,692
That's a trick question, Hetty.
It takes at least a 20-ton press

522
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,886
to get the proper raised finish
on authentic paper.

523
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:46,239
- You're ready, Mr. Callen.
- Thank you.

524
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,733
Take her out to dinner,
after the case is over.

525
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,788
Agent Giordano?

526
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:57,482
Then take Sam the next night.

527
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:59,669
You know how he gets.

528
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:14,207
Rick. Gordon.

529
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:16,045
How're you doing?

530
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:20,215
I hear you're in the paper industry.

531
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:21,857
Family business.

532
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,204
Third generation.

533
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:26,987
My old man was a printer.

534
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,656
Ink in the veins.

535
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:33,909
I'm sorry...

536
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,507
- This just doesn't feel right.
- It's okay. It's okay, relax.

537
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,042
I'm just used to meeting in board rooms,
not in bars.

538
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:41,877
Sit down, sit down.
Finish your drink.

539
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,449
I've seen your work.
It's ex-extraordinary.

540
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:52,750
20-ton intaglio press?

541
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,629
And I mix my own ink.

542
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:58,161
1995 series, though,
that's old paper.

543
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:00,368
Single security strip.

544
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,814
It's still in circulation.

545
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,366
That's your problem.

546
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:05,180
You need the right paper to match.

547
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,705
My family company, we have the contract
with the U.S. Bureau

548
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:12,366
of Printing and Engraving.
We supply all the cotton and linen rag.

549
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:16,162
Yeah, but every single sheet
has to be accounted for.

550
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:17,603
It does.

551
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:19,748
I'm the compliance officer.

552
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:22,565
Really?

553
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:29,037
So, what?
The family business doesn't pay?

554
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,804
My current level
of compensation is...

555
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:36,614
inadequate.

556
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:40,819
You see, Gordon has a family
and a wife in Vancouver.

557
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,162
And a very good friend in L.A.

558
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:53,276
- How much paper do you need?
- Three-foot stack should do it.

559
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:58,471
Tha... that's 2,000 sheets.

560
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:03,375
- That's $20 million.
- Can't handle it?

561
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:06,420
How are you going
to move $20 million?

562
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:10,123
I got a window once every 90 days,

563
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:12,157
where we can unload all we print.

564
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,887
- At par, guaranteed.
- Par?

565
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,231
A hundred cents on the dollar?

566
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,227
My cut's 40%.

567
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:25,606
You get 20.

568
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,113
And you take care of her
out of your end.

569
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,903
And I'll need a sample.

570
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,240
Sample's right in front of you.

571
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,479
Son of a...

572
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:49,254
Pargo said "we". He's got a partner.

573
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,678
Eric couldn't place Pargo
or Eddie on the roof.

574
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,418
Neither of them killed Valdivia.

575
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,572
But if we can deliver the paper,
maybe we can meet the partner.

576
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:59,127
Nobody gets 100 cents
on the dollar for counterfeit money.

577
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,076
And what is this 90-day window
all about?

578
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,525
The bigger question is,

579
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:05,266
how do we get 2,000 sheets
of paper by tomorrow?

580
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,113
Somebody's clicking through
your backstop Web site.

581
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,939
"Supplying high-end cotton
and linen products

582
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,369
to only the most discerning
customers worldwide."

583
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,120
Nice turn of phrase, Eric.

584
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:23,265
I minored in Lit.

585
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:26,248
Okay, so I traced the IP address
back to Rick Pargo.

586
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,681
- He's going deeper now.
- I hid a hard to read shipping manifest

587
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:33,182
for the Bureau of Printing and Engraving
in the background of one of the shots.

588
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,967
So if he clicks on it, he's hooked.

589
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,468
He's downloading the JPEG.

590
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,051
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, Gordy, how're you doing?</i>

591
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:47,980
Hi, Rick.

592
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,589
<i>Looks like you and me
are going into business.</i>

593
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:06,999
I need paper.

594
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:09,933
Look at you.
You got in with Pargo.

595
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:14,172
It's a Double-Double?

596
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,717
- I missed lunch.
- We're sharing, right?

597
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,976
How much paper you need?

598
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,394
2,000 sheets.

599
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:32,649
By tomorrow.

600
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:36,417
That's good.

601
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:45,704
Testing my wire, Sam.

602
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:47,247
I got you in my earpiece, G.

603
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,721
We're going in.

604
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,556
Search 'em!

605
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:13,231
You're my newfound friend, Gordy,
you know that?

606
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,150
Got the number generator.

607
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:18,862
Where's my money?

608
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:20,452
Your money'll be here in a bit.

609
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:22,383
In the meantime,
we've got work to do.

610
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,992
You are a printer, right?

611
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,360
Ink's in my veins.

612
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,536
We'll see. Let's go.
Unload it!

613
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:39,633
All right.

614
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,372
I'll ink it, you wipe it, that work?

615
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,702
Let's do it.

616
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,945
Just enough to fill the grooves.

617
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:00,737
Pressure does the rest.

618
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:02,530
That's a born operator, Dom.

619
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:15,761
Three seconds, $3,000.

620
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:17,462
There's no feeling like it.

621
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,046
All right, they're printing.
We got all we need.

622
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,427
No, you've got all you need.
I'm waiting on one more player.

623
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:28,598
Yeah, if he ever shows up.
I'm here to catch a counterfeiter.

624
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:32,236
I'm trying to catch a murderer. And it's
not Pargo, cause he wasn't on the roof.

625
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:35,753
Already dry.

626
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:44,500
They're flawless.

627
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:48,952
Company.

628
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:52,580
Eyes open, G.
It's Gunny Pallet.

629
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,419
<i>He's Pargo's partner.</i>

630
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,875
Unbelievable.
All right, I'm going in.

631
00:36:57,586 --> 00:36:59,273
Dom, if the truck leaves, follow it.

632
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,573
- It's all there.
- 20 million.

633
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,554
- Just like the real thing.
- Yeah, it's all in the paper.

634
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:12,409
I'm sorry.

635
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,519
You want your money.
Here you go.

636
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:20,951
We had a deal.

637
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:23,611
Where you going to get
your paper next time?

638
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,156
I mean...

639
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:28,700
Wait a minute. I...

640
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,667
All right, we can,
we can renegotiate. I mean...

641
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:35,641
- how does ten percent sound?
- Sounds expensive.

642
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:38,253
Wait until we leave,
then take care of them.

643
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:48,886
Frank!

644
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,698
Get in there! Get in there!
Now! Now! Get in! Let's go!

645
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,711
I told you I'd kill you.

646
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:22,712
Pargo!

647
00:38:24,464 --> 00:38:25,339
It's over.

648
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:27,467
Eddie!

649
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:28,968
Eddie's taking a nap.

650
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:40,952
Turn over!

651
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:43,983
Following the money.

652
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,029
Callen, Pallet's back
at Camp Pendleton.

653
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:50,031
The counterfeit money's still
on board.

654
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,318
We're on our way.

655
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,555
You've got $20 million
in counterfeit hundreds.

656
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,762
- Why would you go back to the dock?
- 'Cause you're going to ship something.

657
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:59,312
Eric, give me a list of all the flights
leaving Pendleton in

658
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,083
the next four hours
and what's on them.

659
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,154
Sending the manifest
to you now, Sam.

660
00:39:06,023 --> 00:39:09,657
We got payrolls in Afghanistan, embassy
ATMs all over the Middle East and Asia,

661
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,692
$20 million
in cash flying out tonight.

662
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:14,899
Pallet just printed 20 mil,
and he's swapping it for the real thing.

663
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,725
We should be in on that swap, then.

664
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,878
Tell Hetty we need to intercept
the real money.

665
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,546
Plane leaves in two hours, G.

666
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,817
Stand by, everyone. The game is in play.
Armored truck on its way in.

667
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:32,849
Get that pallet unloaded!

668
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,435
We need to sign for this money,
Sergeant.

669
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,383
Signed and sealed, Corporal.
On your way.

670
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:43,435
Aye, aye, Gunny.

671
00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:46,662
Hello! The pallet on the right
goes on the aircraft!

672
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:48,450
Your right, not my right,
Brain-dead!

673
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,557
- Yes, Sergeant!
- Let's move it!

674
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,239
Let's go, Lolly gags!

675
00:39:56,642 --> 00:39:59,141
We've got aircraft
going OCONUS at 1800.

676
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,356
Now move!

677
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,474
That aircraft
ain't gonna wait for us!

678
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,484
That's going 8,000 miles!

679
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:10,641
Get it secure!

680
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:14,215
Move!

681
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:43,670
What the hell?

682
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,234
Sorry to disappoint you.

683
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:54,338
The C130 with your fake $20 million
has been turned around.

684
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:56,907
What happened to "almost".

685
00:41:01,373 --> 00:41:04,021
The federal government
prints $20 million every hour.

686
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,083
And for what?

687
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:09,172
Two more wars the civilians
won't let us win?

688
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:10,629
That's how you justify it?

689
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,132
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

690
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,509
You tell me

691
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:19,093
that it's the same Navy now
that you enlisted in, Chief.

692
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:21,205
I can't say it is.

693
00:41:21,873 --> 00:41:23,642
But they still ask the same of us.

694
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,811
And that was always
good enough for me.

695
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,149
Not for me.

696
00:41:28,377 --> 00:41:29,315
Not anymore.

697
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:32,772
Don't do it.

698
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:34,903
Don't move!

699
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:37,660
Down!

700
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:42,729
Part of Pallet's job was shipping
$20 million overseas every three months,

701
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,014
so he decided to make a switch.

702
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,427
Valdivia's mistake was spending it
too soon.

703
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,867
Messed up Pallet's plan,
so he threw him off the roof.

704
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,453
Yeah, just leaving. On my way.

705
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:55,299
Born operator?

706
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,398
He's growing on me.

707
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:01,346
Mr. Callen.

708
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:03,340
Hetty.

709
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,142
While congratulations

710
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:09,063
are in order,
there is one small loose end.

711
00:42:09,518 --> 00:42:10,355
The money.

712
00:42:11,102 --> 00:42:12,061
The money.

713
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:17,466
Today, Mr. Callen.

714
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,122
Strangely, the Treasury wants
its money back.

715
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,049
Done.
You don't want to count it?

716
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:32,609
So do you want
to go get a hamburger?

717
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:35,130
Or we could order room service.

718
00:42:37,498 --> 00:42:38,610
I've got this rule

719
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:40,922
about dating cops.

720
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,132
So you mean I have
to wait till I retire?

721
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,224
I guess.

722
00:42:48,294 --> 00:42:49,901
Well, I'll put it in my calendar.

723
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:57,694
Maybe you could take
early retirement.

724
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,959
Maybe I will.

725
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:03,909
She must have been some cop.

726
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:08,784
She was.

727
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:16,564
