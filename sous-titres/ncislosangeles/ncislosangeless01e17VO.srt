00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:38,996
Alvy, we're good.

2
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:40,623
All bets are in.

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,787
Let's go!

4
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:43,793
Orange car,

5
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,462
come up, come up, come up, come up.
Good, good.

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,511
Silver car, come up, come up.

7
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,299
You're good, you're good.

8
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,136
Let's go! Just go, baby. Let's go!

9
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,230
Let's go, baby! Let's go!

10
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,172
Let's get out of here!

NCIS Los Angeles 1x17
- Full Throttle -

13
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,535
You really
got to start taking the freeway.

14
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:05,126
- I like taking the streets.
- No, you like being late.

15
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,162
The freeway would have gotten us
here faster.

16
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:08,920
That parking lot they call the 10?

17
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,971
It's also known
as the Santa Monica Freeway.

18
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:14,045
- They have names as well as numbers.
- Olympic's faster.

19
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:16,928
You never take Olympic
before noon going west.

20
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,484
What if it's a leap year?

21
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:21,791
Sam here claims to know the name
of every freeway in California.

22
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,309
Oh, yeah? What about the 8?

23
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,353
- Ocean Beach Freeway.
- The 2.

24
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:27,313
- Glendale Freeway.
- 215.

25
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,107
Got him.

26
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:31,488
Escondido Freeway.

27
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:37,490
My God.

28
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,799
Are you kidding?

29
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:41,744
- Nice geek chariot.
- Mock away,

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,470
bipeds, but I have managed
to shave 43 minutes

31
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,958
of walking time
that I can now apply to my work.

32
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,191
43 minutes.

33
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,211
- I bet he took the streets.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:55,383
I'm a firm believer that
what you drive reflects who you are.

35
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,260
Exactly.

36
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,953
- Whatever.
- And where you drive.

37
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,046
Naval Yeoman James Rush,

38
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,390
home on leave
from San Diego Naval Base,

39
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,597
died in an illegal street race
in a parking lot early this morning.

40
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,276
In our culture,
some consider it a rite of passage.

41
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:14,846
Boys will be boys.

42
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,518
What was Rush's classification?

43
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,003
According to his file,

44
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,788
he was working admin support
for the quartermaster's office.

45
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:29,631
What's weird is Yeoman Rush's file
is heavily encrypted.

46
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:31,586
What admin division is encrypted?

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,629
The ones used to cover
something confidential.

48
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,299
Eric, find
what he was really working on.

49
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,509
It could just be
an unfortunate mishap.

50
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:39,791
Maybe.

51
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,113
But that encrypted personnel file

52
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,016
suggests he was working
somewhere classified.

53
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,842
The other driver kept going.

54
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,521
Never even tapped the brake.

55
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,148
You think he was running?

56
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,941
Tinted windows, no plates, no I.D.

57
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,808
Tokkan One?

58
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,566
Tokkan...

59
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:00,948
it's Japanese.

60
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,450
Means a lightning bolt.

61
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,490
We need to find the other driver.

62
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,752
Let's check out the crash site.

63
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,955
Take Kensi.

64
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,000
You heard me.

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,935
I know you're taking PCH.
I'm not sitting in traffic.

66
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,474
I'll find out everything I can
about Yeoman Rush.

67
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,716
You two suck exhaust
for the next two hours.

68
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,042
You suit yourself.

69
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,093
Come on, Kens.

70
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,859
What do you say,
we... stop for some doughnuts?

71
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,288
I love doughnuts.

72
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,722
You didn't say anything
about doughnuts.

73
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,995
There is nothing sexier
than an empty sea of pavement.

74
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:39,210
Given the rain, I'll take a hammock,
a sunset and a secluded cove somewhere.

75
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,315
You kidding me? Do you know what
the sand would do to your brake drums?

76
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,249
What?

77
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,206
Some people find nothing hotter

78
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,663
than a racing engine
and squealing tires.

79
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,540
If you're dating the Michelin Man.

80
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,803
How you doing?

81
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,872
- Help you with something?
- Depends. Who are you?

82
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,876
NCIS. Who are you?

83
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,435
Allison Pritchet,

84
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,142
Raydex Insurance.
I've been assigned to this claim.

85
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:04,887
What can you tell me
about what happened here?

86
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,138
Nothing yet.

87
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,010
Street racing's a growing problem.

88
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:11,443
These kids spend more than the car
is worth making them go faster...

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,687
and for what?

90
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,315
Same reason some people spend
a mortgage payment for a purse,

91
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,483
I guess.

92
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:20,361
I'd appreciate a copy of the report
when it's done.

93
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,729
Don't you file your own?

94
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:23,323
We like to be thorough...

95
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:24,867
and professional.

96
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:31,956
What was that?

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,259
I know, right?

98
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,724
I mean you.

99
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:36,845
Me... me?

100
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,296
She was acting weird.

101
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:41,966
I don't trust her.

102
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,443
I'm going to go talk to LAPD
about giving us the wreck.

103
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,430
You... breathe a little bit.

104
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,045
You're really funny.

105
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,368
There and back in just
over an hour on the PCH.

106
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,151
You got lucky.
Where's my doughnut?

107
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,237
I thought you were watching
your figure.

108
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,489
It seems you've been spotted again
in a bit of a rush.

109
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,539
Red light camera.

110
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,188
Busted.

111
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,419
I was chasing a suspect.

112
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,047
Nope.

113
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,560
That was our day off.

114
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,884
You were late picking me up
for the Kings game.

115
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,673
No doughnut, no love.

116
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,067
Maybe our buddy, Bernhart from LAPD,
can help you out with that.

117
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,134
He most certainly will not.
Do you want to jeopardize this cover?

118
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,936
You'll do what everybody else does

119
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,105
- and go to traffic school.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,520
It's no big deal, you can do it online.
You'll love it.

121
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:44,176
You can if you haven't had a conviction
in the previous 18 months.

122
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:45,460
Unfortunately,

123
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:48,741
this is number three
for Mister Callen, which means

124
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,624
16 hours of in-class study.

125
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,080
You're joking.

126
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,246
Don't worry.

127
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,376
Maybe it'll be fun. I enrolled you
in a comedy traffic school

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,948
for the next two days.

129
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,421
You didn't.

130
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,007
I'm working on a case.

131
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:07,065
Sam and Kensi are more than capable

132
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,929
of covering for you
until you're finished.

133
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:14,108
It starts in one half hour
in Culver City,

134
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,851
so you best be on your way.

135
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,604
We don't want you breaking
the speed limit to get there.

136
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,147
You might want to take the 90.

137
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,128
Just saying.

138
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,968
Which is the Marina Freeway.

139
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,779
What do you got, Eric?

140
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,897
A lot of people posted videos
and photos of last night's action

141
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,873
on their social Web sites,
so I'm just comparing the best of them.

142
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,335
All right, a quick snap.

143
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,820
Photo on the left.

144
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,344
Okay. Shake...

145
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:48,746
rattle, and

146
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,928
we are rolling.
Photosynth

147
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,950
has stitched together all these random
photos from different sources

148
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:57,268
and created
one big interactive 3-D image.

149
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,272
We have a close-up of the explosion?

150
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,815
Ask, and you shall receive.

151
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,592
I pulled some audio
from a video cam.

152
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:07,264
You can actually hear Rush activate

153
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:08,988
his pressurized NOS, but...

154
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:12,074
- there's no blinding acceleration.
- Just a blinding flash.

155
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:13,416
Right.

156
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,203
Which suggests the nitrous
never made it into the system.

157
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,582
Rush ran a wet system,
which mixes nitrous...

158
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
Nitrous and fuel into the intake.
Right.

159
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:25,885
Right... but when the system didn't get
what it was expecting...

160
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,967
Engine pressure built,
temps spiked, blew the engine.

161
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,371
- The lady knows her stuff.
- The lady

162
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,263
also knows that a blown engine
doesn't create this type of damage.

163
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,402
To the naked eye,

164
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,852
it looks like the Mitsubishi explodes
right after the Honda passes, but

165
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:41,605
if we slow it down,

166
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:46,108
it's actually a chain reaction
of two separate explosions.

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,128
The first explosion is consistent
with a blown engine,

168
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,863
resulting in a mild flare-up.

169
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,949
What caused the second explosion?

170
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,979
Rush was a master mechanic.

171
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,804
He wouldn't have made a mistake
fitting that fuel system.

172
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,040
So, are you saying
that Rush's car was sabotaged?

173
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:06,067
Encrypted files, possible sabotage.

174
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:10,087
I'm thinking this just became
a murder investigation.

175
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,338
Good afternoon.

176
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,281
I'm Mr. Loobertz.

177
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,014
Welcome to the...

178
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,315
Fun for All

179
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,319
Traffic School.

180
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,255
Now,

181
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,505
I know some of you

182
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:48,366
probably aren't real excited

183
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,465
to be here,

184
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,800
but I guarantee you
it's going to be a great day,

185
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:55,844
because not only are
we Fun for All, why,

186
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,681
we're all for fun.

187
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,240
We put the

188
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:03,310
"Cool" in "School", don't you know?

189
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:06,105
Wouldn't that be "Chool"?

190
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,065
The "H" is silent.

191
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,540
I'm in 'ell.

192
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,412
The garage is a family business.

193
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,507
Older brother, Keith,
younger sister, Angela.

194
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,457
Financial records show they're
one oil change away from foreclosure.

195
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,311
A link on Rush's Facebook page

196
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:30,183
redirects to a site
dedicated to his racing victories.

197
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,477
Looks like Yeoman Rush
was a living legend.

198
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,617
Now...

199
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:37,970
just a legend.

200
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,409
- What is he supposed to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

201
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,476
You don't understand.
We don't have the money.

202
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,437
- We must let him go.
- It's not right.

203
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,034
What can we do?
We have no choice.

204
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:56,524
Guys! Guys, guys, don't...
don't worry about it.

205
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,761
It's okay.

206
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:00,503
I'll be all right.

207
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:03,927
Good luck.

208
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,998
- Sorry, we're closed.
- No, we're not.

209
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,585
- What can I do for you guys?
- Keith and Angela Rush?

210
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,191
Yeah. Why?

211
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:12,221
NCIS.

212
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:14,381
We're here about your brother James.

213
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,851
James was an angel.

214
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:21,110
I remember on my eleventh birthday,

215
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:23,390
I wanted a new bike,
but my dad couldn't afford it,

216
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,399
so James built me one from scrap.

217
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:28,228
He could build anything.

218
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,980
Sounds like a great brother.

219
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,033
The best.

220
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,903
No matter how bad the situation,
he was able to see the good in it.

221
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,230
Even with this garage,
he somehow made it all worth it.

222
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,910
Now that he's gone,
we should just sell it and move on.

223
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,786
That bad?

224
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,243
We're barely staying afloat.

225
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,284
My mom's gone, my father's in jail.

226
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,827
James dies last night,

227
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,713
and Keith is still acting
as if it's business as usual.

228
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,831
It's been rough around here lately.

229
00:11:57,991 --> 00:11:59,749
Sounds like your sister's
had enough.

230
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:03,258
This garage has been
family-owned for 15 years.

231
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,582
It's all we have.

232
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,725
If we sell it now,
we'll have nothing.

233
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,353
Angela doesn't see that,
I'm not ready to tap out yet.

234
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,480
Sometimes you got to fight
for what you love.

235
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,275
I've taken care of James and Angela
since my dad got locked up.

236
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:20,089
It hasn't always been great,
but we've survived.

237
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,809
Best thing I ever did
was get James to enlist in the Navy

238
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,838
to keep him
from winding up like Dad, but...

239
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,123
he couldn't stay away.

240
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,083
What happened with your father?

241
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,268
He's six years into a dime
for vehicular manslaughter.

242
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:36,914
During a race.

243
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:38,382
So you disapprove?

244
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,717
Hell, no.
I used to race, too.

245
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,511
Why'd you give it up?

246
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,638
I was planning on going pro, but...

247
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,017
one thing led to another,
and here we are.

248
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:52,344
I'm fighting to keep
this garage alive for Angela,

249
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,914
whether she sees it or not.

250
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,849
I'm not gonna let my brother's murder
force me into selling.

251
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:00,612
Why do you think
your brother was murdered?

252
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,851
The guy he was dragging,
Silver Honda?

253
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,128
What about it?

254
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:06,077
Tokkan.

255
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,001
He's been gunning for James
for years,

256
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:12,028
and when James enlisted,
Tokkan became the guy to beat.

257
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:15,085
James returns,
Tokkan's back to being second best.

258
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:17,629
Where can we find this Tokkan?

259
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,243
Nobody knows who he is.

260
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,551
Never shows his face,
never sticks around after he wins.

261
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,909
The guy's a mystery.

262
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,974
We need to see your surveillance tapes,
if anybody got to your brother's car.

263
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,107
James wouldn't even let me
near his car.

264
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,263
Sibling rivalry?

265
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:37,376
Seems stupid now, right?

266
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,943
Got to admire their spirit.
One tragedy after another,

267
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,177
- and they just keep moving on.
- You have to.

268
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:44,870
Otherwise, it eats you alive.

269
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,624
- She's funny. Crazy.
- Who?

270
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,697
Hetty sent me a text.

271
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,121
Hetty doesn't text.

272
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,479
She may not hit you.
She hits me all the time.

273
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,244
- About what?
- Dirty jokes mostly.

274
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,758
In Latin. You should hear the one
about <i>e pluribus unum</i>.

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,422
We're practically BFFs.

276
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,148
B-T-W. On your left.

277
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,475
This is exactly why Hetty took away
your pogo stick and your unicycle.

278
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,853
Do you actually have something for us,
Ericus Annoyingus?

279
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:18,222
I ran a check on Tokkan.

280
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:22,195
The name is well known
in the world of street racing,

281
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,702
but the guy has never been caught
or arrested.

282
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,228
Then, we've got
Ratchethead's mechanic,

283
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,081
Omar Alvares, who's just been fired.

284
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,622
He's not a street racer,
but he's got a criminal record

285
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,341
for his involvement
in a chop shop in Inglewood.

286
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,703
Get us a list
of his known associates,

287
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,249
family members and any guys
that may have done time with him.

288
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,299
Rush Senior's in prison
for killing someone in a street race.

289
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:46,735
Maybe his son's murder
was a payback.

290
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,428
Need that file, too, Eric.

291
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,927
Been there, done that.
Check your e-mail.

292
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,745
I told you this thing's
making me more efficient.

293
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,650
They just dropped off
Rush's Mitsubishi at the impound lot.

294
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,813
- What's left of it.
- You want to work it?

295
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,693
No. Go ahead. I send Callen an e-mail,
make sure he's up to speed.

296
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,157
Think he's having fun?

297
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,336
Oh, yeah.

298
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,335
Now, as you can see,

299
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,325
the California Driver's Handbook

300
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,286
is well over 90 pages.

301
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,365
That's a lot of information
for anyone to remember.

302
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,791
But you know
what isn't hard to remember?

303
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:19,425
Anyone?

304
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,133
Anyone at all?
That's a question.

305
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:23,755
Need a hint?

306
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,568
All right.

307
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,215
That's right.

308
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:29,955
That's right.

309
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,013
There you go.

310
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:33,230
Go music, go lyrics.

311
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,018
Can you feel it?
Fun For All...

312
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,478
Fun For All has broken each section

313
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,155
down into songs, from

314
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,452
rocking registration riffs to

315
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:44,276
insurance requirement raps.

316
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,151
Wicky! Wicky! Wicky!
Yeah!

317
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:48,401
So there's something here
for everybody!

318
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,520
Someone shoot me, please.

319
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:52,664
Give me a wrench.

320
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,391
Careful there, cowboy.
This baby's suffered enough.

321
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,663
Sorry. I didn't know
you cared so much.

322
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:02,994
What can I say?

323
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,939
Grease is my favorite perfume.

324
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,476
So, tell me.

325
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:10,300
How do you know so much about cars?

326
00:16:10,342 --> 00:16:12,471
Used to help my dad tune his Nova
on weekends.

327
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:14,160
In fact...

328
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,984
I used to spend my afternoons
handing him tools

329
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,455
and bringing him cold beers.

330
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,904
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:24,248
Every time he turned away,
I'd adjust the carburetor on my own

332
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,942
to surprise him when he came back.

333
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,907
This is not gonna work.
Half-inch socket.

334
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:41,041
Seriously?

335
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:44,765
My dad and I never really
worked on cars.

336
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:47,162
- He was more of a Lego guy.
- Hold on.

337
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:50,676
I feel something.

338
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,309
Oh, my God.

339
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,098
- What is it?
- I don't know.

340
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:06,040
But I'm betting
it's not supposed to be in this car.

341
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,276
Maybe Keith Rush
can tell us what it is.

342
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,502
No one's home?

343
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,247
No one friendly.

344
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:35,818
I'll take the back.

345
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,861
Stop! Federal agent.

346
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:58,160
It's late for an oil change. You mind
telling us what you're doing here?

347
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:01,131
I'm Commander Garrison Timmons,

348
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:04,078
James Rush's commanding officer.

349
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:15,986
James was a good kid.

350
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,121
I was trying to pay my respects
to the family.

351
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,319
Yeah, okay.

352
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,376
I want to know exactly what this is

353
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:22,852
and how it works.

354
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,855
Could not tell you.

355
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,525
You dropped it in the garage
when you ran away.

356
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:34,070
I'm sure there's all kinds
of fancy equipment inside there.

357
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:35,655
It's a garage.

358
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,965
All that other fancy equipment
doesn't have your prints all over it.

359
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:39,868
That does.

360
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,138
Excuse me.

361
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,507
What are you doing?

362
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,342
Give him what he came for.

363
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:06,895
How about this?

364
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,309
You wouldn't know what this is,
would you?

365
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,067
As a matter of fact, yes.

366
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,402
Where's the other one?

367
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,032
<i>James was working</i>

368
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,618
<i>on an advanced
lithium-ion battery system.</i>

369
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,747
Ultra lightweight, high-powered,

370
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,923
never needs to be replaced.

371
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:27,874
Unstable,

372
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,210
but if perfected, worth billions.

373
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,132
Two units went missing.

374
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,204
<i>When I heard about the crash,
I got worried.</i>

375
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,484
<i>- Why?
- James was the kind of R&D guy</i>

376
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,264
<i>who liked to get his hands dirty.</i>

377
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,790
It wasn't unusual for him
to test stuff out on his own.

378
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,384
The battery system.

379
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:51,231
It dramatically increases efficiency
in the combustion cycle.

380
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:54,067
In effect, it would have made
the car go quicker, okay?

381
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,878
I didn't want the Navy
to discover they were missing.

382
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,351
I've come to retrieve them.

383
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:01,909
And this?

384
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,493
It's a dosimeter.

385
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:07,171
It picks up
the battery's lithium-ion signature.

386
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,340
<i>This technology
isn't just worth a fortune.</i>

387
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:21,194
It would revolutionize
our attack vehicles in the field.

388
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,395
It's something we can't afford
to have fall into the wrong hands.

389
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,133
Well, well, well,
if it isn't our resident scofflaw.

390
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,789
Hope you had a nice day off.

391
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:32,917
Don't even start.

392
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:37,360
If someone did sabotage
Yeoman Rush's car,

393
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:38,801
what was the motive?

394
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,606
Could be a rival street racer,

395
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:43,366
which puts this Tokkan
at the top of our list.

396
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,201
What about Rush's C.O.?

397
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,412
He came clean too quick.
I think he's legit.

398
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,123
The missing high-tech battery?

399
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,927
On our way to search the garage.

400
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,591
Good morning.

401
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:57,751
How long does it take a car
traveling at 35 miles per hour

402
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,515
to stop, Mr. Callen?

403
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:01,633
200 feet.

404
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:04,024
Try 210.

405
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,682
How can someone so small...

406
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,143
It's just traffic school.
How bad can it be?

407
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,854
Remember the Libyans
that took us off the trawler?

408
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,285
- Really?
- The Libyans didn't sing.

409
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,275
- There's singing?
- And puppets.

410
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,194
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,237
Oh, good morning, Speed Racer.

412
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,991
Did you get my last text?

413
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,202
OMG, Hetty. Hilarious.

414
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,919
Hope you're watching the time.

415
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,958
Last day and all.

416
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,206
Remember, hands

417
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,072
at 9:00 and 3:00.

418
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,022
10:00 and 2:00.

419
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,344
Hang in there, buddy.

420
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:50,414
- It's a battery.
- I've never seen this before.

421
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,630
Keith would know more
about this sort of thing.

422
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,187
You can ask him when he gets back.

423
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,078
Mind if I take a look around?

424
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,424
You know where we can find
Omar Alvares?

425
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:06,136
South Central?
He's always moving.

426
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,140
This must be a lot for you guys
to handle on your own.

427
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,245
I hate street racing.

428
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,793
I begged James to stop,
but he wouldn't listen.

429
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:16,480
Men are idiots.

430
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,458
Sometimes.

431
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,738
And after what happened to our father,
you'd think he would have...

432
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,364
He just couldn't stop racing.

433
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,537
Nothing here.

434
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,202
You know where we can find Keith?

435
00:22:30,664 --> 00:22:34,136
He said he was making a parts run,
but parts run for what?

436
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,083
It's not like
we've gotten any customers.

437
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:38,648
- Where do you think he went?
- I'm not sure.

438
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,093
I tried calling his cell,
but he didn't answer.

439
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:45,154
I'm worried he's out there looking
for Tokkan, and if he finds him...

440
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,363
I can't lose another brother.

441
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:51,511
Your brother needs to contact us
the moment he gets back.

442
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,244
And so that is why it is essential

443
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:00,713
that you carry them at all times.

444
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:03,820
Isn't that right, Mr. Walinski?

445
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:07,310
Mr. Walinski.

446
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,539
Mr. Walinski.

447
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,202
Essential. I got it.

448
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,657
- So insurance...
- Mandatory, Mr. Walinski,

449
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,004
mandatory.

450
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:26,051
What if you modified your car
for street racing?

451
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:27,947
Anyone familiar with

452
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:31,201
the California insurance
reference manual knows

453
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,017
that street racers
cannot be insured.

454
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,214
As a matter of fact, street racing
or any other negligent act

455
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,782
voids an insurance
policy altogether.

456
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,366
Yes, sir.

457
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,198
I hope those are notes,
Mr. Walinski.

458
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,709
Callen was right.
Rush didn't have a policy with Raydex.

459
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:56,739
In fact, as far as I can tell,

460
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:59,216
he didn't have a policy
with anyone outside the Navy.

461
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,509
What about the insurance agent
that we met?

462
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,858
Doesn't exist.
Raydex has no one by that name

463
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,878
and didn't have an agent
in the area yesterday.

464
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,866
Alvares' last known address
was bogus,

465
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:09,910
but his list of acquaintances
probably isn't.

466
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:12,197
- Who does Alvares trust?
- He was cell mate for a guy

467
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,566
for three years
by the name of Dwight Johnson.

468
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:16,371
Cell mates can get close
during their time

469
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:20,041
- if they don't kill each other first.
- Johnson has a place in Echo Park.

470
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,305
What about the case
against James' father?

471
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:25,009
Let's see,
the person Rush Sr. killed was...

472
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,841
homeless and nameless.
Body was never identified.

473
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,007
Making the chances
of this being payback slim.

474
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,345
I got him. I got him.

475
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:33,346
Alvares?

476
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,691
Tokkan's car. He just turned off
the 105 into El Segundo.

477
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:38,226
Kensi, separate cars.

478
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,853
Talk us in, don't lose him.

479
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,774
<i>Where is he?
I don't see him.</i>

480
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,152
He's right in front of you,
turning into the refinery.

481
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:48,663
He's accelerating.

482
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,572
I got him, but we've been made.

483
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,534
I'll try and get ahead of him.

484
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,255
Federal agents! Out of the vehicle!
Hands where I can see 'em now!

485
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:50,796
Now!

486
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:14,388
College student,

487
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,374
wealthy family, no record.

488
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:19,702
Allysia Takada.

489
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,677
AKA insurance agent.

490
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,451
Aka Tokkan.

491
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:26,440
Basically, you're just
a spoiled rich kid from Palos Verdes.

492
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:28,503
The secret identity
was all part of the game, right?

493
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:31,744
Except this isn't a game.

494
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,166
A man is dead.

495
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:39,916
Did the frustration of losing to James
Rush finally escalate to murder?

496
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,490
You wanted the title.

497
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:48,806
Top racer on the set.

498
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:51,484
Tokkan One. Lightning bolt, right?

499
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,377
Except James was faster,

500
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,836
so you, or one of your buddies,
you rigged his car and you killed him.

501
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:02,787
No, James and I were competitive,
but I didn't kill him.

502
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,001
I was in love with him.

503
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,923
<i>I was so happy
when James joined the Navy.</i>

504
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,966
He ever tell you
what he was working on?

505
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:19,181
Not really.

506
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,940
He liked
that it was top secret stuff.

507
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,226
He told me he had a trick up his sleeve
and challenged me to race him.

508
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,270
Was he the only one
who knew you were Tokkan?

509
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,531
Tokkan was James' idea.

510
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:32,433
None of the guys would race a woman.

511
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,360
You know guys and their egos.

512
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,405
If you loved him,
why didn't you stop when he crashed?

513
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,922
Because I knew he couldn't survive
something like that.

514
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,829
I just kept driving around
all night.

515
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,831
I didn't want to face
what had happened.

516
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,413
I didn't go back until the next day.

517
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,379
Did he have any enemies?

518
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,785
If anyone wanted to make sure
James didn't finish a race,

519
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,868
- it would be Stringer.
- Stringer.

520
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,751
Drives a pearl-black Chevelle.

521
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,726
He lost to James earlier
and was pretty pissed.

522
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:10,547
There was a lot of bad blood
between them.

523
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,148
You have a first name?

524
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:16,077
Nick Stringer, biker, car thief,
and all-around badass,

525
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,580
moves around the country,
city to city, stays long enough

526
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:21,407
to show up on the local law enforcement
radar before moving on.

527
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,330
When he's not racing,
he's either betting on races

528
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,967
or stealing cars to race.

529
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:30,117
Warrants read like a Zagat guide
to illegal street racing.

530
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,429
There, pearl-black Chevelle.

531
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,335
And there's Stringer.

532
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,122
Unfortunately, being at a race
isn't enough to charge him.

533
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:38,866
Who's he talking to?

534
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,968
Eric, step frame.

535
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,034
Now blow it up.

536
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:44,603
Right there.

537
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:46,523
The reflection.

538
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:51,594
Keith Rush?

539
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:01,667
Two on one, huh?

540
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:02,990
On the ground.

541
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,827
- On the ground.
- No, don't, don't shoot.

542
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:07,662
There's gasoline everywhere.

543
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,359
Don't do it. Don't be stupid.

544
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,341
Where's Angela?

545
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,363
She said she wouldn't come
to the garage anymore.

546
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,014
She is the one with the brains
in the family, isn't she?

547
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:28,739
So who are they?

548
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:32,478
- They work for a guy named Stringer.
- The guy you were with at the race?

549
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:36,065
Why didn't you tell us you were there
the night your brother got killed?

550
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:37,739
You're jealous of the golden boy

551
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,485
while you were stuck at home
with family?

552
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:42,113
Maybe you decided
to do something about it,

553
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:44,574
like maybe mess around
withhis engine.

554
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,048
No way, I was there
because I wanted to bet Stringer

555
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,705
that James would beat Tokkan.

556
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,138
It was a safe bet.

557
00:29:50,503 --> 00:29:52,081
James had the fix in.
He had this...

558
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,207
Naval battery?

559
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,683
He said it guaranteed him the win.

560
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,173
It didn't. It's what killed him,

561
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:03,288
that in combination
with his NOS system.

562
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:08,055
I was going to use the money
to help fix this garage up, but...

563
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:11,601
now I owe the bank and Stringer,
and I just don't have it.

564
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,311
How much you in for?

565
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:17,690
- $70 k.
- Where's the other battery?

566
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,026
I didn't know there was another one.

567
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:24,322
- I swear to God.
- Okay, your mechanic.

568
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,365
Where can we find Omar Alvares?

569
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,062
I don't know.

570
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:34,601
Omar runs with Los Locos Lowriders.

571
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:36,480
You find them, you'll find him.

572
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,714
I need a list of known hangouts
for Los Locos Lowriders.

573
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,893
You're approaching an intersection

574
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,115
where the traffic signals
are malfunctioning.

575
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:47,656
What will you do?

576
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,431
<i>Callen,</i>

577
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,023
<i>Sam and Kensi are going after
the Ratchetheads' mechanic Omar Alvares.</i>

578
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:56,020
- Mr. Walinski.
- All right, great, keep me posted.

579
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,898
For shame, Mr. Walinski, for shame.

580
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,942
Shouldn't he be wearing a seat belt?

581
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,432
<i>I hope this works.
It's possible we're too late.</i>

582
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,221
Omar Alvares?

583
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,102
Calm down.
Where you going?

584
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:38,077
Put your hands on the hood.

585
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,377
Federal agents. Stay back.
Don't get cute.

586
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,246
What you got in here, huh?

587
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,890
What is this?

588
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:02,085
That's a lot of cash
for an unemployed mechanic

589
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,630
who hasn't been paid in weeks.
Where's the naval battery?

590
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,091
I don't know
what you're talking about.

591
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,224
 Stay still.

592
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,331
Wha... what is that thing, huh?

593
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:22,169
How long do you think he's got?

594
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,317
I'd say no more than three hours.

595
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,219
I'm thinking closer to two.

596
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,405
Yeah, right, man.
Look, I want my lawyer, okay?

597
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,991
Buddy, if I were you,
I'd want my doctor.

598
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,935
You've got radiation sickness
from exposure

599
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,996
to an experimental
naval battery, Omar.

600
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,072
You know
what radiation sickness does?

601
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,450
Your hair falls out,
your skin blisters,

602
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,948
you bleed from every orifice.

603
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,961
Every orifice.

604
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,381
Okay, so y... you're going
to take me to the hospital?

605
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,801
Tell us where the naval battery is
and who sabotaged James Rush's car?

606
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,471
I think he's starting to sweat.

607
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,053
- Huh?
- Yeah.

608
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:56,602
It's hyperhydrosis.

609
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:59,249
- Wha... what do you mean?
- Your heart should be racing by now.

610
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,752
That's tachycardia setting in.
You feel it?

611
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:04,178
If we don't take him
to the hospital fast,

612
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,397
his tongue's going to swell up.
They'll have to intubate,

613
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,301
- he won't be able to talk.
- My tongue?

614
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:11,697
You gotta take me to the emergency room.
That's the law.

615
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:13,888
Seriously, guys,
look, I... I don't...

616
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,910
I don't know anything
about sabotaging James' car.

617
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:18,263
Look, I liked James, man.

618
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,653
Look, I worked for his family
for a long time.

619
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,208
Even when they couldn't pay me.

620
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,918
Is that why you stole the battery?

621
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,032
Come on, don't you think you owe it
to James to tell us where it is?

622
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,074
Look...

623
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:30,508
I sold it to this cat
named Stringer, okay.

624
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,052
Stringer's probably a ghost by now.

625
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,971
- With billions in naval technology.
- What about me, huh?

626
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,735
I got... I got radiation poisoning!
Come... come...

627
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,309
I need medical attention.

628
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,928
I'm going to give you two
of these, okay?

629
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:44,530
This'll help you.

630
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:51,862
All right. Better?

631
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:54,740
Man, these are breath mints.

632
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,743
Never underestimate
the importance of good oral hygiene.

633
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,014
- Let's go.
- Do I got radiation poisoning or not?

634
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:01,414
No. Make a path.

635
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:03,541
That's it. Time's up.

636
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:05,155
Pencils down.

637
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,230
All the way down, Mr. Walinski.

638
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:12,831
You'll be informed of your scores
via electronic mail.

639
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,487
And, hey.

640
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:16,805
Drive safely out here.

641
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,272
Well, that was fun.

642
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,670
No kidding.

643
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,525
Would you like
to grab a bite to eat?

644
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,712
Maybe a drink
to celebrate our graduation?

645
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:35,128
I could do that.

646
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,899
Definitely.

647
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,191
No, something just came up.

648
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:42,496
Tomorrow?

649
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:45,583
I'm on the red-eye tonight
for the Bahamas.

650
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,418
Nice. Vacation?

651
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,354
Swimsuit photo shoot.

652
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:54,425
Could be a vacation
if I had some company.

653
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,463
If he's smart, Stringer's moved on.

654
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:00,799
Maybe.

655
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:03,714
But he probably doesn't know
what that battery technology's worth.

656
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,233
If he does, he'll try to sell it
to the highest bidder.

657
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,499
Stringer's an adrenaline
addicted personality

658
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,767
who's got his hands on something
that'll give him the edge

659
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,234
over anyone he races against.

660
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:14,150
He won't be able to resist.

661
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,531
Trouble is, we don't know where the next
street race takes place.

662
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,158
We don't, but I believe

663
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,890
you know a certain female street racer
who can find out.

664
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:24,427
You're right.

665
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:27,274
Stringer contacted Tokkan.
He wants to race her tonight.

666
00:35:28,407 --> 00:35:29,752
Very little time to set up.

667
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,947
We're only going
to get one chance at this.

668
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:33,984
Then let's not screw it up.

669
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:37,927
Having said that, I've made some
adjustments to the Challenger.

670
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:39,220
My Challenger?

671
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:41,420
It may be your car, Sam,

672
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:43,724
but Uncle Sam pays the gas.

673
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,265
Anyway, it's... it's not...

674
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,354
state-of-the-art naval technology,

675
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,440
but it'll give it a little extra oomph,
if you need it.

676
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,403
My car...?

677
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:59,295
From what we've seen, Mr. Callen,

678
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,492
you don't seem to need any help.

679
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:03,828
I figured.

680
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:39,962
Federal Agent.

681
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:42,700
Nick Stringer,
get down on the ground, now.

682
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,122
I'd do what the lady says.

683
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,332
Everybody stay cool.
We're only here for Stringer.

684
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:53,836
Don't do it.

685
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,663
Don't.
Stop.

686
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:15,691
Clearly, this guy hasn't read
the California driving manual.

687
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,950
Failure to use a turn signal,

688
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,099
running a red light?
At least ten points.

689
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,412
I'm a little busy here, G.

690
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,172
- I thought you knew how to drive it.
- I should drop off some of the weight.

691
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:42,104
This guy's good.

692
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,552
He's good.

693
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,089
- We're better.
- We?

694
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,333
Come on, Hetty.
Show me what you got.

695
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,531
What did she do to this thing?

696
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:42,793
Down on the ground!

697
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:44,613
Don't move.

698
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:47,574
What the hell you got in that thing?

699
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,164
So far above your pay grade,
you wouldn't recognize the view.

700
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,741
How was your flight? Turn over.
Turn over!

701
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,608
Put your hands behind your back.

702
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,628
Get up.

703
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:01,880
Jackpot.

704
00:39:02,478 --> 00:39:03,732
We got the battery.

705
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,354
And there you have it.

706
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,244
Stringer copped to everything

707
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:15,042
except killing James Rush.

708
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:18,147
- No surprises there.
- I don't think it's him.

709
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:20,357
- Neither do I.
- Well, if it's not him,

710
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:22,570
it's not Keith, it's not Alvares...

711
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,653
who would want Rush dead?

712
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,006
Well, we must've missed an enemy.

713
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,658
Somebody else that didn't want him
on that track.

714
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:35,340
What do you got?

715
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:36,373
Just a hunch.

716
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:53,057
Thought
you weren't coming back here?

717
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,010
I had to get things
sorted out for Keith.

718
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:59,740
As it is, this place is going
to be a disaster by the end of the week.

719
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,732
I have to move on with my life.

720
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,574
Keith told me
that you caught Stringer.

721
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:05,646
Yeah.

722
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:09,482
Him and Alvares went after the battery.
They thought they could sell it.

723
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:12,170
But...

724
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,455
that doesn't explain
who wanted your brother dead.

725
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:18,385
And then it hit me.

726
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:22,544
It wasn't about
who wanted your brother dead.

727
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,883
It was about who wanted him
to stop racing.

728
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,976
We were looking for an enemy.

729
00:40:31,172 --> 00:40:33,275
But we should've been looking
for a loved one.

730
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:35,806
Someone he trusted.

731
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:39,344
Someone with easy access to his car.

732
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:43,941
Angela?

733
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:51,630
I just wanted it to end.

734
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:56,328
I wanted him to stop racing.

735
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,546
I disconnected his NOS injector

736
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,719
after he ran
his pre-race inspection.

737
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,965
It was just supposed to bleed out,
no harm done.

738
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,607
He didn't tell me
that he swapped out his battery system.

739
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,976
I was just trying to save him.

740
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:27,992
I was just trying...

741
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:41,498
Well, the Navy's relieved
to get their technology back.

742
00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:44,054
And they're not going
to pursue charges.

743
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,044
Good.
That family's suffered enough.

744
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:53,969
- Where you guys going?
- Nowhere.

745
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,721
You're taking out the Challenger?

746
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,391
Zero-to-60 before you can sneeze.

747
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,226
Take me with you
or I'm telling Hetty.

748
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:03,187
What is this, third grade?

749
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,025
- Okay.
- Yes!

750
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,357
But you're not driving.

751
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:13,280
Going somewhere?

752
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,032
- Boat shed.
- We got a lead.

753
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:19,620
We have a lead and we are
questioning him in the boat shed.

754
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:23,624
I hope you guys are
better liars out on the street.

755
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:24,927
Hetty,...

756
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,001
I'm offended.

757
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,400
Tough.

758
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:30,756
I've removed the supercharger
from the Challenger.

759
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:33,886
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, jeez, I wonder.

760
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,175
You want
to do something constructive,

761
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:38,444
take Mr. Callen out to a parking lot

762
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,349
and teach him how to drive.

763
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,893
All right, I happen
to be a great driver.

764
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,455
Not according
to your Traffic School.

765
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,067
They just called your alias.

766
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:48,106
You failed.

767
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:50,118
How could you fail traffic school?

768
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,167
What?

769
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,300
I was working on a case.

770
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:55,828
you need a note for your teacher?

771
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,721
I'd settle for a little appreciation,
okay?

772
00:42:57,763 --> 00:42:59,654
I passed up the Bahamas to be here.

773
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,982
I gotta get one of these.

774
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:23,925
