00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,544
<i>Permission to fire granted.</i>

4
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,698
That's a roger, stingray six.

5
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,931
- BFT has you cleared.
<i>- Target is confirmed,</i>

6
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:37,337
<i>you have authorization to fire.
Falling back.</i>

7
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,204
Hawkeye is firing...
In five...

8
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:43,134
Four... Three... Two...

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,273
One.

10
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,369
<i>Hawkeye, this is stingray six.
Confirm missile fired. Over.</i>

11
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,595
Stand by.

12
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,437
<i>Hawkeye,
we are getting a misfire alert.</i>

13
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:03,256
<i>Hawkeye, your drone
is veering off course.</i>

14
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:05,004
<i>Return to previous vector.</i>

15
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,151
<i>- Briggs, what the hell's happening?</i>
- Target coordinates are shifting.

16
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:11,029
Mike, get out of there.
I've now lost control of the drone.

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,826
<i>Hawkeye, we have radar confirmation
of missile fire. Please advise.</i>

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,411
Mike, the missile's live!
Get out of there!

19
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,922
.: Team UnderCovers :.

20
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:39,515
NCIS Los Angeles
1x03 [ Predator ]

21
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,018
So?

22
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:03,276
So?

23
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,901
I want to know.

24
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:08,274
You want to gossip at my expense.

25
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,047
Come on, how'd it go last night?
Date number two.

26
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:12,642
It didn't. Canceled.

27
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,047
- He canceled?
- I canceled.

28
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:17,955
It wouldn't have ended well.
It's pretty much over.

29
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:20,110
I thought the first date went great.

30
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:22,850
Look, you guys, I am the best
first date girl in town.

31
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,126
I mean, I bring
my "a" game... funny,

32
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,897
flirty, charming, spontaneous,

33
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,408
- tasteful.
- Like me.

34
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,653
- And the second?
- Second date: antsy, bored,

35
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,988
distant, impatient, irritable.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,948
Like G.

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,908
I decided to save
everybody some trouble,

38
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:42,245
end it early, and...
embrace my skill set.

39
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,683
- The first date's the last date.
- Absolutely.

40
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:47,334
Few men know how to deal

41
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,502
with a smart, strong,

42
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,212
independent woman.

43
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,844
They say they want
a soul mate to share their dreams

44
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:58,473
and their hopes with, but all
they really want is a substitute mommy.

45
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:01,180
As a professional psychologist,
I have to completely...

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,306
Nate, sit down.

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,396
I'm gonna sit.

48
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:06,561
Briefing?

49
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,188
Sexual harassment guidelines.

50
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,716
There's a seminar next week and...

51
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:16,040
it is mandatory,
even for you, Mr. Callen.

52
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,613
George hamilton once told me

53
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,744
that what men really love
is a woman who plays hard to get.

54
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,959
Or was it Sinatra?

55
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,535
- Saved by the whistle.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:42,388
All right, footage from Camp
Pendleton, tagged "classified."

57
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,516
- How old is this?
- Approximately 24 hours.

58
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,267
What are we looking at, exactly?

59
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,729
The battlefield through the eyes
of an unmanned aerial vehicle,

60
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,106
commonly referred to as a uav.

61
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,526
- Future of warfare.
- Field operatives in Pakistan

62
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,821
call in a target to a pilot sitting
behind a joystick in california.

63
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:02,118
Pilot hits a button,
rains missiles down on the bad guys.

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,659
Like a video game but real.

65
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,537
This feed is from a live-fire
training exercise at Pendleton.

66
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,656
A marine unit was working
in tandem with the drone.

67
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,917
This one was armed
with two Hellfire missiles.

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,003
- Who changed the target coordinates?
- Still trying to figure that out.

69
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,255
Here is the feed
from the missile's warhead camera.

70
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,276
The marine was killed.

71
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,054
Run it back. There.

72
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,522
Sergeant Michael Hazlett.

73
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,100
Specialized in coordinating
uavs with the ground teams.

74
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,937
- Married, three kids.
- Who was flying the drone?

75
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,230
Air Force Captain
Mark Holden Briggs.

76
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,077
Says he didn't misfire.

77
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,455
Drone fired itself.

78
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:39,987
I think we need to take
a look at that drone.

79
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:41,822
Good luck with that.

80
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,824
- It disappeared from radar.
- Crashed?

81
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,451
They can't find it.

82
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,571
So what killed sergeant Hazlett?

83
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:51,357
- Theory one: pilot error.
- Theory two: system malfunction.

84
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,416
Theory three: sabotage.

85
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,360
It was a joint op between
the marine corps and the air force.

86
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:59,600
Someone with security clearance
could narrow those choices.

87
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,566
Air force doesn't want us going
through their dirty laundry.

88
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:05,429
Logging that request means 50 pages
of fine print and a day's wait.

89
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,397
And we're sitting on our hands
while the trail runs cold.

90
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,487
Bureaucracy.

91
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,472
- It's all about who you know.
- We know anyone?

92
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:21,569
We know people.

93
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,032
The kind of people who know people.

94
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,498
- Hetty and Frank Sinatra?
- Don't go there.

95
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,843
He told her men like women
who play hard to get.

96
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,755
Which suggests that Hetty was playing
hard to get with Frank Sinatra.

97
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,797
- I told you not to go there.
- Yeah, you did.

98
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,386
Ol'blue eyes and Hetty.

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,350
- I guess hetty did it her way.
- Here he comes.

100
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:56,482
- What agency is this guy with?
- CIA, NSA, DOD.

101
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,355
Some say he's a black ops
handler for all three.

102
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:03,113
- But he's our guy.
- He's not our guy, he's Hetty's guy.

103
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,487
Gentlemen.

104
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,779
This conversation never happened.
You have 60 seconds.

105
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,456
How secure are these uavs?

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,792
Hackers are chasing the usaf
security protocols constantly.

107
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:20,921
Over the past month, we had four
experimental uavs breached domestically.

108
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,381
This has happened before?

109
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:25,259
No, every other time it happened,
the drones crashed within ten seconds.

110
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,947
Practice runs. Hackers are trying
to see if they can get the hang of it.

111
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,432
Your time is up.

112
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,687
Tell Hetty I haven't
forgotten about Nepal.

113
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:40,221
As far as I'm concerned,
we're even now.

114
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:46,072
Didn't seem like 60 seconds to me.

115
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,010
Bad cologne.

116
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,305
A copy of the uav's video feed
just popped up on sphereguide.com.

117
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,830
- Which is?
- Like Youtube for hackers.

118
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,498
Can you trace the IP address?

119
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,276
The poster's signal
wasounced off six different servers.

120
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,921
He doesn't want to be found,
but I'll get him.

121
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:05,260
Rewind it.

122
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,177
This is the feed
from the drone's camera.

123
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:09,461
Looks like it landed
in the desert somewhere.

124
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:12,352
Based on its last coordinates,
it's gotta be local.

125
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,183
So there was no crash.

126
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,091
How many Hellfire missiles
were on the drone?

127
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,021
Two.
It fired one.

128
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,259
And here comes our man.

129
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,157
What are you up to?

130
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,356
He powered it down.

131
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,157
Must've loaded
the drone in the back.

132
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:40,584
Who is this guy?

133
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,156
Proud new owner of
a hellfire missile.

134
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,589
And he's somewhere in L.A.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,933
I started a facial recognition
search on the driver.

136
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,021
No plates on it,
how we gonna trace him?

137
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,440
Kaleidoscope.

138
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,234
The R&D guys over at China
lake developed the algorithm.

139
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,728
What is it?

140
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,030
It's the naval weapons center's
brand-new visual query system.

141
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,531
You feed it the description
of a person, place, or thing...

142
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:15,258
It scans live feeds
from traffic cams,

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,955
ATM cams, and satellite
images for a result.

144
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,825
- You got to be kidding me.
- I kid you not.

145
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,695
All right, search terms:
blue 18-wheel semi

146
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:28,701
and... middle eastern man
in his 20s behind the wheel.

147
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,218
What if he isn't mobile anymore?

148
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:33,929
Then we wait. He'll have
to move the drone eventually.

149
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,249
What's to stop him from flying it
out of the country?

150
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,518
The uav's transponder.
It automatically activates on takeoff.

151
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,675
Once it's online, we can track it,
so he's not gonna risk it.

152
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:46,442
My guess is if we see it airborne again,
it'll probably be in targeting mode.

153
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,524
Every government and terrorist
group in the middle east

154
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,573
wants a piece of that technology.
He'll have no problem finding a buyer.

155
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:55,916
Alert Homeland Security.

156
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,515
We can't let this guy
get it out of the country.

157
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,956
How fast can we get
that footage off the web?

158
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:04,627
With or without the cooperation
of sphereguide.com's legal department?

159
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,089
Okay, cutting through legal tape.

160
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:14,374
I just crashed their entire server.

161
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,715
Idiot hackers!

162
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,643
I think we're due in the boathouse.

163
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,262
Walking.

164
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,483
- Eric did it.
- Hey, Hetty.

165
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,608
I was watching that viral video
with the cats and the trampoline,

166
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,908
and the site just froze up
and crashed on me.

167
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:39,662
Did you have anything
to do with that?

168
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,179
Gentlemen, our tale of the tape.

169
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,424
Captain Mark Holden Briggs,
32 years old,

170
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,177
earned valedictorian honors
from the air force academy

171
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,430
and graduated at the top one percent
of his class at usaf weapons school.

172
00:09:58,653 --> 00:09:59,753
Smart guy.

173
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,226
Also has a narcissist,
egocentric disorder.

174
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,645
Type of person who believes
the world revolves around him.

175
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,169
If he's guilty,

176
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,525
he'll have what he believes to be
perfectly good reasons for his actions.

177
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,527
Joystick jockey with an attitude.

178
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:14,113
Antagonizing him is not
a way to break through.

179
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,032
Do I look like an antagonist, Nate?

180
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,388
This is by no means
an admission of guilt,

181
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,161
but I want my jag lawyer present.

182
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,719
Maybe he'll get here eventually,
but traffic's a bitch today.

183
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,201
Mike Hazlett...

184
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,871
Mike Hazlett was a good man.

185
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:50,816
A friend.

186
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:53,464
I knew his wife, and his kids.

187
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,407
Friends don't always get along.

188
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:57,521
Check the paperwork.

189
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,826
We ran a full diagnostic.
There was no system failure.

190
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,745
I did not misfire.

191
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:04,913
- It's all documented.
- Then what happened?

192
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,444
A hacker got into the system.

193
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,567
It's experimental.

194
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,035
It's flawed.
And I knew it.

195
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,551
- And Mike knew it.
- Maybe you made a mistake.

196
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,304
Maybe that mistake
let a hacker in the system.

197
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,875
I don't program them, I fly them.

198
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,466
And I don't make mistakes.

199
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,813
Maybe you got paid to fly it
somewhere off the grid.

200
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:32,834
Paid?

201
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,692
Think I sold out?

202
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:40,044
I should be flying F-22's
over afghanistan right now

203
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:43,863
but I'm stuck in riverside,
rotting away in a steel box

204
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:47,498
next to joystick jockeys raised
on energy drinks and video games.

205
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,321
What happened yesterday
was inevitable.

206
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,668
Drones can get hacked.

207
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:54,838
Fighter pilots can't.

208
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,260
Now America's about
to find that out the hard way.

209
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,301
Everything that came out of Briggs'
mouth could be considered motive. But,

210
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,680
his body language is indicating
something else entirely.

211
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:11,563
Which is?

212
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,637
Well, he's frustrated and angry, but

213
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:15,651
Briggs is not our guy.

214
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,655
- What do you got, eric?
<i>- A hit.</i>

215
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:23,242
- Kaleidoscope?
<i>- No, that's still looking.</i>

216
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,213
We got a lead on our hacker.

217
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,288
He posted the uav attack footage
from the rathmor tech campus.

218
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,667
More specifically, the science
auditorium <i>at 10:23 a.m. Today.</i>

219
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:35,087
- You got a name?
-<i> We got 67 names.</i>

220
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,415
<i>That's how many students were logged
on to the wireless hub at the time.</i>

221
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:42,090
<i>All of them taking</i> a day-long class
in advanced computer science.

222
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:45,013
<i>They are on lunch break now.
They reconvene in about 90 minutes.</i>

223
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,930
They're scheduled to have
a guest speaker.

224
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,101
A reformed hacker
who now works for the FBI.

225
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,477
<i>What is the good news?</i>

226
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,686
<i>Well, the only people that can put
an actual face to the hacker's name</i>

227
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,484
<i>- work for the Bureau.</i>
- So we can improvise.

228
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,766
Eric, find out who posted
that video of the drone landing.

229
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,347
Ho, brah!

230
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:04,405
Excuse me?

231
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,326
It's... it's a surfer thing.

232
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:08,871
A surfer thing?

233
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,844
Yeah, as in a spontaneous
expression of ecstasy

234
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:15,183
that could accompany the perfect
swell, you know the kind that just...

235
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,379
You can hang up now.

236
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>Yeah, no, wait, facial recognition</i>
just ID'd our semi driver.

237
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,968
<i>DMV database.</i>

238
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>Yousef Kaleem.
No criminal record.</i>

239
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,099
<i>Home address in Venice, California.</i>

240
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,564
You went soft on him.

241
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,694
I know you're not gonna go
here with me right now.

242
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,864
We're in the middle of chasing
our only lead on our only suspect...

243
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,067
You know your ears wiggle
when you try to avoid a conversation?

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,765
It's kind of adorable.

245
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,796
For years I dreamed of being a seal.

246
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:01,006
I gave up everything else
to get there.

247
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,582
Everything.

248
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,079
If I saw the finish line
and found out that

249
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:09,014
the Navy was gonna bump me
somewhere else, I'd be angry, too.

250
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,560
And my ears don't wiggle.

251
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,198
So, what are we this time?
Couple of salesmen who got lost?

252
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,647
Maybe some guys looking
for an old college friend?

253
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,216
How about we're two armed federal
agents trying to apprehend a terrorist?

254
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,094
Do it.

255
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:48,786
Clear.

256
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:50,768
Clear.

257
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:05,904
"And allah will rain
the fire of the just

258
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,824
down on Zion and America,
the two satans,

259
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,916
crushing the infidels."

260
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,009
Just needs a little reggae beat.

261
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,555
Islamic discussion boards 24/7.

262
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,809
Get your hand out of the bag.

263
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,663
- This is not the way of Allah.
- What do you know about Allah?

264
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,697
Kaleem...

265
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:08,634
You quote the Koran in Arabic,
but you still do the work of infidels.

266
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:11,414
- We just want to talk.
- Nobody ever wanted to talk to me!

267
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,680
- We do, all right?!
- We just want to talk, I promise you!

268
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,812
- Put the satchel down.
- Allah...

269
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,643
Go! Run!

270
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,581
- What happened?
- Kaleem's dead.

271
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,294
How?

272
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,525
- Shot.
- Blown up.

273
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,206
You guys are thorough.

274
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:38,912
What are we doing now?

275
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,500
We focus on the hacker
who posted the uav footage.

276
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,323
Is that blood, Mr. Hanna?

277
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,755
- Mostly.
- Yours?

278
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,198
Other guy's.

279
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,760
- Can we bill him?
- Not anymore.

280
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,941
You wouldn't happen to have a fresh
pair of pants I can borrow?

281
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,082
Shirt?

282
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:01,992
What happened in Nepal?

283
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,222
Excuse me.

284
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:16,269
I told you to never
mention nepal, G.

285
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:17,786
You crazy?

286
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,058
I bet you it involved sherpas.

287
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,417
Sherpas?

288
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:31,392
Razor Mantis? As in the sexually
carnivorous insect?

289
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,852
As in the one
that has a mating ritual

290
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,684
which begins with the female
biting off the male's...

291
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,160
head?

292
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,143
Come on, this is what I get for
opening up to you about my dating life?

293
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,762
The real Razor Mantis was supposed
to speak at the rathmor tech class,

294
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:47,404
and we're improvising.

295
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,430
All right, fine, so,
what's my background?

296
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:54,030
FBI arrested you for stealing files
from the department of defense.

297
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,296
And you cut a deal
to avoid jail time in exchange

298
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:59,566
for teaching classes
about the perils of cyber crime.

299
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,414
And what if one of the students
checks up on my story?

300
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,499
Consider yourself backstopped.

301
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,534
As far as the legal
system is concerned,

302
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,991
you are the Razor Mantis.

303
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,467
Now, many of the students
are hackers themselves.

304
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,970
Now, they've heard of you,
but they don't know what you look like.

305
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:20,265
Hackers are feisty. So, they might
try to challenge your authority.

306
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,151
Which is what we want.

307
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:25,562
That's right. You want to elicit
a response. And I suspect

308
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,620
hubris will be his downfall.

309
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:30,148
In terms of your computer skills,
you might be a little

310
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,177
out of your league
with these rathmor tech kids.

311
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,177
I have proficiencies
in IPsec architecture,

312
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:37,284
Kerberos,
and Plutoplus with the FBI.

313
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,897
These kids...
invented that stuff, so...

314
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,192
These guys have spent more time

315
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:45,142
with their World of Warcraft avatars

316
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:47,876
than real women
who aren't called "Mom."

317
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,172
Just in case.

318
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,516
Great.

319
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,967
Because there's nothing I love more
than falling back on my sexuality

320
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,555
to get the job done.

321
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,802
And those shoes
are crocodile stilettos.

322
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:09,453
You scuff them,
tear them, lose them...

323
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,318
and I'll end you, Tootsie.

324
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,957
Checked out kaleem's house.
Found a weapon stash.

325
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,451
Two handguns, a semi-automatic
rifle and three grenades.

326
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,001
Nate says he's more
of a follower than a leader.

327
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:26,790
- What else?
- He used to work for a tech company.

328
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,606
AJ Concept Solutions.

329
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:32,295
It was started up just over a year ago
by a man named Arthur Janson.

330
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,465
- I'm gonna need to meet him.
- I'll track him down for you.

331
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,865
Geez, these jeans are too tight.

332
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,753
Told you not to mention Nepal.

333
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,807
Okay, everyone,
take your seats, please.

334
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:50,396
As you might have
heard from Dr. Knorr,

335
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,025
I'm going to be your guest lecturer
for this afternoon's session.

336
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,366
When I was arrested
by the FBI, I was known as

337
00:19:58,658 --> 00:19:59,906
the Razor Mantis.

338
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,560
For eight years...

339
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,927
Once they've logged on,
you can scan their hard drives?

340
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,831
I'll just be throwing up additional
data on the touch screen.

341
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,125
You'll be picking out
anyone suspicious.

342
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,442
- That'll be most of them.
- And we're off.

343
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,015
Predictably, each student just ran
a search for the Razor Mantis.

344
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:18,515
And check this out...

345
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,455
Today, we'll be
discussing the overlap

346
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:24,272
of our domestic cyber crime
community with terrorism abroad.

347
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:25,469
Question?

348
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,059
Do you think the slave-generated
data bots out of Silicon Valley

349
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,845
are vulnerable
to sigma seven ov errides?

350
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,900
That is an excellent question.

351
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>Kensi, there could be two answers.</i>

352
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,987
Hold on, there could be two answers.

353
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,215
I just said that!

354
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,788
There could be two answers
to that question.

355
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,008
That's why I asked you your opinion.

356
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>- What he's asking makes no sense.
- That's because it's a trick question.</i>

357
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,448
<i>Sigma seven overrides are incompatible
with slave-generated data bots</i>

358
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,752
<i>because those bots can't exist
on single-tuned harmonic filters.</i>

359
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,763
Those data bots can't exist
on a single-tuned harmonic filter.

360
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,428
Anyone else want to try
and stump me with a trick question?

361
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,181
All right, 50 hard drives
scanned and downloaded.

362
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:07,838
We're almost there.

363
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,395
What's the difference between string
system code and mvo-6 languages?

364
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:14,356
Really?
You want to go there?

365
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,484
Kensi, ignore him.

366
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,036
<i>Just look down at your laptop
and hit some keys.</i>

367
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,511
<i>Tell him that you'll answer
once</i> the guy to his left

368
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,616
stops messaging him
about your bra size.

369
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:27,136
I will consider
answering your question

370
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:30,591
once the guy to your left stops
IM'ing you about my bra size.

371
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,196
This is what we want.

372
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:38,691
A few guys are getting paranoid
and logging off the network.

373
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,131
We call eliciting a reaction.

374
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:42,954
I'm sending you their names
and search results.

375
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:46,267
We've got an outlier.
Joel Hardy.

376
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,933
On financial aid. Low-income family
but he's made some big purchases.

377
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,980
A 2009 Ducati.

378
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:55,407
I see a trip to Vegas, and...

379
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,592
$20,000 in computer hardware.

380
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:02,320
This could be our hacker.
<i>To your left, seventh row up, end seat.</i>

381
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,782
<i>- He's fidgeting.</i>
- Doesn't want to make eye contact.

382
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,633
Yeah, he's hiding something.

383
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:09,869
Trying to play it cool.

384
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:17,919
All right, Kensi, here comes
your excuse to follow him.

385
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:23,466
Excuse me, I have to take this call.
Let's take a ten-minute break.

386
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:28,864
Someone higher up
financed his spending spree.

387
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,567
He can lead us there.

388
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:34,394
Eric, tell me about this guy.

389
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:38,898
Old parking tickets, bad habits,
friends, taste in music, anything.

390
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,818
He shut down his laptop
before I could mine anything relevant.

391
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,529
- Gotta go in cold.
- Just act like it's the first date.

392
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,619
- Do you have a minute?
- No.

393
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,555
<i>And shouldn't you be
finishing up your lecture?</i>

394
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:57,024
Shouldn't you be staying to hear it?

395
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,401
- I've got a thing.
- A thing?

396
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,828
Somewhere to be.

397
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,466
Oh, I see.

398
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,596
Well, I'm sorry I bothered you.
Have fun at your "thing."

399
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,438
Wait!

400
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,769
- Wait!
- What's she doing?

401
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,520
She's playing hard to get.

402
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,652
What'd you want to ask me?

403
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,908
I'm... stuck in town for the night.

404
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:31,201
Bummer...

405
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,746
Do you know where
I could get a drink... Or five?

406
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,499
Depends.
You want company?

407
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:43,124
I go.

408
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,402
Arthur Janson?

409
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,899
You must be the gentlemen
my secretary mentioned.

410
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,179
- What can I do for you?
- Yousef Kaleem is dead.

411
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:53,616
He was your employee.

412
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:57,352
- You mind telling us about him?
- I'm afraid I don't know that much.

413
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,377
He worked here for over a year.

414
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:04,390
Kaleem was a business associate.

415
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:07,664
You in a rush, Mr. Janson?

416
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:10,108
I don't get close
to people on the job.

417
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:12,659
No, trust me.

418
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,142
You open that door up,
you're asking for a needy, whiny,

419
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:19,040
- slacker of a colleague.
- I know exactly what you mean.

420
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
Any details will help.

421
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,534
I hired kaleem because he was
skilled at writing computer code.

422
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,408
You know, come to think of it,

423
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,135
Lately he's been spouting off
about politics and religion on the job.

424
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,919
Real crazy, venomous
anti- american stuff.

425
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,487
Why didn't you just fire him?

426
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,165
The equal opportunity act
makes it illegal for me to fire him

427
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,726
based on his religious views.

428
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:43,481
I was amused that he hated the country
that kept him gainfully employed.

429
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,110
That's one of my big
complaints with Mujahadeen.

430
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:48,695
No sense of irony.

431
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,899
Unfortunately, the same
could be said for my clients.

432
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,370
If you'll excuse me.

433
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:07,589
I don't whine, I'm not needy,
and I don't slack.

434
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:11,009
Two out of three ain't bad.

435
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:22,795
Any luck with the semi?
And finding the drone?

436
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,701
Kaleidoscope's still looking.

437
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:33,924
You're the kind
that thinks that pressing

438
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,626
the elevator button
over and over again

439
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,869
makes it get there
more quickly, aren't you?

440
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,332
I like the way you party.

441
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,130
It's only money, right?

442
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:58,463
And you very clearly
know how to spend it.

443
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,300
Well, let's just say I know the right
people, and leave it at that.

444
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:05,688
The right people,
I know all about them.

445
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,857
I've done favors
for half of Silicon Valley.

446
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,764
The other half pays
me for protection.

447
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:10,893
<i>You dig that?</i>

448
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,906
Running network protection schemes
on yuppies chasing stock options?

449
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:17,825
Well, it beats working
for a living, doesn't it?

450
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,287
Call it money. Don't call it living.

451
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,533
And what's living to a guy like you?

452
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,003
By passing military-grade
quantum cryptography.

453
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:31,611
<i>And?</i>

454
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:39,580
A guy's gotta save something
for a second date, right?

455
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,836
- I'll be back.
- All right.

456
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,320
Dom, keep an eye on him.

457
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,393
You look like a man on a mission.

458
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,612
Maybe later.

459
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:28,813
<i>Everything okay in there?</i>

460
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,662
<i>Dom, are you there?</i>

461
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,555
This is security cam footage
Eric pulled from the bar.

462
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:53,876
Joel Hardy walked in that bathroom
less than 30 seconds ago.

463
00:27:58,486 --> 00:27:59,556
Rewind it.

464
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:02,055
Now hold on that guy that comes
out just before dom goes in.

465
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:13,024
- I walked right past him.
- Don't let it bother you, Dom.

466
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,080
There's no way you could've
known who he was.

467
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:17,487
Well, the bad news is,
our only lead in this case is dead.

468
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,131
Good news is, you're off the hook
for date number two.

469
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:25,119
Sure, hope on the Kensi abuse train
while there's still room on board.

470
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:28,122
There. That's him.

471
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,468
Run him through
the facial recognition.

472
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:00,015
You're not responsible
for this, Dom.

473
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:03,741
You did your job.

474
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,536
And when doing my job isn't enough?

475
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,748
You come and see me,
and we talk about it.

476
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,628
Thanks.

477
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,649
I'm ready to go back to work now.

478
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,503
- Thanks, Rose.
<i>- Okay.</i>

479
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,585
- Let me know if anyone does.
<i>- Oh, I will.</i>

480
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:37,259
- I'll tell l nate you say hi.
<i>- Yeah, he has a thing about coroners.</i>

481
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,043
- News?
- No.

482
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:48,133
No one has claimed
Kaleem's body yet.

483
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:50,045
Or... What's left of it.

484
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:53,281
Extremist views tend to estrange one

485
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,320
from one's friends and family.

486
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:57,879
I hope the 72 virgins were worth it.

487
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:00,548
How's the team holding up?

488
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:07,302
Two bodies in one day.
It's a lot for anyone to handle.

489
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:10,016
That's to be expected.

490
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:14,328
It's when they stop being affected
that I begin to worry.

491
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:19,275
Well, they've got a ways
to go before they get to that point.

492
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:24,280
That's good to know.

493
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,764
Wake up, sweetheart.

494
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:44,000
Found this
in Joel Hardy's apartment.

495
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,385
Good enough to fly a AUV, Dom?

496
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:48,679
With the right software
and uplinks, yeah.

497
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,017
It needs to be hooked up
to a computer, though.

498
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,604
It's with Eric. He's trying
to crack the encryption.

499
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:55,776
Let's look at connections.

500
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,064
Starting with Youssef Kaleem.

501
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,815
Kaleem was the perfect fall guy.

502
00:31:01,857 --> 00:31:04,983
Anti-american views, strong
religious beliefs, and...

503
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:07,579
weak enough for someone to convince
him to take on the high-risk work

504
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:09,834
of snatching the UAV
from its landing site.

505
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,115
Joel Hardy.

506
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,317
A whiz kid who could beat
the air force at their own game.

507
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,902
But he was immature.

508
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,762
Spent his money carelessly,

509
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:21,629
he did drugs, and was reckless
enough to post the UAV footage online.

510
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:24,715
Which is probably
what got him killed.

511
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,676
Which means he's not the ringleader.

512
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:30,388
- Captain Briggs, our pilot.
- The wild card in the deck.

513
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:33,302
Well, he's got an axe
to grind with the drone program

514
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:36,066
and the brain to pull off
a conspiracy like this, but...

515
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:37,994
He's not acting like a guilty man.

516
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,023
- Ho, brah! Score!
- What was that?

517
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:43,276
It's Eric. He caught a break.

518
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,202
I just breached Joel Hardy's laptop.

519
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:48,781
Level seven nokVAULT software
with a triple encryption code.

520
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,204
I found a program that would
enable the user to penetrate

521
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,662
the kind of quantum
encryption used by the Air Force.

522
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:56,182
Joel sent it...

523
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:58,329
to AJ Concept Solutions.

524
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,842
We got a hit.
Hamzi Khan, Afghani.

525
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,587
Former beat cop in Kabul.
Retired in '03.

526
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,132
Not the first guy
I'd hire for a hit in L.A.

527
00:32:13,174 --> 00:32:17,026
His wife died in Afghanistan
in 2007. Rifqua Khan.

528
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,769
She was the victim of a UAV attack.

529
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,932
A missile blew up the school
where she was a teacher.

530
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,005
She and eight children were killed.

531
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,702
Pulling up her photo now.

532
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,704
She's not an ethnic afghani.

533
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:33,620
Rifqua is arabic for Rebecca.

534
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,828
Janson has a sister named rebecca.

535
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,917
So, a Predator killed
Janson's sister

536
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:43,711
who happens to be married to Khan.

537
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:47,256
And now they want to give
America a taste of drone warfare.

538
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:50,901
Yeah, Eric?

539
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:53,597
Thanks.

540
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,223
Kaleidoscope just
picked up our 18-wheeler.

541
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,850
Pulled out of a warehouse downtown.

542
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,859
He's headed south.

543
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,737
His route lines up
with the port of L.A.

544
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,822
- Show your hands!
- Over your head!

545
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,423
Put 'em up!
Get out of the truck!

546
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:26,654
Get out!

547
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,676
Please. I-i...
I was just doing my job.

548
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:30,633
Face down.
Down on the ground!

549
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,176
I got him.

550
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,887
Some guys just need
this truck dropped off at the port.

551
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:36,138
Don't move.

552
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:43,646
- This guy?
- Yeah... Yeah, that's him.

553
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,249
Face down.

554
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:55,731
We've been had.

555
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,202
- Yeah?
<i>- We've got a situation here.</i>

556
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,653
Janson wasn't trying to move
the drone out of the country.

557
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,254
He wanted it airborne.

558
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:04,709
Transponder just went online.

559
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,293
Where's it headed?

560
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:09,594
It's circling Los Angeles.

561
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:21,021
I tapped into the LAX
air traffic control system,

562
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:25,064
and it shows an unidentified aircraft
circling Marina Del Rey at 10,000 feet.

563
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,381
- What are our options?
- We could crash

564
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,692
- the satellite drone server.
- Sounds like a good idea.

565
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:32,236
Every UAV around
the world would go haywire.

566
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,155
Dozens of missions
would be compromised.

567
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,128
None of which is
as important as preventing

568
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,742
a terrorist attack on american soil.

569
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,479
It's not gonna work.

570
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:45,555
Janson installed his own server
overrides. He knows what he's doing.

571
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,426
Bypassing them will take hours.

572
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:49,628
And how long would it take
to scramble an F22?

573
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,201
Including flying time...
20 minutes, tops.

574
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,509
It's too long. Eric, find Janson.

575
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,512
I told you guys everything I know.

576
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,190
Your UAV is airborne.

577
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:13,152
Where?

578
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,490
Up there. Somewhere circling.

579
00:35:17,568 --> 00:35:20,159
We think the guy who hijacked
it is gonna use it.

580
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,881
Nobody listened to me.

581
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:24,701
You see?

582
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,917
You see what happens when
you replace men with computer systems?

583
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:34,256
Eric triangulated the UAV's
signal to this location.

584
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,717
Janson's got to be
around here somewhere.

585
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:57,644
Joystick. Throttle.

586
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,992
This was used to get
control of your UAV.

587
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,621
We're going to hack
into the system...

588
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,165
and get it back.

589
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:12,145
I watched a friend die.

590
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,506
I couldn't help him.
I can't do that again.

591
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,667
Last night...

592
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,773
I watched a kid bleed out
on the floor of a bathroom...

593
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,696
because I couldn't get
there in time to save him.

594
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:44,246
There's nothing
I can do to fix that.

595
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,747
I don't get a second chance.

596
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,123
But you do.

597
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,721
Sometimes our best
isn't good enough.

598
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:05,814
True.

599
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:11,020
But that's no reason
to give anything less.

600
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,856
All right, I've gotten
to Janson's network firewall.

601
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,475
I just need to bypass...

602
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,188
Sam, I'm in.

603
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:24,742
I've got his targeting information.

604
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:28,537
Holy crap.
William f. Cooley high school.

605
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,805
Eric, get that school evacuated now!

606
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,339
- Calling LAPD.
- Not fast enough!

607
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,870
Got it. Now commencing
with fast enough.

608
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,353
I need specifics, Eric. Anything
that might give Janson away.

609
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,809
If he's controlling the drone,

610
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:56,315
he's going to need a satellite
dish or antenna array.

611
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:09,328
<i>- Sam, I found it.</i>
- Where?

612
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:11,263
<i>Janson is on a yacht called Rebecca.</i>

613
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:12,164
Let's go.

614
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:14,465
It's docked in slip number 15.

615
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,150
How you doing?

616
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:21,500
Unbelievable. Is this a Lungelli?

617
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,298
- This is a private vessel.
- What do you think this is, 35 meters,

618
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,495
maybe 40?

619
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,208
You know, I bet you
this is actually 40.

620
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,934
Composite hull.
This is unbelievable!

621
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,686
- Get back.
- It's beautiful.

622
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,108
- Hostile down. Slip 15.
<i>- I'm on the way.</i>

623
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,420
This is a long shot,
this gear has all sorts of bugs.

624
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:55,648
Isn't working.
It's not responding.

625
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,777
<i>I'm out of time.</i>
I can't hack the drone.

626
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:02,139
If you can't hack the drone,
can you hack the missile instead?

627
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:21,983
Don't do it.

628
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,358
You're too late.

629
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,787
Come on!

630
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:37,666
I got it...

631
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:48,784
You guys got a place
you want to ditch this missile?

632
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,054
I believe we do.

633
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,070
Thanks.

634
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:20,311
Good night, Hetty.

635
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,987
That Nepal story was crazy.

636
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:24,671
You told Sam?

637
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:44,978
- She didn't really tell you, did she?
- Sorry, G. It's classified.

638
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:49,822
Chinese take-out and a glass
of red wine never looked so good.

639
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,816
I thought you had a date
with that guy tonight,

640
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:53,829
- the one who...
- Canceled on him.

641
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,913
<i>- Hey, Kensi, is Dom there?</i>
- Yeah, he's here.

642
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:01,098
It's Nate.
You still want to talk to him?

643
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,421
I'm good.

644
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:07,554
He's good.

645
