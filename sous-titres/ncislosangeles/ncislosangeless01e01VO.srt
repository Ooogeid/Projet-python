00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,980
<i>Looking to the 101 eastbound,</i>

2
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:10,401
<i>traffic is moving slow, starting
to slow down around white oaks.</i>

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,477
<i>Officer vehicle northbound on 101.</i>

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,979
<i>Dark blue Tahoe 6A18 is code three.</i>

5
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,599
<i>Requesting back up.</i>

6
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,938
<i>DMV tag is 5 Zebra</i>

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,183
<i>N for nora, 197.</i>

8
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,276
<i>Two suspects in vehicle
fleeing traffic stop.</i>

9
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:29,821
<i>6827 responding, code three.
Secondary. We're 6818.</i>

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>Vehicle now heading
west on Mulholland.</i>

11
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:46,801
Pull up right behind him.

12
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:52,926
Out of the car!

13
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,768
Out of the car!

14
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,686
Driver, show me your hands!

15
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,309
Out of the car!

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,900
- Your hands, get them up!
- Show me your hands!

17
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:04,517
Passenger, get out of the car.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,482
Put 'em up!
Get 'em up!

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,122
Passenger, get down on the...

20
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,054
weapon!

21
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,238
Get him, Pablo!

22
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,766
All right, let's step in.

23
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,579
Secure the vehicle!

24
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,867
Secured!

25
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:13,564
Stay with me, G.
Don't do this to me. Come on!

26
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,384
Come on, buddy.

27
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:54,927
Here you go.

28
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:56,268
Fat free?

29
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,070
So...

30
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,287
What is it this time, G?

31
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,851
- Cold showers, bed bugs, fenghui?
- Too noisy.

32
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:08,242
Last place was too quiet.
The place before that was too hot.

33
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:11,435
No, no, no. That place was too cold.
The place before that was too hot.

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,476
You sure you're ready to come back?

35
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:18,049
What, are you
my mother or something?

36
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:20,203
You could use one.

37
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,551
Yeah.
I got you.

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,160
Thank you.

39
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,725
- It's a new office, huh?
- Yep.

40
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,515
- What's it like?
- Noisy.

41
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:49,437
Three months and the neighbors
still don't know we're here.

42
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:52,647
Hiding in plainsight.

43
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,818
What was it before we got it?

44
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,053
Old water plant
administration building.

45
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,576
Condemned after
the northridge quake.

46
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:05,077
- Condemned?
- Only on the outside, G.

47
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:17,356
Coming through!

48
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,357
Just put it on my desk.

49
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:28,267
Voilà.

50
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:32,992
Got to go see you know who.

51
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,498
Hetty, I gave you the receipts.

52
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:54,634
If every agent came back
from an undercover assignment

53
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,522
with expenses unaccounted for,
Mr. Hanna,

54
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,217
I'd be either out of
a job or out of pocket.

55
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,135
I don't intend to be either.

56
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,577
- What are we down to?
- 15, 20 bucks?

57
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,034
$61. And a nickel.

58
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,024
You're a fantastic
operations manager, Hetty.

59
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,691
All right.
I got you.

60
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,027
$20.
Yeah.

61
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,360
$40. $60.

62
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,613
Okay?
Thank you.

63
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:26,901
- I'll spot you the nickel.
- Thank you. I'm good for it.

64
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:30,723
Mr. Callen.

65
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,666
You're not due back for a month.

66
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,880
I missed your sunny smile, Hetty.

67
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,964
We need to update your biometrics.

68
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,300
New photos for drivers licenses,
passports,

69
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,632
general backstopping...
Not to speak of documents,

70
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:49,457
credit cards and so forth,
and, um...

71
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,056
Wardrobe.

72
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,189
Problems with the neighbors?

73
00:05:58,557 --> 00:05:59,933
Something like that.

74
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:04,846
Well, don't even think
about unrolling...

75
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:06,888
that disgusting thing in here.

76
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,772
- I think she's mellowed.
- I think I'm in love.

77
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,167
Who's that?

78
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,048
It's a new guy started this week.
Green.

79
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,960
- That's his name?
- Nope.

80
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:27,326
Heads up!

81
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,309
Director's coming online.

82
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:32,051
Hey, Callen.
Eric.

83
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:35,436
Well, it's about time.

84
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,408
- Kensi.
- Hello.

85
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,589
My favorite agent.

86
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,325
Oh, I thought you'd callously
abandoned us to join the FBI.

87
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,987
Uh, once was enough.

88
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:45,209
You still making the weekend
drive up to Pendleton?

89
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,947
Of course.
Home away from home.

90
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,034
Well, that's what you get
for growing up a marine brat.

91
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,592
- Get a note from your doctor?
- You're my doctor, Nate.

92
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:55,159
Yeah, I just get to play around
inside your head, though.

93
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,929
How's the rest of you?
Aches? Pains? Insomnia?

94
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,080
Yeah, all of them.

95
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,905
- Before I was shot.
- Hi. Dominic.

96
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,267
Callen.
Nice to meet you, Dom.

97
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:21,910
<i>Agent Callen.</i>

98
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,759
<i>I didn't think you were due back
from sick leave till next month.</i>

99
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,430
I guess you didn't get the email.

100
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>I guess you haven't sent it yet.</i>

101
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,201
<i>Your case is still active, Callen.</i>

102
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,836
<i>- We will find them.</i>
- Yes, sir.

103
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,486
We will.

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,957
<i>Here's the reason I'm calling.</i>

105
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:41,970
<i>It's commander Frank Mcguire.
Works the office of naval intelligence.</i>

106
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>Or did, until two hours ago.</i>

107
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:47,967
<i>He was kidnapped and subsequently
killed in a shootout with lapd.</i>

108
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,887
<i>Routine traffic stop, his kidnappers
sped off, lapd went after them.</i>

109
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:55,391
<i>- Mcguire got caught in the crossfire.</i>
- What do we know about the kidnappers?

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,352
<i>Mexican nationals.
That's what's got us worried.</i>

111
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:02,022
<i>In less than 12 hours, there's going
to be a coordinated military operation</i>

112
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,151
<i>on both sides of the mexican
border against the drug cartels.</i>

113
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>Operation Dakota.</i>

114
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,363
<i>Mcguire had detailed
knowledge of this plan.</i>

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,124
<i>We need to find out if
it's been compromised.</i>

116
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,142
<i>Files' on its way, Eric.</i>

117
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,252
<i>Keep me in the loop.</i>

118
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,967
Footage, Eric.

119
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:28,821
Eric, slide it back.

120
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,985
Hold it.
Dom?

121
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,554
What do you see?

122
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,222
The second guy's been hit and he's
trying to get back in the SUV.

123
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:42,354
Okay. Why?

124
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:44,509
Cover?

125
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:46,966
Zoom and enhance, Eric.

126
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,280
Passenger side window just exploded.

127
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,581
Yeah, but that's not a surprise.
Lots of incoming from the lapd.

128
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:55,534
Tighter, Eric.

129
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,257
Advance three frames.

130
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,670
The window's blowing into the car,
not out. Kidnapper fired the shot.

131
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,256
Mcguire wasn't killed
in the crossfire.

132
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,550
He was executed.

133
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:23,229
Okay, so you're a bad guy.
You're surrounded by LAPD.

134
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,740
You've seen the movies.
You're going to shoot your way out.

135
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:29,069
Only your buddy takes one in the chest
and he's dead before he hits the ground.

136
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,013
- I think I've seen that movie.
- Now the cops are blamming away.

137
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:34,406
Six cops, squeezinglks.

138
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,475
That's a lead storm that's
coming right at you.

139
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,755
Definitely ain't no movie.

140
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,881
- What do you do?
- Al Pacino was in it.

141
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:42,436
Might have been DeNiro.

142
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,903
You pee your pants. You drop
your weapon, you kiss the pavement.

143
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,031
Okay?

144
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,577
At least that's what I'd do.

145
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:55,396
Instead, I go back to the car,
execute the hostage,

146
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,004
and die doing it.

147
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,550
Now, why would you sacrifice
yourself to kill your hostage?

148
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,386
So he couldn't reveal
what you were up to?

149
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,983
Mcguire lives at 1041,
apartment one.

150
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,146
What are we?

151
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,068
- If anyone asks?
- We're city inspectors.

152
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,844
No. Nobody talks to city inspectors.

153
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:15,307
You're a realtor. I'm your client.
You're showing me an apartment.

154
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,238
- Do I look like a realtor?
- Okay, I'm the realtor.

155
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,671
You're the guy looking
for the apartment. Okay?

156
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:23,585
- Can we go?
- Would I live in place like this?

157
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,315
I mean, I don't even know if
I could afford a place like this.

158
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:28,555
Well, that's why i'm showing you.

159
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:31,635
To see if, you know, you would
want to live in a place like this.

160
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,932
Does it have a jacuzzi? If it has,
I'm going to drown you in it.

161
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:49,916
<i>Hi. This is Frank McGuire. Sorry
I can't take your call right now.</i>

162
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,562
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get right back with you.</i>

163
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:06,935
Clear.

164
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,029
Clear.

165
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,533
<i>Message bank deleted.</i>

166
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,464
Looks like someone didn't want
us to hear Mcguire's messages.

167
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,010
Eric?
I need you to check a call.

168
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,918
I'll run a check on Mcguire's phone log,
see what we turn up.

169
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:24,467
Mcguire graduated top 1%
from the naval academy.

170
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,233
Look at this. Stellar career.

171
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,287
Specialized in
satellite image analysis

172
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,613
and spent time in
the San Nicolas navy base.

173
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:34,568
- Where is that?
- 75 miles off the coast of L.A.

174
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,404
It was discovered by spanish
explorer Sebastian Vizcaino.

175
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:40,487
He actually charted
the entire california coast.

176
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,359
And his ship was called
the San Diego, which is where

177
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,266
the bay gets its name, of course.

178
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,540
I think it was back in... 1602?

179
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,381
- I read a lot.
- Reading's good.

180
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:04,978
Found this on the coffee table.

181
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,542
Like it mattered.

182
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,315
"Emma fleet week san diego."

183
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,168
Mcguire wasn't married.

184
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:18,471
His birthday was two month ago.

185
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,349
How long do you leave
birthday cards on display?

186
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,112
I don't know.
I never got one.

187
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,839
You've never gotten
a single birthday card?

188
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:26,622
Nope.

189
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,726
What? It's not a big deal.

190
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,100
I'm definitely getting you
a birthday card this year.

191
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,380
Great. You make sure
you put some money in it.

192
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,764
How about I put a personality in it?

193
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,630
"Happy birthday to my favorite uncle.
Love, Emma."

194
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:46,707
Mystery solved.

195
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,301
Mystery solved.

196
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,980
No signs of struggle. Dead bolts
on all the windows and doors.

197
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,422
Must have snatched
him off the street.

198
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,787
Laptop's encrypted.
It's a job for Eric.

199
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:06,862
For a career navy guy, commander
Mcguire wasn't very squared away.

200
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,868
Unless he had something
else on his mind.

201
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,092
No jacuzzi.

202
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,787
- Deal breaker?
- Afraid so.

203
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,018
There goes my commission.

204
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,132
Gardner included in the lease?

205
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,003
It is.

206
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,166
Very safe.

207
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,984
This navy guy... I looked
at his apartment, and...

208
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,154
He was kidnapped, murdered.

209
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,373
Did you know him?

210
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,166
Oh, every day he waves.

211
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,415
I saw him this morning.
He's dead?

212
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:10,079
And already his
apartment's available.

213
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,543
Unbelievable.

214
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:17,970
You might have been
the last person to see him alive.

215
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,590
No, he was with his friends.

216
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,696
What if they were
the ones that kidnapped him?

217
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:23,327
No, no, they were his friends.

218
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:26,020
They've been here before.
I see their car...

219
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:28,075
- The blue tahoe.
- Blue tahoe? When?

220
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,652
Every day this week.

221
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:07,624
- Did you get the plates?
- No, he was clean.

222
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,181
Turns out it wasn't Mcguire's
first trip in the tahoe.

223
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:14,138
He knew them. They picked him up

224
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,769
every morning this week,
dropped him off three hours later.

225
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,320
Sound like a kidnapping to you, Sam?

226
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,641
It looks like a kidnapping,
but it's not.

227
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:32,138
- So why the hood and the nylon ties?
- They don't want him to see

228
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,683
where they're taking him, so they tie
his hands so he's not tempted

229
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,949
to lifthe hood and peek.

230
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,935
It's common practice
in the middle east.

231
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,285
I've used the technique
a few times myself.

232
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:46,122
Now, Mcguire used to get
to the office around 8:30

233
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,779
give or take five or ten minutes.

234
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,476
But, as you can see,
he was late every day this week.

235
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,666
The gardener said
they picked him up at 7:30.

236
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,730
And three hours later they drop him
back at home and then he goes to work.

237
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,414
A lot you can do in three hours.

238
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,035
Especially if you have
top-secret security clearance.

239
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,706
How much time do we have?

240
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,757
Operation Dakota
against the drug cartels

241
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,997
kicks off in seven
hours and 33 minutes.

242
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,968
What about the call to Mcguire's
apartment to erase his voice mail?

243
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,867
I'm on it.

244
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,892
- Finances?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

245
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,538
- Travel?
- Nothing in his name,

246
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,196
or any of his nouns' credit cards.

247
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,559
- Family, relatives?
- Parents are deceased.

248
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,081
He's got one sister...
Helen Mcguire.

249
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:22,790
Lives in west hollywood.
Divorced, one kid.

250
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,094
A girl... Emma.

251
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,944
Photo at the apartment.
Her favorite uncle.

252
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:38,586
All right, enough with the look
already. I'll go.

253
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,534
And I will take our trained expert
operational psychologist for backup.

254
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,370
I love field work.
Do I get to carry a gun?

255
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:49,714
I don't think we're expecting a lot
of trouble from a grieving family.

256
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,953
Can I still carry a gun?
Wear one of ose ankle holsters?

257
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:57,238
- Maybe that would make me walk funny.
- You already walk funny, Nate.

258
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,111
Where are we with friends or lovers?

259
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:00,909
There's one stand out... a guy.

260
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,477
- Friend or lover?
- I don't know.

261
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,717
Not really the question
that had jumped out at me.

262
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:06,021
Informed guess.

263
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:08,857
He's a six-foot,
three 200 pound special forces.

264
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,515
Paratrooper, guys.
I'm leaning towards a friend.

265
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:12,823
Good call, Dom.

266
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,617
Got a hit on that phone number.
Detail's coming up.

267
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,879
Same phone number used to call in
and erase Mcguire's voice mail,

268
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,415
also called him 15 times
in the last four days.

269
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,402
Somebody's trying
to cover their tracks.

270
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,440
Distance themselves
from the investigation.

271
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,909
Who is he? Who made those calls?

272
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,402
That's him.

273
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:33,524
The special forces paratrooper guy.
He runs a private security firm.

274
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:38,145
Bobby J. Jenlow & Associates.
What do the associates do?

275
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:41,841
Anything Bobby J. Jenlow tells
them to. No plates.

276
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:45,933
Small world.

277
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,427
Are you listening to me,
Eddie? No, no!

278
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,856
You listen to me.
It's called standing up, okay?

279
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,945
It's called standing up
for your brothers.

280
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,502
That's all I'm ask...

281
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,130
Just do it...

282
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,448
For me, Eddie.
Just do it.

283
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,258
You run pretty good.

284
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,842
- Nice hand brake turn.
- You gonna badge me?

285
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:15,915
Make a difference if we do?

286
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:18,219
Saw you going in.
I didn't know who you were.

287
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,991
So you cleared the phones remotely.

288
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,633
Private conversations.

289
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,769
- Every one.
- Close?

290
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:26,818
Since we were kids.

291
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,058
It's got to hurt knowing
one of your close buddies

292
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,679
is betraying his country.
- He was kidnapped.

293
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:33,851
He was no traitor.

294
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,789
You guys don't know anything.

295
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:38,587
We know he wasn't kidnapped.

296
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,453
We know he's been working with them
for the better part of a week.

297
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,787
We know he was shot to shut him up.

298
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:48,293
- What do you know, Bobby?
- Nothing.

299
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,121
You're special ops.

300
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,265
It's funny how
we all know just by looking.

301
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,592
Me, I was a seal.

302
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,100
Planning a little
hunting party, Bobby?

303
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,700
We're done.

304
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,122
Jenlow compromised the operation
against the cartels.

305
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,833
Putting together a team to go
after them. Retribution.

306
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,629
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

307
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:33,847
I sent everyone home.

308
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,164
All my friends.
I wanted to be alone.

309
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,375
When did you last see your brother?
Thank you.

310
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,387
The weekend.

311
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,379
Frank, took...

312
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,313
Took Emma to the farmer's market.

313
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,908
He was always taking her someplace.
The beach, the movies.

314
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:53,820
After we divorced, Emma's father,
moved overseas.

315
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,437
So Frank became the man in her life.

316
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,754
Did you speak to your brother
at all on the phone this week?

317
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,515
No.

318
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,982
Did he mention
he was worried about something?

319
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:02,951
Nothing.

320
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:05,648
Everything was normal.
And then...

321
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,360
- Will you excuse me?
- Sure.

322
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:19,120
You know, you can tell a lot
about people from their fridge?

323
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,006
And not just what's on the inside.

324
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,310
Outside tells a story, too.

325
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,883
- She's grieving.
- Yes, she is.

326
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,504
Which is normal
considering the circumstances.

327
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:32,542
- Absolutely.
- So what? Tell me.

328
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:35,687
She's on edge.

329
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:39,700
Answering way too quickly.
Particularly to direct questions

330
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:41,675
requiring a simple yes or no.

331
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:44,384
And mostly she's saying no.

332
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:48,496
Kensi... Everything that woman
just told us was a lie.

333
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
Mr. Callen.

334
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:58,012
A moment?

335
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:01,593
You want some backup?

336
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:08,625
Your hand.

337
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,648
Eye.

338
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:19,986
Car.

339
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,575
Blue'07 impala.

340
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:27,179
Modified the engine, upgraded
the brakes, transmission, suspension.

341
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,132
Fitted with 19-inch wheels.

342
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,581
And latest smart technology.

343
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,909
Three-G network with two
four megapixel cameras,

344
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:39,130
updated microphone,
32 giga flash drive,

345
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,563
wi-fi, bluetooth, mini-usb slot
and of course...

346
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,303
GPS! And it's encrypted.

347
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:48,431
And so please don't forget
your pin this time.

348
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:50,890
Let's go.

349
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,770
Now wardrobe
for your undercover work.

350
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,348
I know you grew up
in the well-meaning

351
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,526
but cold embrace
of the welfare state, Mr. Callen.

352
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:03,914
But just because you're an orphan,
doesn't mean you have to dress like...

353
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,407
Oliver Twist.

354
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,563
Now, we need something modern,

355
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:09,956
individual...

356
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,999
That speaks to the man within.

357
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,016
That's not for you to admire.
It's for you to try on.

358
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,649
Here.

359
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,760
And here.

360
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:27,655
And... here.

361
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,670
- This or this?
- Those.

362
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,698
A fitted boot jean, medium weight,

363
00:22:33,174 --> 00:22:35,372
distressed denim.
I think...

364
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:38,298
we need something
more relaxed, Mr. Callen.

365
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,032
Something amuses you?

366
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:52,078
Oh, it's just that in three years,
you've never called me G.

367
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:57,292
Well, it's not a name.
It's a letter.

368
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:02,714
Now if you were to tell
me what the "g" stands for...

369
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,134
No one ever told me.

370
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,531
Tell me that's good news, Eric.

371
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,515
That's good news.

372
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:20,648
And that is commander
Mcguire's laptop.

373
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:22,714
- You got in?
- I got in.

374
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:24,891
Me and about a hundred-
thousand other zombie computers.

375
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,805
I hacked into
an illegal botnet system

376
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:29,640
and redirected the computing
power into cracking the encryption.

377
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,986
Couple of minutes,
and we'll get to peek inside

378
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:34,204
all of Mcguire's
dirty little secrets.

379
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,798
All right, guys,

380
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:38,407
Nate thinks Mcguire's
sister's lying to us

381
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,247
that she knew what
her brother was doing.

382
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,979
But I think there's something else.

383
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,589
It's like the kind of raw emotion

384
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,175
that you see in someone
when the nightmare's still unfolding.

385
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,093
Like it was still happening to her.

386
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:49,928
Same time every morning,

387
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:53,264
they pick him up, cover his face
and take him somewhere.

388
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,391
So why would someone
betray their country?

389
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:57,727
Ideology... greed.

390
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,562
Love.

391
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:03,761
Oh, my god, it's her.

392
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:05,693
- Mcguire's sister?
- No, his niece.

393
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:09,120
Eric, buddiesbook entry
for Emma Mcguire, west hollywood!

394
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,365
Coming in five.

395
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,410
She said she wanted to be alone.

396
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,901
Callen, her daughter
wasn't even with her.

397
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,281
All right, here we go.

398
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,209
Emma's been sending messages
to her friends every single day.

399
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:23,641
- And then come this week...
- No messages.

400
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:26,355
Nothing.
She hasn't logged on for four days.

401
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:29,275
So, whatever they've been getting
Mcguire to do, this is how

402
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:32,456
they've been forcing him to do it.
This is why she's still living it.

403
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:34,013
It's still happening.

404
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,809
They have her daughter.

405
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:47,694
Coming in three...

406
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,830
two...

407
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,749
one.

408
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:50,856
Bingo.

409
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:53,256
We just opened four encrypted emails

410
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:55,535
sent to Mcguire's laptop
over the last four days.

411
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:58,264
Sequential time code is
within an hour of the download.

412
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:01,220
They were dialing direct from one
of our own defense satellites.

413
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:04,294
Mcguire downlinks the satellite
images to the main computer,

414
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,530
and then secretly e-mails
them to his own laptop.

415
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,952
Recording everything
they were making him steal.

416
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,550
There's the San Diego bay.

417
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,803
Army bases, border crossing.
Border security.

418
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,293
- Eric, get me vance.
- Got it.

419
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,642
How did the drug cartels find out
Mcguire even had those access?

420
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,512
It was a joint military operation,

421
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,886
so the leak probably came
from south of the border.

422
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:27,589
Cartel sets up a satellite uplink,
kidnaps his niece Emma,

423
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:30,165
who's still missing. Knowing
that he'll do anything they ask

424
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:32,155
and not tell anyone.
- He did tell someone.

425
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,422
Bobby Jenlow.

426
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:38,075
He's gonna try to rescue her.
Probably gave Mcguire a GPS locator.

427
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:40,603
- Gotta find Jenlow, Eric.
- I'm already on it.

428
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,123
Director's online.

429
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:47,416
<i>- What do you got?</i>
- Operation Dakota's been compromised.

430
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,506
Mexican drug cartel forced Mcguire
to access one of our satellites.

431
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:51,591
<i>Forced?</i>

432
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,369
Kidnapped his niece.

433
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:55,011
She's still missing.

434
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:58,284
<i>It's too late to stop dakota</i>

435
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:01,226
<i>Gotta find out which cartel.
We'll hit them first.</i>

436
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,872
<i>And you have...
less than four hours.</i>

437
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:06,314
<i>Callen...</i>

438
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,729
<i>The girl is a priority.</i>

439
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,487
Jenlow's cell phone is on.
And I got him.

440
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:15,902
- Hollywood hills.
- Kensi, Mcguire's sister.

441
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,595
- You know.
- We put the pieces together.

442
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:33,508
- I'm sorry, Helen.
- Come in.

443
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,743
I wanted to tell you,
but Bobby wouldn't let me.

444
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,381
He's going up there
to bring her back.

445
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:41,835
- When?
- Now.

446
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,416
Sam, it's me.
I'm with Helen Mcguire.

447
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,264
- Bobby Jenlow's on his way in.
- Copy that.

448
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:51,377
First turn off viewpoint
road. Got it.

449
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,039
All right, we're ten minutes out.

450
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:54,279
Transmitting.

451
00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:56,515
- Stand by...
- Picture's up.

452
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,451
He's gonna get another ticket.

453
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:06,320
Have they contacted you?

454
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:08,255
- No.
- OK, if they do,

455
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:11,531
I want you to keep talking to them
so that we can trace the call, okay?

456
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:13,537
They were at the market.

457
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:16,390
One minute Emma was standing right
next to him, Frank turned around

458
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:17,927
and she was just... gone.

459
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,414
- How do they contact him?
- Cell phone,

460
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,677
couple of minutes
after she disappeared.

461
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:25,431
They told him what they wanted
him to do. He agreed.

462
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:27,259
Have they let you speak to her?

463
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:28,771
No.

464
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,665
Bobby gave Franck a GPS transmitter.

465
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:34,671
Frank put it in the cartel's house.

466
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:38,671
He gave up his life for my daughter.

467
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,412
Turn's up ahead, Sam.

468
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,423
- You feeling lucky?
- After last time?

469
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,785
Not particularly.

470
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,318
Here we go.

471
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:11,475
That's not Jenlow.

472
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,413
Look out!

473
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:15,068
Callen.

474
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:11,367
It's okay, Bobby.

475
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:13,705
Emma.

476
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,094
Get Emma.

477
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,415
Eric, ambulance.

478
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,277
Sam and I are fine.

479
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,253
She's not here.

480
00:29:49,942 --> 00:29:50,880
Find her.

481
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,382
Please just... just find her.

482
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,036
Any ID on our two amigos?

483
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:05,579
All cashed up, no ID.

484
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:08,179
The car had a GPS
system tracking system.

485
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,677
- Previous destinations.
- There's two with repeat journeys.

486
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,706
This one and one
in Malibu. Hey, Eric.

487
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:18,801
Give me everything you got
on 1727 pacific coast <i>highway, Malibu.</i>

488
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:23,446
Okay. House is owned
by <i>PPZ Investments.</i>

489
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:27,116
<i>It's a trust,</i> which in turn
is owned by a guy named...

490
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:28,576
Manny Cortez.

491
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,244
"Mad" Manny Cortez

492
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,580
It doesn't describe him
as "mad" in the SEC filing, but

493
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,649
<i>if you say so.</i>

494
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,416
We found our cartel.

495
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,316
Who's Manny Cortez?

496
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,636
Just a mass-murdering drug lord
with a classic oedipus complex.

497
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,223
Last bit's an educated guess.

498
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:46,140
I'd have to talk
to him to be certain.

499
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:49,268
Manny and his father ran one
of the largest drug cartels in Mexico.

500
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,677
And now it's just him.

501
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:53,479
- What happed his father?
- According to legend,

502
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,829
Manny cut off his toes
with a pair of bolt cutters.

503
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:57,906
Then his fingers. Then some other...

504
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:58,855
Bits.

505
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:00,158
Cool.

506
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:08,991
Helen, I'm sorry.

507
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,001
Emma wasn't at the house.

508
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,024
Bobby?

509
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,208
He's on his way to the ER.

510
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,713
Gunshot wound, but I think
he's going gonna be okay.

511
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,288
Hello?

512
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,157
<i>It's Luis. Any news?</i>

513
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:33,432
It's my ex. Emma's dad.

514
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:37,147
Hello, Luis. There's no news.

515
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,664
- Emma's still...
<i>- Helen, what about Emma?</i>

516
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,078
<i>Please, you just need to
tell me what's happening.</i>

517
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,941
Luis, I...

518
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:48,137
Excuse me.

519
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,001
Could you?

520
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,618
- Mr. Perez?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

521
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,207
Special agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

522
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,241
<i>Oh, geez.</i>

523
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:01,860
I just have to reassure you

524
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:04,543
that we are doing everything
we can to get your little girl back.

525
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:06,264
<i>Helen didn't tell
me until this morning.</i>

526
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:08,259
<i>I'm booked on the next
flight out of london.</i>

527
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:11,394
<i>You promise me you'll do
everything to find her.</i>

528
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:13,329
<i>Everything, you hear me?</i>

529
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,439
- Yes, sir, I hear you.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

530
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,416
Emma adores her father.

531
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,768
He only just gets back to town

532
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,337
couple of times a year.

533
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,408
We were planning on having
thanksgiving together.

534
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,003
What do you think it'd take
to storm that place?

535
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:52,255
- A week's planning and a small army.
- Could be too late, G.

536
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,261
Nate, the girl...

537
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,050
you think she's still alive?

538
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,734
The moment Mcguire was killed,
she became a liability.

539
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,822
Now, psychologically...

540
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:12,615
the fact that she's a child makes
the decision harder, but...

541
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:16,619
Eventually, self-interest
usually wins through.

542
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:19,316
If she's still alive,
she's running out of time.

543
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,125
We need a plan.

544
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,169
Okay, we could
send in a tactical team.

545
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,126
We'd need an hour
to get them together.

546
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:28,561
We don't have an hour.

547
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:32,917
Utility company, city engineer...
food delivery.

548
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,929
No, if Manny Cortez is really there,
the only way he's gonna invite us in

549
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,837
is if he thinks there's money in it.

550
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:40,202
"Trade...

551
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:43,715
ei id quod cupit."

552
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:46,837
- What was that, greek?
- Latin.

553
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,247
"Give them what they want."

554
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,778
Very good, Dominic.

555
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:53,129
Though your declinaision
needs a little work.

556
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:56,037
The pronoun is...
masculine singular...

557
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,649
"Give him what he wants."

558
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,414
So, what does this toe-cutter...

559
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,456
want?

560
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,512
Satellite access, 24/7.

561
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:15,124
- Did you make the call, nate?
- Yeah. He's expecting you.

562
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:21,578
- Yeah? What do you want?
- Want to do business.

563
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:23,269
<i>What sort of business?</i>

564
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,479
Satellite business.

565
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,413
Game time.

566
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,070
Okay, man.

567
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:50,838
I'm good.

568
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,322
No problem.

569
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,240
- Who are you?
- Frank Hanley.

570
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,597
I'm a lawyer.

571
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:19,026
A lawyer needs a bodyguard?

572
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:22,995
Oh, the big guy.
Big guy's actually my client.

573
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:25,024
Works in the defense department.

574
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,207
Civilian analyst.

575
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:29,903
Actually, he just worked with
a former business partner of yours.

576
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:33,172
Naval Commander... Named Mcguire?

577
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:35,633
- Never heard of him.
- Really?

578
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:37,949
Well, maybe you've
heard of his niece?

579
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,587
Her name is Emma.

580
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,986
Mcguire shared some
information with my client.

581
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,200
In less than three hours,
operation dakota begins.

582
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,084
In less than one hour, my client
can have you back online

583
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,719
real-time, satellite imagery,
the mexican border.

584
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:07,823
24/7.

585
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:12,179
And how can your client do this?

586
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:17,267
It's a simple phone call.

587
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,071
Pictures are coming up.

588
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,265
Guys, that's not Manny Cortez.

589
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,791
Then who is it?

590
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:29,482
I don't believe you.

591
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:30,479
Daddy.

592
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,675
Daddy!

593
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,779
Hey!

594
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:44,919
Is that who I think it is?

595
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,070
Kensi.

596
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,790
The father's behind this.

597
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,281
Emma's with him.

598
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,807
Nate, he called here.

599
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,956
He knows... Luis knows we're NCIS.

600
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,800
Operation's compromised. He knows.

601
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:01,576
We have to do something.

602
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:05,867
When can I call mommy?

603
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:07,861
Tomorrow, I promise.

604
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:09,736
Now, daddy's busy.

605
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:12,525
Why don't you go have your swim
and I'll join you soon, okay?

606
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,815
Give me a kiss. Bye-bye.

607
00:37:22,188 --> 00:37:24,033
We all live a lie.

608
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,962
Some are bigger lie than others.

609
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:29,163
I spoke to one of
your colleagues on the phone.

610
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:31,084
A distraught father.

611
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:33,482
She was NCIS.

612
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:34,942
I assume you are, too?

613
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,630
How long you been
working for Manny Cortez?

614
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,087
Seven, eight years.

615
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:42,094
A double life.

616
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,101
You were Mcguire's brother-in-law.

617
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,342
He never thought I was
good enough for his sister.

618
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:50,635
Yeah, he was right.

619
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,072
You set him up to believe
that his niece was kidnapped.

620
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:55,141
She was.

621
00:37:55,888 --> 00:37:57,265
But by her father.

622
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:01,396
And she's not going back.

623
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,325
Yeah, he's right here.

624
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,426
It's Mcguire.

625
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,372
He's not really dead.

626
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:57,540
- Thanks, dom.
- You're welcome.

627
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,378
Kensi...

628
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,600
Give her the phone.

629
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:14,132
Hello.

630
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:16,516
It's for you.

631
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:21,109
- Hello.
- Baby!

632
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh, baby...

633
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,611
Hi, mommy.

634
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,083
When can I come home?
I want to come home.

635
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:31,074
You can come home right now.

636
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:39,333
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

637
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,548
Sweetheart, I love you so much.

638
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:46,725
I love you too, mom.

639
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,975
Expense accounts.

640
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,968
You're six months behind.

641
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,395
I would have thought

642
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:04,440
that seeing as you had so much
time off for recuperation,

643
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,987
you would have caught
up on your paperwork.

644
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:08,864
Tell me you're kidding me.

645
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,248
Well, I could...

646
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,267
but it would be a lie.

647
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:16,955
No, rush. Tomorrow will be fine.

648
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:31,555
Night.

649
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:35,788
Night, Dom, Kensi, Nate.

650
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:47,861
Sofa's free at my place.

651
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,821
Noisy.

652
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:53,738
- Good night, G.
- Good night.

653
00:41:15,332 --> 00:41:16,187
And...

654
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,041
Done.
