1
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,587
Yo, Don Ho, how about a refill?

2
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,591
It looks good.

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,971
- Get him the money.
- I told you my cocaine's pure.

4
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
I think we've got compagny!

5
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:24,893
Go, go!

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,639
.: Team UnderCovers:.

7
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,257
NCIS Los Angeles
1x02 [ Killshot ]

8
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,402
Bang! You're dead.

9
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:35,921
You have to clear yourself
of the line of fire first.

10
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,241
Do it again. Focus, Dom.

11
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,206
You can't move until you know
where the weapon is.

12
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,154
What if I step backwards?
Wait until you feel the barrel.

13
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:49,496
Again. Hands up.

14
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,488
Come on, come on.
Hands up.

15
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,480
- What are you doing?
- Training.

16
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,934
To go undercover as a scarecrow?

17
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,861
Sam's helping me hone
my agent skills.

18
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,373
Personally, I do not respond to being
whistled at like a sheepdog,

19
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:26,795
but Eric seems
to have trained the others.

20
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:30,751
So I suggest you learn
the appropriate Pavlovian response.

21
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:36,287
Which is go, little doggie! Go!

22
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:44,108
Very funny.

23
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,252
Roll 'em, Eric.

24
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,441
Director Vance received this footage
from the LAPD this morning.

25
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,273
It's the house security cam feed

26
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,207
from the scene of a double
homicide in Malibu two days ago.

27
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:58,403
Three masked guys invaded
the home of a suspected drug dealer,

28
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,626
killed two people and stole
a large sum of money.

29
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,359
What is the world coming to
when drug dealers aren't even safe

30
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,203
in the comfort
of their own fortified homes?

31
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:12,251
Your... professional
psychological analysis

32
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,545
is an invaluable asset
to our team, Nate.

33
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,365
- Thanks, Hetty.
- But your stand-up... needs some work.

34
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,667
Save it for open mic night.

35
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,767
Carry on, people.

36
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:32,062
So, what does this
have to do with NCIS?

37
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,983
The suspects came in
and left from the ocean.

38
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,201
And they were using
military hand signals.

39
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:39,445
Throw it over, Eric.

40
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:43,693
- What are you chasing, Sam?
- They're Seals.

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,251
- How can you be so sure of that?
- I know that guy.

42
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,239
From body language, hand signals?

43
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,219
Hand signals are like
handwriting, dancing.

44
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,918
Everybody's got their own style.
That's Kurt Holgate.

45
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,337
Eric, punch him up.

46
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,257
All right, let's see
what we have here, uh... Kurt Holgate.

47
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,887
Impressive record.

48
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,100
Holgate and his team just
returned from overseas.

49
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,852
They've been stateside
less than a month.

50
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,686
- They're no longer active service.
- I'll look up Holgate's team.

51
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,981
But there's nothing in his history
that would suggest he's the kind of guy

52
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,983
to get involved
in robbing a drug dealer.

53
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,318
You're right,
he's not that kind of guy.

54
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:22,108
- You sure you know this guy, Sam?
- Trust me...

55
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,907
that's Holgate.
I should know, I taught him.

56
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,082
Another member of Holgate's SEAL team,
David Ramirez

57
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,522
was shot and killed
three weeks ago while...

58
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,378
walking out of a grocery store.

59
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,261
Police report says it was collateral
damage from what is believed

60
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:37,336
- to have been gang-related activity.
- No.

61
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,756
- That could be a coincidence.
- And it could be a naval cluster bomb.

62
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,633
We got to proceed
cautiously on this.

63
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,034
Holgate's currently assigned to a Joint
Task Force over at the Federal Building.

64
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,556
Think maybe it's time
we pay your old friend a visit.

65
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,395
- When's the last time you saw this guy?
- Bosnia.

66
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,956
You got history with him?

67
00:05:57,998 --> 00:06:00,109
We weren't dating,
if that's what you're asking.

68
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,944
SEALs work together as a team.

69
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,293
Holgate had the tendency to act
like a lone wolf,

70
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,688
- if you know what I'm talking about.
- Actually,

71
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,052
half the time, I don't know
what you're talking about,

72
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,099
and the rest of the time,
I just disagree.

73
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:13,914
I really look forward to
having Dom as a partner.

74
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,271
You'd miss me.

75
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,876
I complete you.

76
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,603
Hey. Holgate.

77
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,870
Sam Hanna. How the hell are you?

78
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,776
I'm well. It's been a while.

79
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,789
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

80
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:32,522
Joint Task Force stuff.
Heard you got out a while back.

81
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,803
- How's retirement?
- It's still a few years off.

82
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:37,742
- I'm with NCIS now.
- Why? You lose a bet?

83
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,808
I'm just kidding.

84
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,653
- How's that working out for you?
- It's real good.

85
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,474
- Sorry to hear about Ramirez.
- Yeah, thanks.

86
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:51,262
God's got a cruel sense of humor.

87
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,132
I got to run. We should, uh, get
together over some beers sometime.

88
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,146
Sounds like a plan. All right.

89
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,516
He didn't ask you
what you were doing here.

90
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,230
No, he didn't.

91
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,242
Here's the video of Sam's
SEAL friend Holgate.

92
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,891
Freeze. Back it up.

93
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,653
- What do you think, Nate?
- He's trying hard

94
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:23,484
to appear relaxed and friendly,
but doesn't offer to shake your hand.

95
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,529
And the moment you say "NCIS,"
he deflects with humor.

96
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,740
Nothing in his financial records
to suggest any change in lifestyle.

97
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,634
I can get in touch with the coroner,

98
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:34,203
see if there's anything pertaining
to the crime scene that confirms

99
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,663
SEAL involvement.

100
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:38,792
What?

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,336
- You know, like... ballistics.
- Really?

102
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,714
You're throwing that out
there with a straight face?

103
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,015
Ever since you profiled
the Dickinson case,

104
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,307
you've had a thing for the coroner.

105
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:53,481
I don't know
what you're talking about.

106
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,308
I mean, she's hot, but she works
on dead bodies all day.

107
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,018
It takes a certain kind of person.

108
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,558
Nate seems pretty lively compared
to the stiffs she is working on.

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,620
All right, you know what, your herd
behavior is unbecoming, gentlemen.

110
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,986
Guys, guys.

111
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,028
- Timothy Jackson.
- What about him?

112
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,513
He's another member of Holgate
and Ramirez's SEAL team.

113
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,691
In fact,
he was Ramirez's swim buddy.

114
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,698
He's missing. Since the 18th.

115
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:17,205
That's the same night
as the shooting.

116
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,685
- That's Jackson's trailer over there.
- Thank you.

117
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:29,027
I haven't seen him
around lately though.

118
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,219
If Jackson is Ramirez's swim buddy,
they're closer than brothers.

119
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,742
Swim buddy gets you through SEAL
training, helps you survive hell week.

120
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:38,044
I could use a swim
buddy to deal with Hetty.

121
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:40,086
Jackson's got a sweet trailer.

122
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:46,791
Let's take a look around.
See if he's coming home anytime soon.

123
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,866
Too slow, Secret Squirrel.

124
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,978
Not a lot of places
to hide anything.

125
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,218
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

126
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,951
You recognize these guys?

127
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,241
We're in Jackson's trailer.
That's my friend Holgate.

128
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:25,461
That's Ramirez, who died
in the grocery store.

129
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,984
- So who's the fourth?
- I don't know.

130
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:33,279
You're a SEAL.

131
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,950
Where would you hide
stolen drug money?

132
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:41,292
Underwater?

133
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,315
No, because I wouldn't
steal anybody's money,

134
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,294
drug dealer or otherwise.
And I doubt these guys would either.

135
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,849
You're the one who I.D.'d Holgate
from the surveillance footage.

136
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,343
You don't like the thought there are
dirty, but you want to hear my theory?

137
00:09:57,227 --> 00:10:00,782
These guys are stuck overseas
in some hellhole for months on end,

138
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:03,361
fighting for their lives, watching
their buddies get killed,

139
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,430
and for what?

140
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,437
To save some people who would
just as soon slit their throats?

141
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:12,600
You know, and if they do finally make
it back, they come back, they realize

142
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,847
a dealer is wearing a watch,
it's worth more than the house.

143
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:19,368
So they use a little
bit of what they know

144
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,890
to take a little something
back for their retirement.

145
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,293
I can see you're really
intrigued by this.

146
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,000
SEALs don't do it for the money.

147
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,280
For the chicks?

148
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,088
It's probably more like a calling,
like the seminary.

149
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,168
That's right.

150
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,259
If priests actually blew things up
and could kill you with a Bible.

151
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,137
- Are you trying to get under my skin?
- I'm just bouncing ideas off you.

152
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,901
Keep it up, I'm gonna
bounce you off a rock.

153
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:42,573
I'll tell Nate you said that.

154
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:57,153
All right, Eric. Thanks. Yeah, let me
know if you find anything else.

155
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,430
All right, bye.

156
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,871
- GPS trackers activated.
- Good.

157
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,204
Eric confirmed Holgate's working
alongside Homeland Security

158
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:10,757
- on a human trafficking task force.
- What if Holgate's not involved?

159
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,629
Well, for his sake, I hope he's not.

160
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,090
I wouldn't want to wind up
on Sam's bad side.

161
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:19,136
- I think I already am.
- What do you mean?

162
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,222
It just seems like nothing I do
is ever good enough for him.

163
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,445
Sam demands the best from himself.

164
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:27,116
It's hard for him to accept anything
less from anybody else.

165
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:29,705
- You'll get used to it.
- It's just...

166
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,308
It's hard being the new guy.

167
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,137
Try being the new girl.

168
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,047
They used to make me crawl
into the air vents, under houses

169
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,835
just because I was the smallest one.

170
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:42,026
When was the last time any of you had
to put on a bikini for an assignment?

171
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:44,662
Yeah, that's right.
Try hiding a gun in your thong.

172
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:48,624
All right. I just never
thought of it that way.

173
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,362
It's obviously not
like that anymore.

174
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:55,578
I mean, if you can prove that you can
protect yourself and protect your team,

175
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,750
he'll let up.

176
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,467
If Sam is hard on you in the office,

177
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,785
it's really just because he wants
to protect you in the field.

178
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,038
Well, of course, either that,
or he genuinely doesn't like you.

179
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:10,564
Heads up.

180
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,314
Holgate's on the move.

181
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,268
No, look, Kensi, he's not.

182
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:20,406
Looks like we've got a meeting, Dom.

183
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:21,944
I can't see anything.

184
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:25,519
I'm going to risk getting closer to hear
what they're saying. Give me the ears.

185
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,442
<i>I'm sure we'll be fine.</i>

186
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:41,463
<i>Let's not jump to conclusions.
It could be a coincidence.</i>

187
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:43,989
<i>- You willing to take that chance?
- What do you want me to do?</i>

188
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,660
<i>Lay low, stay off </i>the grid, and keep
your head on a swivel.

189
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:48,469
They could already be watching us.

190
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,736
- He's watching you.
- <i>Watching me like</i> he's paranoid

191
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,064
- or like he's checking me out?
- What's the difference?

192
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,462
<i>Well, usually the amount
of time focused on my butt.</i>

193
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,110
He's paranoid. No offense.

194
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:00,747
Where are you? At home?

195
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,610
That's funny, 'cause I'm looking right
at your car, you lying son of a bitch!

196
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:07,487
Who is she? Because I would like
to carve the bitch's name

197
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:08,700
in your paint job.

198
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,987
And don't call me.

199
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:14,268
I'll contact you when we're cool.

200
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,031
Have Eric run these plates.

201
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,148
I think I just bought
the owner some body work.

202
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:37,750
Great.

203
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:40,216
I've got it. Thanks.

204
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,728
Fourth man in the photo
is named Morris Raspen.

205
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,451
If he was part of the team,
I'm sure Ramirez's widow knows him.

206
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,208
- Mrs. Ramirez?
- Yes?

207
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,506
I'm Sam Hanna.
This is my partner Callen.

208
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:00,856
We'd like to ask you some questions
about your husband and his teammates.

209
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,969
- You're a SEAL, aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

210
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,360
I never asked him about his job.

211
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,601
I knew it was dangerous.

212
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:16,733
He'd always say, "Don't worry, baby.
You ain't getting rid of me that easy."

213
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,774
Never expected to lose him
just running to the grocery store.

214
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,367
So he didn't know
the men who shot him?

215
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,704
No. They were drug dealers.

216
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,041
Are you still in touch
with the other members of his team?

217
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,334
SEALs take care of their own.

218
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:42,881
The wives are pretty close, too...
those who have wives.

219
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,453
When was the last time
you saw Timothy Jackson?

220
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,200
He usually comes by here Friday,

221
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,070
but he never showed up.

222
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,495
He stops by to check
on me and my son.

223
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,440
Tim and David went
through BUDs together.

224
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,851
I think sometimes he was closer
to my husband than I was.

225
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,400
Do you have any idea where he is?

226
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,779
When was the last time
you saw Morris Raspen?

227
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,491
At the funeral. He was the newest
member of the team.

228
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,213
I don't really know him.

229
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:14,699
Excuse me.

230
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,821
I've been combing
through financial, email,

231
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:21,189
phone records, everything I can
on Timothy Jackson, nothing stands out.

232
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,142
- I didn't think it would.
- But I can tell you

233
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,950
where he was the day
of the shootings.

234
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,010
His credit card was used
at a place called The Sunset in Malibu.

235
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,725
All right, thanks.

236
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:33,421
So, I open this guy up
to do an autopsy

237
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:37,161
and there's this miniature cuckoo
clock where his heart should be,

238
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,291
still ticking.

239
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:40,643
And as I pull it out, it goes off.

240
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:42,637
But instead of a bird popping out,

241
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,205
it's this little garden gnome.

242
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,074
He jumps out of the clock,

243
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,746
flips me off,
and then runs out the door.

244
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,254
I'm more of
an operational psychologist,

245
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:58,707
so, I don't really do
dream analysis.

246
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,372
But if I were to hazard a guess,

247
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:07,276
I'd say that the clock
obviously represents...

248
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:09,166
time.

249
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:13,889
And, the autopsy death.

250
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:18,435
And yet, there's this magical
creature that lives on inside him

251
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,063
that's set free by your actions.

252
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,190
So, I helped to release his soul.

253
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:24,816
Yeah.

254
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,791
Then, why did he flip me off?

255
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,606
Gnomes... notoriously cranky.

256
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,024
So, uh, no one has come
to claim our friend, the drug dealer.

257
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:42,961
Ballistics were inconclusive. No way
to tell if SEALs were responsible.

258
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,112
Two .9mm slugs to the chest

259
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:50,565
from about 15 feet turned
his heart into hamburger.

260
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:54,469
The shooter double tapped
him just left of center.

261
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,017
Knew the anatomy of a kill shot.

262
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,684
That is a professional.

263
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:01,644
So, the same gun was used
to kill both drug dealers?

264
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,800
There was only one drug dealer.

265
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,149
- There were two victims.
- You mean the cop?

266
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:10,597
We were told that two suspected
drug dealers were killed.

267
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:13,701
Yeah. The other victim
was an LAPD officer.

268
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:16,587
Bullet fragmented too
much to make a match.

269
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,494
Why wasn't that in the report?

270
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,411
Yeah, well, the guy was
so deep undercover

271
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,651
that we didn't get
the info until today.

272
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:25,870
Those guys are cowboys.

273
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,714
I know the type.

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,119
Why are we just hearing
about this now, Nate?

275
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,551
Yeah, okay.

276
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,420
Thanks.

277
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,236
- Problem?
- Uh, you could say that.

278
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:48,544
One of the guys killed in the shootout
was an undercover cop.

279
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:53,032
This just keeps getting
better and better.

280
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,087
That's our missing
SEAL's motorcycle.

281
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,801
How you doing?

282
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:02,746
Sorry, guys,
we don't open for another 20 minutes.

283
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:06,043
I was actually just hoping to talk
to someone who worked here two days ago.

284
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:07,761
You're looking at her.

285
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:11,298
Let me ask you something.
Do you recognize any of these guys?

286
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:16,022
Yeah.
Three of those guys were here.

287
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:18,013
Pretty cute. Good tippers.

288
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,879
You didn't happen to hear what
they were talking about, did you?

289
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,277
It was pretty busy.

290
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,434
But I do know they got
into an argument at one point.

291
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:25,479
About what?

292
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:28,092
Like I said, it was really busy.
They took it outside.

293
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,568
- So, you saw them leave?
- No. Sorry...

294
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,552
- How long's that motorcycle been there?
- I don't know. Couple days, maybe.

295
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:38,450
Never really thought about it. Figured
it belonged to a local or something.

296
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:41,179
Do you have surveillance
cameras inside?

297
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,752
Well, the house
where the shooting occurred

298
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:47,530
is just a couple miles down the road.
Just a short drive.

299
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,581
Or a short swim.

300
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,773
- Why would somebody swim?
- Because they could.

301
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,283
What do you got, Eric?

302
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:06,231
Call the Sheriff's Department back and
tell them to put us on the guest list.

303
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,939
- Thanks.
- Good news or bad news?

304
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,450
A body just washed up at Point Dume

305
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,652
that matches the description
of Timothy Jackson.

306
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:26,281
Lifeguard pulled him in.
Tried to revive him, but...

307
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:28,873
Looks like he's been
dead a couple days.

308
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:40,712
It's Jackson.

309
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,849
Looks like a single
gunshot wound to the side.

310
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,073
Surf's been pretty big lately.

311
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:01,883
Stronger currents...

312
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,130
could have taken him out for miles.

313
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,280
This is from the Sunset
Restaurant in Malibu on Saturday.

314
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:24,306
Holgate and Raspen take Jackson
out for some fresh air around 2:11.

315
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,247
How do you know they're not leaving?

316
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,889
They didn't close out their tab.

317
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,619
SEALs wouldn't leave unfinished beer
on the bar if the place was on fire.

318
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,219
All right, jumping ahead...
Here we go.

319
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,868
Holgate and Raspen return
without Jackson at 6:39.

320
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,029
So Jackson left?

321
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,792
If he did, it was
without his motorcycle.

322
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,036
It hasn't moved from the parking
lot since that day.

323
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,961
All right, Kensi and Dom
observed Holgate talking to someone

324
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:51,110
this afternoon who we now
know was Raspen.

325
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,664
That's Raspen meeting Holgate.

326
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,587
Holgate told him to lay low.

327
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,839
So, Jackson, Holgate and Raspen

328
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,103
rip off a known drug dealer
as pay back for Ramirez's death,

329
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,554
but Jackson is shot in the process
and drowns during the escape.

330
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,223
- And the money?
- Maybe it goes to Ramirez's widow?

331
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,284
- No sign of that.
- Keep looking.

332
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,604
And Raspen is the best way in.
He was the newest member of the team

333
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:15,222
Yeah, well, Raspen seems
to have gone underground.

334
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:16,837
SEALs are your people, Sam.

335
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:19,047
Do you have anything
you'd like to add?

336
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:27,050
Being a SEAL is
a big part of who Sam is.

337
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:31,039
If these guys are dirty,
they threaten his very identity.

338
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:33,750
They will protect
each other at all costs.

339
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,794
You don't have to worry about Sam.

340
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,888
This is a joyous occasion.

341
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm assuming
all our cases are closed.

342
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,194
Otherwise, how could you be here
working out in the middle of the day?

343
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,434
I'm just waiting for Callen.

344
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,874
What's wrong, Sam?

345
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,703
Why does something have to be wrong?
Can't a guy get some exercise?

346
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,647
Pilates is exercise.

347
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:13,498
Beating the hell out of something

348
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,626
is an aggressive
expression of male frustration.

349
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,509
This is about your SEAL brethren.

350
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:24,247
Have they disgraced the uniform?

351
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,985
When does duty trump loyalty?

352
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:32,032
Nobility, honor, betrayal.

353
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,119
All you need is a...

354
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:37,727
a backstabbing whore,
and you've got the makings of a...

355
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,778
Elizabethan tragedy.

356
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,028
Don't mock me.

357
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:46,276
I criticize, I scold, I chastise...

358
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,491
I've even torn someone a new one,

359
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,724
but I never mock.

360
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:54,844
You, Sam Hanna,
are more than this job

361
00:22:54,886 --> 00:22:57,250
and much more than a SEAL.

362
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:09,731
What if Holgate doesn't lead
us to the money?

363
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,779
- We go to plan B.
- What's plan B?

364
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,421
We don't have one yet.

365
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,773
What are you doing?

366
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,179
I, my friend, have to pee.

367
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,152
In here?

368
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,280
My bladder's gonna burst if I don't.

369
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,496
Can't you just go into, like, a coffee
shop or a restaurant or someplace?

370
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:35,455
Dom, we are on a stakeout. Welcome to
the glamorous world of surveillance.

371
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,332
I'll just go for a walk,
a quick walk.

372
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,824
Sit your butt down.

373
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,630
Damn it, Holgate's out now,
you see, and I...

374
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,641
I can't pee now. Are you satisfied?

375
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:49,603
And you know what? If I pee my pants,
you are so paying for the dry-cleaning.

376
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,448
Bringing up his tracker now.

377
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:07,908
- He's accelerating.
- Well, stick with him.

378
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,503
He's taking evasive action.
He must know we're following him.

379
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,916
No, wait.
He's driving in a a big circle.

380
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,057
He's making a cleaning run.
He's making sure he's not being tailed.

381
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,982
- He stopped moving.
- Stop the car, stop the car.

382
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,076
- I can catch him.
- That's what he wants,

383
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,652
for us to show ourselves. Pull over.

384
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,274
There must be a traffic cam nearby.

385
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,413
He's not in his car.

386
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,878
- Can you get a location from his phone?
- I'm trying.

387
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,348
Hey, Callen, it's Kensi.
Holgate ditched his car.

388
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,797
We're gonna try and track
him on his cell phone.

389
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,488
Tell Eric to shut off his phone.
If he knows he's being tailed,

390
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,344
He's gonna warn Raspen.
We're just about to pay him a visit.

391
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,305
- Holgate is in the wind.
- Yeah, okay.

392
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,977
Where do you want to meet?

393
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,244
Drop the gun.

394
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,187
I'm an NCIS agent.

395
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:17,012
I'd do as he says.

396
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:34,446
Recognize your SEAL buddy, Jackson?

397
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,765
Yeah, he probably looked a little
rosier last time you saw him.

398
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:47,303
We've got you and Holgate arguing
with Jackson,

399
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:50,650
leaving the bar together,
and then coming back without him.

400
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,837
- I think he hooked up with a girl.
- Yeah, there's no footage of that.

401
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,407
And his motorcycle never
left the restaurant.

402
00:26:57,668 --> 00:27:00,118
- Maybe he went home with her.
- He's lying.

403
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:04,143
Actually, he's trying very hard not
to lie by avoiding definitive sentences.

404
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,742
"I think he...", "Maybe he..."

405
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,502
Lies of omission are still lies.

406
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,869
You three didn't rip
off a drug dealer?

407
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:17,246
Seriously... that's what you think?

408
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:21,241
How about you and I tell each
other something... that we don't know.

409
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,093
Okay, I'll begin.

410
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,957
One of the drug dealers
that you killed...

411
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,814
was an undercover cop.

412
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:37,446
- Yeah.
- Where you going?

413
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,719
- To expedite this process.
- Sam, stop.

414
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,576
Don't go in there.
Give Callen a chance.

415
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,210
- We're wasting time.
- Sam, I know you're angry and

416
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:46,366
- you take their actions personally...
- Stop.

417
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:48,958
Do me a favor,
and stay out of my head.

418
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,260
Let's just take a step back
and think about this.

419
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:54,489
SEALs have a word for that.
It's called retreating.

420
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,964
It's something we don't do.

421
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,968
Now, if he doesn't get anything
from that guy by the time I get back,

422
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:02,076
I'm gonna jog his memory
from the inside out.

423
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:18,700
Is it too much to ask
for a little peace and quiet?

424
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:20,808
It's Bach!

425
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:24,151
Bach!

426
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,746
Can't you hear that?

427
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,130
What do I have to do to get
through that impenetrable

428
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,751
cranium of yours?

429
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,044
Sam, I...

430
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,340
Oh, for the love of Gucci.

431
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:42,387
What is the matter with you men?

432
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,713
Sorry, I was just letting
off a little steam.

433
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,955
Like the Little Engine That Could?

434
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:49,213
I know you lost a target.

435
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:52,719
Big deal, it happens.
Get over it.

436
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:55,880
- So you heard about that.
- Of course I heard about it.

437
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:58,403
I know what you ate for breakfast,
sweetie.

438
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,456
You think... Callen and Sam...

439
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,484
never screwed up?

440
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:12,910
Once Callen fell through a skylight

441
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:16,317
installing a camera
and landed in bed with the target.

442
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:21,374
And ask Sam about
the time he backed over

443
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:23,422
a suspect's beagle puppy.

444
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:28,224
And don't you think they walked
in here holding hands.

445
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:31,769
Once I had to turn a fire
extinguisher on them.

446
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,757
- Really?
- No.

447
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,653
These are just charming
anecdotes I made up

448
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:38,639
to bolster your self-esteem.

449
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,524
And listen.

450
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:46,531
Pivot on your back
foot when you punch.

451
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,014
Otherwise,
you're losing all your power.

452
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,699
- Drop the gun.
- You drop the gun.

453
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,161
- I'm an NCIS agent.
- Yeah? Well, I'm LAPD.

454
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,876
And this is my crime scene.

455
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:44,523
- I knew the Navy was behind this.
- Not in any official capacity.

456
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:45,927
Official, unofficial.

457
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,305
Either way, the dead guy that washed up
on the beach was one of yours.

458
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:54,349
My partner died here in my arms,

459
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:57,754
- shot by one of your men.
- They're not my men.

460
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:01,119
Then why are you here?

461
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:04,128
The surveillance video
doesn't tell the whole story.

462
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,074
I wanted to walk
through it for myself.

463
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,385
What's your excuse?

464
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,216
I was hoping to find something that
might lead me to my partner's killers.

465
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,436
Looks like I did.

466
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,578
I want names and addresses.

467
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:19,950
Full Navy cooperation.

468
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:23,192
Unless you want the news media
all over a story about rogue SEALs

469
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:26,050
going off the reservation
and killing a cop.

470
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,580
He's right here. I'll tell him.
That's was Kensi.

471
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,668
Still no sign of Holgate.

472
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,425
We've either got to charge
this guy or let him go.

473
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,837
- And you didn't even bring doughnuts?
- No, I did not bring back doughnuts.

474
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,410
I went back to the beach house
to walk the crime scene.

475
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,822
- What'd you find?
- This guy.

476
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,078
Grozen. He's an LAPD.

477
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,269
There were two
undercover cops there.

478
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,162
Recognize that guy?

479
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:05,830
Should I?

480
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,134
He's an LAPD detective.

481
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,719
That's right.

482
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,846
There were two undercover
cops at that drug deal.

483
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,252
If this guy's an undercover cop,
then he shot his partner.

484
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,076
You're telling me that this guy...

485
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:24,358
shot another cop?

486
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,193
This guy...

487
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:29,276
shot this guy.

488
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,149
I was there.

489
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:38,878
But if this guy is LAPD,
then he's a dirty cop

490
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:41,555
because I saw him kill his partner.

491
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:01,773
So whose idea was it
to go to the beach house?

492
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:07,109
Or I'll hand you over to LAPD, okay?
See how those boys treat cop killers.

493
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:11,712
Jackson learned that one of the suspects
in Ramirez's death lived there.

494
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,377
The guy was linked
to one of the Mexicali cartels.

495
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,764
Is it why Jackson chose the restaurant.
It was close to the beach house?

496
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,373
Come on, Raspen. I'm throwing
you a life-line here. Take it.

497
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,781
Jackson wanted to plan
an op to go after the guy.

498
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:25,127
Holgate tried to talk him out
of doing anything stupid.

499
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,088
<i>He obviously didn't
do a very good job?</i>

500
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,812
He's answering quickly,
with no real elaboration.

501
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,868
His visual accessing
cues are consistent.

502
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,574
- I think he's telling the truth.
- Jackson kept talking

503
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,770
declared a war on drugs

504
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,767
and that's what
he was going to bring them.

505
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,726
And then... boom,
he bailed off into the water.

506
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,522
- And you followed him.
- We didn't have a choice.

507
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:48,418
We figured a cold swim would probably
sober him up, but he was so fired up,

508
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,026
we couldn't catch him.

509
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,044
And by the time we did, he was already
at the house and had secured a weapon.

510
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:55,913
You're telling me that you went unarmed,
into the home of a dealer,

511
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,661
knowing full well that you were
outnumbered and outgunned?

512
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:00,605
It was a little improvised.

513
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,624
Besides, we knew they had weapons.
We could just take theirs.

514
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,859
<i>Got to love SEALs.</i>

515
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:07,793
<i>- Where's Holgate now?
- I've told you enough.</i>

516
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:11,298
<i>- He could be in serious danger.
- I'm not worried about Holgate,</i>

517
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,427
and I'm not saying anything
else until I see a JAG lawyer.

518
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:16,929
Fair enough.

519
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,837
- This is a bad idea.
- Trust me, doc,

520
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,451
sometimes you got to let
the big dogs work it out.

521
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:43,879
Let me guess.

522
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,936
- You're the bad cop.
- Something like that.

523
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:50,935
Unless you're a lawyer, I'm not talking
to you. So save your breath.

524
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,426
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a SEAL.

525
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:59,064
- What's our motto?
- "The only easy day was yesterday."

526
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,015
That's right.

527
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:05,262
<i>Now things are about to get really hard
for you. Forget how stupid you were.</i>

528
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:09,148
You broke the most sacred vow of all...
never leave a man behind.

529
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:10,715
Okay, that was good.

530
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:13,569
<i>No matter what happens, we never,
ever leave a man behind.</i>

531
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:17,264
<i>- But that's what you did to Jackson.</i>
- We didn't know he was shot.

532
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:18,853
That's no excuse.

533
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:22,078
- More of a reason to stay with him.
- We tried to help him.

534
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,643
He was struggling swimming
with the money, Holgate took it.

535
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:26,331
- You stole the money?
- Jackson did.

536
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,382
He was going to give it
to Ramirez's widow.

537
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:31,067
One minute he's swimming right next
to me. The next he's gone.

538
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,760
You took the cash, you left him.

539
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:35,257
We searched the water
for him for a couple of hours.

540
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,572
- Where's Holgate?
- I don't know.

541
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,401
- Don't lie to me.
- I don't know.

542
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:45,058
Slightly different technique.

543
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,145
You left a man behind,
and you're about to do it again!

544
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,622
Because if we don't get
to Holgate before Grozen does,

545
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,224
he's going to wind up
dead just like Jackson.

546
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,529
Then you have the blood
of two murdered SEALs on your hands.

547
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,684
Holgate's holed up
in a motel in the Valley.

548
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:09,047
<i>So, guys, how we gonna get Grozen</i>
to confess when his own people can't?

549
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,599
Because we've got
something Grozen wants.

550
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,831
... on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.
Next up, the big burner...

551
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:28,936
Wake up, sunshine.
Time to go to work.

552
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:44,034
Hey, remember me?
You shot my partner.

553
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,820
The Navy wants to prosecute as well.

554
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:52,305
Whoever can give him the toughest
sentence should take him to trial.

555
00:36:52,347 --> 00:36:53,877
Oh, I'm good with that.

556
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,099
Don't turn your back
on this guy. He likes to run.

557
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:58,646
Don't worry.
His running days are over.

558
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:05,134
Watch your head.

559
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,916
- Where the hell's the money?
- What money?

560
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:35,753
I'm gonna shoot you right here,
right now. <i>You think I won't?</i>

561
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,828
Are we going to be able
to track him as well?

562
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,435
Like a tagged moose.

563
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:41,375
I'm not going to ask
you a second time.

564
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,052
This guy's going to kill him.

565
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,930
I don't have the money.
My partner does.

566
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,058
- What's his name?
- Raspen.

567
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,105
- Morris Raspen.
<i>- Where do we find him?</i>

568
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,895
Probably at the golf course.

569
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,082
<i>Grozen and Holgate
coming up on your right.</i>

570
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:18,514
Anybody else?

571
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,124
One bogey in the trees
by the clubhouse.

572
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,413
The elusive Mr. Raspen.

573
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,436
I thought your buddy was kidding
when he said the golf course,

574
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,775
but I get it now.

575
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,569
Public place, yet it's wide open,
so you can see anybody approaching.

576
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:44,609
And you'd have to be a sharpshooter
to make a shot from any real cover.

577
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,217
How many SEAL snipers
you got hidden around?

578
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:50,619
- I'm just working on my short game.
- Throw your piece in the pond.

579
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,161
All of them.

580
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,042
Where's the money?

581
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,634
- In the bag.
- Back up for me.

582
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,441
I should have brought a caddy.

583
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,911
Why don't you go join your buddy?

584
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:34,645
Come on.

585
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,046
Put your hands up and drop.

586
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,613
Holgate's hit!

587
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:56,882
- G?
- I'm good.

588
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:58,990
- Kensi?
<i>- We're good. Shooter's down.</i>

589
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:08,155
- Hold this tight. Eric?
- Ambulances are en route.

590
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,200
What happens now?

591
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,660
Only easy day was yesterday.

592
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:43,901
- So what's the word on Holgate?
- He's out of surgery.

593
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,363
Docs figure he'll
have a full recovery.

594
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:48,586
It's still not a lot of fun.

595
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:51,487
Although I do appreciate
him taking a bullet for me.

596
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:54,576
I'm really trying to give up
getting shot so much.

597
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,455
That's the least he could have done.

598
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,734
Everybody go home?

599
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:03,627
For the most part.
Dom and Eric went to a club.

600
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,581
Nate is debriefing Kensi about her
shooting over a Pink's chili hot dog.

601
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:09,675
I don't know where Hetty is.

602
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,803
I'm sure that little ninja's lurking
around here somewhere.

603
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:20,144
I bet you were really
good at Legos as a kid.

604
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:21,819
Legos?

605
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,648
Yeah, those little colored
block things you snap together.

606
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,454
I know what Legos are.

607
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:32,906
So you still mad at Holgate
and those guys for what they did?

608
00:41:36,598 --> 00:41:38,915
I get why they did it.
I get what they did.

609
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:43,504
When you're in combat together,
you trust someone with your life.

610
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:45,169
It's a brotherhood forged in fire.

611
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:50,966
Well, we've been shot at.
A lot of times.

612
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,159
I didn't mean it like that.

613
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,138
We don't have a brotherhood
forged in fire?

614
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,639
Okay, stop.

615
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,516
I even brought you
a beer to cheer you up.

616
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,693
Don't make me break
this rifle out again.

617
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,226
- Love you, man.
- Good night.

618
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:18,702
