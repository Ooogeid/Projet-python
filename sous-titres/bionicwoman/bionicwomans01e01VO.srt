WOMAN Season 01 Episode 01

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,050
4.28AM ****

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,790
I didn't want to.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,890
I'm not in control.

7
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,630
I know.

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,610
Tell me you love me.

9
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,610
I love you.

10
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:34,430
THREE YEARS LATER *****

11
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:38,433
*****

12
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,698
we're out of stoli!

13
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,325
becca!

14
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,723
What?

15
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,692
Your music's too loud.

16
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:42,713
What now?

17
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:44,963
Why is the door locked?
What were you doing?

18
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,342
Where is it?

19
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:53,601
Where's what?

20
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,551
You're not allowed

21
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:57,953
Or do I have to show
you the court order?

22
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,402
Yeah,well,why don't you email it to me?

23
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:00,080
Becca-

24
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:03,080
look,go ahead. Tear the room apart.
Do you see a computer in here?

25
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:06,503
No,which means that the only thing

26
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:08,822
drum roll please-you.

27
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:11,180
I'm driving you to
school in ten minutes.

28
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,160
Too easy.

29
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,281
And you're a prima ballerina

30
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,471
on a spring afternoon

31
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:36,123
Change on into the wolfman

32
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,572
howling at the moon

33
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,220
that's not real food.

34
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,490
You're not a real mom.

35
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,133
What's your problem?

36
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:51,472
You know,dad didn't try to control me.

37
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,922
Dad trusted me,okay?

38
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,752
Dad dropped you off on my doorstep.

39
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,531
You want to live with
dad? Live with dad.

40
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,180
If you can find him.

41
00:03:58,185 --> 00:03:59,901
Here's what to do.

42
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,493
Look for a big protest rally,

43
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,693
then find the nearest bar.

44
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:05,860
You think you remember, but you don'T.

45
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:21,373
The victim of a baghdad car bombing.

46
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:25,123
Needed transplants and
facial reconstructions.

47
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,130
This triathlete was told
he'd never compete again.

48
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,670
For some women, bigger is better.

49
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,272
What these people have in common
is that they have each on some level

50
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,110
altered themselves.

51
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,210
But where's the threshold?

52
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:48,251
When is it okay to
intervene in god's work?

53
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,882
This question's the very
cornerstone of bioethics,

54
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:53,703
And we're gonna spend the rest
of the semester dealing with it.

55
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:58,481
Come on,will, I'm a bartender
and a dropout. You're a professor.

56
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,410
And a surgeon.

57
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,090
How can you take me seriously?

58
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:02,753
What makes you think
i take you seriously?

59
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:04,561
Do you?

60
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,441
Why are you with me?

61
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:09,423
- You're different.
- From what?

62
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:13,013
When your whole life's planned out
for you while you're still in the womb,

63
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:15,083
it kind of kills the mystery.

64
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,770
And then you came along and you were...

65
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:19,270
unexpected.

66
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,591
Unexpected?

67
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:23,020
The one choice my father
didn't make for me.

68
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,101
I gotta run.

69
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,351
- We still on for dinner?
- 8:00?

70
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:33,441
Make it 8:30. I have to go
to the lab for a few hours.

71
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:37,310
While we're on the subject,
why are you with me?

72
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,711
You're not entirely uncharming.

73
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,582
It's insulting.

74
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,710
Last time I left you
alone you started a fire.

75
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,163
The microwave was broken.

76
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,750
We didn't have a microwave.

77
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:54,781
look,they're weird.

78
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:55,793
They're my friends.

79
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,172
Yeah,they're your weird friends.

80
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,153
Please? For me?

81
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,753
Look,tomorrow night.

82
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,300
Double feature?

83
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,972
Deal.

84
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,121
Wow.

85
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,340
You look rocking.

86
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:09,940
I brought pheromones.

87
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,903
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.

88
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,043
Be good!

89
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,732
Have fun.

90
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,403
I think there's a pretty good
chance the grant will come through.

91
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,163
The institute's indicating
it's a done deal.

92
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,562
And I hear paris is
great in the spring,and-

93
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,991
you're not happy.

94
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:33,210
Of course I'm happy.

95
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,692
Because I think you should come with me.

96
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,013
I can'T.

97
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:38,780
- Why not?
- I have a job.

98
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,112
- Jaime.
- And a life.

99
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:41,831
We're talking paris.

100
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:43,821
And I have responsibilities.

101
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:44,700
Did I mention it's paris?

102
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,081
I'm pregnant.

103
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:50,833
Yeah,that's what I said.

104
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:53,061
I don't want you to-

105
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,723
I just-

106
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,312
I know this isn't something
you just spring on someone.

107
00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:00,323
Except for the part where that's
exactly what I'm doing to you right now.

108
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,092
And I know you're in a place where
you can't even think about it.

109
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:04,770
And,god,I'm only 24. It's not-

110
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:07,272
I mean,I said to myself there's
only one thing to do,but-

111
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,272
five months,14 days.

112
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,403
That's how long we've been dating.

113
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:19,042
Jaime,if somebody had asked
me five months and 15 days ago

114
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:23,292
if I believed in love at first sight,
I would've said i absolutely did not.

115
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:27,263
And the very next day i
would've been proved wrong.

116
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,290
- Will- -
marry me.

117
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,461
So I'm thinking coltrane if it's a boy.

118
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,053
Billie if it's a girl.

119
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,410
You don't have to do this,you know.

120
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,870
Actually,I'm pretty sure
you have to name them.

121
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:41,883
I mean you don't have to-

122
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,881
I know, and I'm still asking.
So what does that tell you?

123
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,503
Jaime.

124
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,312
Jaime!

125
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,773
looks like massive internal bleeding.

126
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,000
extensive crush injuries
to right arm and both legs.

127
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:23,852
She's coming up!

128
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:25,832
I need five milligrams of midazolam!

129
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:26,852
Will.

130
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,182
you're gonna be okay,baby. We're
gonna put you back to sleep.

131
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,500
It's gonna be all right. I promise.

132
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,573
It's gonna be okay.

133
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:51,950
WOLF*******

134
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:58,011
WARING*****

135
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,813
bp 95 tell. Pulse ox is 90-20.

136
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:05,221
Multiple compound radial and
ulnar fractures of the right arm.

137
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,751
Severed brachial artery.

138
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,760
Right arm is a shredder. We're looking
at complete ak amputation on both legs.

139
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,072
Neurovascular damage is catastrophic.

140
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:13,051
Lost the fetal heartbeat.

141
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,352
Dr. Anthros, bp's falling,80 systolic.

142
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:18,290
Prep her.

143
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:19,770
- Dr. Anthros,we
can't- - do it!

144
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:21,843
Why didn't somebody stop him?

145
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:25,908
He has full clearance. We didn't
have the authority to stop him.

146
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,345
This is the price you pay for
working with a so-called genius.

147
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,091
Guess he must've left his iq in the car.

148
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,632
Deep reading the ulnar nerve.

149
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,391
Significant damage.

150
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,313
Should I intervene?

151
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:53,091
no.

152
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:56,490
This operation,this patient,
doesn't officially exist.

153
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,413
We have deniability. It's a freebie.
We can always terminate later, need be.

154
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,101
Meanwhil? get jae.

155
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:11,142
It will have to be resected
to its branch point.

156
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,830
Radial nerve appears to be intact.

157
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,531
I need some pressure here.

158
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:56,183
Forgive me,father, for I have sinned.

159
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,411
The doctor. Did you kill him?

160
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,881
It was like a ride at disneyland.

161
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,011
Which one?

162
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,713
I've never been.

163
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:09,381
I'll take you.

164
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:11,700
You'll love it.

165
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,853
It's all fat people

166
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:16,001
with fat children
walking around aimlessly,

167
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,890
too stupid to know the difference.

168
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,852
Do you miss it?

169
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,771
The way things were?

170
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:23,971
If I could remember, I'm sure I would.

171
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,061
Do I remind you of her?

172
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,171
Your skin.

173
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,232
Tell me you love me.

174
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,022
Jaime?

175
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,913
What happened?

176
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:13,471
There was an accident. You're okay.

177
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,390
The baby.

178
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,162
What about the baby?

179
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,223
Oh,god.

180
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,812
There was no permanent damage.

181
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,733
You'll be able to get pregnant again.

182
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,272
Why can't I feel my legs?

183
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,351
Okay,jaime,I need to tell you something.

184
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:42,413
What's happening to me?

185
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,170
I need to tell you about what I do.

186
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,221
And you need to listen to me.

187
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:47,321
- I can't feel my arm.
- Listen to me,jaime.

188
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:52,830
Both your legs and your
arm had to be replaced.

189
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,103
Also your right ear and right eye.

190
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:59,623
Molecular machines-

191
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,451
anthrocytes-

192
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:05,072
have been substituted for
1/8 of your blood cells.

193
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:12,103
Now you should have

194
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:17,841
but the throcytes are healing
you at an exponential rate,

195
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:20,400
all of you. They're making you better.

196
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:38,003
******

197
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,271
It was a dream.

198
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,493
The bionics enhance
baseline human strength.

199
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,831
And then some.

200
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,633
What have you done to me?

201
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:25,582
Jaime-

202
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:26,781
why did you do this to me?

203
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:29,222
You were going to die.

204
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,491
sir.

205
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:09,640
Born jaime wells
sommers, van horne,iowa.

206
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:12,532
February 23,1983.

207
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,741
Mother deceased,cancer.

208
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:18,120
She's clean except for a
sealed court record from 1998.

209
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,310
What's in it?

210
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,931
- It's sealed.
- Unseal it.

211
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,931
I'm working on it.

212
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,431
I think she's a good candidate.

213
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,243
Well,let's pretend i'm
soliciting opinions-why?

214
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:30,843
She's stable.

215
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,902
I pulled up an old minnesota
multiphasic personality inventory.

216
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:36,371
I liked what I saw.

217
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,691
Plus the situation with
her sister shows loyalty.

218
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,120
And she's smart.

219
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,403
I found an old iq test.

220
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,520
How'd she do?

221
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,340
A little better than you...sir.

222
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,510
Jae,can you train her?

223
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,951
Well,the last one we
screened and tested.

224
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:55,960
There were psych evaluations,
and she was a soldier.

225
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,211
Look where that got us.

226
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:00,142
We always talked about
non-military applications.

227
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:00,972
Here's our chance.

228
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,251
Your opinion is invalid here.
You're too close to the subject.

229
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,671
This from the guy who played
house with the last one.

230
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:08,510
Let's get fresh data. I
want you to sit her down.

231
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,223
All right.

232
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,550
you know,I once had a wolf.

233
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:22,560
And a wolf only makes a
good pet thinks he's a dog

234
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,892
now your girlfriend, we're
keeping her here against her will.

235
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:31,041
How long until she realizes that no one
can make her do anything against her will?

236
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:33,191
You're talking about killing a human.

237
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,842
I'm talking about killing a wolf.

238
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:40,150
You know what scares me about you?

239
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,321
Your father.

240
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,823
He seemed normal too.

241
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:48,641
If I'm anything like my father,
you just made a big mistake.

242
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:54,201
All right,we have to get you to rehab.

243
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,322
What for?

244
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,840
Rehabilitation.

245
00:16:56,845 --> 00:17:00,293
I'm not the one performing human
experiments and keeping people prisoner.

246
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,732
You rehabilitate yourself.

247
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,391
Boo.

248
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:48,562
I'm ruth.

249
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,663
I'm pissed.

250
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,113
Good.

251
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,782
We're here to talk about our feelings.

252
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,763
How do you feel about me being
kept here against my will?

253
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,381
I was speaking editorially.

254
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:58,571
Actually,we're here to
talk about your feelings.

255
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:01,490
Something no one seems
to have any regard for.

256
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,851
Curve balls'll do that.

257
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,023
You can have all the
contingency plans you like,

258
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:07,881
and then someone goes and
does something like this,

259
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,261
and then we all have
to stay after school-

260
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,572
and talk about our feelings.

261
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:12,831
Your feelings.

262
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,401
Right.

263
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:17,430
After all,feelings are what
got us here in the first place.

264
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,953
You like to draw.

265
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:29,352
- True or false-
- I have a sister.

266
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,742
She's staying with your landlady.

267
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:34,331
She thinks you're skiing in vail.

268
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:37,203
This is where you stayed. It looks nice.

269
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,570
You had fun.

270
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,220
Except for the part where will
injured his arm skiing into a tree.

271
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,630
Does this mean I'll be
going home at some point?

272
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:48,802
It means that we have a contingency plan
should you be going home at some point.

273
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:52,722
We also have a plan should you not.

274
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,682
True or false.

275
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:57,343
You can't teach an old dog new tri

276
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,282
you would've done the same thing.

277
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,832
You never met my wife, did you?

278
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:27,711
For two years I watched her in a
hospital while they disassembled her.

279
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:31,602
And the whole time I knew all I had
to do to save her was bring her here,

280
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,861
but saving my wife was not the mission.

281
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,720
Ruth says she's stable.

282
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,690
How long until she's combat ready?

283
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,561
She's a civilian.

284
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:46,623
Everyone has to sing for their supper around
here,will, or haven't you figured that out yet?

285
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:53,251
How long until the rest of
her implants come online?

286
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,320
She likes to draw.

287
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:08,471
I don't care.

288
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,561
I think you'll care about this.

289
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,541
Who did they bury?

290
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:27,021
I mean,did you ever see the body?

291
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,423
You show this to anybody else?

292
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:29,211
St you.

293
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,691
Keep it that way.

294
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:42,140
security breach. Security breach.

295
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,042
I can't protect you in here,
but once you're on the outside-

296
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,971
why should I trust you?

297
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,262
Because I'm the only one you can trust.

298
00:20:57,276 --> 00:20:59,273
Go back to your life like
none of this ever happened.

299
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,240
I'll work it our with them.

300
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:01,650
What about you?

301
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:03,752
Go now.

302
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,451
All right,so I'll have those faxed
over to you by friday afternoon.

303
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,303
And we're still on for
that meeting tomorrow?

304
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,211
Okay,good.

305
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:58,862
Yeah.

306
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,322
Mm-hmm.

307
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:03,991
Mommy...

308
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:07,203
there's a lady out there running
really fast. Like as fast as a car.

309
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,652
Sweetie,what did I tell
you about making things up?

310
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:14,212
I just thought it was cool that
a girl could do that. That's all.

311
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:20,701
Let her go.

312
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,061
What the hell did you do?

313
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,631
You want her,right?

314
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:27,451
For the program. I'll make
her understand what's at stake.

315
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,653
Just let me have time-

316
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,753
time to what?

317
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,541
Letting her go is not a bad idea.

318
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,310
If you want her loyalty,
give her freedom.

319
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,582
Or the illusion of freedom.

320
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,473
All right. Everybody stand down.

321
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,500
move out.

322
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:51,251
You're making a mistake.

323
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,271
Listen to me.

324
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,262
The accident wasn't an accident.

325
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:59,652
According to the autopsy, the driver's
neck was broken an hour before the crash,

326
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,902
which means someone else
was driving that truck.

327
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:03,803
We need to find out who.

328
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:17,003
I have done it again

329
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:22,801
and the worst part is

330
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:27,583
there's no one else

331
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:31,573
jaime,it's will. Jaime,if
you're there, pick up the phone.

332
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,703
I need to talk to you.

333
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:35,953
Jaime,please.

334
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:40,223
There are things I need
to tell you about...

335
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:42,690
before they happen.

336
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,723
I am small

337
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:26,570
I'm really me

338
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:50,991
Nice of you to show up.

339
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,633
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,992
Yeah,what for?

341
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,570
For leaving and not telling you first.

342
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,633
How was skiing?

343
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,190
It was fine.

344
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:12,900
Dad used to always say don't believe
anything until it's been denied.

345
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:13,483
Becca-

346
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,531
look,don't lie to me,okay?

347
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:18,453
We both know you don't ski.

348
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,551
So where were you?

349
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,742
I
- I can't tell you.

350
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:54,081
YOU FAILED ME

351
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:04,853
- Coffee.
- Sure.

352
00:26:11,245 --> 00:26:12,942
There's no smoking.

353
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:19,153
What are you? A forest ranger?

354
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:22,302
Something like that.

355
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:27,730
Must be scary.

356
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:30,491
Alone in the forest,
just you and the elves.

357
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,983
Not if they know who's in charge.

358
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,372
Hey,wait up!

359
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,913
Guard.

360
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:50,530
We both know you work in a super-max
prison 1,000 feet below florence.

361
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:53,981
We both know this is the
place where they stick people

362
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,781
when they outlive their usefulness.

363
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:56,633
I don't know who you are-

364
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:58,260
if you don't do exactly what you say,

365
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:01,020
my man is gonna carve your wife
barbara up like venus de milo.

366
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,801
oh,god,bobby,help me.

367
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:17,653
BLACKWELL******

368
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,690
How'd you do it?

369
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,771
Do you know what they call
creatures that can live comfortably

370
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,762
in environments considered lethal,

371
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:32,642
say for instance 1,000 feet
below the earth's surface-

372
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:33,603
how did you do it?

373
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:35,732
Extremophiles.

374
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,610
I'll do an impression
of one for you. Ready?

375
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,631
How did you-

376
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:45,442
what? How did I do what?

377
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:47,750
Sarah corvus is still alive.

378
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,031
And you came all the
way here to tell me that.

379
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,151
Let me do another impression for you.

380
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:56,003
Impression of man who's
been stabbed in the back,

381
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,821
stripped of his rights, and
thrown in a hole like a dog.

382
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,963
Sarah corvus is a time bomb.

383
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:02,871
We both know it.

384
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:06,293
Well,time bombs only matter
to those who have time.

385
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,513
Good-bye,jae.

386
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:11,531
Please give my regards to will.

387
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,321
Tell him daddy says hello.

388
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,570
Guards!

389
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:29,362
if I may make an observation.

390
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,752
You seem way too innocent
and sweet to be running a bar.

391
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,853
You should be out there
with the rest of them.

392
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:37,432
Finally,I'm not the only
person that feels that way.

393
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,880
What can I get you?

394
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:39,961
Beer.

395
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,060
On the house.

396
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,060
Thank you.

397
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:49,551
Don't I know you?

398
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:51,792
We met very briefly.

399
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,481
We didn't even actually meet.

400
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:54,593
Where?

401
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:55,941
Guess.

402
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:57,162
Aah!

403
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,070
Are you all right?

404
00:28:59,075 --> 00:28:59,991
Yeah.

405
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,131
Let me take a look at it.

406
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,682
No,that's okay.

407
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,270
Are you okay?

408
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:34,333
come on,your boyfriend will never know.

409
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:36,863
Come on,lisa.

410
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:45,302
Are you all right?

411
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,632
let me help you.

412
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:08,133
Just breath.

413
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:15,761
It's like that the first time the ear

414
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,440
It's too much information.

415
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:21,950
You have to learn how to focus
it and turn it off and on at will.

416
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:31,053
You're a fast healer.

417
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:34,090
The anthrocytes are doing their job.

418
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,843
Who are you?

419
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:39,263
Who are you?

420
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,340
jaime.

421
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,273
Jaime.

422
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:10,061
Tell everyone sarah corvus says hello.

423
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,630
yo!

424
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,493
You looking for something?

425
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,482
You need something? Huh?

426
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:50,611
Here,baby.

427
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,711
I got what you need.

428
00:32:02,427 --> 00:32:04,531
Please!

429
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:08,331
Please
don't- don't-

430
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:27,633
Are you okay?

431
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:28,723
Tell me what you put in my head.

432
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,070
- Jaime- - I
almost killed a man.

433
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,843
I didn't even know what I was
doing. What did you put in my head?

434
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:38,220
Microscopic chips have been
implanted in your cerebral cortex.

435
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:43,513
My father developed the
technology for the military.

436
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:46,440
The program was meant to
help amputees in the gulf.

437
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:48,761
Of course he saw the combat
applications immediately.

438
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,623
You made me into a soldier.

439
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:53,071
You're hardwired for highly
specialized warfare,yes.

440
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,460
I was gonna kill him. I would have.

441
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,010
But you didn'T. You're still in
control. And with the proper training-

442
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:57,931
training?

443
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:00,423
Jaime,we're the only
ones that can protect you.

444
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,981
Let me protect you.

445
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:04,040
How can you protect me
if you're scared of me?

446
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:07,652
I never meant for any
of this to touch you.

447
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:09,963
I didn't,I just-

448
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:13,123
I couldn't bear to lose you.

449
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:44,342
That isn't even me.

450
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:47,672
Yes,it is.

451
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:09,350
hey.

452
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:10,720
Hey.

453
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:12,250
I have to get back to becca.

454
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,683
I can't keep leaving her like this.

455
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:14,650
Jaime-

456
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
what do you people do, anyway?

457
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,762
It's complicated.

458
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,431
Try me.

459
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:27,001
The world's further along
than anyone wants to admit.

460
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:31,282
Technology is at the point where
science fiction isn't fiction anymore.

461
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:34,750
We keep that technology from
getting into the wrong hands.

462
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:37,290
Who gets to decide right from wrong?

463
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:44,083
What about sarah corvus? Where
does she figure in all of this?

464
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,241
Where did you hear that name?

465
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:51,462
Where did you hear that name,jaime?

466
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,872
Will!

467
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:19,061
Will.

468
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:21,331
- I'm sorry.
- Just hold on,okay?

469
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,000
Where is she?

470
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,761
I need everyone.

471
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,563
Time-out.

472
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:08,261
The anthrocytes in our blood can
filter out any impurities in our lungs.

473
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:12,442
Fringe benefit of being a freak.

474
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,282
What do you want from me?

475
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:17,013
Honestly,I'm not sure.

476
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:18,923
Jogging partner?

477
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,733
Who are you?

478
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:24,181
Without being too melodramatic about
the whole thing, I'm sarah corvus...

479
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:27,513
the first bionic woman.

480
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,000
Tah-dah.

481
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:34,913
So what did they replace?

482
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:39,103
I figured the eyes and
the ears. What else?

483
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:44,163
Me,they did both arms,
both legs. Only one eye.

484
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:48,100
Anthros wasn't sure about
the optical interface.

485
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:51,313
So I did the other one myself.

486
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:55,752
Part of my chest too.

487
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,763
I'm cutting away all the
parts of me that are w

488
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:08,590
time in.

489
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:25,462
You only have one bionic arm.

490
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,603
You should really do
something about that.

491
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,560
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

492
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,321
How am I doing now?

493
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,383
Not bad.

494
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:43,950
Not bad at all.

495
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:13,910
we have 39-year-old
male caucasian,

496
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,663
gunshot victim to the left shoulder.

497
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,601
Request assistance from mercy general.

498
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,462
10-4,notifying mercy general.

499
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,571
Transport when ready.

500
00:40:20,577 --> 00:40:22,523
Will gonna make it?

501
00:40:46,646 --> 00:40:48,802
Ms. Sommers.

502
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,720
Just wanted to get a look at you.

503
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:53,600
Who are you?

504
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:59,083
You have $50 million worth of my property inside
you, so I guess you could say i'm your landlord.

505
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:01,713
What do you want from me?

506
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:05,773
I don't know. Maybe you died three days
ago and you just haven't realized it yet.

507
00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:07,401
Is that a threat?

508
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,540
There are no free
agents here,ms. Sommers.

509
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,632
Sooner or later you're gonna
have to make a choice. 

510
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,453
It goes something like this.
Heads,you lose. Tails,you die.

511
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,422
Welcome to the game.

512
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:23,803
Hey!

513
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:32,051
If we do this, whatever this is,

514
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:34,490
we do it on my terms.

515
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:38,132
If that's not okay with you,

516
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:40,723
I know what i'm capable of now.

517
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:44,073
So you send whoever you send,

518
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:47,581
and I'll bury one guy after the next

519
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:50,620
you understand me?

520
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:58,191
By the way... sarah corvus says hello.

521
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:07,661
Tell jae we have a candidate.

522
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:32,432
SONORY *****

523
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:41,182
What are you doing?

524
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:44,951
I haven't seen the moon in 1,023 days.

525
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:47,930
It hasn't changed. Let's go.

526
00:42:48,437 --> 00:42:50,530
We have work to do.
