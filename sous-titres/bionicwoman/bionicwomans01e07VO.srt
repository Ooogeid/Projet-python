00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:02,915
<i>Previously on Bionic Woman</i>

2
00:00:03,057 --> 00:00:04,862
Dinner, tomorrow night.

3
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:07,634
But that guy Tom is under some scrutiny.

4
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:10,914
He only has a paper trail for the last
six years. Before that, nothing.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,422
We have to assume that
he's the enemy, Jamie.

6
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:14,817
I don't believe it.

7
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:17,348
My gut tells me he has
nothing to do with this.

8
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,998
the last time you listened
to your gut about a guy,

9
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:21,872
you had your limbs replaced.

10
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,731
Who's gonna have my back in there.

11
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:25,896
We'll be with you every
step of the way, okay?

12
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,121
- You're the good guy.
- Well, CIA.

13
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,183
It's open to interpretation.

14
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,065
This time we came out ahead.

15
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:35,284
- Could've done better.
- I was thinking about Tom.

16
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,085
I was thinking about you.

17
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,166
God, you're beautiful.

18
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,484
Hey, Agent Hastings.

19
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,251
Hey yourself, Agent Sommers.

20
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,306
So, I was just calling to make sure

21
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,538
we were still on for the family
dinner tomorrow.

22
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>You're keen.</i>

23
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,743
I thought it was
"my sister's making dinner".

24
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,678
<i>- What she making?
- Pasta carbonara, that I actually hate.</i>

25
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:25,014
- But don't tell her.
- So what are you doing right now?

26
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,546
Working.

27
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,074
And what are you wearing?

28
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,700
You can't ask me that now.

29
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,017
<i>All right, all right,
I got it, carry on.</i>

30
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:40,581
<i>Just be careful.</i>

31
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,165
Okay? Don't do anything crazy.
No heroics.

32
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,467
I'll call you back.

33
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,565
So where were we?

34
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:28,292
Don't do anything crazy.

35
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,442

Synchro : bbd1980, Kasius, IceFre@k

37
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,237
Jaim, we don't have heavy cream
or bacon, do we?

38
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:57,323
- You making a heart attack?
- Do you want me to cook dinner

39
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,764
- for your boyfriend or not?
- I want you to cook for him.

40
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,376
I don't want you to kill him.

41
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:02,701
And he's not my boyfriend.

42
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,070
Tell your face that.

43
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,036
Really, it's nice to see you happy.

44
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,762
I mean, you tell more jokes,
you buy me more stuff...

45
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,004
'Cause I'm inherently selfish
and I want this to continue,

46
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,683
I'm gonna make you make
a good impression on this guy tonight.

47
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,931
Just leave it all up to me.
I will take care of it.

48
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:19,228
Great. All right.

49
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,918
Can I have 50 bucks to pay for all this?

50
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,522
Morning, chatty.

51
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:31,658
Chatty?

52
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,748
Yeah, I took a look
at your cell phone log.

53
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,296
You were talking to Tom
while you were out...

54
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,418
It's not your job to monitor my calls.

55
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:40,734
I'm just saying...

56
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:43,384
Had you not been distracted,

57
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,596
you could've taken the guy out
with a lot less risk.

58
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:46,758
What risk?

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,404
I'm bionic.

60
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,738
You're bionic, not immortal.

61
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,768
And the risk I'm talking about
is not you.

62
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,475
It's to Berkut.

63
00:04:57,913 --> 00:04:58,913
Exposure.

64
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,578
Don't worry about it. You're learning.

65
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,274
A general rule of thumb:

66
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,731
Relationships and counterespionage
don't mix.

67
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,073
Is that why James Bond never
had a steady girlfriend?

68
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:10,463
I think having a steady girlfriend
is overrated.

69
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:11,817
You're such a guy.

70
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,951
50-caliber depleted uranium tip.

71
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,608
This thing will eat your guts.

72
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:21,441
- Created specifically for...
- For the chambliss...

73
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,730
optical tracking system.

74
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,553
Which gives this rifle

75
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:28,159
an effective range up to...

76
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,163
2-1/2 miles.

77
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:33,787
Lethality...

78
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,419
100%.

79
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,608
2-1/2 miles.
That's further than I can see.

80
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:43,919
Well, at least a mile and half farther
than any other rifle on earth.

81
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,596
- Something the world really needed.
- We developped it.

82
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:49,258
- We Berkut?
- No, we the United States of America.

83
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,619
Fortunately, we recovered
four dozen rounds

84
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,955
from your bad driver last night.
However,

85
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,307
the army managed to lose
six dozen rounds along with the way.

86
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,046
- Lose?
- It was stolen out of an armored vault.

87
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,377
It ended up pointed at president Rudhan,
dictator of Imara, two weeks ago.

88
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,941
So if the ammunition is in this country
now, then...

89
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:08,506
Then the rifle is too.

90
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,119
And president Rudhan will be here
in three days.

91
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,134
He has horse racing
at the Bay Maiden Cup.

92
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,708
Supposedly he trained the horse himself.

93
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,424
Why, is somebody trying to kill him?

94
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,950
Along with being good with horses,
he rules by political terror,

95
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,740
abduction, assassination, torture.

96
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:27,198
And that's not just people
he doesn't trust.

97
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,552
Their families, the villages,
old people.

98
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,715
I know. I spent some time there.

99
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,920
We're gonna protect this guy?

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,136
Listen, they could kill him
all day long in Imara,

101
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,920
but if it happens here, it's only gonna
empower the anti-american nationalists.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,075
Leaving a power vacuum in Imara.

103
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,458
To be occupied by
a fresh generation of jihadists.

104
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,225
Taliban comes to Africa.

105
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,790
Right, so we protect the bad guy.

106
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:13,751
Every move His Excellency will be making
while in this country is shown here.

107
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,862
We trust that you,
along with the CIA and Secret Service,

108
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,265
will assure that his visit is
a pleasant one.

109
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:22,406
Security won't be a problem.

110
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,359
Personally, I don't see the need
for American bodyguards.

111
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:27,285
I have complete confidence in my men.

112
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:31,009
The Imaran security forces are
the most respected soldiers in Africa.

113
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,083
Feared is a more accurate word.

114
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:36,728
- You don't like our country?
- No, I love your country.

115
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,476
It's your genocidal dictator that...

116
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,986
No, not as much.

117
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:44,326
Look at the time, we should do that
perimeter check before it gets dark.

118
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:45,797
It's easy to sit in judgment.

119
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,548
But we are trying to build a nation
from the ruins of colonial exploition.

120
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,260
Our country would be torn apart

121
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,652
without a strong leader
to keep the peace.

122
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,758
Peace? What kind of peace
are you talking about?

123
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:58,154
I was there,

124
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,913
and I watched your president
kill thousands of his own people.

125
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,296
So what are we looking for?

126
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,923
Places with a clear shot

127
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:14,292
and a good hide.

128
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,119
If the President'suite here, then...

129
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:20,216
It won't be there, because there's
a helipad on the rooftop next-door.

130
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:23,823
It won't be there...

131
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,060
because that building
overlooks that one.

132
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,628
If i had the pleasure of taking
this monster down, I would be alone

133
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,116
on that rooftop...

134
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:34,158
Right there.

135
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:42,743
You've done this before, haven't you?

136
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,693
Taken people out on rooftops.

137
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:50,198
"People sleep peaceably
in their beds at night "

138
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,315
because rough men stand ready
to do violence on their behalf.

139
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:56,287
Churchill?

140
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,889
No, George Orwell.

141
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,537
Damn, I gotta get out here.

142
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,038
I have my therapy session with Ruth,
and then dinner with Tom and Becca.

143
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,488
You got balls, I'll give you that.

144
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:12,063
- An hour with Ruth can be torture.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

145
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:14,252
A relationship with a CIA operative?

146
00:09:14,474 --> 00:09:17,214
After everything you've been through
with relationships lately?

147
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,774
- You just can't keep your nose out.
- The world we work in is too intense.

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,757
This relationship is never gonna work.

149
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,673
- Who is she?
- Who?

150
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,855
The woman who broke you.

151
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,036
Come on.

152
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,775
Why do women always think it's a woman?

153
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,669
I'm gonna get it out of you.

154
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:51,665
New shoes, Ruth?

155
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:55,679
Maybe we should talk about why you've
been resisting these therapy sessions.

156
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,222
Am I?

157
00:09:58,354 --> 00:10:01,565
Well, I guess because you guys make me
come to them and they're boring.

158
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,626
I feel like a science experiment.

159
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,688
Well, these sessions are
designed to help you.

160
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,564
You know what would help me, Ruth?

161
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,568
If you told me about your day,
and how you're feeling.

162
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,904
I'm a psychiatrist. We don't do that.

163
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,980
Come on, Ruth. Break the rules.

164
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:16,168
Knock yourself out.

165
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,541
I mean, this place is hardly inducive
to opening up and feeling comfortable.

166
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,043
- You mean my office.
- Berkut.

167
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:26,679
This place is about as warm
as a hospital bathroom.

168
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,058
Would it kill you guys
to put up a painting?

169
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,290
A plant?

170
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:31,624
Rock it a bit.

171
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,333
Time's up.

172
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,479
Thanks, Doc. It's been a pleasure.

173
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,728
Jaime, stop, no.
I've already got everything

174
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,792
how it's supposed to be.
Don't touch anything.

175
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,280
Calm down. It's just dinner.

176
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,980
- Calm down. It's just dinner, okay?
- Wait here, okay?

177
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,717
I think I just won mystery date.

178
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:16,868
Here. These are for you.

179
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:17,988
Thanks.

180
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,125
And this.

181
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,245
Thank you.

182
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,998
Tom, I'd like you to meet my sister.

183
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,047
- It's great to meet you finally.
- You too.

184
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,730
I've heard so many things about you.

185
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:34,123
Come on in. We're actually not gonna
have dinner out in the hallway.

186
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,707
Well, I'm relieved about that.

187
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,231
Got these.

188
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:43,493
She is adorable.

189
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:44,807
I know.

190
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,845
So, Tom...

191
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,343
how long have you been involved
in calculator manufacturing?

192
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,093
I moved over to the company
five years ago.

193
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:57,407
Wait, so how dooes an executive
at a calculator company

194
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,892
and a girl who sells time-shares,
how do you meet exactly?

195
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:02,042
- He bought a time-share.
- I bought a time-share.

196
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,583
That's fun.

197
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,061
Where was the time-share?

198
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,770
- Florida.
- Istanbul.

199
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,045
No, it wasn't in Istanbul.

200
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,009
Who buys a time-share in Istanbul?

201
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,357
I'm joking.

202
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,954
So who asked out who?

203
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:16,243
I asked her out.

204
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:20,116
I took one look at her, and I knew
I wasn't leaving until I asked her out.

205
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,506
In fact, she's the reason
why I bought a time-share in Florida.

206
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,861
I hate Florida.

207
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:36,783
<i>- Hello.
- Jaime.</i>

208
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:38,645
Sudden change of plans.

209
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:42,402
President Rudhan is arriving
at the airport right now.

210
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm on my way.

211
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:48,967
I am so sorry.

212
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,439
Big sale?

213
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:53,753
Huge sale.

214
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,560
There's a big thing,
and they need a heavy hitter.

215
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,071
And I just have to go, okay?

216
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,840
I'll make it up to you. I'm sorry.

217
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,185
Enjoy your meal.

218
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,357
Bye.

219
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,830
Watch out for those other brokers.

220
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:13,893
She does that sometimes.

221
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:18,424
What is this?

222
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,096
<i>It's Air Traffic Control 2.0.</i>

223
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:25,129
I don't remember getting excited
over version 1.0.

224
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,976
5,000 planes in the air
at any given time,

225
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:31,517
and you're not excited by the software
that keep them from colliding.

226
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,084
Narrow thinking, Jonas.

227
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:34,636
What's got to do with us?

228
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:35,756
Well, I was...

229
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,958
checking out air trafic patterns
in preparation for Rudhan's flight

230
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,428
in three days. But...

231
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,025
2.0 alerted some unusual activity.

232
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:46,396
<i>Imara flight, four eight charlie,
slow to one six zero.</i>

233
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,304
<i>Descend and maintain 4,000.</i>

234
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:49,747
<i>Vector to approach.</i>

235
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,084
Don't get lot of private planes
registered in Imara flying to the US.

236
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,177
Maybe Rudhan's bringing in
extra security.

237
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,513
This is why you're gonna add genius
to my title.

238
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,948
See, the software also gives me
access to the computer

239
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,940
in security cameras air
in Imara's airfield.

240
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,285
That's president Rudhan.

241
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,198
He boarded a plane 12 hours ago.

242
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,126
He's trying to sneak in under the radar.
Get Jaime on the line.

243
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,633
That airfield's unsecured.

244
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:22,033
Thank you, Nathan.
I'm glad somebody here is excited by...

245
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,538
advances in aviation
and traffic control."

246
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,746
The president of Imara's had a change
of plan. He's arriving at the airport.

247
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,776
It's a perfect opportunity
for the sniper.

248
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,309
I'm already on my way.
Antonio called me ten minutes ago.

249
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,736
He couldn't have. I just found out.

250
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:43,457
Whatever. I'm my way.

251
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,885
I am so sorry.
She's not usually like this.

252
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,856
I mean, she's usually
a pretty considerate person.

253
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:05,106
I guess she just takes her job
responsabilities really seriously.

254
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,018
Try not to take it personally,
because it's not about you.

255
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:10,543
I mean, you're nice,
I think she really likes you.

256
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,315
So I bet the last thing
you want to do right now

257
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,601
is having polite dinner conversation
with some old guy you just met.

258
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,559
How about we start fresh?

259
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,144
Take a rain check.
I'll take the two of you out to some...

260
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,058
fabulous dinner at a great restaurant.

261
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,620
Maybe next week?

262
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,885
It was great meeting you finally.

263
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,243
You too.

264
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,809
And...

265
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:56,089
You know, Jaime's lucky
to have a sister like you.

266
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,358
And I'm pretty sure she knows it.

267
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,432
- All right.
- Bye.

268
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,243
Yeah, I'm here.

269
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,468
She just left a few minutes ago.

270
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,431
Secure the president.
Get him away from the plane!

271
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,290
What are you talking about?

272
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,972
Move, move! Come on!

273
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,223
Bomani, we need to get the president

274
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,285
out of the city,
out of the country immediately.

275
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,172
That is not going to happen.

276
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,596
Let me talk to him.

277
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,451
I apologize.

278
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,405
They don't always have
the best of manners.

279
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,360
What do you want to tell me?

280
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,612
You're not safe here.

281
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,925
You need to get on that plane
and go home.

282
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,762
I mean, come on, it's a horse race.

283
00:17:57,882 --> 00:18:00,683
- It's not worth dying over.
- How much time ve you spent in Imara?

284
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,350
That would be none.

285
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm not afraid to die for my beliefs
and my people.

286
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:16,325
- I thought I might see you here.
- You're on this case?

287
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:18,731
They just called me in for backup.

288
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,358
- Where's your protective gear?
- Tom, don't start.

289
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,503
This isn't me thinking
you can't handle yourself.

290
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,609
This is me thinking
about a sniper bullet that big

291
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,195
which almost blew out your brains.

292
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:29,714
This is so typical of Berkut.

293
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:32,769
- They think rules don't apply to them.
- The CIA always goes by the book?

294
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,396
- You mind?
- Actually, I do.

295
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,425
You're talking to my partner, causing
yet another distraction. Back off.

296
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:39,849
- I'll call you later.
- Why don't you tell your partner

297
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,058
you don't show up to a mission
with no protection.

298
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,629
- She doesn't have a weapon!
- You are way in over your head,

299
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,077
you don't even know it.
Let's go. We've got work to do.

300
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,568
I told you CIA boy was a bad idea.

301
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,624
I don't need relationship advice
from you, Antonio.

302
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:07,156
I spy with my little eye...

303
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,199
What is it, Sommers?

304
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,442
What's that?

305
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:24,094
I don't know. A piece of rubber?

306
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,648
I'm not sure if I should trust you
with it.

307
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,019
- Why is that?
- You want to tell me why you knew

308
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:31,796
that guy arriving at the airport
before Jonas even called me?

309
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,748
Believe it or not,
my good friend Bomani called me.

310
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,139
You want to level with me
about this woman thing?

311
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:45,155
I was undercover in Africa
about three years ago,

312
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,653
working with a woman.

313
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:50,801
We were assigned on point
on a raid for...

314
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,624
a terrorist training camp.

315
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,702
We got the location, but they got her.

316
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:58,008
I knew they were gonna torture her,
but I had to do my job.

317
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:00,125
Get back with the intel...

318
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:03,013
and leave her there.

319
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:06,322
She was still there
when the first cruise missile arrived.

320
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:09,674
The missiles were right on target.

321
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,063
It was considered a good mission.

322
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,506
I'm so sorry, Antonio.

323
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:21,657
Oh, my god,
you just made the whole thing up.

324
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,509
Screw you.

325
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,848
What, you don't need a story
to trust me, Jaime.

326
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,362
Just trust me!

327
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,666
I'm off to Berkut to show
what we learned in school today!

328
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,747
I'm right behind you!

329
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:50,855
This is all you got?

330
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:52,824
I'll run some tests on it.

331
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:54,983
How long is it gonna take
to run these tests?

332
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:58,270
You have given me a all piece of rubber.
Don't give me attitude.

333
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,171
In that case, I'll be at home.

334
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,201
I have to go let Becca yell at me.

335
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,611
Could I show you something?

336
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:14,949
Sure.

337
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:22,011
I got a plant.

338
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,834
I want you to be comfortable here.

339
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,606
- Hi
- Hey, Becs.

340
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,011
I'm so sorry I had to leave you earlier.

341
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,029
Look, don't screw this one up, okay?

342
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,156
He's a great guy.

343
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,008
He's smart.

344
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,055
Funny, kind.

345
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:00,459
He's crazy about you.

346
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:04,523
He's so much better than
those loser guys you usually date.

347
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,406
Sorry, I know, that's just how I feel.

348
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:11,466
I know you have
a wild self-destructive streak.

349
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:13,383
Just...

350
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,135
Just keep that under control, okay?

351
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,182
I threw out the carbonara.

352
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,824
I know how much you love it,
but it doesn't keep, so...

353
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:26,642
'Night, Becca.

354
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:17,760
Hello.

355
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm in bed.</i>

356
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:35,682
Really? What are you wearing?

357
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,384
Focus, Nathan.

358
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:39,821
Why are you calling me?

359
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,237
To gloat.

360
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:45,499
I ran my little tests
on that ridiculously small

361
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,544
so-called piece of evidence
you guys game me

362
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,160
seven hours ago, and already...

363
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:52,787
Already have a solid lead
on where the guy might be.

364
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,145
Fill me in.

365
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,748
<i>What you guys gave me</i>

366
00:23:56,286 --> 00:24:00,260
was a piece of the sole
of a high-end sneaker.

367
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,668
On it was chlorinated residue

368
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:05,079
found in residential fountains.

369
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:08,252
I traced it back
to the waterfall apartments.

370
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,375
Antonio is on his way
over there right now.

371
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:11,821
Is there a team on the way?

372
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,211
<i>No, he said the guy would see that
mile away.</i>

373
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:15,834
He's gonna handle it by himself.

374
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,198
<i>- Without me?
- He said not to bother you.</i>

375
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:20,255
Just let you sleep.
Said he could handle it.

376
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:24,159
Now would be the part where you say,

377
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,676
"Really, really great work."

378
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,693
"You're so smart and hot,"

379
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,021
<i>and...</i>

380
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:44,013
<i>- She exited the building.
- She appears unarmed.</i>

381
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,447
Where'd she go?

382
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:55,325
Why are you following me?

383
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,815
You're gonna have to talk
to agent Hastings.

384
00:24:58,278 --> 00:24:59,530
You gotta be kidding me.

385
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,301
I don't have time for this.

386
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:04,843
Okay, you know what?
You tell Tom Hastings you...

387
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,710
You know what? I'll tell him myself.

388
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:17,771
<i>I'm unavailable,
so please leave a message.</i>

389
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,876
Where the hell are you, Antonio?

390
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:40,092
<i>- Nice place, right?
- Absolutely.</i>

391
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:41,524
<i>I'm glad you could come.</i>

392
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:44,767
<i>I can't do this anymore!</i>

393
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:46,584
<i>- Come here.
- Get your hands off me!</i>

394
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,922
<i>You're crazy! How can I argue with...</i>

395
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,434
They know you were here.

396
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:06,655
Stay away.

397
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,412
What are you doing here?
I thought I told Nathan to let you sleep

398
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,482
We're partners.

399
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:36,214
You right.

400
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,000
Let's go

401
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,427
He's gone.

402
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,414
Antonio is communicating
with the assassin.

403
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:32,473
Are you sure?

404
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,995
Of course, I'm sure. you want to
argue with the ear?

405
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:36,382
You think about it.

406
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:38,705
He knew the president
was arriving sooner than you did.

407
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:42,374
He told Nathan not to bother me,
he'd be fine by himself.

408
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,167
He just stood there lying to me.

409
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,560
Going through the motions.

410
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,768
- And what did you do?
- Nothing.

411
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,514
I just pretended I didn't hear him.

412
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,524
I haven't been doing this
very long, remember?

413
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,688
You did fine, you did fine.

414
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:58,502
I knew he was stationed in Imara 5 years
ago, and I knew he had strong feelings

415
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,315
about the leaderships there, but I
didn't know they were this strong.

416
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:05,607
- You're gonna have to bring him in.
- No, you're gonna have to bring him in.

417
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,035
You're gonna give Antonio
false information.

418
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:10,919
that the president of Imara is
changing his box at the racetrack.

419
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,466
We'll stay on his ass.
Bust him and the shooter.

420
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,396
a little change of plans.

421
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,585
Really.

422
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,325
Rudhan's security told us
they've changed the location

423
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:27,483
of the president's box. He's now
gonna be sitting down below.

424
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,024
Right there

425
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:30,900
That totally changes
the sniper sight-wise.

426
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,638
Yeah, what do you want to do?

427
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,293
I'll take the tower

428
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,189
and you can take this other one.

429
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:37,733
We can cover this, right?

430
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:38,645
Yeah.

431
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,712
Let's go do it.

432
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,273
What's up with you today?

433
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,589
Nothing.

434
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,134
Something happen with you and CIA dude?

435
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:55,814
Maybe.

436
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,048
I won't say I told you so.

437
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:00,587
But they never seem to work out
in this line of work.

438
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:03,257
If that's the truth, then why
do you still do it?

439
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,701
Sometimes I don't know.

440
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,161
Sorry I didnt'call. I heard you
took out two of my agents.

441
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,797
I can't believe you have me followed.

442
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:21,718
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- That's not why they followed you.

443
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,814
Really why then?

444
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,375
When someone in the CIA starts a...

445
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,314
Relationship... they have to
tell the organisation.

446
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:32,193
then they check that person out,
that's all.

447
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,335
So I told them that.

448
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:35,698
You are my girlfriend.

449
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:38,766
Right.

450
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,616
You know, are you who you say you are,
and do you live where you say you live.

451
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,549
Normal stuff in our line of work.

452
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:45,775
Okay.

453
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,682
Are you okay with that.

454
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
I don't know.

455
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:55,523
I have so much going on right now.

456
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,781
Well, what's going on?

457
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,417
I can't tell you

458
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:00,776
I'll call you later, OK?

459
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:01,862
Bye

460
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:32,975
<i>Ladies and gentlemens,</i>

461
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:35,395
<i>The official results are in on race 8.</i>

462
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:38,461
<i>Sabrina's bride in first paying $12.80.</i>

463
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,549
<i>Straight up no out in second
paying $5.90.</i>

464
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,340
<i>Hanna's gold to show paying $4.50.</i>

465
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,569
<i>Red Ridge? He's up in the next race.</></i>

466
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:37,712
<i>Yeah, I saw.</i>

467
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:44,314
<i>The horses are on their way to the gate</i>

468
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,574
<i>for the Bay maiden cup.</i>

469
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,686
<i>A graded stakes race
for the million dollars purse...</i>

470
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:51,440
<i>All betting windows are now open.</i>

471
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:12,741
You gonna tell me what the hell
is going on?

472
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,626
I heard you with the assassin.

473
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,354
I know you're in on this.

474
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:17,647
Did you tell Jonas?

475
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:18,837
I had tell him.

476
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,245
I'm not working with the assassin
but I do know her.

477
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:27,097
Her?

478
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,476
Will you just tell me the truth?

479
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,659
We were station together in Amara
about three years ago

480
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,312
We saw a lot of bad things.

481
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,700
She's been working underground against
the Imaran governement ever since.

482
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,820
She's in too deep.

483
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:41,862
She's lost. It happens.

484
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,740
When I heard about
the assassination attemps,

485
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,547
I felt like it might be her.

486
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:48,245
The night at the airport,
I found a cartridge hand-loaded.

487
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:49,652
One done by her.

488
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:50,773
To a shooter,

489
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,170
That is as distinctive as a fingerprint.

490
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:54,981
Once I knew it was her,

491
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:56,349
I tried to stop her.

492
00:32:56,662 --> 00:32:59,578
I tried to talk her out of it at
the motel the night you saw me.

493
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:02,963
Told her that this was as bad idea.
That we were onto her.

494
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,195
But I couldn't bring myself
to take her down.

495
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:08,587
She saved my life more on once, Jamie.

496
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,238
That's make a little hard
to put a bullet in her.

497
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:16,097
Why the hell should I believe
any of what you're saying?

498
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:17,943
Because I'm asking you to.

499
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:20,090
You've got a believe me on this one.

500
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:23,116
I'm trying to stop this thing
just as much as you are.

501
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,265
Wait a minute.

502
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,375
If Jonas thinks I'm in on this,

503
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:32,295
He probably had you feed me some false
information

504
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:34,495
- about where Rudhan's sitting.
- He did

505
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,975
Jamie, that makes this guy
an open target.

506
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,713
We cannot allow him to die
on american soil

507
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,141
You take the president,
and I'll take the tower.

508
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:20,532
Yes!!!

509
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:29,415
Cover the windows! Cover the windows!

510
00:35:29,548 --> 00:35:30,843
Secure the president!

511
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:37,068
Get back out. Get them on the move, now!

512
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:39,086
Go, go, go!

513
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:28,475
Julia, stop!

514
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:43,301
A person doesn't see what we saw back
in'02 and forget it.

515
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,417
Torture, executions.

516
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:49,073
You've been working private
sector ops too long.

517
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,847
But then you were always good
at walking away from things.

518
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:55,281
I didn't walk away from you. I had
to complete the mission. You know that.

519
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,761
Well, now I'm gonna finish
my own little mission.

520
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,042
- Take the shot, Antonio.
- Shut up, Sommers.

521
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,227
You should've listened to her.

522
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:46,621
She was the one who broke your heart.

523
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,630
Sir, you need to keep this on.

524
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:56,376
I had to get out.

525
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:59,220
It was too intense.

526
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:03,469
She always had more nerve than I did.

527
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,089
I should've never left her alone
in Africa.

528
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:09,946
Don't ever let that happen to you,
Jamie.

529
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,923
It's not easy... to live with.

530
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,067
I should've had...

531
00:38:16,749 --> 00:38:18,101
Had her back.

532
00:38:23,998 --> 00:38:25,605
We're losing him.

533
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:34,502
Clear!

534
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,704
A negative, charge again.150 joules.

535
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,126
Clear!

536
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,829
First time's the worst.

537
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,426
What happened?

538
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,772
I can't do this.

539
00:39:56,402 --> 00:39:58,529
I'm not cut out for this.

540
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,812
Hey, come on.
