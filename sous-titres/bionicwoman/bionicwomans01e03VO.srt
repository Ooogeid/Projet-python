1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:02,150
Previously on Bionic Woman.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,717
Why can't I feel my legs?

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,936
Both your legs had to be replaced.

4
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:12,314
Jaime, tell everyone
Sarah Corvus says hello.

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,035
You live with me.

6
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,451
That's the way it is.
You're never gonna live with dad.

7
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:18,013
I feel like I hold you back sometimes

8
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:20,732
You're the only thing in my life
that makes any sense right now.

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,007
Sarah Corvus is still alive.

10
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:23,825
You came all the way here
to tell me that?

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,634
Good-bye, Jae.

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,657
Please give my regards to Will.

13
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:27,901
Tell him daddy says hello.

14
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:31,205
Will!

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,306
We are gathered here today
to honor William Anthros.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,264
This is hard.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,411
I'm gonna go back to my life,

18
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:41,730
and my job, and pretend
none of this ever happened.

19
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,259
Why did Will have
a file on me this thick?

20
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,769
I found it in his apartment,

21
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,955
and it started two years
before I met him.

22
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,146
What are you people?

23
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,548
We're a private clandestine
group dedicated to stopping

24
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:54,317
rogue organization from
ending civilization as we know it.

25
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:55,436
Who are you?

26
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,803
I'm Sarah Corvus.
The first bionic woman.

27
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,077
Ta-da.

28
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:02,955
- Push it, Jaime.
- I can't do it.

29
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,615
I guess I'm not used to thinking
of myself as artificially intelligent.

30
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,034
That's not what I said.

31
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:18,794
I said part of your programming includes

32
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:21,747
artificial intelligence,
the ability to learn.

33
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,179
More importantly, to unlearn.

34
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,715
Here we go.

35
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,867
You see how you always defend
the same way every time?

36
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,846
One more time.

37
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,425
You can't be too predictable, Jaime.

38
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,072
You can circumvent the programming,

39
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:04,312
go way beyond what it intended.

40
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:10,687
You're telling me I can hack into
myself, change the information?

41
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,863
All it takes is practice.

42
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:21,245
How's your salad?

43
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,663
It's great. It's a salad.

44
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,356
You want to split a sundae?

45
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,147
Go to the movies later?

46
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:29,633
What are you doing?

47
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:32,389
I'm trying to buy back your love
because I've been working so much.

48
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,413
It's gonna cost you
a lot more than lunch.

49
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:35,616
Okay, you know at I want.

50
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:38,373
I'm not buying you those jeans.
They're $170.

51
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,978
Jaime, they make
my butt look amazing.

52
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,757
You can't put a price tag on that.

53
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,407
We don't have the money.

54
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,263
What about your new job?

55
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:49,001
I mean, shouldn't consultant
pay more than bartender?

56
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,768
Okay, if you can't buy those jeans,

57
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:52,206
I think you need to renegotiate.

58
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:54,778
That's not the point.
The point is, you're 15 years old.

59
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,936
I'm not buying you $170 jeans.

60
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,325
Hey.

61
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,021
I need you to do something for me.

62
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,499
Can't. I'm out with my sister.

63
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,397
Who is it?

64
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,716
It's work.

65
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:07,847
Ask for more money.

66
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,494
I know where you are. That's why
I have something for you to do.

67
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,500
You know where I am?

68
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,656
$50 million, you didn't
think'd throw in a GPS?

69
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,319
Wait a minute, you have a tracker on me?

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,913
No one said anything
about a tracker.

71
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:17,981
What tracker?

72
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,079
Nothing, it's nothing.

73
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,555
A block up the street, a guy with
blond hair, green jacket,

74
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,065
and glasses. He's eating a falafel.

75
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,268
Who is he?

76
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,224
Suffice it to say, he's a very bad man.

77
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,754
- He's a bad man?
- Who's a bad man?

78
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,159
Somebody's sleeping
with somebody else at work.

79
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,957
- This is not a good time.
- It never is.

80
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:38,356
You want to have lunch with
your sister or save the world?

81
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,879
Didn't you give me a speech
about how I'm not ready for this?

82
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,960
You're not, you're the closest
operative I have.

83
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,143
Make sure he doesn't leave.

84
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,735
Sit on him if you have to.
We'll be there in five minutes flat.

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,707
What if he gets away?

86
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:48,962
Ask fomore money.

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,562
Massasualties.

88
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,756
Listen, in the future, we really
can't stop to chit-chat like this.

89
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:56,402
Here's how it works.
I say do something, and you do it.

90
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,701
No, don't tell me you have
to go back to work.

91
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,924
No, I don't.

92
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,283
You know what?
I think you should get those jeans.

93
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,062
Early christmas present.

94
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,726
I'm not gonna have to, like, clean the
bathroom for the next year, am i?

95
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:11,737
Just go. I'll wait for you here. Go.

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,399
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:26,843
Hi, I'm new in town,
and I'm a little lost.

98
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,697
- Can you tell me where the museum
of modern art is? - Sorry.

99
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:33,104
Oh, because there's supposed to be
this incredible basquiat exhibit.

100
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:36,808
Okay, listen. I've been asked to make
sure you don't go anywhere, okay?

101
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,027
So is there any way we can wait here
for five minutes until backup gets here?

102
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,657
Feel free to turn the radio on.

103
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay. Plan b.

104
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:58,945
Transcript : swsub.com
Synchro : bbd1980, Kasius, IceFre@k

105
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,007
You were supposed to get
one pair of jeans.

106
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:19,984
I know, but they had
all these shirts on sale.

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,277
I got you one.

108
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:27,565
And you were supposed to be here
when I got back. Where'd you go?

109
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,760
Bathroom.

110
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:30,186
Oh.

111
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,295
What the hell.
Let's go catch that movie.

112
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,518
Yeah.

113
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,431
I love you, I honestly do.

114
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,550
You're what gives my life meaning.

115
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,323
You're the only thing worth living for.
Without you, I think I'd die.

116
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,761
Amazing.

117
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,814
No flutters, nothing.

118
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,770
We've got to find a way to teach this.

119
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:00,172
How do you do it, anyway?

120
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:01,650
I've been married.

121
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,712
What time does Sommers come online?

122
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,272
Not my department.

123
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:11,251
I was never into voyeurism, remember?

124
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:16,208
Can you explain the obsession
people have

125
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:19,660
typing little messages
to each other with their thumbs,

126
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:22,895
as if it's somehow more
convenient than just talking?

127
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:30,033
It's some bad ideas in your head
these days, don't you, Sarah?

128
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:32,127
Feelings you don't understand.

129
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,571
Impulses to do things that...

130
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,440
Frighten you.

131
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,786
It's the bionics, isn't it?

132
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:43,121
They've changed me,
turned me into this thing.

133
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,275
I can't help you
until I have more information.

134
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,829
What information?

135
00:06:58,322 --> 00:06:59,326
Meanwhile,

136
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:02,019
I want you to take this.

137
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,325
It's for your nerves.

138
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:05,916
It'll calm you.

139
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:09,022
Is the same thing going
to start happening to her?

140
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:10,360
I don't know.

141
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,229
The only way to be sure

142
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:16,137
is to evaluate Jaime Sommers in person.

143
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,143
If you found differences,
could you help me?

144
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,146
Unlikely.

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,903
but not impossible.

146
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:30,949
You gotta trust me, Sarah.

147
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:33,015
I can me you feel better.

148
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,518
At least for the time being.

149
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,370
Just bring Jaime Sommers to me.

150
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,780
Jonas, we need to talk
about this tracker thing.

151
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:58,439
- How do you feel about canadians?
- Don't change the subject.

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,787
you thought it was okay
to put a tracker inside my head?

153
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:03,682
Since we're on the subject, we're
also streaming video from your head.

154
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,103
Streaming what-- what?

155
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,170
So there's a video camera in my eye?

156
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:08,510
It's in your brain.

157
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:09,960
I don't know where to start.

158
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:11,860
I wait out.
I want it all out of my head.

159
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:14,428
You see, the whole thing's grafted
onto your cerebral cortex.

160
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:15,376
We could take it out,

161
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,652
but you wouldn't be able to
move the left of your body.

162
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,077
This is an invasion of my privacy.

163
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,699
It's stripping me of my dignity
and it's a little pervy.

164
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,139
- Pervy?
- It's perverted.

165
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,289
It's for your own safety.

166
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,966
That is crap. It's so you can watch me
and watch your investment.

167
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,120
That's so true.

168
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:30,124
This conversation is not over.

169
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:31,902
Okay.

170
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,747
So why are you asking me
about canadians?

171
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,259
This is Heaven von Fleet.

172
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:38,044
She's the daughter of a major
canadian defense contractor.

173
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,182
She's gonna be visiting
the U.S. For three days.

174
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:41,830
Canada? Do they even have an army?

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,882
- Of course they do. They're a country.
- OK, what's it got to do with me?

176
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:48,099
Heaven's father sell arms to the
bosnians, which pissed off the serbs.

177
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:50,388
There's been a threat made
on his life, he's insisting

178
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,514
his daughter get 24h protection
while he's here.

179
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,837
What are the chances of the serb
militants coming here

180
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:56,722
and taking out this little rich
Canadian girl?

181
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,863
Zero, but we do business,
and he's pulling a favor.

182
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,066
And this involves me how?

183
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,711
Just make sure nothing happens to her.

184
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,560
- Nothing is gonna happen to her.
- Exactly.

185
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,549
- What? I'm a bionic babysitter?
- That's right.

186
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,153
Sometimes you get a softball.

187
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,559
Instead of complaining
about it, just enjoy it.

188
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,758
I'm glad you could come by
and meet Heaven.

189
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,383
Tomorrow, I'll need you
here at 9:00 to pick her up.

190
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,336
- Sure.
- And one more thing.

191
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:19,404
I should probably mention that my
daughter is a little spirited.

192
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,653
That's great.

193
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,833
What I mean to say is, while she's
under your watch,

194
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,440
she is not to get a new taoo,

195
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,590
a new body piercing,
consume any alcohol,

196
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:27,642
or take any drugs.

197
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:30,255
You know, my understanding
was my job was just to keep her safe.

198
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:34,174
Yes, well, I've provided millions of
dollars in revenue to berkut.

199
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:37,238
I don't think that's a relationship
you want to screw around with.

200
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,868
Young lady,

201
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:41,238
there is to be no smoking in this house.

202
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,117
Shut up, dad. Get out.
Get out!

203
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,388
Get out of my space!

204
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,764
I merely want to introduce...

205
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,406
The goon? I see her.

206
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,816
This whole thing is stupid, dad.

207
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:51,642
It's just a way of you
trying to control me.

208
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:52,764
I hate you.

209
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,645
Hi, I'm Jaime Sommers.

210
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:56,979
I don't need to know your name.

211
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,059
Don't talk to me.

212
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,223
Walk five steps
behind me at all times.

213
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:02,868
Great. I'll see you tomorrow then.

214
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,783
wow, I cannot believe
you've never had a lesson.

215
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,442
what's up?

216
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,165
it's nothing.

217
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,938
It's nothing.

218
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,328
everyone's already there.

219
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,663
You always do this.

220
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:33,243
We always miss the fun stuff
because you're too slow.

221
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:34,907
Don't tempt me.

222
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:39,146
Sissy.

223
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,257
Give me a sip.

224
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,949
Oh, one sip, for God's sake,

225
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,978
Hey, one.

226
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,515
Come on, Anne, don't bogart.

227
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:06,798
There's only one gulp left.

228
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,798
There's at least two.

229
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,861
You're not really gonna
drink the rest of it, are you?

230
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,364
You don't know me very well,

231
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,775
Do you, Sarah?

232
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:41,927
I can't believe you let mom
get rid of kurt.

233
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,803
Kurt.

234
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,578
What kind of name was that for a pet?

235
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,035
Oh, he was adorable.

236
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,538
Second, he was by far the stupidest
animal I've ever seen.

237
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,283
All he did was lick himself a day.

238
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:53,092
- You know what they say.
- Becca, don't.

239
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,763
- If people could do it...
- Becca.

240
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,445
- They'd never leave the house.
- You're...

241
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:02,149
My god, Becca. How long did it
take you to do all this?

242
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,466
I'm not finished yet.

243
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,848
Mom kept all the really cool stuff
from that year

244
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,402
we spent in D.C. before she died.

245
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,489
You really are the family
packrat, aren't you?

246
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:10,598
Think about it.

247
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,406
It's our family we're
talking about here.

248
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:15,824
I mean, if there weren't pictures,
no one would ever know existed.

249
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,217
Oh, here, let me show you something.

250
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:19,561
Check this out.

251
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,943
- Wow, that's mom's grandma, right?
- Yep.

252
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,671
It was just before she found out
she was dying.

253
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,669
Oh, well, she made it to 92 eventually.

254
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,010
And later they discovered it was
some kind of getic disorder.

255
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:35,755
She was 25. Just a year older
than youre now.

256
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:38,390
Tick-tock.

257
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,513
Not funny.

258
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,952
How do you know all this stuff?

259
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,802
I mean, why is it important to you,

260
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,611
digging around, learning all this
stuff about our family?

261
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,739
I guess I just want to know the truth...

262
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,427
about everything.

263
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,484
I don't like secrets, Jaime.

264
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:05,905
We are the only two people with
sub-retinal charged coupling devices

265
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,546
implanted in our optic nerves.

266
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:13,084
But our human brain still filters out
things it doesn't want us to see.

267
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:14,934
Don't let it!

268
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:16,922
See everything, Jaime.

269
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,387
We know what each other's thinking...

270
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,422
If we want.

271
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:25,942
Wake up, Jaime.

272
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,015
Don't even try it, honey.
I know how you think.

273
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:41,156
Having only one bionic arm shouldn't be
such a predictable weakness, Jaime.

274
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,341
The metal tip on that comb.

275
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:49,237
The phone cord.

276
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,890
Ooh, there's an idea.

277
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,821
The scissors in the desk.

278
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:54,590
I know your instincts, Jaime.

279
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,937
We have the same baseline programming.

280
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,864
I know you better than you
know yourself.

281
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,205
But not well enough.

282
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:04,723
What is it this time, Sarah?

283
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:08,315
I see they have you lojacked.

284
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:09,413
That gives me what?

285
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,298
A couple hundred seconds
before they show up?

286
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:13,013
I can talk fast, but not that fast.

287
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:16,177
Sir, there's been a breach.

288
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,622
Bathroom apartment window.

289
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,912
This is why I said we need
a 24-hour surveillance.

290
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:21,912
Well, sir, you also said to
hold off on that.

291
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,108
Something about her right to privacy.

292
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,246
Situation one, now.

293
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,783
I need you to help me.

294
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:32,835
- I need you to come with me so that...
- You tried to kill me.

295
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,298
You killed the only man I've ever loved.

296
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,404
Did you know I was pregnant?

297
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,363
Did you know you murdered
my unborn child?

298
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:46,108
Glad to see there are still some things
that can shut you up after all.

299
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,753
And now you break into my house,
threaten my family?

300
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:52,015
Tell me again how much you need me,
you psychopathic freak.

301
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,190
I need you to believe me.
This wasn't ever about you.

302
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,044
Oh, just collateral damage, huh?

303
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,177
Do me a favor, Sarah.

304
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,267
Try not to make it worse by
apologizing, okay?

305
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,588
I am not here to hurt you,
or your sister,

306
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:08,530
and I promise I won't, but in exchange,
I need you to trust me this once.

307
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:11,286
Meet me tomorrow, noon, sulfur plant.

308
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,664
It's by the ocean.

309
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,467
It's the only place we can talk
where they can't corner me.

310
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,604
I need you to come alone.

311
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,500
No back-up.

312
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,297
Whether you know it or not,
you need me too, Jaime.

313
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,702
Let's see if the trust works both ways.

314
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,444
I want her under lockdown now.

315
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,490
I want this entire organization
on full alert.

316
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,373
I want corvus found and brought in,
dead if necessary.

317
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:38,451
Roger that.

318
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,446
I want her streaming optical
interface tracked permanently.

319
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:44,394
I don't want to make a move unless
we know when, where, and why.

320
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,671
- What?!
- I'm not doing any of that.

321
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,814
I'm not hiding, and I'm not
running away.

322
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:52,070
And you talking about me like
I'm not even in the room,

323
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:53,978
like my opinion doesn't matter,

324
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,511
not exactly the attitude adjustment
we talked about.

325
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,275
- It's true. We did talk about a...
- All right.

326
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,390
All right.

327
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:04,471
I'm soy.

328
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,951
Then here's what I think we should do.

329
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,766
I'll draw Sarah Corvus out.

330
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:12,211
But you've got to promise to let me
talk to her fore you bring her in.

331
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,801
Let me get close to her, find out
what it is she wants.

332
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,000
No, no.

333
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,639
We have experts in that category.

334
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:22,269
Great. I'm sure your experts
have a lot to talk about.

335
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:23,413
Fine, fine.

336
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:24,558
It's a deal.

337
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,336
You keep your appointment with Sarah.

338
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,117
We'll be close, but we'll
stay back until

339
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:30,810
you give us the signal
to move in, okay, dirty harry?

340
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,226
Look, I think she's in pain.

341
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:36,729
You need to promise me if you bring
her in, we're gonna help her.

342
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,613
Don't make a liar out of me.

343
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,758
Consider it a promise.

344
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,013
She lost a sister.
You know that, right?

345
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,190
Car accident.

346
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:52,545
Sarah was driving.

347
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,313
She pretty much went scorched
earth after that.

348
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,857
If Sarah Corvus wants something,
she'll tear through a wall to get it.

349
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,571
Just make sure that wall isn't you.

350
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,577
Size 0. I told you size 0.

351
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,408
Now!

352
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,545
I think it's outrageous that in spite
of the Sarah Corvus situation,

353
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,031
I'm still expected to babysit
this little monster.

354
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:29,242
Hey, you're bionic, babe.

355
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,716
Multitask.

356
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,403
Nathan, what I'm looking for here
is a little sympathy, okay?

357
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,123
I just want you to agree with me.

358
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:39,227
- I'm trying to be your friend, dummy.
- Okay, um, you're right.

359
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,470
They're wrong.

360
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,190
Would it be inappropriate of me
to ask you out for drinks?

361
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,125
Yes, completely inappropriate.

362
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:50,265
God!

363
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,287
So you want me to be, like,
one of your girlfriends.

364
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,518
I have an idea.

365
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,196
Why don't you put me in a dress and
a wig and call me stephanie,

366
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,668
- and we'll have mane, panties...
- Oh, this is great.

367
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,027
Just great.

368
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,775
I gotta go.

369
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:17,387
- Hello.
- Why aren't you on your way in?

370
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,260
You're supposed to meet
Sarah in two hours.

371
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:20,596
I'm on my way.

372
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,070
So how's it going with the girl?

373
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:25,307
- Great, I'm all over it.
- Really?

374
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,951
'causet looks to me like you lost her.

375
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:29,199
Okay, you know what?

376
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:30,798
This camera in my eye, it sucks.

377
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,326
- It's not a camera, it's...
- A tota violation of privacy.

378
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,137
You know what?
I'm gonna call somebody.

379
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,272
The justice department
or Hillary Clinton.

380
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:38,717
She'll get to the bottom of this.

381
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:42,026
Jaime, just go find heaven so we
don't have to go to war with Canada.

382
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,656
I want it on my back.

383
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,806
I'm thinking between my shoulder blades.

384
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,931
Somewhere my father will see it.

385
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,198
What?

386
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,291
Come on.

387
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:31,273
Is this punishment?
Is that what you're doing?

388
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:32,401
Yeah, it's punishment.

389
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,874
I'm really scared.

390
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,608
Oh, you should be.

391
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:39,257
What is she doing here?
This is a top secret facility.

392
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,154
Am I supposed to be impressed?

393
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,749
I'm going out for a few hours.

394
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,224
This is ruth. She's gonna run
a few teston you.

395
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,776
Is she a lesbian?

396
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:51,353
Have fun.

397
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:05,714
I'm going to see Sarah Corvus soon.

398
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:08,170
I'm feeling a little in the dark.

399
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:10,139
What does she want with me?

400
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:14,707
We think Sarah Corvus might be
working with Anthony Anthros.

401
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:15,988
Will's father?

402
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:17,437
He escaped from prison.

403
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,825
Treason.

404
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,502
He tried to sell bionics to
the highest bidder.

405
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,957
Appantly, you and Will didn't
talk very much.

406
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:27,209
Apparently, I'm the most gullible
person on earth.

407
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,328
So what does he want with Sarah?

408
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,450
He created her, he designed her.

409
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:34,676
He and Will.

410
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,537
So what do they want?

411
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,098
If I had to guess, I would say you.

412
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:41,578
I would say you.

413
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:14,717
Okay.

414
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,469
So I'm here.

415
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:18,787
Talk.

416
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:20,793
I'm sick.

417
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:24,828
And I think you're the only person
who can help get me well.

418
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,504
What do you mean, sick?

419
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:30,066
I don't know what they told you,
but I've done some bad things.

420
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:40,018
- A few years ago, I...
- I know, Sarah.

421
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,457
Jae shot me,

422
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,446
and as far as the world was
concerned, I was dead.

423
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,654
But Will revived me, surgically.

424
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,596
He raised you from the dead?

425
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,950
- How did he...
- I don't know,

426
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:57,117
but whatever he did
changed something in me.

427
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:00,296
But it's like my emotions
were gone with it.

428
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,754
I felt like a pure machine, like I
could do anything, and I loved it.

429
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,095
So why do you need me, Sarah?

430
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,904
I'm losing control again.

431
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:15,499
Just take your medicine, Sarah.

432
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:17,811
You know
it'll make you feel better.

433
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:23,326
Whatever will did to save
me was temporary.

434
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:24,725
But your implants,

435
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:27,211
the way the anthrocytes
interface with your body,

436
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,540
it's more advanced.

437
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:33,107
If we can isolate those properties,
we can make those adjustments in me.

438
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,350
You can save my life, Jaime.

439
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,945
Let me ask you something.

440
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:45,303
How well did you really know will?

441
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,456
How sure are you that the only
reason you became

442
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:49,399
a bionic candidate was because
of the accident?

443
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:52,509
Will didn't have any way of knowing you
were gonna slam that truck into me?

444
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,657
So your conspiracy theories
don't have any weight.

445
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:57,165
How do you know I didn't
just expedite things?

446
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:00,474
How do you know you weren't
being primed anyway?

447
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,208
Used by a man looking for the next
candidate to serve up.

448
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,988
We're finished talking.

449
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:09,513
I don't need you, Sarah.

450
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:10,704
You need me.

451
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,577
I expected more from you, Jaime.
Shame on you.

452
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,756
Run!

453
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:26,606
Move! Move!

454
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,738
I have no visual on her, sir.

455
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:32,906
We lost her.

456
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:35,976
Didn't we have a deal?

457
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:40,051
Is this the way things work
around here?

458
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,274
You were listening to everything,
big-brother style, right?

459
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:47,203
So what was Sarah about to tell me
that you didn't want me to hear?

460
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,270
Am I a ticking time bomb too?

461
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,723
I'm going after her, and if we can,
we're gonna help her.

462
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,731
She killed 14 of my men, Jaime.
You know that.

463
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:55,874
Good men.

464
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,208
And that was a tragic thing.

465
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,862
But that wasn't her, and you know it.

466
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,949
Oh, so you're a supporter
of the insanity defense?

467
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,203
I just think there's a difference
between going crazy

468
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,280
and having your identity
stolen from you.

469
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,841
Which reminds me,

470
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:08,055
your little video tap,

471
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,659
I want it turned off.

472
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:19,403
Nice move.

473
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:30,699
Interesting things start happening
once you learn to let go.

474
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:34,441
You think Sarah Corvus is gonna
bring gloves to a fight?

475
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,183
No.

476
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:39,095
Something tells me...

477
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,910
that she's gonna leave her little
pads at home,

478
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:45,713
and what we need to find now...

479
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:48,390
is the animal.

480
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:53,391
Now we all know that if
your training is worth a damn,

481
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:57,529
by now, I should be able to take this
crowbar and swing it as hard

482
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:01,332
and as fast as humanly possible
and never get within an inch of you.

483
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:03,979
That's right, boys and girls.

484
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,893
I'm about to get analog on your ass.

485
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,714
So what do you say, Sommers?

486
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,119
Are we ready to find the animal?

487
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:14,801
Bring it on, bitch.

488
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:19,311
Are you insane?

489
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,001
You're not finished!

490
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,672
Enough.

491
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:44,575
There's the animal.

492
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,154
Now she thinks I betrayed her.

493
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:00,581
You did betray her.

494
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:01,982
So what now?

495
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,146
You know her.
What's she gonna do next?

496
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,145
I don't know.

497
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,245
What I do know, she holds grudges.

498
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:10,248
That's great.
That's awesome.

499
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,837
- That's super helpful, Jae.
- Listen, you're on the grid now.

500
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,133
You have 24-hour security.

501
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,757
You're not in this alone, okay?

502
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,733
I guess that helps.

503
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:21,270
I gotta go.
I'm on an assignment.

504
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,418
Heaven needs a pedicure.

505
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,164
Now,

506
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:30,724
let's move on to your mother.

507
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,530
Does she infantilize you also?

508
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,682
I'd really like to stop now.

509
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,384
That door is locked.

510
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,043
Sit.

511
00:29:50,216 --> 00:29:51,216
How was it?

512
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,334
I'm really sorry about ditching you
at the store.

513
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,380
I'd really like to leave now.

514
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:56,636
Okay.

515
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,172
Thank you, Ruth.

516
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:08,566
That's the second time.

517
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,328
- You suck!
- I'm sorry.

518
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:17,918
What was that?

519
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,454
What are you doing here, Sarah?

520
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:22,664
Getting a pedicure.

521
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,459
Red, please.

522
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:27,522
- Can I have a water?
- Of course.

523
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:30,677
You're looking better.

524
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:33,807
It comes in waves, honey.
Today is a good day.

525
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:35,994
Who's that?

526
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:38,332
They got you on baby detail?

527
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:41,543
Look, Sarah, I'm sorry I brought Berkut
with me before, okay?

528
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,919
You killed 14 people.
You were lurking outside my window.

529
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:47,419
- Can't you see this from my side?
- Yes, I can.

530
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,809
I see everything from your side.
That's the point.

531
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,915
- We need each other.
- I don't think I need you, Sarah.

532
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:54,257
Are you sure about that?

533
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,440
Because there's four serbian gangsters
coming up to the salon,

534
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:59,720
and I don't think they're here
to get their nails done.

535
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:02,233
Better watch out
for the little princess over there.

536
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,175
3,

537
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:06,457
2,

538
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:07,842
1.

539
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,328
Everybody out.

540
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,555
Everybody out.
Get up!

541
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:15,943
Now!

542
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,752
I don't suppose
we could talk about this.

543
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:27,870
I don't think so.

544
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:39,481
How about a little help over here?

545
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,348
I thought you said you didn't need me.

546
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,616
Okay, okay, I need you.

547
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:01,815
I need you!

548
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,433
- What's the magic word?
- Please.

549
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:06,440
Bionics are great and all,

550
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,895
but nothin' beats a little firepower.

551
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:21,581
Rock, paper, scissors for the last guy?

552
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,045
I'm not sorry Will's dead.

553
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,473
But I didn't know you were pregnant,
and I am sorry about that.

554
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,598
But I need your help, Jaime.

555
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:43,871
I'm dying.

556
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,340
Your bionics are the only thing
that can save me.

557
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,735
What just happened?

558
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,221
A bunch of serbian dudes walked into
a nail salon and tried to take you out.

559
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,854
- Nice.
- Look, you're gonna be okay.

560
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,366
Berkut is gonna follow us.

561
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:59,240
It won't make any difference if we move.
I've this tracker in my eye.

562
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,621
What are you talking about?
You're starting to scare me.

563
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:02,972
Get in the car and shut up.

564
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,243
You haven't figured out
how to disable their gps yet?

565
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:07,864
- You can do that?
- You have to.

566
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:09,842
Those Berkut guys look at you
in the shower.

567
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:12,494
Don't even get me started
on how objectifying

568
00:33:12,597 --> 00:33:15,331
this whole bionic woman thing is.
They don't tell you anything.

569
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:18,962
That's why you and me, we need
to stick together, maybe form a union.

570
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:20,876
I have a lot of reasons
not to trust you,

571
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,172
that's not gonna change
just because you say it should.

572
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:26,664
Here's how you do it. It's like hacking
into your own computer.

573
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,882
You need to concentre really hard,
and visualize it.

574
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:32,486
- We should get out of here now.
- Adults are talking.

575
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,950
Focus.

576
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,827
- And visualise.
- That sounds awfully new-agey.

577
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,660
Look, Jaime, you can do this.

578
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:43,606
They don't want you to know
how powerful you are. Just trust me.

579
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:46,829
Hack into your ocular tracking device
in your cerebral cortex.

580
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,916
Visualize the tracker.
Disable it with your thoughts.

581
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,790
I just did it.

582
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,151
And you just got back a little dignity.
How's it feel?

583
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:13,595
Why is your nose bleeding?

584
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:15,464
Why don't you hang yourself
or something?

585
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,494
Let me cut to the chase.
I want something from you.

586
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,581
I want you to come with me
to see Anthros

587
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,619
so they can study your technology
and update me.

588
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:26,572
When they put the bionics in me,
the system,

589
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:29,152
- it wasn't perfected.
- What is she talking about?

590
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,167
Shut up!

591
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,615
I will die within the year if you do
not come with me and help me.

592
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,408
Save my life, Jaime.

593
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,140
You're a good girl.
You like to help people.

594
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:40,890
Help me.
Help me save my life.

595
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,510
I can't.
I can't go to Anthros.

596
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:44,387
I will not get cut up by Will's father.

597
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,871
Besides, if I go with you,

598
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,536
Jonas'll wipe out the compound with you

599
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,333
and in it long
before your health improves.

600
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:52,480
- Come to Berkut. We'll do it there.
- And who's gonna do the surgery? Jonas?

601
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:54,708
Antonio?
The janitor?

602
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,226
Will's dead.
There's not a surgeon there.

603
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:58,477
You have to come with me.

604
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:01,417
I can't.
I'm sorry.

605
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,218
I wish I could, but I can't risk it.

606
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:05,185
It's not just about me, Sarah.
I have a sister.

607
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,164
I'm her guardian.
You know, our dad's a flake.

608
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,843
Our mom's dead.
We have no one.

609
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:10,055
Whatever.

610
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,891
So you're saying no?

611
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:13,840
I have no choice.

612
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:15,576
Okay, then.

613
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,088
- Good luck.
- Where are you going, Sarah?

614
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:20,102
I'm gonna go lay down on the sidewalk
and die.

615
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,611
You don't have to be so dramatic.

616
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,039
Don't I?

617
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:25,855
I thought I was just told by
the one person who could save my life

618
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:29,192
she's got better things to do.
That feels pretty dramatic to me.

619
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,918
Not that I can actually feel anything,

620
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,639
but I can intellectually imagine that
that feels pretty dramatic.

621
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:37,402
She's scary.

622
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:39,558
Yeah, I know.

623
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,866
Daddy, I love you.

624
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:07,129
Thank you.
I'm so gonna take up karate.

625
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:16,228
Take care.

626
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,727
- Hello.
- Hey, Becca, it's me.

627
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,835
These jeans are life-altering.

628
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:37,451
I'm on my way home.
How about I pick up some chinese?

629
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:39,052
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Bye.

630
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,746
You're losing control, Sarah.

631
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:49,237
Your denial will work with the others.

632
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,198
It won't work with me.

633
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,347
- I see you.
- You don't see me.

634
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,427
No? What am I missing?

635
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,593
That you had a history of sick behavior

636
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,735
even before you became
a bionic candidate?

637
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:04,498
- Before you killed your sister?
- Stop saying that!

638
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:14,348
Maybe it's true.

639
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,350
Maybe Jaime Sommers really...

640
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,877
can help you get better.

641
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,596
But you're never gonna be able
to trust her

642
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,458
until she can truly relate to you.

643
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:28,848
She's never going to trust me.

644
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:32,381
I can't reach her.

645
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:34,731
She'll trust you

646
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,359
when she can connect with who you are.

647
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:40,959
When she gets to feel

648
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,217
what you felt.

649
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,388
You don't know me very well,
do you, Sarah?

650
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,283
Grab your chopsticks, woman.
Kung Pao is in the house.

651
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,257
Jaime, this is our new neighbor Sarah.
She's moving in downstairs.

652
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:30,096
It's so nice to meet you, Jaime.
I love your sister.

653
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:32,531
What a sweetheart.

654
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,133
Welcome to the building, Sarah.

655
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:40,107
I love the building,
and the apartments are great.

656
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:42,134
And these windows are awesome.

657
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:45,143
Yeah, I mean, you don't see moldings
like this everywhere.

658
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,739
Great moldings, great moldings.

659
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,321
- Do you love the moldings?
- I do.

660
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:51,505
And the best thing is the neighborhood
seems really

661
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:52,779
safe.

662
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:54,823
Yeah. I like to think that it is.

663
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:10,667
it's okay.

664
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,514
Just a little something
I put in the tea.

665
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,846
Don't worry.

666
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,280
She's not dead...

667
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:17,803
yet...

668
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:20,757
as long as you come with me to Anthros.

669
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:23,494
Otherwise, I may have to take her
out of the picture

670
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,605
so you don't feel so torn.

671
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:27,638
Please don't do this.

672
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:30,830
I know what it feels like
to lose a sister.

673
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:32,274
I killed mine.

674
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:34,631
It sucks.

675
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,646
But I feel like there's a silver lining.

676
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,077
You'll lose a sister,
but you'll gain more of me.

677
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,035
You and I will be even more connected.

678
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:42,211
It'll be fun.

679
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,458
We could even wear matching outfits.

680
00:39:44,964 --> 00:39:46,527
How do you look in Capris?

681
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:52,961
You don't want to do this.

682
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:55,084
You don't want to kill her.

683
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,847
I know you think you're this pure,

684
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:01,143
aggressive animal,
but that is not all of you.

685
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,732
I know you loved Jae and he loved you.

686
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:15,205
I know you loved your sister.

687
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:22,151
There is some humanity left in you.

688
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:29,373
I can see it.

689
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:34,177
Please.

690
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,183
- I'm sorry.
- You bitch.

691
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,289
They're gonna be here any minute.
Get the hell out of here.

692
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,850
You chose Berkut over me.

693
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:01,731
You're going to have to live with that.
They will destroy you!

694
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:04,817
If you ever come near my sister again,
I will kill you.

695
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:06,665
You know Will?

696
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:09,074
The guy you were in love with?

697
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:11,357
Did you know that he studied you
like a lab rat?

698
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,011
That he cased you, worked you,
set you up?

699
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,307
There was never any reality
to any moment

700
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:17,993
you ever thought you shared with him.

701
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:20,003
Every look, every kiss,

702
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,509
every word, every night.

703
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:22,817
It was nothing.

704
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:28,577
So remember that the next time
you feel like you're trusting someone.

705
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:31,157
You meant nothing to him.

706
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:41,986
It's gonna be okay.

707
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:44,957
I promise, it's gonna be okay.
