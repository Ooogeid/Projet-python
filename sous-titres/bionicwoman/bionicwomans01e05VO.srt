1
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,822
You all right, soldier?

2
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,269
You need a doctor?

3
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:50,675
Easy, soldier.

4
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:53,990
It'll be all right. Just--

5
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,208
just put that gun down.

6
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,940
What about Jeremy,
the one from the bar?

7
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:12,912
- Married.
- Not happily.

8
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,547
- You're in a good mood tonight.
- I'm always in a good mood.

9
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:17,978
Honey, you have been walking
around miserable all week.

10
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:19,570
Seriously, what's going on with you?

11
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,026
It's like the weight of
the world's on you lately.

12
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:23,905
That's what margaritas are for.

13
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:27,527
What about my brother?

14
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,101
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

15
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:33,780
- Because honestly, Robin, he's gay.
- He is not!

16
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:36,863
Look, it's fine, just stop trying to
set him up with your girlfriends.

17
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,011
You guys are so cynical.

18
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,380
Besides, I don't need a
man in my life right now.

19
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,421
Yes, you do.
Honey, it's almost winter.

20
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,663
Every day is precious. Trust me,

21
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,490
I don't need a man to make me happy.

22
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,562
- That is really sad.
- Pathetic.

23
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:49,872
Yeah, ditto.

24
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,002
Oh, my god. Girls, look at this.

25
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,471
Names of the victims will be released
after the families have been notified.

26
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:59,901
This is a stunning and tragic event.

27
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:04,552
The soldier was a P.O.W.
held captive and feared dead for two months.

28
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,712
He was set to ship
home later this week.

29
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,221
- Hello.
- We have a situation.

30
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:17,141
What is it?

31
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,342
It's supposed to be a
treatment for depression.

32
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:20,701
I feel better already.

33
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,671
It has to be implanted
in your brain.

34
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,833
But this particular neural
implant has some side-effects.

35
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,531
Okay, three american soldiers,

36
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,060
all P.O.W.'S held by an Al-Qaeda cell,
all released.

37
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,921
All suddenly make very specific
attacks on their own men.

38
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,071
They're like human car bombs.

39
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:44,742
- They all had this neural implant?
- We don't know what it does, but...

40
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:48,940
we know where it comes from.
Professor Howard Samuels.

41
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:52,002
He runs the country's
most cutting-edge lab

42
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:53,971
developing these things
at Stanwick university.

43
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:55,901
How about we start by
arresting Samuels?

44
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,771
- We're not cops.
- Antonio's gonna go after the buyer,

45
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,551
and you're going after the implants.

46
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,033
- So what, I break into the lab?
- It's not that simple.

47
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,082
What's this?

48
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,290
Student I.D.
You're going to college.

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,222
You're transferring in from England.

50
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,260
How's your british accent?

51
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:40,002
Okay, these are the basic
classes you would've had taken

52
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,211
as a transfer student
in neurobiology.

53
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,103
Cellular neuroscience,
which is just about how

54
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:48,591
neurons process physiological
and electrochemical signals.

55
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,703
- Glad that's all it's about.
- Systems neuroscience,

56
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,482
which is just about how neurons,
you know, form circuits--

57
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:56,371
can you just stop saying
"which is just about?"

58
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:58,963
This is an insane amount of
information to process this quickly.

59
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,363
You just have to pull up that
Harvard part of your brain.

60
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,331
The part that never went
to Harvard is much bigger.

61
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,763
Besides, I was gonna
major in Irish literature.

62
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:08,923
Wow, then you dodged a bullet
when you didn't go, because

63
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:11,873
you would've ended up a hundred
grand in debt and still a bartender.

64
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,802
Science, Jaime.
That's what pays the bills.

65
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,701
I'm gonna look like a total idiot.
You can't fake math and science.

66
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,362
Okay, okay, okay, just calm down.

67
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,333
Going to college was
a fantasy for me.

68
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,913
But in my fantasy,
I'm hanging out with intellectual people,

69
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:25,741
tossing a frisbee around,
making a nice pot of Earl Grey,

70
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,960
and finishing my
dissertation on James Joyce.

71
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,833
Wow, we have very little in common.

72
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,431
And now I'm gonna look like a
total idiot faking my way through

73
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,773
- cellular neuron science physio--
- Yeah, neuroscience. Yeah.

74
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:40,391
You could wear glasses.
Then you would look smarter.

75
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:43,553
Thank you, Nathan,
for that completely unhelpful suggestion.

76
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,311
Just doing my job.

77
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,031
"Thank you, nathan." You're welcome!

78
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,000
Starting with the primary
somatosensory cortex,

79
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:11,520
we have areas one, two, and three defined
by the medial longitudinal fissure,

80
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,300
central and lateral sulcus.

81
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:16,843
This region receives the majority--

82
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,072
Young lady, you are new?

83
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,561
Sorry. Sorry.

84
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:33,010
Yes, I, um... I just transferred
in from Oxford. Clarissa Whyte.

85
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:36,213
I presume English is
your first language.

86
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,242
Yes.

87
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,970
Then perhaps you can tell
me what that sign says.

88
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,081
No cell phones.

89
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:45,751
Well, come on,
a little conviction in your voice.

90
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:46,953
Try again.

91
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:50,672
- No cell phones.
- That is so much better.

92
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,201
Now you're on a roll,

93
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,523
perhaps you can tell me when
my lecture's interrupted

94
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,990
by students who can't remember
to turn off their cell phones,

95
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,872
what area of my brain
is firing like crazy?

96
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:03,272
- Um, well, that would be--
- I'll give you a hint.

97
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:06,712
It's the region that processes
emotions like irritation.

98
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,071
If that doesn't help,

99
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:11,702
it's bordered by the inferior
and middle temporal area.

100
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:19,823
Um, that would be Brodmann area 38,
also known as the Polar Gyrus.

101
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,933
Yes, that is correct.

102
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,720
Keep your cell phone
off in my classroom.

103
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:38,703
How about this? Faraj Habib.

104
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:42,800
I'd say if he weren't in Guantanamo
right now he'd be our guy.

105
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:47,502
- Nadeem Samad?
- I like him for this.

106
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,160
Well, he has no known ties to
any terrorist organization.

107
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:53,790
He has no criminal record.
He graduated college with honors.

108
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:57,853
He started obsessively visiting
terrorist web sites 14 months ago.

109
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,201
I'm on web sites all the time.
You're doing research.

110
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,361
Maybe he was too,
doing a paper in college.

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,602
He took two classes
with professor Samuels

112
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:08,280
and became a practicing muslim
all in the same time period.

113
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,723
Ruth, this is racial profiling.

114
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,901
Hmm. Or brilliant detective work.

115
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:16,402
Check him out.

116
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:22,430
Hey.

117
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,481
Aoki!

118
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,242
Oy!

119
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:34,131
Every time you crumple that paper,
it makes me want to kill myself.

120
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,251
That's what my last roommate did.

121
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,842
Great.

122
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,852
It was great.

123
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,710
I got all "A"s for the semester.

124
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,142
You're kidding.

125
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,961
Yes. What are you working on?

126
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,121
- Neuroscience lab work.
- Really?

127
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,993
I love that class.

128
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:54,413
- Easy "A."
- Of course you did.

129
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:58,801
- What are you working on?
- I have a paper on James Joyce due.

130
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,051
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,533
The dead.

132
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,441
I don't even understand
what it's about.

133
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,413
It's all, like,
irish and stupid and nothing happens--

134
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,813
No, it's a great book.

135
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,942
It's all from the husband's
point of view the whole time,

136
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,623
until the end of the book, when his wife
tells a story about her first love.

137
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,211
And the husband, who's been so
loving towards his wife all evening,

138
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,083
realizes she wasn't even
thinking about him.

139
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,253
She was thinking about her first love,
who's dead.

140
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,642
It's about how you can't escape.

141
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:25,653
Like somebody dies,
and you think you're free, but you're not.

142
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,070
The dead are always there.

143
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:29,860
Which is a different
ending to Ulysses,

144
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,736
which is all about love,
and life, and sex, and optimism--

145
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:33,735
Okay.

146
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,987
You want to--
you want to just do it for me?

147
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:41,113
- You want to do my lab work?
- Deal.

148
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,173
Deal, give me one of
these chocolate bars.

149
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,103
Sure.

150
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:52,120
There's a-- there's a party later,
if you want to go with me.

151
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:57,602
- So do you know lots of people here?
- Eh, a few.

152
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,892
- Ooh, there's food here.
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,813
Hey, the transfer
student from Oxford.

154
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,641
- The merciful T.A.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,122
- Tom Gilchrist.
- Clarissa.

156
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,900
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for earlier.

157
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:21,101
- I totally blanked.
- Well, Samuels can be intimidating.

158
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:24,452
Yeah, he is a little--
he's a mean, mean cranky old man.

159
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,000
- Yes, he is.
- That's what he is.

160
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:27,872
But you're very nice
to take pity on me.

161
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:31,690
Um, can I interest you
in a tasty beverage?

162
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,890
A tasty beverage. Who--
Step off. Who is this guy?

163
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:39,663
You know what they say about the brits.
We love our drinks.

164
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:40,691
Go away!

165
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,940
He's trying to get you drunk.
Can't you see at?

166
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,631
- Vodka, wine?
- Uh, wine.

167
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,832
So you must be lonely being
so far away from home.

168
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,511
Actually, no,
it's quite exciting being in America and all.

169
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,890
I feel like Felicity.

170
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:05,523
Only she wasn't from England,
and she wasn't a scientist,

171
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,223
and she went to college to look for a guy,
which I didn't, so...

172
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,622
I don't feel like Felicity at all.
I don't know what I'm saying.

173
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:13,970
Can you talk now?

174
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,941
I kind of like listening
to you free associate.

175
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,553
I feel a little discombobulated.
Jet lag.

176
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,143
How about you?
How long have you been Samuels' T.A?

177
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,012
Oh, just this semester.

178
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:28,833
It's too bad he's such a bastard,
because he really is brilliant.

179
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:33,440
He's... doing work that's
going to make a difference.

180
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,300
It's his work in neural
imaging research

181
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:38,332
that made me want to become his T.A.

182
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:44,512
My... my dad...
died of Parkinson's last year.

183
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,851
- I'm so sorry.
- Aw, oh, yeah? Aww!

184
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:52,951
Oh, god, the oldest trick in the book,
Sommers. Answer the phone!

185
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:58,343
But after he was diagnosed,
it was a wake up call.

186
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,830
Before that,
I was a bit of a screw up,

187
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,173
almost dropped out of college.

188
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:07,103
- You'd never know it.
- Well, now...

189
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,322
I want to be a neurosurgeon.

190
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:13,901
Neurosurgeon? Oh, what?
Was astronaut taken? Am I right?

191
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:18,561
I want to help people.
I want to change their lives.

192
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,933
You know, I want to make--

193
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,270
I'm sorry. This is boring.

194
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,193
- No, no.
- Yes,

195
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:29,161
chatty Cathy, cut the cord.
God, what-- okay.

196
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,313
Hate to have to do this to you,
Jaime, but you leave me no choice.

197
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:35,111
Ahh!

198
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:38,791
- You all right?
- Ow, yeah, bionic ear's hurting.

199
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:42,983
Yeah, earache.
I left my drops at home.

200
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,901
Could you excuse me?

201
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,733
- You're an ass.
- Tick tock, okay?

202
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,671
The changeover for the
lab isn't till 11:00.

203
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,442
- Yeah, which is in five minutes.
- Yeah, I know what time is it.

204
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,450
I was doing--
what do you call it-- recon.

205
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,442
Recon? You can't just throw
around the word recon, okay?

206
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,893
That wasn't recon.
That guy wants to be on top of you.

207
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,580
Really? Do you think so?

208
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,552
Get your head in the game, Sommers.
You gotta get over to the museum.

209
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:12,080
- What are you eating?
- Chinese food.

210
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,772
- Kung pao cafe?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,220
- You get the moo shu?
- Mmm, low mein chicken.

212
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,631
The moo shu's better.

213
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,203
You should see a ladder to the roof.

214
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:26,370
- There's no ladder.
- Okay, what's plan "b"?

215
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:30,863
Um...plan "b" is your bionic.
Figure it out.

216
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:31,981
Okay, hold on.

217
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:39,643
You okay?

218
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,683
Yeah, just hanging on to my cell phone.
It messed me up.

219
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,182
So typical of this place.

220
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:49,571
They spend $50 million on you,
and then won't spring for a bluetooth.

221
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,920
By the way,
I'll bet my paycheck that the story

222
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:57,222
about his dad dying of
Parkinson's was a load of... crap!

223
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,612
You're so cynical, Nathan.
It's not attractive.

224
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:03,520
- I'm telling you as a friend.
- I'm just saying that

225
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,832
you can't believe everything
everybody says to you.

226
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,230
And I'm just saying you have
to assume the best in people.

227
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,863
You have to assume that not everyone
is trying to screw you over.

228
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:15,361
Even if it's hard sometimes.
Okay, hang on a sec.

229
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:29,200
Okay, where was I? Yeah,
not everyone is gonna want to screw with you,

230
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:30,843
even if it's hard to believe.

231
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,660
Wow, that'd be a good attitude
to have if you weren't a spy.

232
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:37,810
- Why are you not in the lab already?
- I'm going as fast as I can, bossy.

233
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,300
Crap.

234
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,382
The glass is wired.

235
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,243
Don't worry, it's an analog circuit.

236
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,983
We can override that easy schmeezy.
Can you find the contacts?

237
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,140
By the way,
why are you using the accent with me?

238
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm a method actor.

239
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,061
Fine by me.
It's literally the hottest thing ever.

240
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:59,091
- Found 'em.
- Okay.

241
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:02,433
You gotta put something metal
between the contact points

242
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,440
to keep the circuit from breaking.
Like a paperclip or a hairpin.

243
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,010
Or a steel bar.

244
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:32,550
- Okay, give me the code.
- 3QR4561.

245
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,653
I'm here, I'm in. What do I do?

246
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:43,233
Computer, let's start scanning.
We need to get the dirt on Samuels.

247
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:45,900
So I'm a glorified fax machine?

248
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:49,340
Come on, don't sell yourself short.
You can also open cans.

249
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,782
We need to find out who he may have
contacted about the neural implants.

250
00:14:53,066 --> 00:15:00,152
Okay, old journal articles.
MPTP neurotoxicity.

251
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:03,970
Apparently the guy's a pioneer
in Parkinson's simulation.

252
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,201
There's some grant
applications. Wait.

253
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,761
Synthetic neurotransducers.

254
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,632
That's it, right, Nathan?

255
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:17,202
No, it looks good.
Now let's get out of there.

256
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:26,092
- What are you doing?
- I'm just curious about him.

257
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,970
- I want to know how old he is.
- Unbelievable.

258
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,483
- Professor Samuels.
- I know who you are.

259
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,581
Sean, go back to my office and

260
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:41,061
get started on the research
while I talk to Ms. Whyte.

261
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:45,541
I'm well aware of every pharmaceutical
company, competing university,

262
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,271
and everyone else trying to
steal information from us.

263
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,060
I don't know what
you're talking about.

264
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:52,232
- I just transferred in from Oxford.
- I don't care where you're from.

265
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,203
I just want to know what
you were doing in my lab.

266
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,221
Sir, I've wanted to be part
of this program for years.

267
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,371
You know,
you're a pioneer in Parkinson's simulation.

268
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,911
That's why I transferred here.
Your work is cutting edge.

269
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,973
And I made such an idiot of myself in class,
and someone said

270
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,612
if I wanted to get back in the good
books to clean out the monkey cages,

271
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,332
and now I realize it was a joke,
and I feel so stupid.

272
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:13,663
- How did you get past security?
- The door was unlocked.

273
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:18,321
Clarissa, what are you--

274
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:22,613
you didn't actually clean out
the monkey cages, did you?

275
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,183
Yeah, I did.

276
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,530
I told her to do that.

277
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:28,253
Sorry.

278
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm also the one that
left the door unlocked.

279
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,903
I forgot some papers to grade.
I came back to get them.

280
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,543
The only reason I'm here now

281
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,982
is because I remembered
I left the door unlocked.

282
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:38,992
Never happen again.

283
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:43,382
So... you're dedicated.
I'll give you that.

284
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:45,980
Okay, Tom.

285
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:50,393
How about you escort Ms. Whyte out.

286
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,311
I'm watching you.

287
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,733
Thanks.

288
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,843
What were you actually
doing in there?

289
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,383
- The truth?
- Yeah.

290
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,483
I was trying to get a
copy of the lecture.

291
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,461
I, um, can't read my notes,
and I'm in way over my head.

292
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,151
Well, I can help you with that.

293
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:13,363
You can?

294
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,540
For a price.

295
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:22,461
Dinner, tomorrow night.
8:00 work for you?

296
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,333
I'm supposed to buy you dinner?

297
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,232
I'm buying.
I just want you to show up.

298
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:34,643
Sure.

299
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:49,860
...didn't turn out quite as well
as I would've hoped, but...

300
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:55,251
You know what? The next time you
have a crappy lame hunch like this,

301
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,792
- put Nathan on it, please.
- What's the latest?

302
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,582
They're getting
through the appetizers.

303
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:03,433
She had the caesar. He had the soup du jour.
Both were wonderful.

304
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,131
The tortilla soup was a little
spicier than he expected.

305
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,013
And I swear to god,
if I have to sit here

306
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:11,223
while they order dessert,
I'm gonna kill you.

307
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,071
What a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on.

308
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:20,902
Hello.

309
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:22,823
Yes, that's right.

310
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:27,102
Sunday won't be acceptable.
Friday. We said 5,000.

311
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,812
Get backup.
We're gonna need someone on this guy 24/7.

312
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:36,841
There are those who find DNA
mapping to be the key to our future.

313
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,941
Me, it's the map of the brain.
The way we think.

314
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:45,280
How, why, who we are is in here.

315
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,010
Yes?

316
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,713
Check this out.

317
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,661
Before the implant,
the subject's tremors were so severe

318
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,943
he couldn't hold a knife,
a fork, drive a car.

319
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,813
- That's amazing.
- You think that's good?

320
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,532
Watch this.

321
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:13,103
He can juggle. Great.

322
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,831
No, you're missing the point.

323
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,093
The neural implant not only
reroutes the pathways,

324
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,820
but it acts as a receiver.

325
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:22,361
You send a signal to juggle,
and he juggles.

326
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,280
What you're seeing there...
totally involuntary.

327
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,293
- It's sick.
- Wait.

328
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,633
- You can make him do that?
- Anything. Watch this.

329
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,273
When a computer takes over his body,

330
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,471
the subject can be more coordinated
and capable than he ever was before.

331
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:41,770
Stop it.

332
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,240
Stop it!

333
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:51,250
We can modify pain tolerance too.
Brave new world, isn't it?

334
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,982
- What do we got?
- Nothing.

335
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,990
The guy hasn't made any
modifications to the application.

336
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:01,871
He's just treating parkinson's.

337
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,523
There's no money
trail with him either.

338
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:07,952
Maybe he's not the guy.

339
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,791
Whoa, whoa. Who's that?

340
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:17,842
Oh, it's the T.A.
who's trying to get into Jaime's pants.

341
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:20,371
- Really.
- I know. It's like,

342
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:23,093
"keep your grubby hands off our
50 million dollar piece of--"

343
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:24,981
- Hey!
- Yeah, right, right, right.

344
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:29,650
- So what do we know about him?
- He went to undergrad at Stanford.

345
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,142
Majored in cognitive and
neurosystem sciences.

346
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:33,602
Oh, really.

347
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,483
I went to Stanford.

348
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:41,641
Okay.

349
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,480
I just think that technology
has become way too advanced.

350
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:49,012
Isn't it creepy?
I mean, it's mind control.

351
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:54,383
Well, the possibility for abuse exists,
but think of all the people who--

352
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,611
you know what,
I don't want to talk about the chip.

353
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:01,182
Let's talk about you.

354
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,570
You're just here for
a semester, right?

355
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,973
- Yeah.
- I guess I have to work fast then.

356
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,371
- Oh, wow.
- I know, bold.

357
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:10,501
Yeah.

358
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,573
Just tell me if I have to slow down.

359
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,153
This is-- this is cool.

360
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:20,203
I just realized this
is my college fantasy.

361
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,233
This is just what I
thought it would be like.

362
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,193
Mm-hmm.

363
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:27,233
What? What?! What?

364
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,442
You-- you have
something on your nose.

365
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:30,790
- Oh, god!
- No, it's okay.

366
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,341
- Here, wait.
- Embarrassing.

367
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,683
I think you need a
little more on there.

368
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:45,582
Hi!

369
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:49,023
Hi.

370
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:51,503
What, you're not gonna
introduce me, Clarissa?

371
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:55,743
- Uh, this is Tony, my--
- Uncle. How are you?

372
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:02,782
I know, it confuses a lot of people,
me being american and all.

373
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:06,842
- Sure. Hi, Tony. I'm Tom.
- Shouldn't you be at work?

374
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,500
Actually, I need a little word.
It's really important.

375
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:17,250
Oh! Well, I gotta get going anyway,
but it's great meeting you.

376
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:21,400
We're still on for 8:00, right?
Dinner, you and me? Okay.

377
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:26,753
- What the hell is that about?
- We think Samuels is clean.

378
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:28,911
But that guy Tom is
under some scrutiny.

379
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,400
He only has a paper trail
for the last six years.

380
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:33,742
- Before that, nothing.
- That doesn't mean he's involved.

381
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:36,603
He says he majored at cognitive
neurosystem sciences at Stanford.

382
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:38,900
There isn't a degree of
that name at Stanford.

383
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,133
So he lied on his application.
A lot of people do.

384
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,593
He's had a hard time.
His dad died of Parkinson's, you know.

385
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,101
We have to assume that
he's the enemy, Jaime.

386
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:52,250
I don't believe it. My gut tells
me he has nothing to do with this.

387
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,650
The last time you listened
to your gut about a guy,

388
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,571
you had your limbs replaced.

389
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:12,143
Your paper's done.
I emailed it to you.

390
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:16,001
- Mmm, these are delicious.
- I know, huh?

391
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,510
I have some butterfingers
hidden in the bathroom,

392
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:21,680
but they're better dipped
in butterscotch pudding.

393
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:26,733
- What's with all the hiding food?
- I just like secret food, okay?

394
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,563
Why is that such a big deal?

395
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,392
It's time to take my meds.

396
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:37,681
Hello.

397
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,172
I thought we should have a
little post-first kiss caucus.

398
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,230
I'm good with the kiss.
It was great.

399
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,640
Let's do it again some time.

400
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,422
Well, what are you doing right now?

401
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:50,351
Oh, not now. I'm cramming.

402
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,550
I have to go to the bookstore to
get this book on neuroscience.

403
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:56,000
Microchips for dummies,
I think it's called.

404
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,593
Supposed to be brilliant.

405
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:01,693
- All right. We still on for 8:00?
- Absolutely.

406
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:05,413
Great. Bye.

407
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,131
Bye.

408
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:13,062
Oh, my god. You totally like him.

409
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,041
Stop!

410
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:36,300
You have no idea what
I can do to you.

411
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:39,410
I can't stop myself. Help me.

412
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:46,943
Matches the one they pulled
out the soldier in Iraq.

413
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:50,761
- My god. Is he gonna be okay?
- They think so.

414
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,541
Who knew where you were going?

415
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,400
- Tom.
- What did I tell you?

416
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:59,510
- It wasn't him.
- Can I just--

417
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,812
What does a guy have to do to
get you to break up with him?

418
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,150
- He had you manchurian candidated.
- The drop is now up to 5,000 chips.

419
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:09,222
That's it. I'm pulling you off this.

420
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:11,452
- No, you're not.
- Yes, he is. It's too dangerous.

421
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:15,200
I can help. If he's the bad guy,
I want to know just as much as you do.

422
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:19,572
Come on. You're not gonna get
anybody closer to him than me.

423
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:29,973
- How's your sushi?
- Mmm, good.

424
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:35,743
- How's yours?
- Yeah, it's great. I love sushi.

425
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,870
I don't really like sushi. Sorry.

426
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:42,110
It's okay,
I don't really like sushi either.

427
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,502
Well, why did we come here?

428
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm sorry, this is a little weird.

429
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,891
- You feel weird.
- You just seem kind of stressed.

430
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,531
- Do I?
- Just a little bit.

431
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:54,733
It feels like something's on your mind.
You look a little preoccupied.

432
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm sorry, I just insulted you, didn't I?
That was terrible.

433
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:00,940
This is not going the
way I wanted it to go.

434
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:01,642
No.

435
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,913
I didn't mean that.
You look beautiful. You really do.

436
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:08,190
And I don't know why I'm still talking.
This is going kind of awfully.

437
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:11,771
You look amazing, and I'm--
all I'm doing is insulting you.

438
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,070
It's really terrible.
Do you want to--

439
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:15,903
Do you want to get out of here?

440
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,503
- I would love that.
- Shall we?

441
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,981
- I think that's a great idea.
- Best idea you've had all night.

442
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:41,863
- Uh, you know what would be good?
- Yeah, I'm one step ahead of you.

443
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:47,123
Do you, um--I know this may sound silly.
Do you have any champagne?

444
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:52,480
- Do-- You want champagne?
- Yeah.

445
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:55,920
All right, I'll get some champagne.
What kind do you like?

446
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:58,933
- The pink kind.
- Of course you do.

447
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:08,953
Be right back.

448
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,390
This guy's too good to be true.

449
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:22,270
Tarragon? He is the perfect guy.

450
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:27,111
Tarragon?

451
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:29,741
He's too perfect.

452
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:42,041
He lied. I'm an idiot.

453
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,983
We'll know if it's the
same chip by morning.

454
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,112
Nathan needs to run a few tests,
so we'll just keep him under observation.

455
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,012
He's gonna want to know
what happened to me.

456
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:51,451
And he's gonna want to know
what happened to his microchip.

457
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,550
No, just sit tight.
We've got your dorm room wired.

458
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,220
Subject spotted with a blue sweater.

459
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,411
Subject at the door.

460
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:32,293
Five...

461
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,931
four, three...

462
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:36,330
two, one.

463
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:45,750
Let's do this.

464
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:02,461
- Go, go, go!
- Show me your hands!

465
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,000
- Show me your hands!
- Don't shoot, no!

466
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:06,582
Clear!

467
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:14,011
- What are you doing here?
- My brother lives here, man.

468
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:17,211
I was just dropping off his ipod.
I swear to you.

469
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:30,653
This is for transporting the chips.

470
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,691
Who supplies to you?

471
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,450
I don't know what
you're talking about--

472
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,742
What I am talking about
is the Everest project!

473
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,042
What I am talking about
is american soldiers

474
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,253
that you are participating
in murdering.

475
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:52,303
Tell me who is
supplying to you... now.

476
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:22,030
Was that your family?
Is this why you did what you did?

477
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:31,110
Nadeem... you're
killing innocent men.

478
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:33,410
That's all you're accomplishing.

479
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:38,573
Tell me where the drop
is and when the drop is,

480
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,440
and no one else needs
to get hurt by this.

481
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:44,663
This is what I think.

482
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,182
Too many people have died already.

483
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,691
Your people...

484
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,100
our people.

485
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:58,252
So let's just end this here.

486
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:18,363
- Hello.
- Jaime, the chip's a match.

487
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:20,810
Antonio just found out the drop is now,
right now.

488
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:23,682
We're on our way, so you follow him.
Do not let him make the drop.

489
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:26,411
- Kill him if you have to.
- Okay.

490
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:01,862
- Hey, Lee.
- Here, man.

491
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:04,562
Got the answers to the final,
all right?

492
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,103
- You're a friggin' angel, man.
- I know.

493
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:08,363
Thank you.

494
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:17,011
- Excuse me. Can I have that?
- What?

495
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:18,811
- Can you give me your paper?
- No, that's mine.

496
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,161
- Just give it to me.
- No, it's mine.

497
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,200
- I need this, okay?
- No, you don't understand--

498
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:23,843
- Back away.
- I need that--

499
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:25,913
- Back away!
- Crazy bitch!

500
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,182
Whoa, let me guess.
You stand him up too?

501
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,710
Obviously you thought I was
handing him something covert.

502
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:38,861
- No, I--
- Who are you?

503
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:40,403
- Who are you?
- I asked you first.

504
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,631
- Why were you following me?
- I wasn't following you.

505
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,551
- Are you FBI?
- No!

506
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:48,423
You're friggin' FBI, aren't you?
You're supposed to leave this to us.

507
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,581
- Who is us?
- Come on.

508
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:52,642
- God, are you like a CIA agent?
- Well, what the hell are you?

509
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,660
I'm with the Berkut group.

510
00:34:58,237 --> 00:34:59,742
- The Berkut group.
- Yeah.

511
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:02,461
The insidious, arrogant,
always getting in our way--

512
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,331
Oh, did I mention arrogant--
Berkut group?

513
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,331
Look, it's really just a
temporary gig for me, okay?

514
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,812
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

515
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,480
- I thought it was you.
- Well, it's not.

516
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:17,733
- I thought maybe it was you.
- You're the good guy.

517
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:20,841
Well, CIA.
It's open to interpretation.

518
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:23,123
The Berkut group had
you investigating me?

519
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,492
First Samuels, then you. Sorry.

520
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:29,691
That's why you went out with me,
isn't it?

521
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,080
Yeah-- I mean,
not at first, but then yeah.

522
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,583
- Well, that really sucks.
- Why'd you want to go out with me?

523
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,253
Because I thought you
might be the buyer.

524
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,822
- Yeah, well, same thing.
- No, no, it's completely different.

525
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:42,612
I marked you off my list before--
What happened to your accent?

526
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:45,241
- I'm not really from england.
- Oh, that's disappointing.

527
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:48,582
I loved the way you said "brilliant."
It was really a selling point.

528
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,091
- It turned me on.
- Yeah, well,

529
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:52,672
you wanting to be neurosurgeon was a
big turn on and selling point for me,

530
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,953
- and that was crap, right?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,632
- Your name's not Clarissa, is it?
- You're not Tom?

532
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:00,713
Hello, Sean.

533
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:02,663
You got it?

534
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,573
Stay right here. We'll come to you.

535
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,702
- Wait, isn't that--
- Yeah, it is.

536
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:18,071
- They're making the drop.
- All right, I'll go down,

537
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:21,143
- you stay up here and cover me.
- Don't underestimate me.

538
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,583
Relax, I'm trying to be chivalrous.

539
00:36:32,696 --> 00:36:33,773
Drop the bag, Sean.

540
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,232
- That wasn't a request.
- Don't do it.

541
00:36:37,415 --> 00:36:38,890
Oh, I think you
should do what I say.

542
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:51,331
- I'm not afraid to die.
- I can arrange that.

543
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:02,843
- You all right?
- Yeah.

544
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:03,820
Look out!

545
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:59,032
Get up or die.
Get up, get up, get up.

546
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,393
Get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

547
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,723
Don't move, man.
I swear to you, don't move.

548
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:15,401
Where's Sean?

549
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,570
- You got some cuffs on you?
- Yeah.

550
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:20,532
You want to cuff him?

551
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:30,461
How did you do that?

552
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:32,283
Top secret.

553
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:43,803
- You all right?
- I'm good.

554
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:45,251
Okay.

555
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:55,620
Had a nice chat with our boy Sean.

556
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:59,911
Why'd he do it?
Some deeply distorted political reason?

557
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:01,081
Money.

558
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:04,993
So why does the CIA
hate Berkut so much?

559
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:08,193
Well, you ask me, they're jealous.

560
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:11,862
We do what the military,
the CIA, and the FBI can't.

561
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:15,062
We don't have any red
tape or bureaucracy.

562
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,530
We get things done, Jaime.

563
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:29,973
Not a good idea.

564
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:50,293
- I can't believe you're leaving.
- Yeah, I have to go back to England.

565
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:52,970
- Family emergency.
- That's too bad.

566
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,782
- You were my favorite roommate.
- Oh.

567
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,401
Oh, check it out.

568
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,443
You got an "A" on your
James Joyce paper.

569
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:06,123
Now the prof wants me to
apply to her graduate program.

570
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:09,412
So I don't know how I'm
gonna get out of that.

571
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:15,413
Oh, uh, keep it. I'm late for class.

572
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:23,520
- See you around.
- See you.

573
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:57,410
Where are you going?

574
00:40:57,648 --> 00:41:01,373
I was just, uh, casing the joint.
You know, gonna rob you later.

575
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,342
You were coming to see me,
weren't you?

576
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,730
Yeah, I was just-- you know,

577
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:07,883
I wanted to see how you were, and--

578
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,111
Come on, help me pack.

579
00:41:15,198 --> 00:41:17,272
So I joined the army
right after high school.

580
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,190
They gave me some tests.

581
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:21,581
Sent me to college, trained me,

582
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:23,543
and put me right in the field.

583
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,120
I've got a nice face.

584
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:27,942
People trust me.

585
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:29,573
That's true.

586
00:41:31,988 --> 00:41:34,812
So... what about you?

587
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,113
I mean, what's your story?

588
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:41,221
I mean, you've got quite an arm.

589
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,700
Were you a quarterback in
high school or something?

590
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,283
I don't want to talk about that.

591
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:49,141
It's my last night at college.
Can we just hang out?

592
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,721
Pretend we're normal?
Can we just have a night?

593
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:52,750
Yeah.

594
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,963
Wait, wait. Um...

595
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,360
I don't even know your name.

596
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:07,502
Jaime.

597
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,283
Jaime Sommers.

598
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:12,121
Hi, Jaime.
