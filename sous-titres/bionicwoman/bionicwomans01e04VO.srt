1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:02,392
Previously on Bionic Woman...

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:06,266
This saving the world thing?

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:09,839
- I'd like to give that a try.
- Anything else?

4
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:11,799
What are you doing?

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,990
I'm trying to buy back your love
because I've been working so much.

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,064
You get some bad ideas in your
head these days, don't you, Sarah?

7
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,898
It's the bionics, isn't it?

8
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,588
They've changed me.

9
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,558
Turned me into this thing.

10
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:28,330
We think Sarah Corvus might be
working with Anthony Anthros.

11
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,206
- Will's father?
- He escaped from prison.

12
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:34,125
He tried to sell bionics
to the highest bidder.

13
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:36,197
Am I ticking time bomb too?

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,402
I guess I just want
to know the truth.

15
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,932
About everything.

16
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:43,180
I don't like secrets, Jaime.

17
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:48,502
You're not gonna kill me twice,
are you?

18
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:53,320
And we all know that if your
training is worth a damn,

19
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,062
I should be able to
take this crowbar

20
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:58,222
and swing it as hard and as
fast as humanly possible--

21
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:37,011
This is what you call
studying at Rachel's house?

22
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,613
- Who the hell is she?
- Nobody.

23
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,681
- Jaime, stop!
- You lied to me!

24
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,672
You looked me right in
the face and you lied.

25
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,310
You're a piece of work,
you know that?

26
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,653
This is the thanks I get for
buying you those $1,000 jeans?

27
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,830
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're 15 years old.

28
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,193
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

29
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,212
I'm living my life, Jaime.
It's none of your business.

30
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,373
Oh, yes, it is my business.

31
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:59,473
Hey, do you know she's 15 years old?
You could go to jail!

32
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:02,542
- You said you were 18.
- Shut up! We're going home.

33
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:07,282
- What did you do to my toe?
- It's my toe.

34
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:10,773
And why does it hurt? What happened
to the self-healing anthrocytes?

35
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,523
Well, you're an early
prototype, Jaime.

36
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:17,061
As time goes on, we're gonna
discover countless imperfections.

37
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:20,253
That's so not reassuring.
And you're giving me the creeps.

38
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:22,981
You keep staring at it.
Do you have a foot fetish?

39
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,622
Actually, no, Jaime, I do not.

40
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:28,921
I'm pretty much just
a simple boob man.

41
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:32,170
- You did this surveilling your sister?
- She lied right to my face.

42
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,591
Just looked at me and lied.
"I'm going to Rachel's house."

43
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,391
Well, that's what teenagers do.

44
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,743
They lie. They get tattoos.

45
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:42,401
They have wild sex,
and then knock off liquor stores.

46
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,743
Okay, your toe is screwed.

47
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:47,853
I'm gonna have to shock
that thing into submission.

48
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:50,493
Now this shouldn't hurt at all.

49
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,292
On three.

50
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:55,471
One.

51
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,370
- You suck!
- Here's what I think.

52
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,203
You cannot begrudge a
teenage girl the opportunity

53
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,503
to make out in parked
cars with older guys.

54
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:06,801
It's the lying.

55
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:11,661
Isn't this righteous indignation
just a tiny bit hypocritical

56
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:15,063
considering you're a $50 million
weapon leading a double life?

57
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:18,221
That's mean. Look, I don't really
care so much about what she does.

58
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,671
I know she's gonna make
stupid mistakes and all that.

59
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:23,782
I just don't want her to lie to
me because then I can't help her.

60
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,330
Huh, that sounds good.
Tell her that.

61
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:29,693
Check it out. Good as new.

62
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,230
- You're a genius.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,952
Let's keep this
between us, okay?

64
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:34,690
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

65
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:45,153
I'll see you,
and I'll raise you all in.

66
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:48,832
Everything.

67
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:51,630
That's a lot of coin.

68
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:54,170
You know,
people say that men take all the risks.

69
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:55,991
I'm here to tell
you it isn't true.

70
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,701
You all turn out to be a
bunch of scared little boys.

71
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,420
It's disappointing.
It really is.

72
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:07,240
Sarah, put your
hands on your head.

73
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,020
I guess the fun's over.

74
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,660
This is my boyfriend.

75
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:15,923
It's an on again off again sort
of thing. You know how it is.

76
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:19,250
I kill all those people.
He shot me in the head.

77
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:23,433
Our friends call us the Bickersons.
Isn't that right, honey?

78
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,643
But you know what they say.

79
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:31,173
At the end of the day the most
important thing in the world...

80
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,843
is love.

81
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,213
I knew the game was fixed.

82
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,330
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:13,893
- You owe me $27,269.31 for the toe.
- How'd you find out about that?

84
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:18,141
Your bionics represent the most advanced
form of biotechnology known to man.

85
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,123
It was developed to
protect the human race,

86
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:21,662
not spy on your
delinquent sister.

87
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,773
You know,
I find your whole proprietary attitude

88
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,713
about my body to be
deeply inappropriate.

89
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:27,762
How's the toe?

90
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,632
Take a look at this.

91
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,670
My name is Mark Stevens.

92
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,883
I'm an american doctor
working in Paraguay.

93
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:36,990
I'm being held against my will.

94
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,533
They say that they
will kill me unless--

95
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:47,292
A group that calls themselves
"the sons of the red sand"

96
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,213
took Stevens in Ciudad Del Este
two days ago. They claim he's CIA.

97
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:52,050
Is he?

98
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:54,072
He's american.
That's enough for them.

99
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,382
He's got some incredibly
sensitive information.

100
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,342
And they're gonna
behead him in 48 hours

101
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,931
unless the CIA admits he's theirs,
which they won't.

102
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:03,422
- So why is this our problem?
- You mean besides the fact

103
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,693
he's an american who could
get his head chopped off?

104
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,942
I mean, why isn't the
military sending someone in?

105
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:10,061
Paraguay never passed
any anti-terrorism laws.

106
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:12,841
They're not about to let the U.S.
mount an operation on their soil.

107
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,132
- But we can?
- The two of you can.

108
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,911
Anything that looks like
special ops is out.

109
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,981
But an american couple
moving about the city?

110
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,762
I want to help this guy,
but I don't think

111
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,563
I can fly off to Paraguay
right now. Becca--

112
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,001
Becca will be watched 24/7
by a surveillance team.

113
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:32,292
Okay, I'm in. Just--
what am I gonna tell Becca?

114
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,540
You'll think of something.

115
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:09,121
Ah... the eggs!

116
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:30,633
You were cooking?
Who are you making breakfast for?

117
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:34,151
- You.
- Why are you making me breakfast?

118
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:37,172
About last night.
I just want to clear the air. I was--

119
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,243
Fine.

120
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,370
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you.

121
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,870
Yeah, I mean, I shouldn't have done it.
It was dumb.

122
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,503
Besides, that guy's
a creep anyway.

123
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,082
I mean,
usually those internet chat room guys,

124
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,133
you know,
they turn out to be reasonably cool.

125
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,141
Oh, my god!

126
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,491
I'm kidding.

127
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,741
God, you think I'm retarded?

128
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:04,621
- No, I don't think you're retarded.
- Yeah, you do.

129
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:06,403
So what's going on with you?

130
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,033
Um, well,
Carly invited me up to Napa

131
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,151
to celebrate her
getting into law school.

132
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,962
- Oh, well, that should be fun.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,010
- We land on an airstrip.
- An airstrip?

134
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:30,003
- Is that different from an airport?
- Well, yeah, it's dirt.

135
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,301
I have an asset in place,
a local cop.

136
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:34,702
He's gonna help us locate
Stevens when we get there.

137
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,341
How can you land a
747 on a dirt runway?

138
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,740
No, it's not a 747.
It's a little gulfstream.

139
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,382
- Really?
- You okay with that?

140
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,650
Yeah, I'm good.

141
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,642
Um, do you have any
anti-anxiety meds?

142
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,701
Sedatives? Anything
in that area?

143
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,020
Hi, Jaime. How's it going?

144
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:56,846
You look great. How's Becca?

145
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:01,205
Stevens is running out of time.
We have to go now.

146
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,237
Jonas will take
care of her. Okay?

147
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,853
We're almost done.

148
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:22,791
I'm just getting started.

149
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,630
Stop--

150
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,503
Let him go, Sarah.

151
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,483
Take him to the infirmary.

152
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,890
- You're not helping yourself.
- Reflexes.

153
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,902
Your reflexes were recalibrated
through sensory neurons

154
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:44,871
with your original surgery.
That was hostility.

155
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,423
You noticed.

156
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,792
A girl likes to be noticed.

157
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,343
Let's cut to the chase.

158
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,501
You're having hand tremors,
night sweats, anxiety, paranoia.

159
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,522
Even paranoids have enemies.

160
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,162
The bottom line is the
medicine Anthros gave you

161
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:02,412
barely gave you any relief.
The truth is it probably made you worse.

162
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,343
Are you're gonna fix me?
My hero.

163
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:06,741
Isn't that what you want?

164
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,910
From you? I want nothing.

165
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:11,020
Kill me or let me go.

166
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,753
You know, I tried that once before.
It didn't work.

167
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,561
- This time I thought I'd help.
- You don't know how.

168
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:20,050
Will was working on an upgrade.
I want Anthony Anthros.

169
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,360
You tell me where he is,
you get your life back.

170
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,452
- You're full of crap, Jonas.
- And you're getting worse.

171
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,862
Who made me this way?

172
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,720
You're a liar, Jonas!

173
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,641
A liar playing God!

174
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:53,541
My contact has a very good idea
where Stevens is being held.

175
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:54,570
Uh-huh.

176
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:59,031
He's gonna meet us there. Hook us up
with some transportation when we--

177
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:06,493
- You okay?
- I'm scared of flying.

178
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:08,093
I couldn't find any drugs,

179
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,782
and I think getting wasted
before a mission is a bad idea.

180
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:16,453
I just think, you know, a hunk of
metal in the sky. Counterintuitive.

181
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,380
Okay. Let's talk
about something else.

182
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:19,833
Okay.

183
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,982
I'm upset because I keep lying
to my sister about my job.

184
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,102
You're protecting her.
You're not lying.

185
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:30,393
If she knew the truth about you
putting your life on the line,

186
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,501
I don't think she would
be able to handle that.

187
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't think I buy that.
I think everybody should know the truth.

188
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,553
No, the world just doesn't
work like that, Jaime.

189
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:38,931
But then how can
you have trust?

190
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,332
Trust and full disclosure
is not the same thing.

191
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,531
You trust me right?

192
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:48,842
Relatively speaking.

193
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,052
But what do you
know about me, hmm?

194
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:53,581
What have I disclosed?

195
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,380
This is supposed to
make me feel better?

196
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,861
All you need to know is that we're
a team and that I have your back.

197
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,541
- Isn't that enough?
- Thank you.

198
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,101
Easy, tiger! Easy, easy!

199
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,251
That's your bionic hand.
That's your bionic hand.

200
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:08,340
- Sorry.
- Okay.

201
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,482
We must hurry.

202
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,121
No one can know we've met.

203
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:32,802
Remember, Paraguay is
a complicated place.

204
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,331
We have no laws
against terrorism.

205
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:39,013
And this group has legitimate
business interests.

206
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,130
Kidnap and ransom
is legitimate?

207
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,462
All the perimeter
doors are alarmed.

208
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,890
The only other access is
through the venting system.

209
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,350
But it's blocked
by an exhaust fan.

210
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,990
It'll take your head
off before they will.

211
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,821
Thanks. We'll keep
that in mind.

212
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,132
If they catch you,
I don't know you.

213
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,522
My police won't help you.

214
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,162
My opinion, for what little it's worth,
this is suicide.

215
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,021
But you americans know
all there is to know

216
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:08,571
about handling these
foreign situations, yes?

217
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,361
He's an optimist.

218
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,711
Okay, we get in,
we get him, we get out.

219
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,302
Sure, easy.

220
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,301
There wasn't supposed
to be an alarm.

221
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,480
Just get us in.

222
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:32,011
- You know how to disarm it?
- Stevens' life is ticking away.

223
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:35,252
Just do it. Trust me.

224
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:56,591
You're a machine.
Don't think about it.

225
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,232
Even if it's not real,
it's still attached.

226
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:03,711
I'd like to keep it that way.
Give me a second.

227
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,551
See?

228
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,803
Matter over mind.

229
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:49,070
What now?

230
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:01,761
Are you crazy?

231
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:03,402
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,570
I suggest you follow my
lead or you'll be shot.

233
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:10,602
You told me I could trust you.

234
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,623
Beauty is supposed to be the
mark God sets upon virtue.

235
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,573
And are you God in that homily?

236
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,982
She got less virtue
than she bargained for.

237
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,830
Look, I know you don't
want to believe this,

238
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,380
but every step of the way she
had no bigger supporter than me.

239
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,100
So why make her your enemy?
She needs help.

240
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,160
Will came up with a fix
before he was killed.

241
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,220
Swap out the nerve bundles,
infuse new anthrocytes.

242
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:01,810
- So what are you waiting for?
- She knows where Anthros is.

243
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,363
He's been giving her treatment.

244
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:07,342
Maybe if you fixed her,
she'd talk.

245
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:10,503
Chicken, egg.
Be her friend, Jae.

246
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:15,860
You want to help her?
Help her help herself.

247
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,010
- At least we're together.
- You're out of your mind.

248
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,632
We're about to be executed.

249
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,003
No, they'll want to make an
example out of us to Stevens,

250
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,781
or they'll want to make an
example out of him for us.

251
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:52,492
Either way,
that gets us to him.

252
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:53,971
I need you to lose the
fear and go bionic.

253
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,732
If I told you what I was going to do,
you would've backed out--

254
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:06,443
Friends of yours?

255
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:11,113
I believe, Dr. Stevens, that you
don't believe what will happen to you

256
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:15,362
if you don't decode the
contents of your flash drive.

257
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,712
Which is nothing compared
to what will happen to her.

258
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:21,391
Please, I'm working
as fast as I can.

259
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,311
Perhaps you need a
little inspiration.

260
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:29,731
Wait, it's a multi-level
asymmetric encryption!

261
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,710
It's gonna take time.

262
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:41,983
Allah akbar.

263
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,710
Now would be a
good time, Jaime.

264
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:46,650
Jaime, now!

265
00:18:31,438 --> 00:18:35,452
- Jonas says he can help you.
- And he's got every reason to lie.

266
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:38,212
He's also a man
of self-interest.

267
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,972
You're valuable to him.

268
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:43,602
He's playing you.

269
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:46,993
Getting off watching
this dance.

270
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,182
Or you're playing me.

271
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,063
I want you to know
you can trust me.

272
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,740
I want you back.

273
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,763
We all want something back.

274
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,350
Even if Jonas could help me,
I don't trust him.

275
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,233
Do you trust me?

276
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,833
Bring me proof that Jonas
is telling the truth.

277
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:08,510
That they made advancements
they can use to fix me.

278
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:14,233
I might remember where
he can find Anthros.

279
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,461
Take this rope.

280
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:25,983
We'll tie him and take him.

281
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:32,202
Take the rope, tie his hands up.
We gotta move.

282
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:33,801
What are you gonna do to him?

283
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:36,481
No worse than what he
was going do to you.

284
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:38,760
You want answers, right?

285
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,150
Then when you're done,

286
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,882
take him down to the fan room.

287
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:48,171
What about you and Stevens?

288
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,052
What about me?

289
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,490
He stays.

290
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:56,741
What are you talking about?

291
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,140
- You deciphered the flash drive.
- I was stalling.

292
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,781
- You read it!
- What was on the flash drive?

293
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:04,011
Tell me.

294
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:06,813
You.

295
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:11,710
Blueprints, materials, everything
there is to know about bionics.

296
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,442
If you know what was on that drive,
then you know who gave it to me.

297
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:16,843
To decipher, not to read.

298
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,650
This doesn't make any sense.

299
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:20,971
We came here to save him.

300
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,890
- And we would have.
- I'm not gonna say anything.

301
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:29,050
Yeah, until you're caught,
tortured, or your brother is taken.

302
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,730
They put a machete to a pretty girl's
neck, you were gonna give it up.

303
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:35,190
- I was trying to save you.
- Take him down to the fan room.

304
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:37,313
So you're just gonna kill him,
is that it?

305
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:41,721
Jaime, go. Go!

306
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:45,810
Damn it!

307
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:48,920
Far end of the building,
fan room, I'll meet you there, go.

308
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:54,263
You let him go, he talks,
you're in the crosshairs.

309
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:57,891
A target for people to catch and
dissect. You won't last a month.

310
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,252
Then I won't.

311
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:40,672
Are you okay?

312
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:41,943
You've been hit.

313
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,172
Go through.

314
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,460
Thank you.

315
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:05,553
- What you did back there.
- It was stupid.

316
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,333
I'm gonna get us both killed.

317
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,721
I have no plan.
You know that, right?

318
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,613
There'll be supplies in
here for your wound.

319
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,360
- We can't stop.
- No, you can't keep going.

320
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:16,612
Can you get the lock?

321
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:37,651
Can you see what
numbers to push?

322
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:40,330
Your eye,
can you tell what numbers?

323
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,730
2569.

324
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:57,170
These are usually four digit codes.
That gives us 24 combinations.

325
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,272
Let's try it in reverse.
Highest probability.

326
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:07,433
All right.

327
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:12,513
Who gave you the flash drive?

328
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:16,462
I have a contact.
A voice on the phone.

329
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,581
When he needs help,
he tells me where to pick things up.

330
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,431
What about the terrorists?

331
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,721
Do you know who hired them?

332
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:26,780
I assumed it was just them.

333
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:29,921
Somebody tipped 'em off
to what I was doing.

334
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,651
Okay, your body's in shock.

335
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:42,073
You really are a doctor?
It's not just a cover?

336
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:46,871
Yale medical school.
Two-year residency at Walter Reed.

337
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:48,943
Specialty in espionage?

338
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:54,480
I was always kind of a savant
with word games and puzzles.

339
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:02,943
How many words can you make out of the
letters in yoo-hoo, that kind of thing.

340
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,801
I was showing off one day at Walter
Reed and a CIA guy recruited me.

341
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,260
You don't feel that?

342
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:20,650
How bad?

343
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,930
The human response to a
foreign object is to repel it

344
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,523
and fight it like an infection.

345
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:30,021
But you...

346
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,133
... Aren't human?

347
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,701
You have anthrocytes.

348
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:38,612
The files say they're designed to keep
your body from rejecting the bionics.

349
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,671
So they work to incorporate
what's foreign and not repel it.

350
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,121
Doesn't sound so bad.

351
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,951
The anthrocytes are
moving the bullet.

352
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,492
It could damage other organs.

353
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,311
I need to take it out.

354
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:56,721
Now.

355
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,863
- She could be dead.
- No, she's not.

356
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:03,642
She's still green.

357
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,482
It was your idea to
send her in, Jonas.

358
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:07,102
And you nearly
got her executed!

359
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:09,602
You know the risk involved
better than anyone, buddy.

360
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:14,180
No, willingly surrendering a $50 million
bionic woman is not in my play book.

361
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,671
Well, it got us inside to get
Stevens and the flash drive.

362
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,090
You don't have the flash drive,
and you don't have Jaime.

363
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,122
Well, how about I get off the
phone so I can go and find her?

364
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,472
You better. And Antonio?

365
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:28,772
You treat her like she's expendable
again, I won't be this nice.

366
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:33,782
Do not tell me how to do my job.
I'm gonna go and get your girl back.

367
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:05,820
Carly?

368
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:09,720
- What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you too.

369
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,311
Seriously, what are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

370
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:14,791
Yeah, I just borrowed
these from Jaime.

371
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:18,843
- She home?
- No, she's in Napa...

372
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:20,723
with you.

373
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:22,781
Excuse me?

374
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:25,212
Exactly.

375
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:37,652
- What are you looking for?
- What you promised Sarah.

376
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,760
Proof of Will's upgrades.
You told me to get her trust.

377
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:43,923
- I'm trying to get her trust.
- You didn't trust me.

378
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,702
There's nothing here.
No files at all.

379
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:49,393
- What is going on, Jonas?
- I don't know.

380
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,133
So you lied to me?

381
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:54,580
I told you Will was working on fixes,
not that I had them.

382
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:57,643
Apparently, the files are on
a flash drive in Paraguay.

383
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,231
How?

384
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,922
I don't think we knew Will
as well as we thought.

385
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,191
Ah, damn it!

386
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:17,873
Sorry.

387
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,602
Not what you want to be
hearing from your surgeon.

388
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:24,650
How you holding up?

389
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,861
I've been sitting here thinking
about all the lies I've been told.

390
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:34,091
All the lies I've been telling,
even to myself.

391
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,133
How do you make peace with it?

392
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:40,210
You don't.

393
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:43,752
You do what you can.

394
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,731
Sometimes you pay a price.

395
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:48,831
Three years ago,

396
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:52,233
a lie I deciphered lead to
a bombing raid in Iraq.

397
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:55,102
87 civilians killed.

398
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:59,472
- Another 113 injured.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:05,321
So I came to triple border...
to atone.

400
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:08,932
Doctoring people
who have nothing.

401
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:11,230
What about the CIA?

402
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:14,841
Occasionally they ask a favor.

403
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,371
But now I only succeed at
deciphering those things that

404
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,673
I can live with.

405
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:23,462
If you had told the terrorists
what you knew about me,

406
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:25,431
they might've let you go.

407
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,861
Yeah, and I'd have given them
the technology to do what?

408
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,711
And then who would
they have sold it to?

409
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:42,853
Do the files say
why it does that?

410
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,710
- It stops after a few minutes?
- Yeah.

411
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:51,040
What?

412
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:54,732
It's your bionic interface...

413
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,461
failing...

414
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:58,752
and being reset.

415
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,391
It keeps happening.

416
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:01,750
It's inherent in the system.

417
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:03,331
And?

418
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:07,993
The anthrocytes function
like an anti-rejection drug.

419
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:12,920
But over time,
they become fatigued.

420
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,412
So they'll replace them?

421
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:20,183
On the flash drive,
it talked about a five-year projection.

422
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,151
Until what?

423
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:25,941
Bionic systems
cease to function.

424
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:27,173
What does that mean?

425
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,340
What does that mean?

426
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,190
You're gonna die.

427
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:48,922
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink.

428
00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:53,643
So that's where we're starting.
With horses?

429
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:59,571
Mr. Ed won't drink, you grab him
by the mane, force him under.

430
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,732
Hold him there long enough,
he'll swallow.

431
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,181
The point is to
interpret the saying.

432
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:11,940
You do know your horses.

433
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:15,150
You and your sister had one when
you were little. Am I right?

434
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,072
And Anne named it Coco?
Whatever happened to Coco?

435
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:27,381
People who live in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones.

436
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:30,920
Or have sex without curtains.

437
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:35,163
Me, I like throwing stones.
Wakes people up.

438
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:39,392
You're caught between a
rock and a hard place.

439
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,022
Now you're just
trying to be funny.

440
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:45,143
Actually, I'm just trying to do my job,
which as much as I don't like it,

441
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,181
means trying to understand you.

442
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,943
I'm messed up, honey.

443
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:52,063
See, now we're
getting somewhere.

444
00:30:52,326 --> 00:30:54,723
Does that make you all
warm and cuddly inside?

445
00:30:57,837 --> 00:31:00,381
You should know I don't
do warm and cuddly.

446
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:03,960
You're caught between a
rock and a hard place.

447
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:07,440
Well, we both know how that ends,
don't we?

448
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:10,352
Three.

449
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,563
Three?

450
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:15,902
You can make three
words out of yoo-hoo.

451
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:19,060
Oh, yoo, and ooh.

452
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:23,820
Actually, nine.

453
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,990
You know, what I said--
I'm sorry.

454
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:36,061
No, it's good to hear
the truth for once.

455
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:43,822
- He's coming.
- Who?

456
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:44,832
Quick.

457
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:48,650
Around the back.

458
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,172
Here.

459
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:54,302
Hold on to this. Wait here.

460
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:55,993
- Wait, what are you--
- Just do it.

461
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:01,750
There is no fix, is there?

462
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,511
Jonas is predictable,
if nothing else.

463
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:13,712
Tell me you love me.

464
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,003
I love you.

465
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,033
Let him go!

466
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:31,901
Stand down, stand down!

467
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:34,192
Sarah, stop.

468
00:32:34,478 --> 00:32:37,023
Seriously, is that the psychological
way of talking me down?

469
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,700
- Let Jae go.
- And you'll what? Help me?

470
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,833
- Where is he?
- Gone.

471
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,863
- Jaime, where is he?
- You were gonna kill him.

472
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:26,833
- I was just doing my job.
- You kept me completely in the dark.

473
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:28,673
Sometimes that's what
the job requires.

474
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:32,441
I refuse to believe that killing an
innocent person could ever make
things right.

475
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:35,890
Yeah, well, that information on
the flash drive could save you.

476
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:37,533
What we were doing
here was for you.

477
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:41,693
You think because I cost $50 million,
my life is worth more than his?

478
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:44,663
Oh, we can talk about that later.
Give him up now.

479
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,591
No.

480
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,063
No!

481
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,213
Stevens is what we call
collateral damage.

482
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:58,882
Killing him saves you.
Maybe one day you'll understand that.

483
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:00,903
You want Stevens...

484
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,763
you're gonna have
to get through me.

485
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:06,643
And this time you'll have
to do it without a crowbar.

486
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:11,702
I find this inappropriate
workplace behavior.

487
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,381
Now who's being inappropriate?

488
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:19,903
You don't want to fight me.
You know what I'm capable of.

489
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,950
Uh-huh, yeah.

490
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,103
Just because you're a machine
doesn't mean you can't be beat.

491
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:45,862
That hurt?

492
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:46,942
Yep.

493
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,211
You've gotta get out of here--

494
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:35,253
She took that pen from the tech.
The one with the multi-fractured hands.

495
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:38,021
- She figured you'd never help.
- The point is moot. She's gone.

496
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:39,993
So is Will's flash drive.

497
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:42,680
Seems Jaime and Antonio
had a misunderstanding.

498
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,321
That can be dangerous.

499
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:47,473
Hmm, Antonio's doctor
can attest to that.

500
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:51,573
So if--if Will's work is gone,
then what?

501
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,450
Sarah's gonna die?

502
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,662
I wouldn't want to
be in her shoes.

503
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:07,660
I have never been snowboarding.
That seems insane to me now.

504
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,811
I can't believe I've lived my
whole life never having done that.

505
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:14,193
My friends all head
up to snow together.

506
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:16,832
Usually in February.
You should come.

507
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:21,780
Oh, you know.
Can't plan that far in advance.

508
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,913
Like to live in
the moment, huh?

509
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,271
Go for it.

510
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:30,243
See it, want it, take it.

511
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:32,920
Never look back at the carnage.

512
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,071
Exactly.

513
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:37,680
Life's too short.

514
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,651
You have no idea.

515
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:46,270
What do you say you
and I get out of here?

516
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:48,523
Okay.

517
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:13,941
Five years?

518
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:17,312
Listen, five years is a lifetime in
technology, Jaime, it's generations.

519
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,622
You didn't think I
had a right to know?

520
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:22,550
Yeah, I just didn't want to tell you.
I wanted to protect you from--

521
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:25,612
No, stop. This is my life.
You will not treat me like this.

522
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:28,483
I'm entitled to know you will
not lie to me. It's disgusting.

523
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:29,703
You're right.

524
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,893
You're right, I'm sorry.

525
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:37,213
- My sister.
- We will find a way to fix this.

526
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:40,513
Jaime, look at me.

527
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:45,683
I will fix this.

528
00:37:51,078 --> 00:37:52,520
I'll fix this.

529
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

530
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:16,933
- How was your trip?
- Good.

531
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:19,700
Yeah, you have fun with Carly?

532
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,493
Yeah, we hung out.
It was cool--

533
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:25,210
Are you, like, having an affair
with a married man or something?

534
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:28,271
- What?
- Carly dropped off your shoes.

535
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:34,043
God, you know, I mean,
you're just like dad.

536
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:35,630
You make these
big pronouncements,

537
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:38,360
but I can't even
trust a word you say.

538
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,083
And you think that
I'm the liar?

539
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,100
Look, what is going on, Jaime?

540
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:48,973
Just tell me, okay?
I need to know. I deserve to know.

541
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,691
I can't.

542
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,811
I love you the most.

543
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:07,273
Remember when mom
used to say that?

544
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:13,563
Yeah. Only she'd say it
so we could both hear.

545
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,031
Now I love you the most.

546
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:21,811
And I want to tell
you everything.

547
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:24,391
But I can't, I--

548
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:30,821
Trust... it's supposed
to be a two-way street.

549
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,780
Yeah, I know, and it sucks.
But you have to trust me, Becca.

550
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:40,290
My new job is--
it's complicated.

551
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,060
I just...

552
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,303
I need to know that you're
never gonna leave me.

553
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:51,570
I will never leave you.

554
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:15,983
