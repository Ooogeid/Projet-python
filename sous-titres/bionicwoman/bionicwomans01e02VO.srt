1
00:00:00,088 --> 00:00:01,403
Previously on Bionic Woman

2
00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:02,643
What's your problem?

3
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,935
You know, Dad didn't try to control me.

4
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,263
Dad trusted me, OK?

5
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:08,029
Dad dropped you off on my door step.

6
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,370
I'm pregnant.

7
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,191
I know this isn't something
you just spring on someone.

8
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,351
Marry me.

9
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,693
So I'm thinking Coltrane if it's a boy,

10
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,285
Billie if it's a girl.

11
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,550
Why can't I feel my legs?

12
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:28,486
Both your legs and your arm

13
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,091
had to be replaced.

14
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,309
Also your right ear and right eye.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,331
How long until she's combat ready?

16
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:40,982
She's a civilian.

17
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,485
Everyone has to sing
for their supper around here, will,

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,451
or haven't you figured that out yet?

19
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:47,251
I'm not in control.

20
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:48,917
I know.

21
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,395
Sarah Corvus is still alive.

22
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:55,026
My father

23
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:57,668
developed technology for the military.

24
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,284
You made me into a soldier?

25
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,507
Will!

26
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:03,630
Who are you?

27
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,636
The first bionic woman.

28
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,070
Ta da.

29
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:19,423
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

30
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,522
We are gathered here today
to honor the memory

31
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:28,441
of William Anthros.

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,246
A surgeon, teacher, son,

33
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:34,012
and loving friend.

34
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,819
"I am the resurrection
and the life,'sayeth the lord.

35
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,608
"He that believeth
in me though he were dead,

36
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,174
"yet shall he live.

37
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:46,583
"And whosever liveth
and believeth in me

38
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,023
"shall never die.

39
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,800
"Let not your heart be troubled.

40
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,529
"Ye believeth in god.

41
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,333
Believeth also in me."

42
00:02:00,473 --> 00:02:01,611
are you okay?

43
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:03,688
I will be.

44
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,563
Jamie.

45
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:08,857
- Give us a second.
- Yeah, okay.

46
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,176
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.

47
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,815
Listen, I know this is a hard time.

48
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:16,057
Listen, I'm gonna go back
to my job and my life

49
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,181
and pretend none of this
ever happened.

50
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:19,860
So don't call me.

51
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:28,063
Who was that?

52
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,484
Nobody.

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,191
<i>breaking news from
paradise idaho, today,</i>

54
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,259
<i>where authorities have
mysteriously cordoned off</i>

55
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:01,850
<i>this small town of 200.</i>

56
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,949
No official reason
for the quarantine has been released.

57
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,196
Here's the thing.

58
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,495
You never really know anybody.

59
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,034
You think you know them.

60
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:21,770
You think you want to marry them and
spend the rest of your life with them.

61
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,450
And then they turn out to be a creep
with a weird dossier on you.

62
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:26,648
What?

63
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,032
Nothing.

64
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:32,639
The point is there's
no such thing as mr. Right.

65
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,887
From here on in, it's mr. Right now.

66
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:38,947
Hi.

67
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,638
Hi.

68
00:04:58,827 --> 00:04:59,954
oh! Oho ho!

69
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,733
Sorry. Sorry.

70
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,009
Are you okay?

71
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:04,900
I think you might've broken my rib.

72
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,993
Sorry. I got a little excited.

73
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,774
I got a lot going on right now.

74
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:11,169
No, no, no.

75
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,681
I think I need to
go to the emergency room.

76
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,101
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh

77
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,628
- What, are you following me now?
- Who's this guy?

78
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,969
This is...

79
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,926
- What's your name?
- Steve

80
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:23,554
Obviously. This is Steve.

81
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,032
Go home, steve.

82
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,242
Thank you.

83
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,662
- This is getting on with your life?
- Go away.

84
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,149
I would love to. But those legs,

85
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:33,906
that arm, that ear,
that eye belong to me.

86
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,123
They cost $50 million.

87
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,052
Well, what if I pay you $20 a month?

88
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,407
- I want you to come work for me.
- I already have a job.

89
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,908
You work in a bar, Jamie.
You never went to college.

90
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,093
And here you're getting drunk, having
sex with strangers in a public restroom.

91
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:46,519
I was accepted to harvard.

92
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:50,402
And I am not at harvard because
I am raising my little sister.

93
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,595
I think I'm gonna have to throw up now.

94
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,753
It's okay, the moment's passed.

95
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,183
I totally forgot what I was saying.

96
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,713
You were making a bunch
of excuses is what you were doing.

97
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,577
- God, you're a douche.
- Listen to me.

98
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,421
You could do something with your life.
You could make a difference.

99
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:12,697
Why? Because you turned me
into a half-robotic freak?

100
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,460
You have no idea what can do now.
It's a gift.

101
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:18,108
It's not what you wanted.
You didn't ask for it. It's not fair.

102
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,374
But it's where you are. And I'm
not gonna stand around

103
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:22,706
and watch you flush
your life down the toilet.

104
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,529
Why did will have
a file on me this thick?

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,236
I found it in his apartment.

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,504
And it started two
years before I met him.

107
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,011
What are you people?

108
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,669
Okay...

109
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:45,026
We're a private, clandestine group

110
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,119
dedicated to stopping
rogue organizations

111
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,872
from ending civilization as we know it.

112
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,874
I'll make it simple for you.
We're saving the world.

113
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,726
I could use your help.
are you in or are you out?

114
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,311
I am definitely out.

115
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,848
And now I think I have to throw up.

116
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,413
hello.

117
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,343
I know Becca's been through a lot.

118
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,986
And I'm very patient
with that up to a point.

119
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,298
But smoking pot on campus,
I have my limits.

120
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,713
I couldn't agree with you more.

121
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:01,143
Now, we can expel her for this.

122
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,525
Short of that, we can prevent her

123
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,075
from doing any school activities,
which includes

124
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,623
the talent show this friday.

125
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,786
Wait-- what? No.

126
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,968
Becca.

127
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,962
Mrs. Buezy, I want to assure you

128
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,492
I take this incident
extremely seriously.

129
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,798
Becca is gonna face
repercussions at home.

130
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,920
And I promise you I'm gonna stay
on top of the situation.

131
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,862
But I would really love it
if we could take

132
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,173
the talent show off the table
as a punishment.

133
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:27,335
Since Becca got involved
with the drama department,

134
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,818
I've seen a big difference in her.

135
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,960
She's more positive,
she's more focused on school.

136
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:34,022
And my fear is if you take that
away from her, she's gonna backslide.

137
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,389
Of course, the decision is yours,
but I just wanted to weigh in.

138
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:39,724
Wow.

139
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,750
Okay, you are good. Thanks.

140
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:43,629
Smoking pot in the girl's locker room?

141
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,044
You're a cliche.

142
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,607
First of all, pot's not really a drug.

143
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,413
It comes from the earth.

144
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,689
And look at you.

145
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,620
Just look. I mean,
you're obviously hung over.

146
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:53,873
Shut up. Just shut up.

147
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:57,055
Can you think of someone
besides yourself just once?

148
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,648
What is wrong with you?

149
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,452
Nothing is wrong with me.

150
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:02,857
You know how much I've given up for you?

151
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,899
We were just at will's funeral,

152
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,708
and now I'm being called to
the principal's office?

153
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,645
I don't know, I mean, maybe
I should just move in with dad.

154
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,065
Maybe you should.

155
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,927
'Cause apparently,
I'm doing a terrible job.

156
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:39,485
My god.

157
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,546
How many casualties?

158
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:43,713
I counted 14 people from these images,

159
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,692
but there's every indication
there's more.

160
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,232
Where did you get this?

161
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,381
It's security camera footage.

162
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:52,863
A contact gave it to me
before the fbi confiscated it.

163
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,659
- What has the military said?
- To me? Nothing yet.

164
00:09:56,818 --> 00:09:58,803
Jonas, the media has been
completely shut out,

165
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:00,644
they have no idea
what's really going on.

166
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,470
There is a complete cover-up.

167
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,612
This seems like a biological
attack to me.

168
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,872
- We need to get in there.
- Okay, let's just

169
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,600
let's take a beat, gather more intel.

170
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,414
The last thing we need is
a pissing match with the army.

171
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:17,719
I'm such a bitch.

172
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:19,941
I don't know what's wrong with me.

173
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,592
Hey, honey, you just lost your fiance.

174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,111
And your sister's acting like a twerp.
So don't be hard on yourself.

175
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:28,473
Hi, I'm so...
I'm so sorry I'm late.

176
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:29,628
You're late.

177
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,796
I know. You didn't tell her, did you?

178
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:34,414
If you told her, I'm going to kill you.

179
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:37,230
- Hey, sweetie, what's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

180
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:39,122
I just got this weird ringing in my ear.

181
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,265
Tell me what?

182
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,798
Big news. I just got into columbia law.

183
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,094
Ouah! Really?

184
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:45,973
They want me. I'm in.

185
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,123
I'm gonna be a scumbag lawyer, you guys.

186
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,927
That is so great. Isn't it?

187
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,192
I'm so happy for you.

188
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:52,344
Isn't that great?

189
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,637
And I think that you and
I should go and visit her.

190
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:56,161
Oh yes, please.

191
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,743
Have you been to greenwich village?

192
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:01,037
No, I haven't even been to new york.
Because I met this amazing guy there.

193
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,480
And maybe right now

194
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,459
we should celebrate by shopping.

195
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,265
I would love to,
but I have this appointment.

196
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,589
So you guys go.

197
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,207
Carly, congratulations. That's awesome.

198
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:25,047
you reading
what color is your parachute?

199
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,550
Uh, yeah. Just, uh--

200
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:27,966
no, no, no.

201
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,526
It's a really good book.
it changed my life totally.

202
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:31,929
- Really?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,181
How?

204
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,566
Well, I ended up starting
a non-profit group

205
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,510
that sends clean water systems
to third world countries.

206
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,297
Maybe I should buy this.

207
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,142
Hey.

208
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:44,888
- Jack russell?
It is.

209
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,075
This is scraps.
And no, I didn't name him.

210
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:48,277
My niece did.

211
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,319
I had one of these when I was a kid.

212
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:51,577
So cute.

213
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,171
Antonio.

214
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,029
Jamie

215
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:56,709
Jamie Sommers.

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,245
So, Jamie Sommers,

217
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,675
You seriously considering a life change?

218
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:03,895
I don't know.
I- I just got out of a relationship.

219
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:06,283
He died actually.

220
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,531
So sorry.

221
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,194
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

222
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:15,112
Sometimes it's easier
to talk to a stranger.

223
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,720
Yeah.

224
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:23,030
It just feels like all my friends are
moving on with their lives, and

225
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:26,123
I'm stuck here reading
what color is your parachute?

226
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,638
Well, maybe it's true what they say,

227
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:30,327
"what doesn't kill you makes
you stronger."

228
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,398
You don't know how true that is.

229
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,880
Well, maybe you just need to
take the time to figure out what, uh,

230
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,963
Jamie Sommers has to offer
the world, that's all.

231
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,343
All right? Come on.

232
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,072
We're now in day two

233
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,577
of crisis in paradise,
as the mystery deepens.

234
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:55,438
This small town in northwestern idaho,
population 201, has been quarantine

235
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:59,583
Still no word as to the reason for the
quarantine. But police have blocked off

236
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:02,103
all access roads, and evacuated
neighboring towns.

237
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:03,410
as a cautionary measure.

238
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:06,792
Please stay with news channel 8
as we track the story.

239
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:33,660
Hey.

240
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,995
What are you doing?

241
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:01,763
Come on.

242
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,163
How did you do that?

243
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,243
Pilates?

244
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:23,299
Yeah, I-I'm listening
to everything you're saying.

245
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:25,040
The answer's still no.

246
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,321
The answer's no,
and that's non-negotiable.

247
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,354
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll talk about it later.

248
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,774
I'm sorry. Were you breaking up
a terrorist cell?

249
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:39,655
It's my daughter. 16 is too young
to be on the pill, don't you think?

250
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,300
Oh, um, well, I guess
if she's sexually active,

251
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,465
it's better to be safe

252
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:46,232
I think it's too young.

253
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,737
Don't you want to know why I'm here?

254
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,842
I know why you're here.

255
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,617
Saved that woman's life and now
you're thinking that Jonas is right,

256
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,463
I could have a larger
purpose in my life.

257
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,110
Go ahead. Feel free. Tell me.

258
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:59,355
- Say the words. "Jonas is right."
- I'm not gonna say that.

259
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,860
However, this saving
the world thing,

260
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,207
I'd like to give that a try.

261
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:05,445
So here are my rules.

262
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:08,242
I have to be home by 7:00 every night
to have dinner with my sister.

263
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,433
I don't work week-ends, and you have to
get my sister on your health plan.

264
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,630
Oh and this friday night,

265
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,353
I have to be at
her school talent show.

266
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,139
She's doing number
fromannie got your gun.

267
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,232
Anything else?

268
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,798
Yeah, my bionic ear
has this ringing in it.

269
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,266
We're working on it.

270
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,382
Send pope in.

271
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:26,156
I need to introduce you
to your supervisor.

272
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:27,566
Actually,

273
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:29,844
I think you two already met.

274
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,346
Hello, Jamie.

275
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,826
Small world, huh?

276
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,641
I keep trying to get
in there with a q-tip.

277
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,456
You did not put a q-tip in my ear.

278
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:47,661
Your ear?

279
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,037
Okay what about now?

280
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,366
Still ringing.

281
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:55,574
Okay, what about now?

282
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,035
It's-- no.
It's still ringing.

283
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:58,133
It's still there.

284
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,236
Now.

285
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:00,678
It's still there.

286
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,637
Really. Can you describe
the ringing?

287
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,958
Uh, it's sort of like
a dial tone only higher.

288
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:09,658
What?

289
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,924
It's probably something
just loose somewhere

290
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,337
or brain aneurysm.

291
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,978
You people act like
you have all the answers,

292
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,905
but really, you don't know
anything about this stuff, do you?

293
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,619
There's one more thing

294
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:22,995
I could try.

295
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,189
Just try it.

296
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,666
What are you doing?
You...

297
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,567
it stopped.

298
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,862
Oh, my god.

299
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,227
Krispy kremes are always welcome.

300
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,161
Food, booze, a nice hug.

301
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,511
That ain't gonna happen.

302
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:40,583
Okay, surprise me then.

303
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,493
Nathan, is she ready
to start traing?

304
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,251
She is all yours.

305
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,743
So it wasn't a chance meeting.

306
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,869
You were just pretending
to be mr. Sensitive.

307
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,115
Waiting for me to pick up
what color is your parachute?

308
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,089
No, you picking up what color is
your parachute?

309
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:58,024
Is you picking up what color
is your parachute?

310
00:16:58,077 --> 00:16:59,938
And you don't have a jack russell.
No I don't.

311
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,362
But you knew I had one as kid,
so you just went and got one.

312
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,362
I borrowed one from the pet
store up the street.

313
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,801
She need a walk.
it worked out for everybody.

314
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,144
So why'd you get into a deep
conversation with me at the bookstore?

315
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,731
I need to find out
if you were compromised.

316
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,492
If you were with another agency.

317
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,703
There are other agencies?

318
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,197
We'll get into that.

319
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,435
So what'd you find out?

320
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,143
I found out that you're smart,

321
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,204
that you're honest,

322
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:28,679
that you don't quite know who you
are yet, and you're sad right now.

323
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,081
So what about the training?

324
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,052
Do I have to climb up a wall?

325
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,525
That's up to jae.

326
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,666
feeling any deja vu?

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,624
Sarah Corvus?

328
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,565
That's exactly how she came at you.

329
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,345
Exactly how you defended yourself.

330
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,028
Just now, you got the demo,

331
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,232
the one programmed
into your muscle memory.

332
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:27,827
Combat programming.

333
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,344
She was calibrating you

334
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,238
and herself, knowing sarah.

335
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,949
You think just because
you have machines inside you,

336
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:35,110
that's enough.

337
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,812
That you're invincible.

338
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:40,026
The machine is nothing
without the woman.

339
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,471
We're going beyond the demo, Jamie.

340
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,725
Way beyond.

341
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,285
<i> sometimes they'll wanna
cut you down </i>

342
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,391
<i> gotta scratch that itch
'cause the time is now </i>

343
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,576
<i>they tell you that you've
gotta have a heart of steel</i>

344
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,701
<i>if you wanna keep up,
can you afford to feel</i>

345
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,889
<i>when the system's wrong,
you gotta tear it down</i>

346
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,490
<i>let it fall to the seabed
like a rusty crown</i>

347
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,516
<i>to the stars that love
the moonbeam's glare</i>

348
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,827
<i>shackles on your feet
that'll disappear</i>

349
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,328
<i>what if I tried to tell you
to do what for</i>

350
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:14,665
<i>can't you see baby's life's
knocking right at your door</i>

351
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:18,879
<i>she says ooh, I just don't
know for sure</i>

352
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:22,851
<i>what if I tried to tell you
to do what for</i>

353
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,001
<i>don't give up, don't give up</i>

354
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,284
<i>don't give up, don't give up</i>

355
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:29,330
<i>don't give up, don't give up</i>

356
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,185
<i>I don't give up, don't give up</i>

357
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:51,503
you can run 60 miles per hour.
maybe faster.

358
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:53,214
And you have enough power
in your arm

359
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,602
to shatter brick.

360
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:56,587
And you can bend steel
with your grip.

361
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,314
That's so superman.

362
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:00,465
You have 2,000/20 vision,

363
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:02,278
which means you can see
from 2,000 feet

364
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,268
what other people can see from 20.

365
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,181
Your ear can isolate a conversation

366
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,828
from two miles away as if
it's right in front of you.

367
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,753
Now Jamie, if you hone your skills,

368
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:15,362
you can become one of the most powerful
weapons ever developed.

369
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,709
But if you fail,
you will go insane.

370
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,241
Is that what happened
to sarah corvus?

371
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,033
Did she go insane?

372
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,270
Is that why she killed Will?

373
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,195
I don't know.

374
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,107
So you were in love with her?

375
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:35,443
Where'd you hear that?

376
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,605
I'm a bartender. We hear things.

377
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,212
Are you still in love with her?

378
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:42,715
I don't know if love is the word.

379
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,516
She killed 14 of our agents
and I shot her in the head.

380
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,715
I could see how that experience
might stay with a person.

381
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,591
My loyalty is to this agency.

382
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,259
Whatever I feel,

383
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:56,172
Sarah Corvus is the enemy.

384
00:20:58,264 --> 00:20:59,279
Okay. Pick your poison.

385
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:00,357
So what's it gonna be?

386
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,841
You wanna spar, sprint,
do pull-ups?

387
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,343
I got a better idea.

388
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,991
How about you set me loose
on some real bad guys?

389
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,077
Come on.

390
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:10,552
You're not ready.

391
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,528
And plus, it's not my decision.

392
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:13,684
Whose decision is it?

393
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:15,152
Jonas, I need to go to idaho.

394
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:16,875
The idaho situation's being handled

395
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,206
by FBI, CIA, and the army.

396
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,310
Just let the government
take care of their crisis.

397
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,003
What if paradise
is just a test-run?

398
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:26,226
A test-run for what?

399
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:28,296
I don't know.
let me go and find out.

400
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:30,805
Uncle sam doesn't know the playbook
on this as well as I do.

401
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:32,344
You need somebody watchin'your six.

402
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,090
Jae's working on Sarah Corvus.

403
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:38,312
- Everybody else is either busy or dead.
- I could go with her.

404
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,613
I'm not a big fan of eavesdroppers.

405
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:42,838
She'll just slow me down.

406
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,324
I'm a lot faster than you are.

407
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,341
Only at running. Jonas...

408
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,561
field test might not be a bad idea.

409
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:50,858
Hang on a second.

410
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:52,704
Keep me apprised.

411
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:55,093
Let's get a list
of suspects generated.

412
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,172
And have my office sound-proofed.

413
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:15,783
- Cool car.
- I know.

414
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:18,129
'72 GTO?

415
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,580
So why are you here?

416
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,883
I didn't...

417
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,443
no, I mean, why did you want
to come with me?

418
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,750
I wanted to try to do something

419
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:30,732
other than sit around
thinking about about will.

420
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,421
Makes sense.

421
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,571
Were you guys close?

422
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:40,066
First thing they teach you
in this game

423
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:42,119
is never get too close to anyone.

424
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:44,108
How can you call it a game?

425
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:46,753
Second thing they teach you.

426
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:03,886
Eyes open, mouth closed.

427
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:16,220
Stop, stop.

428
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:18,798
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.

429
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,209
I'm expected.

430
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,082
And who is she?

431
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,359
She's my muscle.

432
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,717
All right, here you go.

433
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,832
All right, she's clear.
let her through.

434
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,122
Let her through.

435
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,117
- Marty.
- Back here.

436
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,075
Marty works for the cdc.

437
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,136
She's under the impression that I work
for the department of agriculture.

438
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,976
Is it always the department
of agriculture?

439
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,939
It's whatever gets us in the door.

440
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,866
If you don't like this one,
I got 200 more.

441
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,236
Where are they holding
the survivors?

442
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,040
There are no survivors.

443
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,936
Everyone in the town's dead.

444
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:37,275
You okay?

445
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:38,981
How can you be so cool about it?

446
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,802
Look, if it's any consolation,
today's a bad day.

447
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,373
A really bad day.

448
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,119
Don't people have a right
to know about this?

449
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,679
Well, what good would it do them?

450
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:50,148
They'd just panic.

451
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,120
And the truth is they don't
want to know.

452
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,873
You just found out, and already
you wish you didn't know.

453
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,062
Excuse me.

454
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,403
- Jonas.
- Yeah. What's up?

455
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:04,137
The whole town's dead.

456
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,674
How?

457
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,496
An airborne synthetic called dmc30.

458
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:09,654
What do we know about it?

459
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,055
Everything. We developed it.

460
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,611
We're safe now.
it was only toxic for 12 hours.

461
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm going in to get samples

462
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,739
and find a distribution system, but...

463
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,670
If I'm right about this,

464
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,074
then this is just
the first domino...

465
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,652
All right, I'll put a team
on standby.

466
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,374
I thought we didn't have anybody.

467
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,155
I'll rent some guys.

468
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,224
I'll call halliburton.

469
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,030
So you guys developed the toxin

470
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:36,681
that caused all this.

471
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,305
Would you please
stop eavesdropping?

472
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:42,160
Maybe if somebody said something
tome for a change.

473
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:43,282
Over here.

474
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:12,199
The security checkpoint

475
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,412
20 miles northwest of paradise
was breached.

476
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:16,857
What do you mean breached?

477
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,185
There was a distress call,

478
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,798
and we lost all communication.

479
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,500
Okay, let's pull out
all non-combat personnel.

480
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:25,611
Oh, who's there?

481
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:27,116
Jamie and Ruth.

482
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:30,295
You sent Jamie Somers in?
She's only been here three days.

483
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,856
Why would you do that?

484
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:34,572
How much time do we have?

485
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:03,894
I hear someone.

486
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,307
It's probably just the tv.

487
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:08,098
No.

488
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:50,337
Drop the toothbrush.
put your hands on your head.

489
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,651
What are you doing here?

490
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,263
Can I spit?

491
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:56,553
Ruth, what are you doing?

492
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,067
Put the gun down. She's just a kid.

493
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,368
Where's my grandma?

494
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,839
We need to talk.

495
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:13,517
Mr. Park,

496
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:16,235
it's nice to have you back.
It's been a long time.

497
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,225
Your wife is waiting
for you upstairs.

498
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,307
You were always very good
at following instructions.

499
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:03,691
You're not gonna kill me twice,
are you?

500
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:27,890
Sarah.

501
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,419
Happy anniversary.

502
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:45,020
Oh, my god. I'm just here
visiting my grandparents.

503
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,066
They were good to me.

504
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,849
What-- what did this?

505
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:56,594
That's exactly what we're
trying to find out.

506
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,297
Well, why am I the only one
still alive?

507
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,613
- Maybe you can help me.
- How?

508
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,753
Do you remember anything
about this morning?

509
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,395
Anything that was out
of the ordinary?

510
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,003
There was this weird truck
driving around last night.

511
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:13,582
Weird how?

512
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,353
It was like one of those
big gas trucks.

513
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:19,454
I just saw it when I was walking home.
It was doing circles around the town.

514
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,028
I'll be back.

515
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:22,478
Stay out of trouble.

516
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:28,593
I feel like a freak.

517
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,021
I can relate.

518
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:32,214
You?

519
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:34,062
You don't really look like a freak.

520
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,460
Looking one way and being another is

521
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:38,423
something I know something about.

522
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:48,859
<i>- Confirmation...
- Yes, sir. Safety's off.</i>

523
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,557
<i>Check the other quadrant.</i>

524
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:53,354
<i>Ready to go...</i>

525
00:30:58,309 --> 00:30:59,309
<i>You report it in yet?</i>

526
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:03,551
Don't worry.

527
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:06,275
<i>We're the good guys, all right?</i>

528
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,107
<i>Now we need to get you out of here.</i>

529
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,015
<i>There's been a further complication.</i>

530
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:13,056
<i>We're closing in on the girl now.</i>

531
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,423
Okay.

532
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,265
Can you run?

533
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,962
- Yeah. Why?
- Go.

534
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,234
<i>They're on the move!</i>

535
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,186
Spread out!

536
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,449
Who are those guys?
What's going on?

537
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:33,703
It's okay, just stay calm.

538
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:34,838
Who are you?

539
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,730
That's a long story.

540
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,373
You're gonna be okay.
People are gonna come and help us.

541
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:40,723
Right now, just be quiet.

542
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:44,775
I thought you said be quiet.

543
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I can't talk now.

544
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:49,397
Where the hell is
my Tenacious D tee shirt?

545
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,249
Seriously, this is not a good time.

546
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,394
Well, that's fine.

547
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:55,828
Because I just wanted to let you know
dad said it's okay for me to move in.

548
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:57,907
So you don't have
to worry about me anymore.

549
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,877
Just go ahead and live
your awesome life.

550
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:01,539
Don't do anything until I get home.

551
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:02,963
I want that tee shirt.

552
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,301
Who was that?

553
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:09,098
My little sister. She hates me.

554
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,378
<i>- I wanna check in these...
- Someone's coming.</i>

555
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,333
<i>Team leader 5, notify your status.</i>

556
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,139
Get up, now!

557
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,702
Now, now!

558
00:32:27,454 --> 00:32:28,454
I said now!

559
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,390
Vivian, are you okay?

560
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:15,218
Bitch.

561
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,267
Jamie?

562
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,116
We've gotta get out of here.
Right now.

563
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:23,854
<i>All team leaders check in.</i>

564
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:25,338
They've got heavy artillery,

565
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,095
and they're coming right this way.

566
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:28,272
<i>***, where are you?</i>

567
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,838
<i>- Nice work.
- Repeat. ***, where are you?</i>

568
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,496
We'll leave 'em
a little parting gift.

569
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,695
Move, move. Get in.

570
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,701
Addison, you're on point.

571
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,184
Billings, back him up.

572
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:49,231
On the ground now!

573
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,704
Get down, get down!
Get down, get down!

574
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:56,068
Lower your weapon.
I said lower your weapon!

575
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,669
<i>Get down on the ground now!</i>

576
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,830
<i>Down, down! Get on the ground!</i>

577
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,112
<i>Let me see your hands!</i>

578
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:05,582
Guess I'm not too late.

579
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,485
Who are you people?

580
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,272
We're with the department
of agriculture.

581
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:25,329
I guess you got me.

582
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,107
So now what?

583
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:30,512
I'm not sure.

584
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,589
I guess I'll find out
one way or the other.

585
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,412
So will I.

586
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:44,171
Why'd you do it?

587
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:47,261
<i>I'm not in control.</i>

588
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,171
Like I told you then...

589
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:51,849
I wasn't in control.

590
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:55,495
I think someone hacked me.

591
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,512
I watched you die.

592
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,217
- And I...
- I know.

593
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:14,018
You didn't have a choice.

594
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:17,584
Are you okay?

595
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,350
Yeah, I guess.

596
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:24,386
Thanks for all you did.

597
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
That's her.

598
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:34,879
Is she the only one who survived?

599
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,795
She obviously has an immunity
to the gas.

600
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,389
Now all we need to find out is
if there's more of it

601
00:35:43,794 --> 00:35:46,109
out there, and who's got it.

602
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:47,459
How do we do that?

603
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:53,229
Just leave that up to me.

604
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,470
Here's the thing,

605
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,727
I don't like the sound
of my own voice,

606
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,026
so I'm gonna ask you once
to tell me

607
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:11,437
where the DMC30 is.

608
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,671
And where I can find a bunch of guys

609
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,620
who dressed up as funny as you do.

610
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,206
Or...

611
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,883
I'm gonna get a pair
of grip pliers,

612
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,457
and I'm gonna show you
a little something

613
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,223
that someone once showed me.

614
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:38,411
Ruth was right.

615
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,977
Paradise was just merely a test run.

616
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:43,712
They're rolling out 20 trucks
midnight tonight.

617
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:46,104
All right, I'm on my way.

618
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:09,077
15 minutes ahead of schedule, sir.

619
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,253
I've gotta get this stuff
to the trucks.

620
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,857
Team 1, move in.

621
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:24,262
Go, go, go.

622
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,116
Here we go.

623
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:42,008
<i>Get down on the ground!</i>

624
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:44,613
<i>Down, down!</i>

625
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,712
<i>Get down, get down!</i>

626
00:37:47,547 --> 00:37:49,090
<i>Keep down!</i>

627
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,531
<i>Get down now!</i>

628
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:54,792
<i>Let me see your hands!</i>

629
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:07,029
The gas trucks in the stockyard...

630
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:09,399
- Loaded with DMC30.
- Good job.

631
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:14,261
Springfield, Jackson, Portland.

632
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:16,322
These guys were serious.

633
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,304
You're either thinking we just saved
tens of thousands of people...

634
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,712
Isn't that a great feeling?

635
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:36,281
Or you're thinking you knew
the world was a scary place,

636
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,883
but you didn't know
it was this scary.

637
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,564
You just wanna run off somewhere
and hide. Which is it?

638
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:43,064
Both.

639
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:47,099
Listen, I owe you an apology.

640
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:49,957
I shouldn't have sent you there.
It was too soon.

641
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,749
No, it wasn't.

642
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:53,734
I'm in.

643
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:57,911
It's good to have you
with us, Jamie Sommers.

644
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,625
You were so great.
You're a star.

645
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,785
- You were the best one.
- Shut up.

646
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:44,101
Really?

647
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,359
Look, I just want to say...

648
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:49,597
You live with me.
That's the way it is.

649
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:51,796
You're never gonna live with dad.

650
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:53,953
Are you sure?

651
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,468
I just feel like
I hold you back sometimes.

652
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:01,924
You're the only thing in my life
that makes any sense right now.

653
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,392
And I don't want to lose
anyone else.

654
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:09,154
- Okay, are you gonna cry?
- I'm not gonna cry.

655
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:11,662
- Please don't cry, there are people.
- Come on,

656
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,900
let's go get something to eat.

657
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:15,578
- Let's do. What do you want?
- Pizza?
