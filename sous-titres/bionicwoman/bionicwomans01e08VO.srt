1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,889
Previously on Bionic Woman...

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,931
And if I had the pleasure of
taking this monster down,

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,606
I would be alone
on that rooftop.

4
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:08,225
You've done this before,
haven't you?

5
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:10,752
You want to tell me why you knew
that guy was arriving at the airport

6
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:14,842
- before Jonas even called me?
- Just trust me.

7
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,643
They know you were here.
They're sending more agents as we speak.

8
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,853
Antonio is communicating
with the assassin.

9
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,398
You're gonna have
to bring him in.

10
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,450
No, actually,
you're gonna have to bring him in.

11
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,866
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

12
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:30,555
- I heard you with the assassin.
- I'm not working with the assassin.

13
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,657
But I do know her.
She saved my life.

14
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,132
Why the hell should I believe
any of what you're saying?

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,960
You gotta believe
me on this one.

16
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,603
Julia, stop!

17
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,110
- Take the shot, Antonio.
- Shut up, Sommers.

18
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:57,252
He just had such a rough exterior,
you know?

19
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:01,301
You think that he doesn't care if
you're having a rough day or not,

20
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:05,211
but he does. Or he did.

21
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,422
To Antonio Pope.

22
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:10,000
It was an honor to know him,
to work with him.

23
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,423
- I'm gonna miss you, pal.
- Yep.

24
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:32,741
I slept with him once.
It was amazing.

25
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:49,902
Come here for a second.

26
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:58,940
- So you doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

27
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:04,591
Because, you know,
someone died, someone who was...

28
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:08,340
a friend of yours,
who you cared about so...

29
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:11,071
You know what,
I'm getting used to it.

30
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,461
Honky with the dreads
is off the hook.

31
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,043
How do you think I would
look with those, honestly?

32
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,150
I can tell when you're
rolling your eyes.

33
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:32,350
- Can you tell when I don't care?
- Touche.

34
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:36,901
Why aren't you asking me who this
guy is and why we're following him?

35
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,963
Why aren't you peppering
me with questions?

36
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,702
- Fine, who is he?
- He's a bad guy.

37
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:43,710
- Why is he a bad guy?
- Because he does bad things.

38
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,821
This is starting to
sound like phone sex.

39
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,533
If this is what phone sex sounds
like to you, you're doing it wrong.

40
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,901
- You have no idea, do you?
- What about, sex? No, none, zero.

41
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,632
I do know that women
cry a lot afterwards.

42
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,283
- Who the hell are you?
- Shut up!

43
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:43,492
What the hell was that?
How 'bout you just shut the hell up.

44
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:46,753
We'll get to Berkut, and you can ask
your questions to somebody who cares.

45
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:55,662
She's totally pms-ing.

46
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,103
Hey, it's me.

47
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,300
Sorry we keep
missing each other.

48
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,821
Had another long day at work,
and I

49
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,600
just needed to hear
a friendly voice.

50
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:47,163
I'm starting to get really confused
about what I'm doing and why.

51
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:51,023
And now I have to go upstairs,
and put on a big smile,

52
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,991
and see my sister, and pretend
like everything's okay. And...

53
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,271
Yeah.

54
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:00,882
Anyway, you're probably working too,
so, well, call me later.

55
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,760
What is he doing here?

56
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,180
He's doing dishes.

57
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:23,652
Why?

58
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:27,030
Jamie, I don't know. He's your boss.
Why don't you go talk to him.

59
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:31,420
- Hey, you wanna dry?
- Becks, could you give us a minute?

60
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:38,371
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but this is my personal space.

61
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,320
Your sister watches
way too much tv.

62
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,250
This is the home of
a depressed person.

63
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,353
I am working all hours, and you come
here and criticize my housekeeping?

64
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,543
I came over here because
I'm concerned about you.

65
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,781
You've been through a lot.
You need to take some time off.

66
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,692
Is this because I
kicked that guy's ass?

67
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,493
No. It's because
Antonio was your friend.

68
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,263
And he died. And you need time.

69
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:58,611
Work is the only thing
holding me together right now.

70
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,523
If I stop and think about
everything that has happened to me,

71
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:03,391
- I'm gonna go crazy.
- I understand that.

72
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,513
But it's not a good
strategy, Jaime.

73
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,211
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

74
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:09,423
You're gonna take a vacation,
and Berkut will pay for it.

75
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:10,672
I don't take handouts.

76
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,953
Okay, then you can make
a delivery for me.

77
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,212
I need to get a briefcase
to a man in Montana.

78
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,003
You give him the briefcase,
you take a week off.

79
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:20,012
- Do you like to hike?
- You sure that's it?

80
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,933
It's just a briefcase.

81
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:25,960
Antonio used to say a briefcase
is never just a briefcase.

82
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:28,602
Yeah, well...

83
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,330
Antonio's dead.

84
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,762
Are you mad at me?

85
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:00,943
No.

86
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,651
Seems like you got
something on your mind.

87
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,933
That's the most you've said
for the past two days.

88
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,562
What are we doing?

89
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,171
I mean, why is it okay for
me to suddenly ditch school?

90
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,970
You're not ditching school.
I wrote you an excuse, so it's fine.

91
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:19,013
We're just taking a little trip.
That's what we're doing.

92
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:22,601
I mean, you know,
you mope around the house for a week,

93
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:25,750
not taking care of yourself.
And, I mean, clearly something is wrong.

94
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:28,891
And now, all of a sudden,
we're on this trip.

95
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,103
I mean,
what do you think it's gonna accomplish?

96
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,930
You think we're gonna
have deep talks and bond?

97
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,603
Yeah, that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

98
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,633
We're gonna talk and
take spa treatments,

99
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,832
grab some food, make memories.
It's gonna be great.

100
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,051
What are you doing
here, Nathan?

101
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,390
- I want you to train me.
- Train you to what?

102
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:00,370
I want to learn how to fight.

103
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,250
Aren't you supposed to be at a
Star Trek convention or something?

104
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,462
I'm serious, Jae.

105
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:14,013
- What happened to your eye?
- J.R.

106
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,901
- Who's J.R.?
- He's my older brother.

107
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,800
Sometimes he gets a
little physical with me.

108
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,911
Aren't you a little old for your
brother to be picking on you?

109
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,441
Yeah, I'm also a little too old
to be living with my parents,

110
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:30,160
- but I'm working on it.
- So why does he hit you?

111
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,050
He's just always been
a little jealous of me.

112
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:36,761
Why?

113
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,281
Hey, I just have
to make a call.

114
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:55,620
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

115
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,293
I do,
I just need to make this call.

116
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,301
- For work?
- Yeah.

117
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,082
Look, it's the last one
I'm gonna make, okay?

118
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,063
After that, I'll give you my cell.
No more.

119
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,701
- Really?
- Really.

120
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:09,961
All right.

121
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,033
Sorry.

122
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,022
Ha, sorry.

123
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:40,633
You're Jonas' girl?

124
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,600
Just say it so I
can get out of here.

125
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,181
I give you the
briefcase and go.

126
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,962
There are a lot of rumors
going around about you.

127
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,411
Can you just say it?

128
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,243
Do you really have
x-ray vision?

129
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,362
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

130
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:02,970
Just say it.

131
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:12,033
In 1972, a crack commando unit was
sent to prison by military court

132
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,442
for a crime they didn't commit.
These men promptly escaped from

133
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,833
a maximum-security stockade to
the Los Angeles underground.

134
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,893
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

135
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,413
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them,

136
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:24,891
maybe you can hire the A-team.
Bang. Bang. Bang.

137
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,870
You want me to do the
theme song for you?

138
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,643
Have a nice life.

139
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,732
You're registered
in the green party?

140
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,763
What?

141
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,471
Are you actually gonna
vote for Dennis Kucinich?

142
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,011
- How do you know this?
- Visual caller I.D.

143
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,550
Anyone calls my line,
I see their photo, date of birth,

144
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,856
social security number,
criminal record, you name it.

145
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,675
- Nathan set it up for me.
- Is that legal?

146
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,487
- How's the vacation going?
- Your guy's a nut job.

147
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,311
- Is it done?
- Yep.

148
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:07,601
Bye, Jonas.

149
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:10,292
Thank you.

150
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,992
You sure you don't
miss your phone?

151
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,401
Not even a little.

152
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,611
Your thumbs must be
going through withdrawal.

153
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,250
You haven't texted anyone in,
like, an hour.

154
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,210
Leave me alone.

155
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,852
So what are we gonna do?

156
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,732
There's a million things to do.

157
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:33,790
There's horseback riding.
There's a spa.

158
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,701
There's friggin' ballroom
dancing classes.

159
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,190
Oh, there's meditation with gems.
That sounds different.

160
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,482
How 'bout we go up to the room,
order some room service, turn on the tv.

161
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,450
You know, eat and get really fat,
so no one will love us.

162
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,212
God, I love you.
Come on, let's go.

163
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,212
Switch.

164
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,030
Switch.

165
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:06,683
Okay, how can I help you?

166
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,402
Our on demand isn't working,
and tv's really important to us.

167
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:10,981
We'll send up an engineer.
What room?

168
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:11,702
108.

169
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,623
- You're 108?
- Yeah.

170
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,233
This guy has been calling
for you for the past hour.

171
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,810
He asked me to go to your
room and knock on the door.

172
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:24,330
But I told him it's against hotel
policy. He's a very pushy man.

173
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:30,541
Uh... sorry.

174
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,281
You break it, you have to pay.

175
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,380
Excuse me. Front desk.

176
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,690
Please hold, sir.

177
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,683
No, sir, I will not--
please hold.

178
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,362
It's him.

179
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,583
Should I transfer it to
one of the courtesy phones?

180
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:48,253
- Yeah.
- Just over there.

181
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,353
Jaime, why did you turn
off your cell phone?

182
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:01,283
'Cause you told me I needed a vacation,
so I turned my cell phone off.

183
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:03,910
I told you to take a little time off.
Not to go off the grid.

184
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:07,340
I'm not off the grid.
It's a four star hotel I'm at.

185
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,281
Listen, I got a problem.
My guy's gone quiet.

186
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,001
- He never checked in.
- Oh, Jonas.

187
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,023
- He's a little unstable.
- No kidding.

188
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:14,850
So can you look
in on him for me?

189
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,680
Listen, I would never ask you to
do this if it wasn't an emergency.

190
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,021
- He's staying in room 203.
- He's staying here?

191
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,031
Yeah, I know.
I was surprised too.

192
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:25,273
He seemed like more of
a seedy motel kinda guy.

193
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,753
- Can you do this for me or not?
- Okay.

194
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:37,163
I was booking us spa treatments.
She kept me on hold for ten minutes.

195
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:41,253
Becks, you know,
I was thinking about what you said.

196
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,270
And I know you're not stupid.

197
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,710
I know I've been acting weird lately,
and anything.

198
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:49,040
Okay, okay, stop talking.
Because listen, okay, I met this--

199
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:52,813
- Hey.
- Nick. This is my sister Jaime.

200
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,113
- Jaime, this is Nick.
- Hey, Nick.

201
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:56,750
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

202
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,460
Well, I'm starving.
Um, you wanna go get some breakfast?

203
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,100
Great, you two grab a table,

204
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,781
and I'll run upstairs and book
the spa appointments. Okay?

205
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:05,850
Hey.

206
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,803
In case you're looking for this,
don't even bother.

207
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:10,961
I'm insulted.

208
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,362
- Okay, isn't he cute?
- Super cute.

209
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:15,270
And we hate all
the same things.

210
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,501
Hello?

211
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:38,341
Oh, my god.

212
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:52,381
- Yeah?
- Jonas, he's dead.

213
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:54,570
He's laying right in front of me,
and he's dead.

214
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,072
- How?
- Maybe it has something to do

215
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,461
with the hypodermic needle
sticking out of his arm.

216
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:00,681
Damn it.

217
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:03,361
Obviously I'm on the job now, Jonas.
So just fill me in.

218
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,143
No, I'm not gonna
do that to you.

219
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,013
What was I delivering?
Who the hell is this guy?

220
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,362
It's not your problem, Jaime.

221
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,462
Oh, my god.

222
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:22,901
He's an assassin?!

223
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,251
Were you gonna have
somebody killed?

224
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,941
What was in that briefcase?

225
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,010
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't worry about it?

226
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,631
The guy is lying here dead.
Someone is gonna come in and find him.

227
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,261
Okay, listen,
put him in the bathtub.

228
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,900
Get a bunch of ice and
some air fresheners,

229
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,332
and I'll send someone down to
deal with it as soon as I can.

230
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,022
I can't believe
this is happening.

231
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,220
What am I supposed to
do with the briefcase?

232
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,651
Put it in your room.
I'll have someone deal with that too.

233
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,713
Jonas, I'm here with my sister.

234
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,471
She's with you?

235
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:58,703
Nothing's gonna happen to Becca.
All right?

236
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:00,562
I promise you.

237
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:47,503
Morning.

238
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,760
Hey, we were about to
send a search party.

239
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:39,613
Sorry, I was on the phone to the spa,
and then I just passed out.

240
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:44,270
- We have treatments at 5:00.
- Oh, okay. Cool. Sweet.

241
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:48,852
Is it cool if we go with Nick and
his dad on a gondola ride at 1:00?

242
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:52,510
- You want to go on a gondola?
- No. No, no we don't.

243
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:57,203
But his dad's making him go,
so I thought we'd go for moral support.

244
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,312
- We'd love to.
- Cool.

245
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,701
- Nick.
- Hi, dad.

246
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,981
- Been looking all over for you.
- Well, I'm right here.

247
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:12,553
These lovely ladies as an excuse to
avoid that gondola ride, are you, sport?

248
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,301
No, dad.
They're gonna come too.

249
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,091
Great. The more the merrier.

250
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,241
I'm Vincent Aldridge.
I'm Nick's dad.

251
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:23,671
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

252
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:27,332
Come on, it's not that painful.
Give us a smile.

253
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:37,890
This is why I told you I didn't
want to work with Javier.

254
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:40,613
I've got a body on ice,
a target in play, and nobody to squeeze.

255
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,981
Well, then you just
make it right.

256
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,643
- Hi, I'm Jaime.
- I'll call you back, man.

257
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,702
I'm Matt. How's it going?

258
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,483
Could I have your
cell phone for a sec?

259
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:55,591
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

260
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,243
- My minutes are your minutes.
- I'll be right back, Mike.

261
00:20:58,268 --> 00:20:59,010
Matt.

262
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,631
- Hello.
- Jonas.

263
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:14,760
I, um-- I opened the briefcase.

264
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,953
The target's son is now
flirting with my sister.

265
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,253
We're all supposed to be going on
a gondola ride at 1:00. Who is he?

266
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,032
He's a very bad guy, Jaime.
And you're way out of your league.

267
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,863
Can you just fill me
in on everything?

268
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:34,462
Okay, he's a nuclear engineer
who's about to sell technology

269
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:37,190
to the north koreans.
He's posing as an accountant.

270
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,773
What kind of technology?

271
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,280
He's developed a more efficient
way to enrich plutonium.

272
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,980
It'll give 'em weapons-grade
fissile material that's 99% pure.

273
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:49,612
You're looking at a man who's about
to hand North Korea a nuclear bomb.

274
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,952
- Don't they already have one?
- This one would work.

275
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:57,613
By the way,
who the hell is Matthew Clarkson?

276
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,162
I have no idea.

277
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,740
Well, whose phone is it that
you're calling me from?

278
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,121
Oh, it's the valet guy.

279
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,442
Looks like a dweeb.

280
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,621
- Hey, thanks, Mark.
- Matt.

281
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:21,161
Yeah. You're not so
much of a dweeb.

282
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,493
Thanks.

283
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:26,152
Okay. Okay. So it's like boom.

284
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,590
- Twist. Back.
- There you go.

285
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:30,570
Okay, okay.
All right, all right.

286
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,290
I can take a little
bit more if he's--

287
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:33,562
Give him a little bit more.

288
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:34,971
I can take a little--
all right, let's do this.

289
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:36,801
All right, I can take a little more.
Come on.

290
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:42,012
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

291
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,452
Oh, god.
It's all the weapons around--

292
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,181
What are you doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

293
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:49,520
Jae's teaching me how to fight.

294
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,692
- What happened to your eye?
- Oh, my brother--

295
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:56,762
I actually don't even want to know.
So listen.

296
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:59,890
We've locked in on the engineer in
Montana, but I can't find a button man.

297
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:02,011
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to Montana.

298
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,831
- And you're coming with me.
- Why am I coming with you?

299
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,500
- Is he ready?
- Yeah, he's got a couple of moves.

300
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,181
Ready? What?
It's actually only one move.

301
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:14,681
- He'll be all right.
- You're my backup.

302
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,350
If I miss the target,
go center mass,

303
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:18,532
bang, bang,
then put one in his head.

304
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,831
- What? I'm not that guy.
- I'm kidding.

305
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,522
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

306
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:25,071
I need you there in case Vincent
has some of his research,

307
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:29,910
we need to figure it out.
Go get some kevlar.

308
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,733
So, Jaime,
what line of work are you in?

309
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:03,842
She sells timeshares.

310
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:07,561
No kidding. I have a timeshare in St.
Barts. Six weeks in the winter.

311
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:11,281
Three bedrooms, right on the beach,
pool. It's fantastic.

312
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,712
Unfortunately, I can't use it this year,
and I'd like to sell it.

313
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,253
But since they introduced
that new tax clause--

314
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,003
I'm sorry to intervene,
Mr. Aldridge,

315
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:22,091
but we kind of have a no work
rule in effect right now.

316
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,562
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
I completely understand.

317
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:26,532
Gotta play too, right?

318
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,960
Yeah, sometimes you mistake
your job for your life.

319
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:34,253
Which isn't such a bad thing
if you love what you do.

320
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:36,642
Do you love what you do,
Mr. Aldridge?

321
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,423
Me? Are you kidding me?

322
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:41,481
I wake up every morning with a
giant smile plastered on my face

323
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,361
because I love
what I do so much.

324
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:50,011
- Jaime, please, call me Vincent.
- Who are those guys, Vincent?

325
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,252
Oh, well, believe it or not,

326
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,850
there are some people out
there who don't love what I do.

327
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,493
Who would have thought accounting
could be so controversial.

328
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:04,032
Yeah.

329
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:24,291
What time is it?

330
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:27,090
Oh, boy, you know, I've got to
get you back to the room, sport.

331
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:28,611
I promised your mom you'd call.

332
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:31,760
And, uh, I believe you two ladies
have some spa appointments.

333
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:34,212
Watch your step,
ladies and gentlemen.

334
00:25:34,248 --> 00:25:35,922
Well, maybe we'll see
you guys for dinner?

335
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,710
- Yeah.
- Sure.

336
00:25:37,908 --> 00:25:39,072
Come on, Nick, let's go.

337
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,393
- What was that about accounting?
- What?

338
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,640
Nick's dad never said
he was an accountant.

339
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:50,522
It was a real
conversation stopper.

340
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,610
Okay, I'm gonna go shower and
warm up before we go to the spa.

341
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:02,331
Cool.

342
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,692
- Yeah, Jaime.
- Jonas, I think I messed up.

343
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:17,190
I think I got made.
Is that what you say?

344
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,093
This guy Vincent,
I think he made me.

345
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:20,523
Okay, that's a problem.

346
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:22,731
Yeah, I know it is.
What do I do now?

347
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,771
You're gonna have
to take him out.

348
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:29,252
- Take him out where?
- Jaime, listen to me.

349
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,370
He knows who you are.
He's not gonna wait long.

350
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,291
You have to kill him
before he kills you.

351
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,652
Okay, I'm all robed up.

352
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:50,871
You ready for the most relaxing
three hours of our lives?

353
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:53,461
Totally. Let's go. Let's go.

354
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:58,490
Rejuvenating facial. Yeah,
your skin's too young for anything else.

355
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:00,723
Right this way, miss Sommers.

356
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:04,450
So I'll see you in three hours.

357
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:08,002
Yeah, we probably won't even recognize
ourselves, we'll be so pretty.

358
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:13,312
I have to go somewhere. If you could
make sure my sister stays in that room

359
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,612
for the next three hours,
I'll make it worth your while.

360
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,203
- Okay.
- Thanks.

361
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,870
I don't think I can do this.

362
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,170
- Trust me, I understand.
- Do you have any advice?

363
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,292
I do,
but you're not gonna like it.

364
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:54,131
- Don't think of him as a person.
- That's gonna be hard for me.

365
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:57,071
I just spent two hours on a
gondola with him and his son.

366
00:27:57,307 --> 00:28:00,460
You gotta think about what could
happen if you don't do it, Jaime.

367
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:06,451
- It does get easier.
- That's what scares me.

368
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:09,852
Thanks, Jae.

369
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,421
- Hi.
- Yes.

370
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:37,202
- I need to talk to Vincent.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.

371
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:38,953
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

372
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:41,383
Well, if I could just take a look,
that would be--

373
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:45,530
Okay, we can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

374
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,041
You're coming with me.

375
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:03,893
It's on the left.

376
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:09,412
Did you do it?

377
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:13,172
No, I couldn't do it.
I was nowhere near being able to do it.

378
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:16,181
In an hour and 45 minutes Becca
is gonna walk through that door.

379
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,450
So can you start by telling me
what I'm supposed to do now?

380
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,441
I need you to calm down
and put him on the phone.

381
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,110
He wants to talk to you.

382
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:27,632
Vincent, Jonas Bledsoe here.

383
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:30,841
It's nice to meet you over the phone.
You with me?

384
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:31,931
Yes, I'm here.

385
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,921
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

386
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,862
Number one, I kill you.
The other one is you talk.

387
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:40,541
And by "talk" I mean you tell
me everything I need to know

388
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,613
to keep this technology
out of North Korea.

389
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,513
Which would you prefer?
It doesn't matter to me.

390
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:47,740
I just need to know whether
or not to wear gloves.

391
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:50,702
I understand your
son is with you.

392
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:55,702
I'll talk.
But you've got to get me out of here,

393
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,412
or my own people will kill me first.
And my son comes with me.

394
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:02,801
Done.

395
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,413
- Dad, where are we going?
- Little change of plans, sport.

396
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:15,060
Matt, do you wanna
get my car, please?

397
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:16,922
Oh, I already called for Mr.
Aldridge's car.

398
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:18,333
Fine.

399
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:19,771
I'll drive.

400
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:23,070
Thank you.

401
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:39,682
What's going on, dad?

402
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:45,091
You're gonna have to tell
him sooner or later.

403
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,960
I can raise my son without your help.
Thank you.

404
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,122
It's nothing you need
to worry about, Nick.

405
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,942
Does it have something
to do with your job?

406
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,032
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

407
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,253
Get out of the car.

408
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,971
- Why?
- Get out!

409
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:17,803
- Nick, get out.
- Dad, it won't open.

410
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:19,591
Open the door.
- I can't open it!

411
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,841
- Open the door!
- Dad, it's stuck. I can't get out.

412
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,131
Come on.

413
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:36,413
Come on.

414
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,801
It's all in the wrist.

415
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:13,312
Jonas. Somebody tried to blow up
Vincent's car with him in it.

416
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:15,742
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

417
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:18,520
- Where are you?
- Five miles south of the hotel.

418
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:20,183
How are you fixed
for transportation?

419
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:22,793
- I stole a car.
- That's my girl.

420
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:25,570
We're heading west on the road.
I think we're being followed.

421
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:27,281
Well, slow down and
see if he passes.

422
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:31,753
We should get away more often together,
road trip.

423
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,013
Shut up.

424
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:44,763
He passed.

425
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,783
A good tail is always
from the front.

426
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,403
You hungry, sport?

427
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,360
No.

428
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,081
Who are you?

429
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:08,990
And how the hell did you
rip that door off my car?

430
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,483
Maybe you should be happy I
did and not ask questions.

431
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:17,780
You saved my son's life.
Thank you for that.

432
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,270
- He's a sweet kid.
- Takes after his mom.

433
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:26,163
I think I've lost him.

434
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,941
Maybe he deserves to know
the truth about his dad.

435
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,671
Maybe your sister deserves
to know the truth about you.

436
00:34:31,956 --> 00:34:33,782
It's a different situation.

437
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:45,101
Hello.

438
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,261
Did you get the
plate on that truck?

439
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,513
- X-U-V-0-5.
- It's here, and so am I.

440
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,210
Get out of there and
meet me up front.

441
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:00,690
We need to move now.

442
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,331
Vincent, let's get you
out of here right now.

443
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:29,140
- What about my son?
- We'll pick up his mother.

444
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,652
We can put 'em in
protective custody.

445
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:32,422
You can speak to 'em after
you've made your statement.

446
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:33,480
Jaime!

447
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,113
Jaime! Jaime, it's Matt!

448
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:40,021
Who's that guy?

449
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,462
The valet guy.
The guy whose phone I used to call you.

450
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,863
The guy whose phone you used
looked nothing like this.

451
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:15,310
Clean this up for me.
I'll take you back to the hotel.

452
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,872
It's gonna be all right.
The Berkut guys are on their way.

453
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,551
Now, Nathan.

454
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm worried that if I keep lying to her,
I'm gonna lose her.

455
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:52,092
So don't lie to her.

456
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:56,872
I don't want her to
think I'm a freak.

457
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,200
Listen, I never said
you couldn't tell her.

458
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,830
You've got to do what's
right for your family, Jaime.

459
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:06,930
I found that out too late.
The question you have to ask yourself...

460
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,301
is is she ready to hear it?

461
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:12,232
Anything has to be
better than this.

462
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,390
Maybe, maybe not.

463
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:19,342
See, here's the thing,
every person who knows

464
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,832
is a potential source of
information for people

465
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:25,633
who might want to scrap you
for parts or technology.

466
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,272
Teenagers aren't exactly
known for their discretion.

467
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:36,273
And if you're at greater risk,
then so is Becca.

468
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,532
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

469
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:44,802
I think either way she's lucky.

470
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:48,131
Because she's got
you for a big sister.

471
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:09,551
Thanks.

472
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:11,083
Hey.

473
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,942
- How was yours?
- It was great.

474
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,772
- You look great.
- Yeah.

475
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:21,731
Look, I wouldn't tip
your girl too much.

476
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,911
I'm sorry,
you don't look any better.

477
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:27,823
That was, like,
three hours for nothing.

478
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,892
- Thanks.
- Come on.

479
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:32,601
Nick never said good-bye.

480
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,550
- No?
- No.

481
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:37,993
That's okay though,
I wasn't that into him anyway.

482
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:41,282
- Oh, this trip had learning.
- Hey.

483
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:46,323
Yes, it's more fun to be with a
guy who gives you the time of day.

484
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:48,470
Good for you.

485
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:53,361
And I'm glad we came.
I had fun with you.

486
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:57,813
Maybe we could do
this again sometime.

487
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:02,170
What?

488
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,972
What? You're freaking me out.
Is something on your mind?

489
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,732
There's something
I should tell you.

490
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:13,612
What?

491
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:19,790
There's this guy who
I work with who died.

492
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:23,681
I didn't even really
know him that well, but

493
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:28,571
what I realized is it's
really affected me.

494
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:32,243
Was he a guy you
liked or something?

495
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,742
No, it wasn't like that.

496
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,972
Wow. I'm really sorry.
Why didn't you tell me about this?

497
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:42,020
I didn't want you
to worry about me.

498
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:44,772
- Well, that was really stupid.
- I know.

499
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,922
Jaime, you can talk to me
about this stuff, okay?

500
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:48,952
I'm a lot stronger
than you think I am.

501
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,643
Okay.

502
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,852
Now, is there anything
else you want to tell me?

503
00:40:06,218 --> 00:40:08,561
No. Nothing at all.
