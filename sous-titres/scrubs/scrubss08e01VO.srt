1
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,342
That's new.

2
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,144
Oh, yeah. My girlfriend
gave me a watch.

3
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:12,979
Do you give a crap,
or are you just hoping

4
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,048
that by pointing out
something new of mine,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,650
i'll segue the conversation

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,552
into talking about something
new of yours, like...

7
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:21,688
Your new prepubescent
"miami vice" beard.

8
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:25,519
There are those who say I look
like a young kenny loggins. Who?

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:27,191
me.

10
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:29,230
Time to go
teach the new interns.

11
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:30,894
They started a week ago,

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,764
and they...
Suck.

13
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,734
This patient's loss
of temperature sensation

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,133
on the contralateral side

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,337
is consistent
with which syndrome, rodney?

16
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:42,042
There was katie,
the self-centered climber...

17
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,175
Mcconaughey's.

18
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:45,612
Mcconaughey's.

19
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,446
Mcconaughey is not a syndrome.

20
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,381
He is, however, one of
our finest working actors.

21
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,683
I recently learned
how I could lose him in 10 days.

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,120
Katie is sabotaging you,
I assume,

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,056
because she knows the answer.
Brown-sequard syndrome.

24
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,390
Yay, katie got it.

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,593
There was denise,
who could be a bit callous...

26
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,196
You know...

27
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,531
It's ironic that "cancer"
starts wh "can,"

28
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:07,997
because at this stage,

29
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:09,903
there's nothing
wecando about it.

30
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,137
Let's take a walk, sunshine.
I...

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,306
And there was ed.

32
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:17,911
Ed, did you finish
those case reports last night?

33
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,847
I totally
was gonna do it, man,

34
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:21,848
but I was on this "lost"
fan site last night

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,283
talking to this chick.

36
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:26,883
About an hour in, I realize
it's a dude messin' with me.

37
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,390
I've been there.
Revenge time.

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,325
I signed up for a new account--
Hotgirl99.

39
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,293
I start flirtin'
with this dude.

40
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:36,430
I'm like, "oh, hey,
I look just like kate."

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,298
And he's totally into it,
right?

42
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,234
Next thing you know,
I got him to agree

43
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,703
to a personal meet-up
here in the hospital

44
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,635
where he'll be holding
a red balloon.

45
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,980
Wait a minute, you're hotgirl99? Yeah.

46
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,114
The new interns all suck,
yeah, but I'm gonna handle it.

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,516
Like you handled
jimmy the overly touchy orderly?

48
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,886
Somebody looking for me?

49
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,389
No, jimmy, we're fine.

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,891
All right. Let me know if
you need anything. Okay.

51
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,194
Have you noticed he only
touches above the waist now?

52
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,998
You're welcome. You know, our
intern class was the last good one.

53
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,033
You must've liked myclass
a little,

54
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:14,902
seeing as you almost
married me.

55
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,002
Mm, yeah, but hello, keith,
I didn't.

56
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,474
That was harsh,
but no one cared

57
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:24,243
because today we were meeting
dr. Kelso's replacement

58
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,613
as chief of medicine--
Dr. Taylor maddox.

59
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,081
She was smokin' hot, so first
I had to see her like this...

60
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,625
I wanna be your lover, baby,
I wanna be your man

61
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,492
I don't want no other, baby,
want you again and again

62
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,097
and I've waited
all night long

63
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,497
now I know what I wanna do

64
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,799
I just wanna
make love to you

65
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:51,170
come on!

66
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,411
Yeah!

67
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:57,870
Hi. Hi.

68
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,881
But then I noticed
how friendly she seemed.

69
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,749
She had the most infectious
smile. No one could resist it.

70
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,914
And I mean no one.
no.

71
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,155
Yes!

72
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:10,385
Never!

73
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:12,492
He it comes!

74
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,228
Clear.
Aah!

75
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,833
Brava!

76
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,267
Oh, yeah!

77
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,538
Yes!

78
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:27,673
You proud fool.

79
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,742
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
everything

80
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,545
you need to know about me.

81
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:33,413
One-- I have an open door policy.

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,252
Two-- if you do your job well,
you're great with me. Okay?

83
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,151
And three-- I don't like spiders.

84
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,121
So if you see one,
I want you to stomp it.

85
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,088
I want you to stomp it dead,
okay?

86
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,090
I don't want you
to put it into a little cup

87
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,093
and take it outside,
because it'll just

88
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,162
find its way back in, okay?
They're sneaky.

89
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,164
Oh, can someone help that man
to his room?

90
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:55,266
Oh. No, I-i'm not sick.

91
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,871
I'm just cold,
and there were no chairs.

92
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:01,976
I'm-- I'm a lawyer.

93
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,678
Of course you are, sweetie.
I'm on it.

94
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,076
She's the new boss, ted.

95
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:09,411
Aah!

96
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,352
Does it hurt here?

97
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,018
Or here? How about here?
Or under here?

98
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,567
Do I know you?

99
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,692
Jimmy, heel!

100
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:22,830
Slowly move. Slowly move.
Don't rush anything. No, jimmy.

101
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,466
Oh, jimmy.
Breathe deep for me real slow.

102
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:28,133
I just wanna feel you breathe.

103
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,638
Yeah. That's a boy.
That's a boy. That's a boy.

104
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:33,571
Good. Breathe on my face.

105
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,444
Okay, time to connect
with the new chief

106
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,382
using a picture of my son
and some brilliant acting.

107
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,349
Oh! Is that your boy?

108
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,582
What's that? Oh, yeah.

109
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,489
His name is sam.
I have a daughter of my own.

110
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:01,722
It's working!

111
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,859
Now seal the deal

112
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,861
with a follow-up question,
but nothing too personal.

113
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:08,898
Did you deliver vaginally?

114
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:10,397
I did.

115
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,168
Big girl. Must've hurt.

116
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:16,404
Wow.

117
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,440
Hi, Mr. Hicks. So you were
admitted to the hospital

118
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,043
with shortness of breath?
Yes, that's right.

119
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,675
Okay, so I'm just gonna...

120
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,846
Die! Die! Die!

121
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,585
Sorry. Spider. Um,
i'm just gonna take you up

122
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:34,190
and get you a full-body
scan, okay? Yeah.

123
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:35,924
And there she goes.

124
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,859
A chief of medicine working
one-on-one with a patient?

125
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:40,828
Maybe she's not so bad.

126
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:42,999
I think she's probably a jerk. Why?

127
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,001
That position
attracts jerks.

128
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:46,970
Plus, well, I know jerks.

129
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,469
Hell, I married a jerk.
I divorced a jerk.

130
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,142
New freckle.
I'm interrupted by jerks.

131
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,276
Look, just give me two minutes
with this maddox,

132
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,640
and I'll know for sure
whether or not she's a jerk.

133
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:57,879
Well, go!

134
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:02,752
Pass.

135
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,689
I know people are down
on these new interns,

136
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,757
but everyone's teachable,
you know?

137
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:09,759
Even jo.
Who?

138
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,796
I like to call denise "jo"
because she reminds me

139
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,728
of that streetwise, mannish girl
on "facts of life."

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
You know,
katie's cutesy and blonde.

141
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,568
You could call her "blair."
"blair" is stupid.

142
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:21,970
"blair" is perfect,

143
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,041
but now I can never use it
in front of turk,

144
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,210
or he'll say 'you're welcome!'
in that reallymug way of his.

145
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,245
Okay, let's gather 'round
for rounds.

146
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,913
Get it? "'round for rounds"?
You can use it.

147
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:34,448
Our first patient

148
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,185
is presenting
with biliary colic...

149
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,656
And, uh-- ed, would--
Would you mind-- would you mind

150
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,056
turning off the beeping
if you're gonna text?

151
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,627
I'll turn it off.
Thank you.

152
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,664
Uh, upper right abdominal pain.
What's your diagnosis... Jo?

153
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,665
I know. Of course you do,
katie, because you know anything

154
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,910
that anyone's ever asked
you ever. But I didn't ask you.

155
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,870
I asked jo. Well, the patient
definitely looks like hell, so--

156
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:58,072
Quick side note--
When a patient's eyes are open,

157
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,075
that usually means
that they're awake.

158
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:03,176
Sorry, Mrs. Gallagher.
You look very beautiful today.

159
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:04,212
Doesn't she?

160
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,714
Yeah, your jaundice
makes you glow.

161
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,052
Yes, yellow like the sun.

162
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,086
Ed, stop texting!
I'm not texting.

163
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,588
I'm looking at photos
of sienna miller's breasts.

164
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,990
There's a difference.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Okay, well, do that more
later... When we're together.

166
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,228
Jo, you were saying?

167
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,562
I'm guessing Mrs. Gallagher
probably has cholecy--

168
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,599
Cholecystis.
She has cholecystis.

169
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,331
I'm gonna cut your throat.
Okay, that's enough, jo.

170
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,034
You, too, blair.
Welcome!

171
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:30,806
Damn it! If you want,
you can call me "tootie."

172
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,772
I don't think it's racist.
Oh, oh, fine.

173
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:35,710
I'm tootie, and I know how
to go on the web and bittorrent.

174
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,580
You probably
shouldn't be texting

175
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,184
while you're leading rounds. I'm--
Oh, I'm-- th-- this is his phone.

176
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,185
It's not my phone.
W.t.h.?!

177
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,252
Oh, fine. It's not your phone.
Hey, want a phone, buddy?

178
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:50,627
no.

179
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,629
All right, listen,
I want you

180
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,636
to run some renal function tests
on Mr. Hicks.

181
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:57,196
Can you do that, or do you have
more questions about my vagina?

182
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:58,462
Lie!

183
00:07:59,568 --> 00:07:59,668
no.

184
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:00,634
Hmm.

185
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,471
Dr. Maddox,
I just wanted to say

186
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:05,473
to be working with you.

187
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,944
Katie is such a kiss ass.

188
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:11,013
You mean "mini elliot"?

189
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,680
What? That's what
everybody's calling her.

190
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,348
It's probably
just because we are...

191
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,921
Both blonde
and have perky boobs.

192
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:19,289
Or...

193
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,658
It's because she is incredibly
whiny and lf-involved,

194
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:24,627
and you, barboo, for the last
year and a half or so,

195
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,928
have beenthemost self-involved
and whiny person in the galaxy.

196
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
What nobody understands
aboutme...

197
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,299
Point proven. Thank you.

198
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:33,903
Okay...

199
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:35,538
Mm, suck-up's back.

200
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,003
You're abrasive.

201
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:38,372
That's enough, blair.

202
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,343
Welcome!
Damn it!

203
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,279
Okay, listen up, guys. I gotta
go take care of Mr. Hicks,

204
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,481
so I need you guys to watch
the floor. Check every patient

205
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,650
and switch out any lines
that need changing.

206
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,718
Monitor Mr. Lombardi's
blood gas,

207
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,820
and intubate him
if he starts getting acidotic.

208
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:54,857
Work as a team,
you'll be all over it.

209
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,857
Let's have some hands in,
okay?

210
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,962
Somedy has some very soft
hands. I sleep in gloves.

211
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:01,095
Right on. Okay, nobody die!

212
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:03,728
Nobody die!

213
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:05,702
Dr. Kelso...

214
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,905
Now that you're retired,
I can finally say this.

215
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:12,342
You, sir...

216
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:16,811
Oh, I can't do it.
You'll get there, ted.

217
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,383
What's with the balloon?
It's been a sad day.

218
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,418
Can you
even believe Dr. Cox,

219
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,518
callingmewhiny
and self-involved?

220
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,487
Elliot, you know how
we're so close

221
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,524
we can say anything
to each other, right?

222
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:31,459
Yeah?

223
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,628
Look, over the last year
or so,

224
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:35,661
you've been going through
a lot.

225
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:37,732
You got engaged.

226
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,237
You broke off your wedding
at the last second.

227
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:45,275
It'd be easy for anyone to
become a little self-absorbed.

228
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:47,982
What are you saying, carla?

229
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,946
Thisis why
I come here every day.

230
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,283
You come hereeveryday?

231
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:55,785
Loser!

232
00:09:59,423 --> 00:09:59,790
My balloon!

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,253
Mr. Hicks' renal tests
came back negative.

234
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:04,526
Thank god.

235
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:08,263
See, bernie isn't just
a patient. He's also my lover.

236
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:10,095
Really?

237
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:13,164
no!
He's fat, bald and ugly!

238
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,504
Thanks a lot!
Aah!

239
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,208
Okay, just swallow your pain
and fix this.

240
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,176
Look, Dr. Maddox,

241
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,879
I think you're
a very well-built...

242
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,343
Sturdy woman.

243
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:27,551
Like a shed.

244
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,020
No, not like a shed.
Like a...

245
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:30,981
Naughty...

246
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,983
Like it.
Structure.

247
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,091
Structure?
I should go.

248
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:38,791
Ooh! Ugh! Aah!

249
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:40,163
ow!

250
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,999
Stop confusing me by being nice
and giving me phones.

251
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,634
Fine! But why did you
have to trip me?

252
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,336
I'll answer that question
with another question--

253
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:51,968
'cause I wanted to?

254
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,437
Ahem!

255
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,307
Excuse me.
Yeah?

256
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,312
Do you think
it would've been funny

257
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:59,448
if he had broken his neck?

258
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,681
I feel like
you want me to say "no."

259
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:04,854
What's your name? Oh, boy.
You really are new here.

260
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:07,452
Uh-oh.

261
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:11,156
"the janitor."
Howdy.

262
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:13,094
Oh, say, beth,

263
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,532
your patient Mr. Lombardi
is about to crash.

264
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,630
How'd that happen?

265
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:19,969
Well, sometimes
when people get owies

266
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,972
and they're left untreated,
they become even bigger owies.

267
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,107
Hey! You guys are supposed
to tube him if he got acidotic.

268
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,176
What the hell?!
He's not my patient, man.

269
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:28,911
Uh, I-I was over there.

270
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,479
Now he's coding.

271
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:33,615
Crash cart!

272
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,317
Sometimes just two words

273
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,419
are enough to make your
thoughts perfectly clear...

274
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,888
So you actually agree
with what Dr. Cox said about me?

275
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:42,852
Whether you're being
brutally honest...

276
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:44,826
I do.

277
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:46,691
Or holding someone
accountable...

278
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:47,998
You're fired.

279
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:50,063
What about my son?

280
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,471
That's my daughter!

281
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,907
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
May I see it again?

282
00:11:58,675 --> 00:11:58,908
Please?

283
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:03,544
Aah! Ew!

284
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:06,344
Or apologizing
for a major screwup.

285
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:07,683
We're sorry.

286
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,518
Yeah. We'll-- we'll get it
together from now on. Promise.

287
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,621
But for some reason,
I didn't want to hear it.

288
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,625
You know what?
I'm done with you guys.

289
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,333
Hey, t-bear,
every time I see maddox,

290
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:24,567
I get one step closer
to ending my career.

291
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,801
Aw, you'll be fine. Maddox seems
cool. I don't know about that.

292
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,707
I- I just can't
shake the feeling that

293
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:33,176
that woman is a complete tool.
You've been saying that all day.

294
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,080
Why don't
you just gtalk to her

295
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,079
and figure it out once and for all? Nah.

296
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,017
Hey, aren't you supposed to be at
rounds? Oh, they're driving me crazy.

297
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:42,019
Someone needs
to send those interns

298
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:43,918
to an internment camp.

299
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,456
De, internment camps
are never funny.

300
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,618
I always forget that turk
is one-eighth japanese.

301
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:49,565
he

302
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:53,331
Y, can you give Mr. Hicks
a full cardiac workup?

303
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:56,835
Of course. And what would you
say if I said he was my lover?

304
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,769
I'd know that obviously
you were joking

305
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,972
because you are
way out of his league.

306
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,671
Oh, there-- there
that is. We're doing this. Okay.

307
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,078
I like you the best.
oh.

308
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,444
Thanks, mom...
Ma'am. Ma'am.

309
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:13,683
She's not your mom. Well,shecertainly
doesn't think th I'm all about me.

310
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,582
I was just being honest.

311
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,553
I'd want you
to do the same for me

312
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,624
if I were doing things
I might regret later.

313
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:22,586
Name one thing that I've done
lately that I'm gonna regret.

314
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:23,995
Mmm!

315
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,996
oh!
Hey, blondie!

316
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,031
Ahh.
Show me your rack!

317
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:29,161
no!

318
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,068
Ooh! Yah!

319
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:38,043
Oh, like that
is gonna come back to haunt me.

320
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,243
What else you got?
Well, what about the way

321
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,647
you're always mocking keith
about not marrying him?

322
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,847
You probably don't even realize
how devastated he still is.

323
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:48,983
Oh, hey, ladies.

324
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:50,651
Awesome day, huh?

325
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:52,589
Awesome!

326
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,527
Ugh. I hope
he'll pull through.

327
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,763
And now on to our next patient.

328
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:02,968
Let's go, bitches!

329
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,969
Why is Dr. Squeaky pants
leading rounds?

330
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:06,900
Ere the hell is dorian?

331
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,139
Keith is not
still devastated.

332
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,575
I mean, what the hell
is carla talking about?

333
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,377
She's completely off base, right?
I have to disagree with you.

334
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,981
You don't see my point at all? You don't
understand. I'm married to carla, right?

335
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,917
She has spieseverywhere.

336
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,691
So ihaveto
disagree with you.

337
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,255
I'm on to you, rochelle.

338
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,260
Dr. Reid?

339
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:38,069
May I talk to you?

340
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:39,999
Ted, are you gonna talk?

341
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:41,973
In a second.
I'm just waiting

342
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,172
for the antianxiety medication
to kick in.

343
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:47,106
And... There it is.

344
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:48,745
Hey, baby.

345
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,713
Yeah, ted,
i'm actually in charge

346
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:52,746
of keeping
a lot of people alive, so--

347
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,719
Carla's right.
Keith's a mess.

348
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:57,653
He hasn't been able to pull out
of it since you ended things.

349
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,422
He's sad all the time.
Yeah, I don't see it.

350
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:02,023
Of course you don't.

351
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,426
No one ever wants
the person who hurt them

352
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,438
to ever see how badly
they've been hurt.

353
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:14,599
Morning.

354
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:15,671
Morning.

355
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,705
It's amazing
how the exact same question

356
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,512
can have
totally different connotations.

357
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,510
May I talk to you?

358
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:25,517
May I talk to you?

359
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,150
May I talk to you?

360
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,621
I have to ask,
when I fired you before...

361
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,623
Did you think I was kidding?
No, I knew you were serious

362
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,088
'cause I heard that you fired
jimmy the orderly.

363
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:36,727
What'd he do?

364
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:40,130
Okay, this is where
you keep all of the tension.

365
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,637
Do you mind
if I do a yogi chant?

366
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:44,068
It relaxes the muscles.

367
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,672
Do you feel that?
Mm-hmm.

368
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:52,577
But that's just jimmy
being jimmy.

369
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,610
You know, the incident yesterday
with Dr. Dorian--

370
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:56,814
I swear to you
that will never happen again...

371
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:58,683
Even though he deserved it.

372
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:01,751
I don't know. Come on!
I've been here forever.

373
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:04,189
You can't just throw me
out of the hospital.

374
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:08,021
No, but I can walk you out
without you even noticing.

375
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,028
Well played.

376
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,565
I need your keys.
mm.

377
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,399
Where are the rest? I got
tired of carrying 'em all,

378
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:20,236
so I made one that works
on everything. Watch.

379
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:23,640
Huh? How about that?

380
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,376
Come on. Hit the highway!

381
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,913
Thank you.

382
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:37,222
no!

383
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:39,724
Keith...

384
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,126
I just realized

385
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,561
that I never really
took the time

386
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:46,831
to apologize for the way
things ended between us.

387
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:49,334
I mean, I did say

388
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,337
that I was so sorry right
when it happened. Remember?

389
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:53,905
We were outside,

390
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,537
I gave you the ring back,
you started crying and cr--

391
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,309
Uh, no need to recap,
elliot.

392
00:16:59,176 --> 00:16:59,376
Right.

393
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,813
Look, I know
this was my decision,

394
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:04,316
so it was easier for me
to move on,

395
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,118
and, well, you know,
make jokes and stuff.

396
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:09,487
I guess that I've been
so self-involved

397
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,891
I never stopped to think
that you still may be hurting.

398
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,561
Anyway, I just wanted
to really apologize...

399
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:19,191
For everything.

400
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:21,495
Thanks.

401
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:23,434
It means a lot.

402
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:25,837
Hug?
no.

403
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:27,372
Okay.

404
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:30,338
Why would you pass off
your interns?

405
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,511
I just-- I can't deal
with them anymore. Really?

406
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,414
Because I had an intern
just a couple of years back

407
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:38,082
thatihated.

408
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,051
Honestly,
he was so maddening

409
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:43,919
that my therapist put me
on a suicide/homicide watch.

410
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:45,657
Do I know this intern?

411
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,159
Intimately.
I figured.

412
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,356
This is a teaching hospital.
You have to teach.

413
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:52,596
I know.

414
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,029
I'm just-- I'm-- I'm so tired
of their attitude

415
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,998
and I'm tired
of their ignorance.

416
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:59,031
It's the same thing
year after year.

417
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:01,065
I'm just...

418
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:02,473
Tired.

419
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,375
Here comes the tongue-lashing.

420
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,812
Boy, I get that.

421
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,615
Why do you think I've been
avoiding the new chief?

422
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:14,050
Because if I do talk to her,
and she is indeed a jerk,

423
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:17,087
then once again,
i'm gonna have to bethat guy

424
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,791
who gets in her face
over every little injustice.

425
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:23,825
But you wanna know something?
I'm tired, too.

426
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,995
So what do we do?
I don't know.

427
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,834
Oh, my god.
He's treating me like an equal.

428
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:33,965
Quick, do something equals do!

429
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:38,409
Why would you do that?

430
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:40,477
I don't know.
I thought equals shared coffee.

431
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:41,976
no.

432
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:44,611
So this intern
that you mentioned...

433
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,381
Earlier,
i'm sure eventually

434
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:48,280
he turned into
a pretty amazing doctor.

435
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,951
Didn't he?
Actually, it was a "she."

436
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:52,758
It wasn't me?

437
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,426
No, no, it was you.
It was you.

438
00:18:58,497 --> 00:18:59,330
Hey.
We'll get there.

439
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,167
Okay, you get nice and comfy.

440
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,503
Dr. Reid gave me
mr. Hicks' tt results,

441
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,573
but they're
locked in my briefcase,

442
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:10,536
and I lost the key.

443
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:12,474
Allow me.

444
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:15,647
Mm, loving this thing!

445
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:17,745
And... Here it is.

446
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:19,749
Hey, how come
all you have in here

447
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,154
is a smiley face button
and a revolver?

448
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,622
Well, one's in case
I get sad,

449
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:28,591
and the other one's
in case I get really sad.

450
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:30,328
Well, see you tomorrow.

451
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:33,598
We'll see.

452
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:35,232
ah.

453
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,570
Oh, Mr. Hicks'
cardiac test results.

454
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,072
They're negative.
mm.

455
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,074
What do you know
about that?

456
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:44,009
Just like the 100 other tests
we ordered

457
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,412
for a man who's only complaint
was shortness of breath.

458
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:49,047
I assume there's a nugget
of a point buried in there.

459
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,278
Why you running that guy
through the wringer?

460
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,014
Because he's got
awesome insurance.

461
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:55,852
He's 100%
pure profit machine.

462
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,716
Ca... And might I add...

463
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:58,755
Ching

464
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,158
I mean, I may even order
an m.r.i.

465
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,257
Just to see if he's actually
stuffed with money.

466
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,229
In fact,
I think I'm ordering one.

467
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,663
And since you cried about it,
why don't you

468
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,065
take him to radiology
like a good little boy?

469
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,269
My head is a box...

470
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,672
Sometimes it really sucks
to do the right thing...

471
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:16,838
And that's the way I like it

472
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:20,911
so please

473
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,776
you were right about me...

474
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:24,981
And thanks.

475
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:27,052
Open your heart

476
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,621
don't mention it.
Love you.

477
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:31,121
I love you, too.

478
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:34,225
Trying to teach
a bunch of jerks...

479
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,526
Okay, when dealing
with peripheral neuropathy,

480
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:38,561
always think...

481
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:40,496
Diabetes first.

482
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,066
Or once again,
facing off with a jerk.

483
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:45,569
Look, you can't just
bleed a guy's insurance dry

484
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:48,540
just because you want to pay
for a new x-ray machine.

485
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,044
Oh, will you shut up if I give you
a key that opens everything? Oh...

486
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:55,681
The more things change, the more
they stay the same, huh? Hi, folks.

487
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,743
If you need anything cleaned up,
just give me a shout, okay?

488
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:00,549
Sure.

489
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,116
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.

490
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,264
I like him.

491
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,203
You guys psyched?
It's our eighth year.

492
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,771
Who's with me?
Yay.

493
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,773
Come on. I know it's tempting
to just mail it in,

494
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:17,775
but there's still
a lot of people

495
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,874
who rely on us week to week.
I think we owe it to them

496
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,112
sotros semanalmente.

497
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:23,347
To be as inspired as we were
in our first few years.

498
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:25,207
Now I know we never do great
come medical awards season...

499
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,409
Except for Dr. Shalhoub.
He wins everything.

500
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:30,913
But I still think we're as good
as anybody else out there.

501
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,060
The nielsens
certainly beg to differ.

502
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:37,527
Oh, they're just upset

503
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:38,658
'cause their insurance
won't cover a private room.
