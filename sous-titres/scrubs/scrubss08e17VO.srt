1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,237
The park was such a blast.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,581
But I had no idea he was so scared of puppies.

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:08,245
Oh, he usually loves them.

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:09,884
Oh, I wasn't talking about Sam.

5
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,769
That was not a puppy.
It was a full-grown dachshund.

6
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:16,016
And it came at me like a rapid missile.

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,741
I heard when you're being attacked by a tiny gay dog,

8
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:22,308
you're supposed to pull its sweater over
its head and hockey fight it.

9
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,526
Sam was so happy this morning,
I decided I'm definitely moving here.

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,310
You know, it's only 37 minutes from work,

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,906
it makes it so much easier for me
to see more of him, you know?

12
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:33,825
I think that's great, J.D.

13
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,942
<i>This feels right.</i>

14
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,128
<i>Still, sometimes when you make big decisions,</i>

15
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:41,663
<i>life starts going so fast that it seems
like you're not even moving throught it.</i>

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,594
<i>It just happens to you.</i>

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,545
<i>Like that, I found a new place,</i>

18
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,751
<i>furnished it,</i>

19
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,778
<i>and after work, i got in my car</i>

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,550
<i>and made the 37 minute drive
to my new home.</i>

21
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:01,419
Hey baby, check out my new badge.

22
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,396
"Christopher Turk, Chief of Surgery."

23
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,024
I am so proud of you!

24
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:13,445
Guys, check out the on-call room walk of shame.

25
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,409
What were you two doing in there?

26
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,663
- Nothing. I was taking a nap.
- Just preparing for the day, really.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,557
Derek, you can't do that
before a full day of surgery.

28
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:25,877
Booty weakens the core muscle, you know?
These get sore.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,880
I think I'm pretty good.

30
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:30,799
Let's go get you some coffee.

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,636
Nice pull, Denise.

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,766
That kid is so fine, he's actually made
a couple of guest appearances up in here.

33
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,842
Me, too.

34
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,920
I've got this one scenario, where he and I
are walking down a dark alley,

35
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,046
and J.D. is a mugger who jumps out with a knife.

36
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:48,817
Derek used to be the mugger, but then I thought
that was a little racially insensitive.

37
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:52,049
Anyway, there's a scuffle.
I wind up with the knife.

38
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,479
So at first, I force them both to pleasure me.

39
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:57,752
But then it takes a left turn
and I go on a killing spree.

40
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,204
Eh, I know it's a little weird, but we all have
our little tricks to help us climax, right?

41
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,916
Elliot Reid - two years therapy-free!

42
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:05,632
I don't need it anymore.

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,481
I don't know why I keep jumping into bed with him.

44
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:09,944
My confidence is shot from screwing up
that spinal tap last week,

45
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,090
and then yesterday,
I misdiagnosed an ectopic pregnancy.

46
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,678
Maybe I wanted to do something I knew I could do right,
like banging a dude.

47
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,515
I'm a giant ho-bag.

48
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,598
No, no, you are not!

49
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,767
So, is Derek a good guy?

50
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:24,947
Derek? I thought it was "Eric".

51
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,180
Hey, you coming up to the third floor today?

52
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,138
No, I am not cleaning the third floor this month.
I'm sending a message:

53
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,238
You steal a man's sandwich off his cart,
you stew in your own filth.

54
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,073
Sweetie, I took that sandwich.

55
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,818
Well, I can't change my mind now.
I'll look like a flip-flopper.

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,566
Listen, my sister Amy's son
is having a tough time at school,

57
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:45,957
and since his dad is out of the picture,
I thought maybe you could sit down and talk to him.

58
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:49,341
Amy, who gave us a doily for our wedding,

59
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:50,920
wants me to save her boy?

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,423
- Please?
- That seems fair.

61
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,582
- So, Ian ...
- It's Ethan.

62
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:58,303
Whatever. Your mom says you're having
a rough time in school?

63
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,680
Liam stole my backpack. I wanna hit him.

64
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,478
No, no, we don't hit. Never.

65
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,015
You hit somebody, and the anger's gone,
and it's all over.

66
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,850
No, the goal should be
to keep that anger inside you, growing,

67
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:11,576
like a anger baby.

68
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,548
You got to get inside Liam's head, right?
You got to find out Liam's weaknesses.

69
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:19,017
Like, uh, is he afraid of the dark?

70
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:21,200
Does he have any food allergies?

71
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,216
How's he do if he's left out on open water?

72
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,537
Does he have a pet?

73
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,372
Could that pet be convinced to betray him?

74
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,909
Would you be willing to get plastic surgery
to further your goals?

75
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:32,796
Would you change the location of your eyes -
to here?

76
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,300
That's the level of commitment I'm looking for.
Or maybe I'm just wasting my time.

77
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,093
Are you on drugs?

78
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,343
Are you?

79
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,949
<i>Now that I lived here,
when Kim and I had to make a Sam exchange</i>

80
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>I just zipped over to St. Vincent's.</i>

81
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,346
Hey J.D., since you're coming around my hospital
a lot more often now,

82
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,481
I was hoping maybe you could dress a little nicer.

83
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,391
And maybe say "Smell you later" a little less often,

84
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:56,528
or just stop completely.

85
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,280
- Are you sure? It's hilarious.
- It's not.

86
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,407
Hey, calm down, gramps!

87
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,743
Now you're screaming at my Chief of Medicine.

88
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,829
Sorry, Dr. Mantoots.

89
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,065
Don't laugh.

90
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,208
- His name is "Mantoots"?
- Yes, I know, I know.

91
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,793
Stop laughing.

92
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,342
Tell them.

93
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:18,484
<i>This was gonna be hard.</i>

94
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:21,919
I got a job at St. Vincent's.

95
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,681
I'm leaving Sacred Heart at the end of the month.

96
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,683
What? How?

97
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,645
Well, I was apologizing to Kim's Chief of Medicine,
Dr. Mantoots ...

98
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:43,201
Mantoots.

99
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,860
Anyway, Mantoots and I ended up hitting it off,

100
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,950
and he actually offered me their Residency Director job.

101
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,898
It pays a little bit more money,

102
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,084
and I'm really liking being closer to Sam,

103
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,617
so ... I took it.

104
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,672
<i>As I scanned across their faces,</i>

105
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,563
<i>it felt amazing to see
how everyone truly felt about me.</i>

106
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:07,515
- Why are you stretching?
- Because, Barbie,

107
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,525
I'm just so very happy,

108
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:13,542
that I'm gonna try something
I haven't done since High School.

109
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,331
Backflip!

110
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,194
Did I stick it, you guys?

111
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:22,950
No, you did not.

112
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,888
It was worth it.

113
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,104

115
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:44,344
So, with the new job, do you think
you'll be able to keep the romance going?

116
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,055
- I don't think it should be that hard.
- I was talking to them.

117
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,100
Hilarious.

118
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:54,145
You mean to tell me you're interested
in Newbie that way, too?

119
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,856
Seriously, are you two gonna be okay?

120
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,983
I mean, you lived together in college,

121
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,750
and med school, out here.

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,987
I mean, you guys are inseparable.

123
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,649
It's not a big deal. I'm sure
it's gonna suck not working together,
but we'll see each other all the time.

124
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,473
- We're only 37 minutes away!
- 35, if I don't stop at the blueberry stand.

125
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,743
- Yeah, but if I'm with you,
we're stopping for blueberries.
- Hell yeah, we are.

126
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,293
I'm just saying, the only time you two
haven't been together was our honeymoon.

127
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,079
- What?
- It's time.

128
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:23,758
Fine. Honey,

129
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:27,804
J.D. and I were together
during our honeymoon.

130
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,187
He flew in and stayed
in the bungalow by the pool.

131
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:32,859
He forgot his favorite lotion.
Am I supposed to let him get ashy?

132
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,954
We only hung out together when you were sleeping
or when I said I was going to get a massage.

133
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,897
Well, sometimes you were.

134
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,437
Smell you later.

135
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,453
That is hilarious!

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,066
I know. You know, some people don't think so?

137
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,911
So, how's Mrs. Gallin doing after her surgery?

138
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,248
Incision's clean, she's afebrile
and her vital signs are stable.

139
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:58,395
Time to put on my Cheery Patient Face.

140
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,290
There it is.

141
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,341
I'm Dr. Reid.

142
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,631
I've never actually had a chance to work with you before.

143
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,224
- Are you enjoying it here?
- Oh God, no. Are you?

144
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,018
Not ever. I like you.

145
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,310
I like her.

146
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:19,744
Something's wrong here.

147
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,985
So anyway, I start at St. Vincent's
at the end of the month.

148
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,195
What are you doing with Vincent? I wasn't listening.

149
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,041
- Never mind.
- Vincent's my hairdresser.

150
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,147
Well, it's good to be near your son.

151
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:33,725
I still toy with the idea of moving up to Seattle

152
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,492
to be closer to Harrison's bordello.

153
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,783
Harrison has dropped all pretense.

154
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,168
He's a manwhore now.

155
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:43,046
Oh, there's good money in that,
especially if you do the naughty stuff.

156
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,384
- Give my love to Vincent.
- Oh, I will.

157
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:48,968
- Hey, weirdo!
- Yes?

158
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,512
You must be excited
that your little nemesis is going.

159
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,674
No, I'm not. I finally have my life in order.

160
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,595
I've got my wife, I've got my Brain Trust,

161
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:00,063
and I finally tricked Johan in the gift shop
into accepting my new fake currency.

162
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,398
Then Dorian comes along and upsets the status quo.

163
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,437
I will bet you five bendels
that other people follow suit.

164
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,737
Change begets change begets change.

165
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,114
- You just gave me a great idea.
- Hit me.

166
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:12,728
From now on, anytime someone's really boring me,

167
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:14,911
- I'm just gonna get up and leave.
- I don't like it.

168
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:17,398
Well, Jordan, I think ...

169
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:19,474
Well played.

170
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,211
I think she's bleeding internally.
You two stay with the patient.

171
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,573
Barbie and I are going to figure out
what the hell happened.

172
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,885
Derek, I need you to do a head-to-toe
CT scan on Mrs. Gallin, stat.

173
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,678
- I'm on it.
- "Stat"?

174
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,640
You don't talk like that.
Is that a new Chief of Surgery word?

175
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,101
- J.D., stop it.
- Should I stop it, stat?

176
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,977
- Seriously.
- Seriously, stat?

177
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,272
- Everything is stat! Stat, stat, stat. Stat!
- Are you done?

178
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,816
I'm done. Stat.

179
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,654
Your young Denise gave Mrs. Gallin
a full post-op dose of heparin.

180
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,032
That's why she's bleeding.
Time to play "Crush the Intern".

181
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,746
Well, let's give Denise a break on this one.

182
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,296
She's having a bit of a self-confidence crisis.

183
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,158
Will you do me a personal favor
and cover my patients?

184
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:01,999
Because I'm gonna bake her some cookies.

185
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,950
Just let me handle Denise, okay?

186
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:07,130
Think of all the time you'll have to go
be a jackass to other people.

187
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,345
Fair enought. But she doesn't get to skate.

188
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:12,927
A mistake was made. Someone has to go
face the patient and take the blame.

189
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,435
Fine.

190
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:20,449
Okay, since we're both going the same way,
would you mind dropping back a few steps
so we don't have to walk together?

191
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:21,821
Glad to.

192
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,481
Thanks for having us over for dinner last night.

193
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:28,317
Oh, hey, next time you guys do a couples thing,
I'll tag in.

194
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:30,069
Are you seeing someone, Todd?

195
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,572
Actually, I'm getting pretty serious
with the Hendersons.

196
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,451
Oh, good. They're nice.

197
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:40,997
Yeah, they are.

198
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,960
We should go, Gooch.
The men have their Brain Club meeting.

199
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,095
It's Brain Trust, hon.

200
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:48,218
Trust - told you 20 times.

201
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,298
Whatever.

202
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,508
Let's call this meeting to order.

203
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:56,616
Since I didn't like the way that
Doug said "here" during roll call yesterday,

204
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:00,183
he has been replaced,
by Jimmy the overly touchy orderly.

205
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,841
Can I make a motion

206
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,021
that we have to keep our hands to ourselves?

207
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,778
All in favor of hands to yourself?

208
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,573
All opposed?

209
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,464
And since we all know that these votes
are largely ceremonial, the motion passes.

210
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,325
Jimmy, hands to yourself.

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,659
Okay, any announcements?

212
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,257
The Gooch and I are having a great time,

213
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,047
and I know it's quick,

214
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,292
but we're moving in together.

215
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:27,501
The answer's no.

216
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:30,004
It wasn't really a question.

217
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,097
I feel like my hands are gonna explode.

218
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,912
Motion to help out a friend.

219
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:37,470
No. Jimmy, use the table.

220
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,890
- It's firm.
- It's a table.

221
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:43,059
You can't make a life decision like this, okay?

222
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,229
It hasn't even gone through subcommittee.

223
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:48,314
Look, Ted ...
Personal sidebar.

224
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,023
Look, Ted ...

225
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:53,973
Stephanie is great.

226
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,953
And I know the idea of change
is very exciting for some people.

227
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,369
But just slow it down.
No moving in together, okay?

228
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,632
- All right.
- Okay.

229
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,812
Should we end the personal sidebar?

230
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,412
You know, sometimes you think
I'm kind of a strange dude,

231
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,048
and then you come across something likes this.

232
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,799
- I think we should open her up and locate the bleeding.
- Typical surgeon.

233
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,642
I think we should reverse the anticoagulants
and monitor her.

234
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,227
Well, as chief, I think it's very ...

235
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,079
Did you just start a sentence with "as chief"?

236
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,564
Dude, don't do that with me.

237
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,818
As chief, I can start anything with "as chief".

238
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,612
Check it. As chief, I'm way more handsome than you.

239
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,106
Actually, that's not a perfect example,
because it was true before I was chief.

240
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,243
So, as chief, I'm sorry.

241
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,595
You know what? The decision does not need
to be made until tomorrow morning,

242
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,330
so can we agree to talk about it then?

243
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,040
Fine.

244
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,168
Okay. Besides, didn't Carla say
you could come see my new place?

245
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:55,277
Dude, you said this place was 37 minutes away.
We've been driving for an hour.

246
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,080
What do you want? There was traffic.

247
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,699
How do you think farmer Hewitt gets
these blueberries to taste so sweet?

248
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:05,489
I don't know. He says he uses a special manure
that his son helps him make.

249
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,816
I didn't really want to know more.

250
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,842
<i>They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

251
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:15,238
<i>The problem is, it's only a matter of time</i>

252
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:17,473
<i>before the smile gets wiped off your face.</i>

253
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,950
<i>Sometimes because the wrong person
is taking the blame.</i>

254
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,378
Mrs. Gallin, it's my fault that this happened,

255
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,078
and I'm very sorry.

256
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,622
It- it's okay.

257
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,519
<i>Sometimes because your friend ignored you.</i>

258
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,314
Oh my God! I can't believe
we're moving in together!

259
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,903
Believe it, Gooch!

260
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,283
<i>Still, not even the three hours
I spent last night vomitting blueberries</i>

261
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>could take my smile away.</i>

262
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:49,643
- Where is Mrs. Gallin?
- In surgery.

263
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,563
What the hell? I thought we agreed to talk about it.

264
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:53,850
We did.

265
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:57,360
But then I made the call - you know, as chief.

266
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,785
When I walk by in a huff, you better look.

267
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:13,876
- I ain't lookin'.
- You will look at my huff walk!
- No!

268
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:23,891
I said the other blonde stick
had to take the blame for Mrs. Gallin.

269
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,448
No, you said "someone" had to.

270
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,592
"Someone" did,
and Mrs. Gallin accepted my apology,

271
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,414
so we are coolio.

272
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,153
Oh, man, is that your betrayal stare?

273
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:42,822
Let it burn.

274
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:45,900
Oh, it's burning!

275
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,208
You know, you're making this difficult.

276
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:57,378
Seriously?

277
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,588
It says I'm ready for anything.

278
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,592
Look, I don't know if it's the pregnancy hormones
or whatever, but I need you right now.

279
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,815
- Need me for what?
- "Need you" need you.

280
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,461
Lose the pants.

281
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,334
Done.

282
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,061
Occupied!

283
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,069
No. This was the plan.

284
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,822
- You need to talk.
- Aw, man!

285
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,659
- Why'd you tell me to take my pants off then?
- Sorry. I got caught up in it.

286
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:32,583
- You got caught up in it, too, right?
- Oh, you need me to say yes, don't you?

287
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,766
-  I got so caught up in it.
- I know. I know you did.

288
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,041
Now talk.

289
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,076
- Man, put your pants back on!
- I'm not ready yet.

290
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,096
Did Dr. Reid get a chance
to talk to you about Mrs. Gallin?

291
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:52,099
Yeah, she explained my mistake
and she told me it was a pretty common one.

292
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,762
Did she also get a chance to tell you

293
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:57,021
that we're passing out the World's Worst Doctor Awards
and that you're a finalist?

294
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,607
- You don't have to be such a jerk about it.
- Oh, thanks.

295
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,621
Your tiny surgeon brain may now go back
to its regularly scheduled programming.

296
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,822
He's not gonna stop until you go.

297
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,039
Look, I know I messed up. Dr. Reid just told me
not to sweat it too much since I'm so hard on myself.

298
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,001
See, as you almost killed someone,

299
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:19,342
if you do feel the urge to "sweat it",

300
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,379
you go ahead an jump on that.
You damn sure earned it.

301
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,250
I just bought this yogurt, and for change,

302
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,068
they gave me this thing
that said "three bendels" on it.

303
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,699
That's worth about 40 cents.

304
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,018
Hey, sweat stain! How's it goin' with your girlfriend,
now that you guys are roomies?

305
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,521
Oh, we're having sex, like, all the time.

306
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:43,817
Why do people react like that
when they picture me having sex?

307
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:44,985
You try it!

308
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,822
- Oh, God!
- Not a pretty sight, is it?

309
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,115
Still, Ted made me think.

310
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:55,538
Maybe J.D. an I should just go for it
and move in together, you know?

311
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,498
And change begets more change.

312
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,577
I've been missing being a doctor so much,
I've been thinking about working locum tenens - 

313
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:03,879
you know, temporary family practice stuff.

314
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,089
More change.

315
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,802
You're going back to work?

316
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,552
With a second baby, I don't think
I can be a nurse full-time.

317
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,970
More change.

318
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,890
Do you think it would drive Perry crazy
if I adopted a couple of Asian kids?

319
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:16,976
OK, that's it.

320
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,445
- Nobody move!
- Excuse me.

321
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,690
Okay, yes, she can move, but that's
'cause she asked permission earlier.

322
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:25,451
- When?
- It was before you all got here.

323
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,455
She- I- I said I might say "nobody move",
and if so, you better not move,

324
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,091
and she said "Yeah, but I gotta move just-
just over there. I'm still listening."

325
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:34,410
I said, "Oh, that's cool, 'cause we're
good friends. I'll see you later."
She said, "Yeah, definitely. Let's do something fun."

326
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,756
What do you want?

327
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,311
I want you to stop changing your lives, okay?

328
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:40,704
We've been conditioned to think
that change is good and exciting.

329
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:43,502
Well, what if it's not?
What if it's actually bad and very, very dangerous

330
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,131
Hey, noboday move! Nobody mo-

331
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:50,384
You can move. No one cares about you.

332
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:54,249
Honey, how would you feel about my sister
and her son living with us for a while?

333
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,086
Outstanding.

334
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,312
- Why are we fighting?
- I don't know.

335
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,606
I can't believe you're leaving.

336
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,482
I know.

337
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm the new Chief of Surgery, you know,
and you're Dr. Cox's number two guy.

338
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,447
I thought eventually we'd be running
this place together.

339
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,324
<i>How cool would that be?</i>

340
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,484
I love how you two have kept everything
in the hospital the same -

341
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,541
except for the free pudding.

342
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,921
Sorry baby, but the free pudding's for us.

343
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,758
Turk, you made a mess.

344
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:32,926
Let him out!

345
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:42,728
Janitor eat?

346
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,690
Janitor clean.
Janitor only clean.

347
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:49,943
Eat?

348
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:51,987
Clean?

349
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,957
Pretty awesome.

350
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,409
- What is your problem?
- I'm glad you asked.

351
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,606
Because it seems no matter where I go in this dump,
this unbelievably annoying doctor,

352
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,460
Elliot "Somebody",
keeps coming up to me and talking to me ...

353
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,224
Why would you torch Denise?
You know her confidence is shot.

354
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,757
Plus, the other day, you even said you liked her,
and I know that you were just kidding around,

355
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:16,845
but you never said you liked me,
even as a joke.

356
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,139
- I like you.
- Really?
- No.

357
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,557
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

358
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:24,019
You know what I don't get?
You've alway protected the interns.

359
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,021
I mean, you've alway been their teacher first.

360
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,520
Why in God's name should I waste my time and energy
whipping some intern into shape

361
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,089
when I know damn sure that as soon
he gets the first opportunity,

362
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,790
he is just gonna blow right out of this dump?

363
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,155
Oh, "he's ..."

364
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,699
Okay, now I get it.

365
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,619
Why don't you just tell him that you're sad
that he's leaving, like a normal human being?

366
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,246
What are you talking about?

367
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,623
Come on, Perry.

368
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,541
We both know who you're really mad at.

369
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,962
So I'll work somewhere else.
We'll still hang.

370
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,821
J.D., that's not a 37 minute drive.

371
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,093
It's an hour and 15 minute drive, round-trip.

372
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,837
And I got a wife,
I got a kid,

373
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,640
I got a kid on the way,
I got a new job ...

374
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm in the same boat.

375
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:05,728
It's a good boat to be in, though, right?

376
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,941
So we'll see each other when we can.
How about tonight?

377
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,588
We'll act sulky
so the girls think we need to talk more.

378
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm in.

379
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:19,037
I'm gonna miss your skinny white butt.

380
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,035
I'm gonna miss your perfect round one.

381
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,789
You wanna pull your pants up first?

382
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,058
I'm still not ready.

383
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,760
Guys, you know the rules.
If you're gonna hook up in here, put a sock on the door.

384
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,513
Come on.
I know a secret place.

385
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,697
<i>Remember when you were a kid and your family moved</i>

386
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,407
<i>and how you always wanted someone to blame
for all those big changes?</i>

387
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:50,974
- You're still working here for a few more weeks, right?
- Yep.

388
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,581
I'm gonna make 'em special!

389
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,569
<i>Luckily, most of us finde the courage
to tell friends that we'll miss them.</i>

390
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,208
Good night, Dr. Cox.

391
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:04,450
<i>Or not.</i>

392
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,299
<i>Still, what I remember most
is that leaving parts of my life behind</i>

393
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,560
<i>alway ended up hurting more than I thought.</i>

394
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,998
No, Turk. Don't sweat it, man.

395
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,351
If Izzy's alone,
you can't leave her.

396
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,527
Hmm, I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

397
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:26,846
We'll just hang out another time.

398
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,745
All right, man. Right.

399
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,828
He can't make it?

400
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:00,991
The ukulele makes me horny.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
