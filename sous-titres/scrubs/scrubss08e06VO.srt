1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:03,408
<i>(j.D.) there's nothing worse
than running into a sworn enemy</i>

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:06,344
<i>First thing in the morning.
Well, if that's the case, fred,
just put him on blood thinners.</i>

3
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:08,513
Excuse me, perry.
You don't have a phone.

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:12,650
You're just holding
your hand to your ear.
Fred, I gotta go. He's gonna
make me talk to him.

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,287
Sure, I'll--I'll pass it on.
Fred says you are a tool.

6
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:18,356
I got nothing.
That's a good one.

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:21,159
Heck, yeah.
Still no
chief of medicine, huh?

8
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:24,195
You must love not having anybody
around to make you tow the line.

9
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:26,464
It's pretty much
a captainless ship around here.

10
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:29,434
People showing up late,
stealing supplies...

11
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,302
Basically doing
whatever the hell they want.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,339
Okay, as you can see,
we've repaired the perforation.

13
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:36,341
Now all that's left to do
is sew up

14
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,277
The surrounding muscle tissue.
Are there any questions?

15
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,414
I don't think
you're doing this right.
Get outta here.

16
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,015
All right.
Let me just touch his heart.

17
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,784
Hey!

18
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,486
Bottom line--if we don't get
a new boss in this place soon,

19
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:52,123
It'll fall apart.
I'd pretend to care,
but I don't have to.

20
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,592
Here's my office.
Okay, fine.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,095
You go ahead and have fun
spending your golden years

22
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:00,465
At a depressing coffee chain
surrounded by--
I don't mean to cut you off,
perry,

23
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,667
But I have to take this call.

24
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:06,471
Look at that.
He brought it back.

25
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,306
Ctor.

26
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,942
Oh, no.
That can't be good.

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,445
<i>I was still trying
to get my intern jo</i>

28
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>To be more sensitive
with her patients.</i>

29
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:18,450
Don't worry, mr. Hapsburg. A lot
of people are afraid of needles.

30
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:20,952
I was only surprised
because you're the first one

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,988
I've come across
that doesn't have a vagina.

32
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,891
Did you know
that guy was a priest?

33
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,927
I did.
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

34
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:31,863
If you're not here, I'll just
assume that demons dragged you

35
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:34,366
Down to hell
to chew your face off.

36
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,334
<i>Now that
I was dating elliot again,</i>

37
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,703
<i>I finally had something
to get home to.
Hey.</i>

38
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,072
Hi.
(piano notes play)

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,676
Why diyou put
my piano mat here?
I was here all by myself,
and I got a little freaked out.

40
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,145
So I thought I'd use that
as a burglar alarm.

41
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,214
(plays lazlo bane's
"I'm no superman")

42
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,182
That's catchy.

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,817
Cookies are done.

44
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,286
I baked a dozen for you
and a dozen for me.

45
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:58,189
Now I like to eat one and a half
cookies every day

46
00:01:58,257 --> 00:01:59,824
So that a dozen cookies
last eight days.

47
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:02,594
Well, ten days because I don't
eat sugar on wednesdays,

48
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:05,597
And on sundays I call my mom,
and she asks what's wrong with

49
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:09,367
My phone because I sound fat.
Anyway, I'm gonna go change.

50
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:12,637
I brought my cookie pants.
(door opens and closes)

51
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:14,673
Notice the loose waist

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,542
To accommodate
an expanding stomach.

53
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,978
I finished my dozen.

54
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,280
Why would you eat
all of your cookies at once?

55
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,582
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen to them?

56
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,284
(glass shatters)

57
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:35,427
Come to daddy.

58
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:37,729
Still pretty smoky.

59
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:42,701
(singsong voice) worth it.

60
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:44,369
(thud)

61
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,604
So he'd kill us?

62
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:48,606
I told turk
you were making cookies.

63
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,343
Plus he has a key to my place,
and carla's out of town.

64
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,844
Elliot, with his diabetes,

65
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,380
It's the only time
he gets to eat sweets.

66
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,315
I'm dating an idiot.

67
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:00,051
Yeah, but you knew
what you were gettin' into.

68
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,289
(door creaks open)

69
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:06,591
(piano mat
plays cending arpeggio)

70
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,360
J.D.,
someone's in the house.
(clatter)

71
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:12,030
Turk, get outta here!
(piano mat plays
descending arpeggio)

72
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,298
(door closes)

73
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:19,037
Pull that piano crap on me?
(scoffs) please.

74
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,240
(lazlo bane) ¶ I can't do this
all on my own ¶

75
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:24,075
¶ no, I know ¶

76
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:31,216
¶ I'm no superman ¶

77
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,384
¶

78
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,219
Morning, sleepy.
Mm.

79
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:38,156
I gotta go to work. I wish
I had the day off, too.

80
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:41,826
Hey, do you realize that we've
already been dating for a week,

81
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:44,229
But we still haven't had sex?

82
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,998
Yes, but you know what?
We're not gonna rush this time.

83
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:50,969
We're just gonna
go with the flow.
I think we should
do it right now.

84
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,406
J.D., why are you throwing
your pants at me?

85
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,574
Because I got excited.
Whoo-hoo!

86
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,076
Well, you should be,

87
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,011
Because tonight
when you get home,

88
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,014
I'm going to be waiting here,
and it's gonna be

89
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,450
The most amazing,
crazy night you've ever had.

90
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:08,853
Stop throwing
dirty clothes at me!
Stop saying sexy things.

91
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,957
Can't wait for tonight.
(grunts)

92
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:16,528
I really wish
I hadn't have done that.

93
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,797
Yeah, me, too.

94
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:21,499
<i>Mr. Lawton, one of my favorite
patients, was back.</i>

95
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,436
<i>Unfortunately,
jo was his intern.</i>

96
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,005
Hi.
How's it going over here?

97
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:29,941
Well, young dr. Mahoney was just
observing that my heart disease

98
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,111
Was, uh, uh,
what was that, sweetheart?
A giant buzzkill.

99
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:36,147
Jo.
What? I was on cloud nine
this morning--

100
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,116
Had a good night's sleep,
hot shower,

101
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,118
Big ol' pancake breakfast.

102
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:43,021
Then bang,
chronic heart disease. Buzzkill.

103
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,457
Well, I-I'm sure
mr. Lawton feels horrible

104
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:48,460
That his condition
annoyed you.
I doubt it.

105
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:51,329
She doubts it. Okay, well, other
than the abdominal discomfort,

106
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,665
Everything okay, sir?
Well, I'd feel better

107
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,667
If this bed were
a little more comfortable.

108
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:57,969
Oh.
Here, lean up. Lean up.

109
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,739
Oh! Thank you. And I'm sorry
if I ruined your day.

110
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:04,843
Eh, we're cool.
Apparently,
you guys are cool.

111
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,911
Yeah.

112
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,147
Sure, I can come in then.

113
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:12,717
Thank you.

114
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:15,053
That was just the board.

115
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,822
They're offering me
the chief of medicine job.

116
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,058
Shut up!
Yeah.

117
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,060
Do you know what this means?

118
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:25,063
That when I ask our nanny how
she manages to raise her own kid

119
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,365
Without a nanny,
I can hire a second nanny

120
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:31,336
To listen
to her boring answer.

121
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,872
Perry, look at yourself.

122
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,675
You don't get
in your own way anymore.

123
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:41,913
Sweetie, I am
so, so proud of you.

124
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,381
Thank you.

125
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,518
I'm feeling so open
and vulnerable

126
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:49,754
That it's literally filling me
up with rage and hatred.

127
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,223
So I should go.
Fair enough.

128
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,025
Okay.

129
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,496
Say, I heard you and barbie
were back together again.

130
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,298
How's that going?

131
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,834
<i>He doesn't care. Don't answer.
Is there
less drama this time?</i>

132
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,103
<i>Hold firm.
Does it feel different?</i>

133
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,738
<i>Give him nothing.</i>

134
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:09,040
Look at you,
not getting sucked in.

135
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:12,143
Maybe you are a little bit older
and a little bit wiser,

136
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,081
<i>Enough for this whole thing to
work out with barbie this time.</i>

137
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:18,049
I really think I am.

138
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:21,086
Oh, my god. How do you not get
that I will never, ever care

139
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,355
About
your pasty white love life?

140
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,857
I only brought it up
because I noticed that barbie

141
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,959
Wasn't here at work today,
and I was hoping that

142
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:30,228
Your relationship with her
had already gone so far south

143
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:33,298
That you'd killed her and buried
her deep in a wooded area

144
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:36,134
And that soon
you would be carted off

145
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,536
For the aforementioned crime
of pasty white passion.
No, no such luck.
She's just at home.

146
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,939
(scoffs) carla, why won't you
pick up? I need to talk!

147
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,041
I cannot believe that
you leave the country

148
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,443
The week
I get back together with j.D.

149
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:47,412
I feel like
that's not a coincidence. Wait.

150
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,948
Didn't mean that. I know
that your aunt did not fal

151
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,450
Out of that balloon on purpose.
Anyway, I promised j.D.

152
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,886
This crazy sex night,
and now I'm totally losing it.

153
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,389
I've been trying on lingerie,
but nothing fits,

154
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,425
Because I ate an entire batch
of cookie dough with a spala.

155
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,094
Plus at my last appointment
I got in a fight with my waxer,

156
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,096
And now there is a rash
on my bajingo that looks like

157
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,098
A thousand tiny spider bites.
Damn it, carla!

158
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,401
I need tonight to be special,
and you're not there for me.

159
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,902
And I know what
you're gonna say.

160
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,570
You're gonna say that--
that you've always come through

161
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,572
And that sometimes I'm selfish,
but even if that's true,

162
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,574
I don't need to hear
your attitude right now,

163
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:18,576
Because I am sick of it.
Do you hear me? Sick of it!

164
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,145
I love you. Call me.
(beep)

165
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:23,081
What can I say? I just wish
you were at home with her.

166
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,549
You and me both.

167
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:26,084
That was an insult.

168
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,353
I know. I thought if I took it
as a compliment,

169
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:31,556
It would drive you insane
and you'd go away.
Damn it!

170
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,558
Hey, j.D., because of
the abdominal discomfort,

171
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,528
I was thinking of ordering
an endoscopy on mr. Lawton.

172
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,531
Yeah?
No, no, he had
the same symptoms before.

173
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,533
It turned out
it was just heartburn.

174
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,768
An endoscopy's a really painful,
invasive procedure.

175
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:46,037
Who gives a crap?

176
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,340
Oh, I don't know, uh, jo.
I-I think I do.

177
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:50,742
Probably sounds crazy to you.

178
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,610
Not crazy.
Just a little weird.

179
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,112
Okay, no more sugarcoating,
all right?

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,114
You will never be
a good doctor

181
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,450
Until you learn what it means
to truly care for your patients.

182
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:00,719
And if I don't start
seeing some changes soon,

183
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:03,221
You're gonna be out
on your ass, all right?

184
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,824
There's your buzzkill.
Go back to work.

185
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,960
<i>Careful. Keep your badass
doctor stare going</i>

186
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,629
<i>In case she looks back.</i>

187
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:18,003
<i>(singsong voice) nailed it.</i>

188
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,373
Bob, what are you
doing up here? Are you sick?

189
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,110
No. I'm just taking a stroll,
but thanks for your concern.

190
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,612
Oh, I'm not concerned.
I-I meant to sound hopeful.

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,981
Let me try it again.
Are you sick?

192
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,517
Perry, why are you hating
this morning?

193
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:36,087
I just came up here because
I heard the board offered you

194
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,589
The chief of medicine.

195
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:39,991
They did.
It's a great opportunity.
It certainly is.

196
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,794
The minute I took that job,
everything got bigger--

197
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:46,631
My office, my staff,
my secretary's hooters.

198
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:49,167
They were a christmas bonus...
For both of us.

199
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,737
Still, I took the job
to improve patient care,

200
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,673
But you spend
most of your time

201
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,341
Dealing
with bureaucratic garbage.

202
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,343
And what with
the budget meetings

203
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,345
And addressing staff
and patient complaints,

204
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,947
You barely have time
for a life.

205
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,949
And what is your reward?

206
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:07,285
Everybody in the hospital
hates you. Yay!

207
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:10,121
Anyway, chief,
congrats again.

208
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,259
Hey, with carla and izzy
out of town,

209
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:17,262
Must be nice to have the place
to yourself for once, huh?

210
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,197
Dude, I can't answer that.

211
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:22,200
How many people here are spies
and are ordered to report

212
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:24,903
Everything I say
back to carla?

213
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,339
I should go.

214
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:30,709
I love my wife,
and I wanna be by her side

215
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,712
At all times! All times!

216
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,213
You heard that, rochelle?

217
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,449
(whispers) psst!
Turk, come here.

218
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:42,587
Elliot, are you sick?
No, I just don't have
makeup on.

219
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,789
You look pretty.

220
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,825
Turk, I need some help
with j.D.
Okay.

221
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:49,694
You guys are back together.
I get that. It's great.

222
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:52,630
You're a fit. I just don't wanna
get caught in the middle again.

223
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:54,632
Well, you should've
thought of that

224
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,468
Before you jacked
all my cookies. You're in.

225
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:57,969
Stupid sweet tooth!

226
00:09:58,037 --> 00:10:00,105
Dr. Reid,
when did you become homeless?

227
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,207
Uh, these are just
my cookie pants.

228
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,442
Oh, these are
my muffin slacks. Bam!

229
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,545
I've been rocking these bad boys
since the day I retired.

230
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,080
Huh.

231
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:11,716
Where's mr. Lawton?

232
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,485
He's getting an endoscopy.

233
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:15,954
Jo, please tell me
you didn't order that procedure

234
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:18,289
Even though
I told you not to.

235
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:21,259
Well, I did, so that kind of
puts me in a pickle.

236
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:24,262
Okay, I-I am so angry right now.
I-I don't even know what to say.

237
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,264
You gotta give me a second.

238
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,700
<i>I knew exactly what to say,
but the longer I waited,</i>

239
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,702
<i>The more I knew
it would make her squirm.</i>

240
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,704
<i>See, there's a lot of things</i>

241
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,573
<i>That can leave someone
speechless.
How'd the meeting go, chief?</i>

242
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,043
<i>Is it official?
It can be an answer
you don't expect.</i>

243
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,679
I didn't go.
I don't want the job.

244
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:45,784
Just tell me this one thing,
and then I'll leave you alone.

245
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:49,287
<i>Or a question you wi
you didn't know the answer to.
If you had to come up</i>

246
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,790
With the ultimate
sexual experience for j.D.,

247
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:54,426
What would it be?

248
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,428
<i>For jo, it was just gonna be</i>

249
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,430
<i>A good, old-fashioned
verbal beat-down.</i>

250
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,432
I don't know who
you think you are,

251
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,068
But I promise you, you are
gonna regret this mistake

252
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,070
For the rest of your--
sorry to interrupt.

253
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,906
Great call ordering
that endoscopy, dr. Mahoney.

254
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:16,081
Mr. Lawton
has stomach cancer.

255
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,849
<i>To make things right.</i>

256
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,417
Jo, I'm sorry.

257
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,920
I thought you were being
callous with mr. Lawton,

258
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,957
<i>And you were just being
thorough.
God, I'm a good apologizer.</i>

259
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,460
From now on,
I'm gonna stop riding you

260
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,262
And let jo be jo.
Sound good?

261
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,365
<i>No. Sounds great.</i>

262
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,866
Why would you apologize?

263
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:38,803
What the hell
is your problem?! Uhh!

264
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,272
Ha ha. Reminds me of what
my grandpa taught me

265
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,108
When I was a boy.

266
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:46,111
He said, "janitor, every time
an angry woman storms out,

267
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,013
Another angry woman
storms in."

268
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,848
What?

269
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,417
Get out of my way.

270
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:55,120
Hmm. That one's for you,
pop-pop.

271
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:58,356
He's not dead.
He's upstairs... Dying.

272
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:02,527
Excuse me.
Dr. Kelso, isn't it?

273
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:03,962
I'm jordan sullivan.

274
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,697
What are you doing?

275
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,666
I'm introducing myself,
because clearly,

276
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,669
Anyone who would convince perry
not to take the chief job

277
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,037
Has never met me.

278
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:15,407
That pansy-ass little
tattletale.

279
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,375
Bob, so help me god,
you fix this,

280
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,678
Or I will grab you
by your muffin top

281
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:21,646
And stomp
on your withering man parts

282
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,415
Until your eyes pop out.

283
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:26,484
20 years ago, I would have
thrown you on this table

284
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:28,687
And made love to you
right here.

285
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,922
<i>And I would have loved it!
(groans)</i>

286
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,924
See? That is
the kind of passion

287
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:34,926
That I want tonight
with j.D.

288
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:37,429
But we've hooked up
so much in the past,

289
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,431
I can't come up
with anything new.

290
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,434
Ooh, what if I dripped
hot candle wax on his chest?

291
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,436
No, tina two-kids tried it

292
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:46,438
And burnt off
his treasure trail.

293
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,373
Okay. Okay.
Let's just keep spitballing.

294
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,375
What if I strangle him
a little?

295
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:52,377
No. J.D. Might like
the idea of that,

296
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,879
But if he loses too much
oxygen, he'll get dizzy,

297
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,882
And then his space needle
will become his space noodle.

298
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,485
How do you even know that?
Elliot, I just do!

299
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:03,188
Matter of fact, I don't wanna
talk about this anymore,

300
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,190
All right? I'm out.
Angry woman out.

301
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,758
Damn it!

302
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:13,965
Angry woman in.
You better not be making me one
of your stupid janitor jokes.

303
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,333
No, ma'am.

304
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,636
Angry woman out.

305
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:24,576
(exhales deeply)

306
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:26,611
Hey, I'm glad I found you.

307
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,614
Uh, I need your approval
to cut down some lollipop trees

308
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:32,417
Outside the sea-monkey hut.
What are you talking about?

309
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,386
These decisions
have to go through you

310
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,922
Because you're
the mayor of crazytown.
Okay, I really
don't need this right now.

311
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,425
Okay, fine, but you're
supposed to be working,

312
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:43,094
So would you mind checking
the patient in bed six

313
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:44,729
<i>For dementia?
This is bed six.</i>

314
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:47,866
I know. I think you're crazy.
It was a twofer. Pa-pow!

315
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,302
You're aware I could
kick your ass, right?
I'm sure I'd get in
some slaps.

316
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,304
Look, I know I'm horrible
with patients,

317
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,740
But I make one lucky call
with mr. Lawton's endoscopy,

318
00:13:55,808 --> 00:14:00,211
<i>And now you're not gonna
push me anymore to be better?
Okay, you're not the mayor
of crazytown.</i>

319
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,815
You're the emperor.
At least when you gave me crap,
I knew you were trying to help,

320
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:06,317
But now you're just
giving up on me?
What do you care?
You don't even listen to me.

321
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:08,153
What?
I've been busting my ass

322
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,021
Trying to be more caring
with the patients.

323
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,590
Remember when mr. Lawton
was uncomfortable?

324
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:15,894
Oh, thank you, doctor.

325
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,229
That must have been
so hard for you.

326
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:21,333
Yeah, I'm still mad
thinking about it.

327
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:26,171
What's with the yarn?
I'm gonna use it later.

328
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,173
Oh, by the way,
jordan thinks I'm hot.

329
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,175
Yeah, she mentioned that before.
It's disturbing.

330
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:32,177
Why aren't you
taking the job, perry?

331
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,678
You said it was
a bureaucratic nightmare,

332
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,680
And I don't want
to be miserable.
You love being miserable.

333
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:38,383
I don't want everyone
to hate me.
Everybody already hates you.

334
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,385
You wanna know
the real reason why

335
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,854
You don't want the gig, champ?
Because you're a fraidy-cat.
Beg your pardon?

336
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:45,457
Didn't you hear me?
Are fraidy-cat's ears too tiny?

337
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,792
Don't push me, bob.
You're right. I'm sorry.

338
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,728
Would it make you feel
any better

339
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:51,696
To bat this around
for a while?

340
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,298
(groans)

341
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:57,902
See, I told you I was
gonna use it later.

342
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,005
Do you know why
I got into medicine?

343
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,507
I assumed there was
some sort of flyer

344
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:03,908
Outside football practice.

345
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,643
(laughs sarcastically) no.

346
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:08,146
Look, I don't care
that I'm not that feminine.

347
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,648
I still look rockin' hot
when I'm naked

348
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:12,984
So I can get it
whenever I want it.

349
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:14,819
<i>Okay, now that was feminine.
Shut up.</i>

350
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,223
I became a doctor because I love
the nuts and bolts of it all.

351
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,059
Like that woman over there--
I am fascinated

352
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,862
By the way her heart pumps
blood through her body

353
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,864
Ke a machine,
the way her axons are covered

354
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:29,067
In a thin layer of myelin like
an insulated electrical wire.

355
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,069
But tell me
to empathize with her,

356
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:33,571
To be totally open
and vulnerable? Ugh.

357
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,074
No, I-I can't even do that
with my own family,

358
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,510
Let alone a total stranger.

359
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:41,680
I'm not sure
I can get past that.

360
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:44,182
What makes you think
you're so special?

361
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,185
Every doctor in this place has
flaws they've been dealing with

362
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:50,188
Since they were a little kid.
Hell, the guy who taught me

363
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:53,191
Is constantly getting
in his own way.

364
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,527
Ah, who needs a promotion
anyway?

365
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,730
I'm dating a girl who's always
fighting her own neurosis.

366
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,098
(knocks on window)

367
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,701
Come on, turk! Talk to me!

368
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,937
And you saw my biggest flaw
in action today.

369
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,907
I was willing to let
a patient I liked

370
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:10,408
Go without an endoscopy

371
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:13,812
Because I wanted to spare him
a painful procedure.

372
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,914
Sometimes I care
a little too much.

373
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,817
Yeah, but that caring thing
has a major upside.

374
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,920
And so does
your cold bitchy thing.

375
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:25,423
It'll protect you from letting
all this stuff weigh you down.

376
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,325
Remember last Monday?

377
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,427
We spent that night
watching a young father

378
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,863
Die of lung cancer.
Do you remember his name?

379
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:33,999
No, um,
not even a little bit.

380
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,768
Jack fremont.

381
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,770
Sometimes I still think
about him,

382
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:41,639
And that
is not a good thing.

383
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,641
(chuckles)
what?

384
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,610
You're so in touch
with your emotions,

385
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,612
And I can't really
get to mine.

386
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,882
It's kinda like I'm the dude
and you're the chick.

387
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,917
I'm not really getting
that simile, jo,

388
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:56,354
But if it works for you,
awesome.

389
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:59,724
So now we know what my deal is.
How you gonna fix it?

390
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,727
I'm not gonna fix anything.
I got my own garbage.

391
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,597
You're gonna do this
on your own.

392
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,165
You're a doctor.

393
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,636
(monitor beeping steadily)
turk, come on. I'm desperate.

394
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:13,638
Elliot, todd and I
are in the middle

395
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:16,508
Of teaching our interns
how to do an appendectomy.

396
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,310
Oh, please, you just cut it out
and sew him up.

397
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,746
She's right, actually.
Finish up.

398
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,783
Look, carla always says that
making love with you is perfect.

399
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,851
(chuckles) yeah, she did.

400
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,853
Tell me what makes it
so special.

401
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:32,724
I mean, she says
that you even cry sometimes.

402
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,392
Thank you for sharing.

403
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,027
That's okay, t-dog.

404
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:39,431
If it doesn't hurt,
you're not doing it right.

405
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:42,400
I just want things to be
different with j.D. This time,

406
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:45,370
To be better.
You wanna know what's so special
about carla and me?

407
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:48,773
That we don't have to try
and make it special. Okay?

408
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,643
We're just connected. If you
want things to be different

409
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:54,312
With j.D. This time around,
you're gonna have to give up

410
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,414
All of that immature,
neurotic over-thinking

411
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,184
And just be with each other.
Todd, hit the button.

412
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:00,352
What button?

413
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,821
(light clicks)

414
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:03,855
Much better.

415
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:05,857
(pounding on window)
(elliot) turk!

416
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:08,426
Oh! That's not right.

417
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:11,129
So this is what fear
feels like, huh?

418
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,333
It's kinda like
being really drunk,

419
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:18,236
Only... In a very sad way.

420
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:22,073
You're just loving watching me
fall apart le this, huh?

421
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:26,011
More than comfy shoes
and a warm place to crap.

422
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:29,114
Yeah.
But you're gonna take
this job,

423
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,116
Partly because
you were meant to do it,

424
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:34,119
But mostly because if you don't,
I will always remind you

425
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,755
That you are
a sac-less little fraidy-cat.

426
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,958
Why in the hell did you try
to talk me out of it?

427
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:42,460
I had to tell you the truth
to prepare you.

428
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:45,463
If I'd fluffed it up, you would
have tortured me forever.

429
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:48,466
So you really think
I'm the man for the job?

430
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:51,770
Who the hell do you think
recommended you?

431
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,205
Thank you.
You're welcome.

Oh, god, no.
What?

434
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:01,780
You don't really think
we're becoming friends, do you?

435
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:03,782
Good lord. I hope not.

436

437
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:07,485
You wanna come over

00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,487
And check out
my hobby shop?

439
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:12,624
Too fast, bob.
Yeah, I knew when I said it.

440
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,160
Oh, good. You're done
with your qut time.

441
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,162
Look, the nurse said
that mr. Lawton's having

442
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:19,164
A bit of a breakdown
about his cancer.

443
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:22,033
I want you to go over there
and help him through it.

444
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:24,035
You really want me
talking to him?

445
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,805
If he cries,
I'm gonna hit him.
Don't mess it up.

446
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,707
Okay.

447
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,709

Still too soon?

456
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,666
Way too soon, bob.

00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,669
<i>And even if some people
can only take a baby step...</i>

458
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:00,171
I can't imagine
what it's like to have cancer,

459
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,708
But I bet it sucks.

460
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:06,978
It totally sucks.

He's not dead.
He's upstairs... Dying.

00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:46,017
(man) is he a patient here?

473
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:49,354
Yeah. He's in the psych ward.
He says he's an owl,

474
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,823
But... (chuckles) you can't

He's on the roof.

(man) why on the roof?

478
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,633
He thinks he's a mountain lion.

when I was a boy.
