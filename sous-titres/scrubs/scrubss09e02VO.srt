1
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:36,073
He's to always wear
a sign that says "number 1."

2
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,342
It signifies that he is
the one med student

3
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,111
For which I have hope.
Thanks. It's a nightmare.

4
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,048
All the best, number 1.

5
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,450
You don't have to wear this.

6
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,953
Look how--look how silly
it looks on me, yeah?

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,955
I hate wearing this so much.

8
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,958
(groans)
he said, "you put that on you,"
and he was yelling.

9
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,960
And I was like,
"okay, don't get mad."

10
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:58,963
But I don't want to wear it.
I don't.

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,299
Guard that, number 1.

12
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,434
No.

13
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,936
You're dangerous, aren't you?
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:08,572
I bet you listen
to rap music.

15
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,876
<i>(lucy) there he is.</i>

16
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,845
<i>No one has sex
with lucy bennett,</i>

17
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:17,414
<i>Takes naked pictures of her
and gets away with it.</i>

18
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,149
Cole.

19
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,653
<i>I'm not sure
I like what you did.
Served!</i>

20
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:26,156
I know I blew any chance of us
being together again,

21
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:28,559
And that kills me.
And I'm sorry.

22
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:32,029
I just... Need to think about
who I am for a second, you know?

23
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:34,832
'sup, boo? What you doing?

24
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,668
I'm making sure these machines
keep this vegetable alive.

25
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:40,671
Man, I wish his family
would just let him die.

26
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,673
Mm, cool, cool.

27
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:46,810
So what are we gonna do
about... This?

28
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:48,812
What the hell are you
talking about?

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,851
I'm talking about this--this
electricity, this spark. Zzt!

30
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,786
Go now.

31
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:57,221
(sighs) okay.

32
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,124
Here's a little secret
about old king cole.

33
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:04,194
The only way to get rid of him
is to sleep with him...

34
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:07,364
(whispers)
until he gets bored with you.

35
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:09,967
Yeah, I'm gonna go get
a wire brush

36
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:13,137
And scrub my skin
till I bleed.

37
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:15,306
All right, class, first order
of business is simple.

38
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:19,076
We're gonna take out our...
J.D., what are you doing?

39
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:21,445
Just watching you teach.
You know, in this light,

40
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:25,115
You look like denzel washington
in "the great debaters."

41
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:27,518
Come on, man. I'm working here.
Now listen. If you--

42
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:30,521
You know that's what I was
going for, right?
It's pretty obvious.

43
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,523
All right, class,
you now have 30 seconds

44
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,426
To list the adductor muscles
of the hip.

45
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:38,696
Your group does not want
to be last. Ready? Go.

46
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:41,932
<i>(j.D.) the pressure here can
make some students crack...
(man) aah!</i>

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,803
Aah!
Amir, you can't just
be grabbing kidneys like that!

48
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,338
Bring it back!

49
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,341
<i>Others found ways
to blow off steam.</i>

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,944
What? What are you doing?
No. Stop. Take it off.

51
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:55,913
I can't. H-he'll know.
He's everywhere.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,083
And the worst part--
drew, I don't care.
I'm losing wood.

53
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,553
<i>And dr. Cox made sure
that the pressure never let up.</i>

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,122
Centerfold, your previous answer
was so wrong,

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,124
It almost became right again.

56
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,693
Now if you would, please help me
choose the subject

57
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,396
For my impending criticism.
Would you like me to nail you

58
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:14,398
For "a," you being
too attractive

59
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,433
To ever be taken seriously
as a doctor,

60
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,402
"b," your upsettingly small ears

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,106
Or "c," that your stupidity is
probably contagious?
I guess
my contagious stupidity.

62
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,641
Great call. Your ears.
Ah ha ha!

63
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,577
Welcome, welcome, number one.

64
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:29,046
Certainly,
with your human-size ears,

65
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:31,081
You can tell us
what the three components

66
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:33,417
Of the mucosa layer
of the stomach are.

67
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:36,587
Epithelium, lamina propria,
muscularis mucosa.

68
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:38,622
That was perfect.

69
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,126
Okay, class, who hates
dr. Cox's favorite student?
(man) I do.

70
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:44,194
Wo it's the first time
you assassins

71
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,398
Have gotten one right all day.

72
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:50,401
<i>There was one bright light
for these kids, though,</i>

73
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,503
<i>And that was me, dr. D.</i>

74
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,038
Hey, bro, the sun is,
like, super bright.

75
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,407
Can you come down?

76
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:59,476
I, like, told you that
the branches are a metaphor

77
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:01,011
For the cardiovascular system,

78
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,147
So no, I cannot come down.

79
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:05,349
Hence, tree class dismissed.

80
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,185
Great class, dr. D.

81
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:10,921
Even better than the one you did
with interpretive dance.

82
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,890
Thanks. I call it
"teacher-tainment."

83
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:15,859
Would you be a doll and get
a message to dr. Turk a.S.A.P.?

84
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:17,861
Tell him I'm stuck
in the tree again,

85
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,764
But this time there appear
to be many bees.
(bees buzzing)

86
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:23,467
Hurry, lucy!
I've got honey hair!

87
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:26,270
Ugh. That tool
cole keeps texting me.

88
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:29,773
"I have a little cole
for your slaw."
so romantic.
You should hit that.

89
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:32,776
At least dr. Cox doesn't make
you send a picture of yourself

90
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:36,413
Every ten minutes
wearing a "number 1" sign.
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

91
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,216
Talking.
No, this feels like sharing,
and it's gross.

92
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:42,052
Drew, I need to be clear about
what it is I'm looking for,

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,288
You know, with us.
Nothing.
Same here.

94
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:47,825
Sorry about the sharing.
Oh, no, no.
It was both of us.

95
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:53,030
Oh, now that's just outstanding.

96
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:56,366
Dude, again?
Finally. Where have you been?

97
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,969
I came as soon as I heard.

98
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:02,306
I thought you said there were
bees. Where are the bees?
They're quiet now, but I think
they're plotting something big.

99
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,844
(gun cocks)
let's get him out of there.

100
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,780
Hell, yeah. Give me a chance
to use old megan fox. Mwah.

101
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:11,815
That's just a tranq gun.
It's an elephant dose.

102
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,918
But don't worry. We cut it
with some diet soda.
Can't we just shake
the tree again?

103
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,553
Go shake.

104
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:19,356
Come on, little white baby.
Jump into my arms.

105
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,659
(grunts) you all right?

106
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:26,163
It's like being held
by a big piece of caramel.

107
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,709
<i>(lucy) you never want to end up
in dr. Cox's eye line,</i>

108
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,579
<i>Because if he sees you,
he makes you do grunt work.
(man) you all right?</i>

109
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,315
Oh, what the french?
Sorry.

110
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,150
I was just hiding
from one of my teachers.

111
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,319
It's a little game we play.

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,022
Really?
No. You can win at games.

113
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:46,691
Got bad news for you,
sweetheart. You lost.

114
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,399
I need you to go ahead
and take mr. Evans' chart here

115
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,901
And make four copies.
Drop one off at my office,

116
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,337
One at my car,
one at the bar that I frequent

117
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:02,306
And then go bury one in the quad
and draw me up a map,

118
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,176
Just in case I want to go on
a treasure hunt later on.

119
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:07,645
Hmm. 10 after.
Goodness gracious.
(cell phone alert chimes)

120
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:10,348
Oh, darn it all.
Now if that ink runs,

121
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,650
I'm gonna have to replace
the whole sign.

122
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,685
Weird. Broken ribs
and a possible ruptureleen?

123
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:18,689
Was mr. Evans in an accident?
Yes, he was in a train wreck
called his life.

124
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,625
You see, alan evans is
a hard-core drunk,

125
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,827
An alkie, a sauce monkey,
a hooch goblin,

126
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:25,830
A man who unwinds
at the end of every single day

127
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:27,632
By treating himself

128
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:30,368
To a delightful garbage bag
full of vodka.
So what are we gonna do?

129
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,336
We're going to get him
out of here,

130
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,339
And then hopefully,
he's gonna die someplace else,

131
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,341
Like in a yard
or somebody's shed.

132
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:46,050
I love teaching.

133
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,922
Mr. Shershow here is
in a massive coma.

134
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:54,158
Even though he can't register
any outside stimulus,

135
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,095
I still want someone to read him
all seven "h potter" books.

136
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,564
Any volunteers?
Cole, thank you.

137
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:03,167
Sorry. No can do. I got
a dinner rezzie with my moms.

138
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:06,003
A rezzie? You also gonna get
your drun and eat some 'za?

139
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:08,506
Nah, I wish.
My mom is lactose-intolly.

140
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,675
For real, though,
she is the best.

141
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,877
When we go out,
she helps me pick up girls.

142
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:14,912
She's my wingmom.

143
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,747
Horrifying.
Look, I don't know

144
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,350
What orlando-based boy band
rejected you,

145
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,919
But you'll do what I tell you.
Yeah, I don't think so.

146
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,255
See,
that's me and my 'rents...

147
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:26,958
(singsongy) at the hospital
groundbreaking.

148
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,593
Wow.
They're
in the major donors club.

149
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:31,662
I got to cut the ribbon
with some big old sizzies.

150
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,631
Long story short...

151
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,566
(chuckles)
I'm untouchable around here...

152
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,401
To everyone except you.

153
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:41,739
Yeah. That just happened.

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,974
(whispers) okay.

155
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:45,843
I know people like alan.
I grew up with them.

156
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:48,112
My uncle frank is
always drunk.

157
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:51,582
He fought the entire band
at my cousin's wedding.
Okay, look.

158
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,085
Alan's an addict, so the first
thing you need to do

159
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:57,355
Is make sure he's ready
for help.
I can't talk to him
about stuff that pernal.

160
00:07:57,356 --> 00:08:00,892
I get embarrassed too easily.
I've never seen myself nude.

161
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,660
I mean, I've been nude,

162
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,529
But I never looked down.

163
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,664
Weird for a doctor,
but okay, fine.

164
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,400
Look, lucy, you have to find
a way to connect with him.

165
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:13,771
I like your perfume.
That's weird, because I've never
worn perfume in my entire life.

166
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,307
Also, I've never seen myself
ked.

167
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:19,577
You know, that was part
of an earlier conversation.

168
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,746
Are you okay?

169
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,315
I'm not great, alan.
Med school is tough.

170
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,185
I don't sleep, and I haven't
eaten anything a week

171
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,120
Except yogurt and wine.

172
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:36,928
Maybe you should take a--
alan, I'm not done.

173
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,530
And just beat him a little,
you know, send a message? What?

174
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,033
Denise, you're scary. I mean,
sure, you seem cute at first,

175
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,402
But then you eat after midnight
or get some water on you,

176
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,837
And then boom,
you turn into this monster,

177
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:50,908
And I gotta throw you
in a microwave and explode you.
What the hell are
you talking about?

178
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,544
You know, you should get your
boyfriend to watch that movie,

179
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,414
And then maybe he could
understand you better.
What boyfriend?

180
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,382
Denise, everybody knows
drew's hitting you.
How?

181
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:00,585
The guy's had sex
near the todd.

182
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:03,688
What? What's going on?

183
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:07,291
Someone's doing it right now,
in that supply closet.

184
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:11,829
(whispers) really?

185
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,998
Still...

186
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,133
Damn it.

187
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,103
How come you don't let him
take his pants off, though?

188
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,307
Man, that was a great cry.

189
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,876
I always feel fantastic
after those.

190
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,813
Hello, world. Lucy's back.
Am I right?

191
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:33,251
Well, you definitely gave me
something to work with.

192
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:35,820
And I look chinese,
but that's really good.

193
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,823
Thank you. I used
to teach high school art.

194
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:40,992
<i>(lucy) oh, my god.
He's opening up.
Oh, yeah.</i>

195
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,629
Yeah, I was married, too,
before everything fell apart.

196
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,498
I tell you what, though--
I definitely don't want

197
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,567
To live this way anymore.

198
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:51,569
Maybe you don't have to.

199
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:55,606
I thought you had dinner plans
with your wingmom.

200
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:58,209
Yeah, she's at the bar, sizing
up the local talent for me.

201
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,911
No! Yeah, I like
more booty than that.

202
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,014
She should know that by now.

203
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,316
I know you feel me.
Yeah, I do.

204
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,652
Is a wingmom what I think it is?

205
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:16,594
Sing to me, wingmom.
Sing me to my dreams.

206
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:18,629
Hello, all.

207
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,998
Hey.
(imitates drew) hello, all.
(scoffs)

208
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,367
(normal voice) I hate that guy.
But you love that guy.

209
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,169
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

210
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,171
What?
I'm not surprised.
You're both dark weirdos.

211
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:30,207
It's like if fonzie
and jo from "the facts of life"

212
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,177
Fell in love with each other.
Oh, I'd watch the hell
out of that show.

213
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,212
Who wouldn't?
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

214
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,081
I like to be an island,
okay?

215
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:39,884
People can visit the island,
but no one gets to stay.

216
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,419
Safer that way.

217
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,688
Do you realize how empty
that sounds?

218
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:47,391
What kind of life is that?
You know, I'd watch a show about
fonzie and a gremlin, too.

219
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:49,327
Mm, fonzie couldn't take care
of a gremlin.

220
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:51,495
He's too busy being cool.
Oh.

221
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,864
Can we stop talking
about this?
You know what you need?

222
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,033
# a water taxi
to your island #

223
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:59,503
# so he can get there,
and you can kiss him #

224
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:02,306
# up on your island,
all chillin' with turtles #

225
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:06,077
# 'cause you're so private,
and now falsetto #

226
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,713
oh, yes, falsetto
* uh-oh, she's leavin' #

227
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,189
Look, alan wants to change,
so I found him a rehab facility.

228
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,393
I just need a doctor
to sign off. Are you in?

229
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,429
<i>And that was the beginning
of a long line of "nos."</i>

230
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,065
<i>I asked all the doctors
in the hospital,</i>

231
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,334
<i>And they all shot me down.</i>

232
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,637
Naive-five!

233
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,408
Someone please wake me
from this nightmare,

234
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,477
Because in my fever dream,

235
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:45,446
I see a med student getting
involved with a patient

236
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:48,416
Who I expressly told her
to ignore mere hours ago.

237
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,986
I cannot tell you how much
I hate to reiterate something,

238
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,555
Especially when I have
already iterated it.

239
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:56,657
You're going to have
to excuse me now

240
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:59,127
Because I must
gather my fury.

241
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:02,597
<i>It's scary to put yourself
out there.</i>

242
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,099
Hey.
Hey.

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,103
Oh, I am having a crapfest
of a day today.

244
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,540
You want to hang out later?
You know, maybe grab a beer?

245
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,343
Grab a beer?
Yeah.

246
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,678
Is that
some kind of euphemism?

247
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,047
Nope. It just means
grab a beer.

248
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,549
Maybe talk a little.

249
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,454
I'm sorry, denise.

250
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,456
I'm, uh...

251
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,758
Just not looking for that.

252
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,193
See you later.

253
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,899
Dr. Cox, while you're
fury-gathering, let me just say

254
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,634
That if alan goes to rehab--

255
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,036
He will do nothing
except figure out

256
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:44,605
How to steal enough
paper cup shooters of mouthwash

257
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,574
To get
one last desperate buzz on.

258
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:48,609
His job is to leave here
and die.

259
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,747
<i>Your job is to listen to
every word I say at all times--</i>

260
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:55,883
And here's the hard part--
actually do those things.

261
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,786
So in the future,
when I tell you to do nothing,

262
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:04,325
I mean nothing, and in case
that is still not clear...
Nothing

263
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,052
I thought being a doctor
was about helping people.

264
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,254
It is, lucy.
Well, that and showing up

265
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:32,224
My third grade teacher who said
I'd never amount to anything.

266
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:35,027
<i>Eat it, mrs. Nickerson.
(j.D.) and rest in peace.</i>

267
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:37,296
All right, I didn't want
to play hardball,

268
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:40,366
But if you don't try to change
dr. Cox's mind about alan,

269
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,702
I will never call you "dr. D."
ever again.
Even in the quad?

270
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:46,572
Especially in the quad.
I'll go talk to dr. Cox
right now.

271
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,776
Dr. Cox said
he'll sign the paper

272
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:53,812
If you can raise the money
to send alan to a rehab center.

273
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:57,516
Dr. D., you rock.
And sometimes I roll.

274
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,886
Aah! Ow!
You twclowns convinced me

275
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,622
To put myself out there,
and drew shot me down.

276
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,791
Why'd you have to go mess up
my little island?

277
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,694
Why'd you push me
towards drew?
He just seems like a nice guy.

278
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,596
Based on what?

279
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:13,766
Want the rest of my nachos?
Oh, hell, yeah!

280
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,201
You like him 'cause
he shared old bar food?

281
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:23,575
Turk and I met
over a bloomin' onion.

282
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:28,681
I will hurt you, little man.

283
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,888
You all right, little lady?
I'm just trying to raise money
for a patient,

284
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:38,724
But it's not going so great.
You know, back in the day

285
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,926
When I did security
for bell biv devoe--

286
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,928
Hey, boss--
shut up.

287
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,898
Copy that.
Anyway, they did their charity
car wash a little differently.

288
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,008
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're all real smart.

289
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,211
Now it's time to get wet.

290
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:01,780
Wow.
Where do I get in line?

291
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,782
Where's your car?

292
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,684
What car?
Full body wax-five.

293
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,187
Buff away, ladies.

294
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:13,692
You know, I don't mean to sound
too forward, but there is

295
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,195
Someone at the hospital
who is really digging you.

296
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,430
Are you hitting on me?
'cause I already went through

297
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:21,633
My bald black dude phase.
Seriously, I did.
I'm talking about
you and denise.

298
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:25,704
Why are you talking about
me and denise?
Because the other night
when we shared the nachos?

299
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,140
Dude, we're na-bros.
Come on.

300
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,943
And that's a special bond--
one which I... Cherish.

301
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,178
I just think
you should go for yours.

302
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,948
(falsetto voice)
¶ go for yours ¶
you don't know me.
I spent the last year

303
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,850
In the askan wilderness,
living in a yurt.

304
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:40,986
The only human contact I had
was an eskboy who sold me

305
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,655
Salmon jerky and painkillers.
And do you know why?

306
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,591
Because when I flunked
out of med school before,

307
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:48,260
I consequently torched
every relationship

308
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,497
That meant anything to me. I'm
not taking that chance again.
What's a yurt?

309
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:56,401
You know, son, I was married
to my enid for 44 years.

310
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,303
And now she's gone.

311
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,038
And the only reason I teach is

312
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,141
So I don't have to be alone
in my house.

313
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,244
You can't wall yourself off
from other people.

314
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,147
You won't make it.
That's some truth
being dropped there.

315
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,048
Great.

316
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,151
So how about you two clear out?

317
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,419
Cindy here's three martinis in,

318
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,790
And I'm about to land
that marlin.

319
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,726
Oh, damn.

320
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:23,862
She was go to go.

321
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,898
Remember, alan,
you can do it.

322
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,534
I can't thank you enough.

323
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,210
<i>(lucy) I knew I'd just changed
alan's life,</i>

00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,546

a big deal out of it.</i>

00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:44,783
<i>As alan the drunk.</i>

327
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:47,953
<i>A man this broken...
I'm just really broken.</i>

328
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:50,055
<i>Needs a woman this strong...</i>

329
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,659
You can do this, alan.
(bottle shatters)

330
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,196
<i>With a mentor
who cares so much.</i>

331
00:16:57,197 --> 00:17:00,365
God, I care so much.

332
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,335
I guess this is good-bye.

333
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,637
No, we can't.

334
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:09,474
I know you're a doctor.
I'm a med student, damn it.

335
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:12,444
Lucy.
Shh.

336
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,963
<i>(lucy) antonio sabato jr.--</i>

337
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,732
<i>My safely ethnic dreamboat.</i>

338
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,601
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

339
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:37,836
<i>I stayed proud of myself
for helping alan.</i>

340
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:41,240
<i>And I wasn't naive. I knew
he had a long road ahead.</i>

341
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,875
<i>But maybe, just maybe...</i>

342
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:45,944
Having someone believe in him
was all he needed.

343
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:48,280
Have I got something
to show you. (grunts)

344
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,384
Honestly, I can't think
of anything

345
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,586
That could make this moment
more delicious.

346
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,955
Alan?
Who are you?

347
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,590
More delicious.

348
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,394
I love when movies end
the way you hope they will.
You saw this coming?

349
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:04,029
Everyone saw this coming.

350
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,566
Not dr. D.
Really? Would you like
to know the deal

351
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,935
Your precious dr. D. Made
with me in my office?

352
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,404
If I agree to do this,

353
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:16,975
You have to promise
that I'll get to be there

354
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,177
I'll do what I can.
Then I'm in.

355
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,113
He even bet me
a triple c-note

356
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:24,049
That alan here
wouldn't make it a week.
I don't believe you.

357
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,084
Hey, big perr, I want
my winnings in all fives

358
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,086
Or my own number 1 sign.
Your call.

359
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,533
How could you do that
to me?

360
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,469
I know you can't see it
right now,

361
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,538
But this is good for you.

362
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:50,142
Yeah, as good
as my mom's fish biscuits.

363
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:52,010
They're bad.
Ah.

364
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,946
Look, lucy,
at--at some point,

365
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:57,616
Every doctor needs to learn
about lost causes like alan.

366
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,786
I just thought I'd come along
for the ride with you.

367
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:03,155
Why?
Because when it happened
to me,

368
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,657
There was no one around
to talk to me about it after.

369
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:08,760
If you're gonna survive
as a doctor,

370
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:11,997
You have to stop trying to
change things you can't change.

371
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:14,800
So I'm supposed to never try
and help anybody like alan?

372
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,803
No. Because if you're gonna
survive as a person,

373
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:21,506
You can never stop trying to
change things you can't change.

374
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:23,075
My head hurts.

375
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,844
(chuckles) get used to it.

376
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,047
I just wanted alan
to end up okay.

377
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,883
You're doing good.

378
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,522
<i>I think what dr. Dorian
was saying--</i>

379
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,791
<i>Although it's never that clear
with him--</i>

380
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,728
<i>Is that you have to keep
putting yourself out there</i>

381
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:45,497
<i>And just hope that you get
something back.</i>

382
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:49,468
Hey, stick.
What's your last name?

383
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,303
Mahoney.

384
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:55,173
I like that. Soou still want
to grab that beer and talk?

385
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:58,110
Not really.

386
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:00,645
But I will.
Great.

387
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,581
I got you something.

388
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,719
Is that cole's mom? (laughs) yeah.
I introduced 'em.

389
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,422
You're gonna hit that,
aren't you?

390
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,591
Like a big rig with no brakes.

391
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,526
Wow. That was disgusting.

392
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,596
Yeah.
Let's get out of here, huh?
Yeah. I could use a drink.

393
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:20,532
I don't really drink anymore.
That's cool. You can drive.

394
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,668
I don't really drive either.
You're weird. I like that.
