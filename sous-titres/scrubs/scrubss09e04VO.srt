1
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:03,576
being in med school

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:05,611
Is kinda like
being in basic training,

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,047
And the professors are like
drill sergeants.

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:10,983
Some rule with an iron fist...
Do you feel
the spit raining down

5
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:14,053
On your face, maggot?!
And will you ever forget

6
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,989
The excessive production of
saliva is a condition known as

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,992
Sia-lor-rhea!
Sialorrhea! Huh!

8
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:22,061
Sir, no, sir!

9
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:24,130
Others carry a big stick.

10
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,566
You wanna become a doctor?

11
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:28,467
Well,
you're gonna have to work.

12
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,436
Work your little scrubs off.

13
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:32,805
is this
the speech from "fame"?

14
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,307
You want fame?

15
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:36,175
Well, fame costs.

16
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:38,678
Our only hope
for getting through it--

17
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,213
Teamwork.

18
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:43,282
Unfortunately, we all
just looked out for ourselves.

19
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:45,885
Cole,
I need the retractor.
I'm using it right now.

20
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:49,155
Seriously?
Yeah. I don't like
touching bread. Creeps me out.

21
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,691
Give him
the stupid retractor!
What?

22
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:53,526
gimme my sandwich!

23
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,333
Who did this?

24
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,975
if you want to
keep sleeping with me,

25
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,510
I expect you
to have my back.

26
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,980
God, you got so many rules!
Get your back,

27
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,983
Listen to you when you talk,
stay out of your purse.

28
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:19,518
Damn, girl.
Quit playing games.

29
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,520
At least
the weekend was coming.

30
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,557
We needed some fun,
and cole was throwing a party.

31
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,058
fame!

32
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,527
this weekend
was gonna be amazing.

33
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:31,631
I was spending it
with the love of my life.
Elliot gone?

34
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,667
Gone. Carla?
Long gone
and took the kids.

35
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,670
Nice! Bro-a-palooza
has offily begun.

36
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:39,438
We're not calling it
bro-a-palooza.

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,775
Why not?
I already made t-shirts.
That's awesome.
Where's mine?

38
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,744
We're not calling it
this is yours!Ro-a-palooza.

39
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:49,015
I've decided to no longer
refer to you two as "pathetic."

40
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:51,984
Well, thanks, perry.
Instead,
since my nephew gave me

41
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,553
My very first thesaurus
as a birthday present,

42
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:57,523
I'm going to allow you
to choose from the following,

43
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,526
If you will--miserable, pitiful,
sorry, wretched, deplorable,

44
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:02,929
Regrettable or... Sad.

45
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,898
"wretched" sounds like dickens.
We'll go with wretched.

46
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,968
Nah, it's just old man doesn't
understand two young guns...

47
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,903
P-p-p-pow!
Out on the town.

48
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,939
He doesn't get
bro-a-palooza.

49
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,308
"8:00 p.M.
To question mark."

50
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:19,478
That means we don't even know
when it ends.
So many things
to tear apart here...

51
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,715
I'll focus on your delusion
that you are still young.

52
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:25,651
You're both much closer to 40
than you are 20.

53
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,120
Let's face it.
You're just like me--

54
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,656
Old, tired and you gotta get up
a lot at night to take a pee.

55
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,792
Is he psychic?
Hey, field hockey,

56
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,994
Your med students
are acting like animals.

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,865
Ugh! You think licking will stop
me? I've eaten out of dumpsters.

58
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:43,736
They're not
my med students.
They are, because
you are their faculty advisor.

59
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,439
You will advise them to start
working together like a team.

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,208
And even more importantly,
you will teach them

61
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,078
To never, ever again
lay their grubby paws

62
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,080
On my glazed doughnut.

63
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:58,484
It is the one sprinkled, sugary
beacon of light left in my life.

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,388
But they're not my students.
Actually, they are,

65
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,290
Because you're their faculty--
student advisor.

66
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,259
So you will advise them
that if they want to

67
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,229
Get through med school,
they have to work together.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,431
Oh, and don't touch doughnuts.
They're beacons of light...

69
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,266
Or whatever.
When did I become
the student advisor?

70
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,236
When you slept with
the faculty advisor.
Your mom's
the faculty advisor?

71
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,171
Joke's on you.
My mom's dead.

72
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:20,673
Really?

73
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,675
You guys
coming to my party?

74
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,677
Yes. I cannot wait
to wear a dress

75
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,579
And have a reason
to actually shave again.

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,081
It is like the friin' amazon
down there.

77
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,650
too far, too far, too far.

78
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:33,652
Gonna be nuts to butts
up in that piece.

79
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:36,522
Big ol' wrangle-dangle!
Yeah, you're making it
sound horrible,

80
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,525
But I'm still gonna go. I need
to have some fun. I've spent

81
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:42,194
The last three weekends
finishing up community service.

82
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,896
I'm sorry.
I was under the impression

83
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,565
You'd all be much younger.

84
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,501
Turns out dinosaur costumes
are extremely flammable.

85
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:50,936
I think we all
need to let loose,

86
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:55,207
And in my case, let lucy.

87
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,576
Oh...

88
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:00,312
Hello, murderers, butchers,
slaughterers, slayers.

89
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,947
I love this thing.

90
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,283
Uh, did you hear
that I was quitting?
I did, ted.

91
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,986
I just haven't really figured
out how to pretend I care yet.

92
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,454
Understandable.

93
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,423
Theodore, I always
assumed that someday

94
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:14,760
We'd just find you dead
in your office.
Yeah, that was the dream.

95
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,630
But the h and I are gonna
take some time off

96
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,399
And tour the country.
We've written a song
for every state.

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,835
I'm sure I'll hear all of them
when I die and go to hell.

98
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,238
Damn elevator.

99
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,626
I'm out.

100
00:04:52,307 --> 00:05:05,940
<i>Sync By: YesCool
www.addic7ed.com</i>

101
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,607
Phase one of bro-a-palooza
starts now.

102
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:13,009
- I'm making quesadillas.
- Pepper jack?

103
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,779
Who you talking to?

104
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,518
I see with your wives
out of town,

105
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,220
You've whipped yourselves
into a lesbian frenzy.

106
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:25,917
What do I need to get, a garden
hose to separate you two?

107
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,315
You can't separate us.
We're attached by fun.

108
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:32,262
And tonighs gonna be awesome.
He just fell from the ceiling.
We're not gonna address that?

109
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,698
Your loser-palooza
is embarrassing,

110
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,500
And I'll be honest with you--
I would have assumed that

111
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,669
Two "hip young guys"
such as yourselves

112
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,972
Would be headed to
the big med school party.
There's a party?

113
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,974
What's the theme--
murder/mystery?

114
00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:48,578
Disco? "star wars"? '60s,
'70s, '80s, '90s? The future?

115
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,613
Please say
it's a "star wars"-themed

116
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,283
Murder/mystery
set in the roaring '20s.

117
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,885
The theme is
cowboys and indians.

118
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,721
yes!
we are there.

119
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,956
Cowboys and indians--
not my first choice.

120
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:01,991
But I do have chaps.

121
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:05,061
I'm liking my new dress.
It makes my boobs look even.

122
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,796
Okay.

123
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:09,365
I'm getting so much
better at making friends.

124
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:12,635
Boom! Looks like the bassist
and drummer from nickelback

125
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:15,004
Are rolling through the party.
Acoustic set, yo.

126
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,140
Please tell me some
of your super-solid bros

127
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,309
From prep school will be there.
Topher and boots
are en route.

128
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,978
Where's everyone going? Nice
dress. Your boobs look weird.

129
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,014
From pre not from up here.Here.
Going to my party.S
are en route.

130
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:26,683
That's not happening.

131
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:29,018
Tonight we're trying a little
exercise in team building.

132
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:31,821
No one leaves until
you take final interviews

133
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,491
From the four teal patients
on this floor.
What's a final interview?

134
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,860
It's a chance for old,
dying people to bore you

135
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,796
With their life story
before they kick it.
No, denise. Have some respect.

136
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:42,132
A final interview isn't
some inconsequential thing

137
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,601
A med student
can just blow through.

138
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,403
It actually really matters. Now
hold my pepper jack, please.

139
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,272
Come with me, children.

140
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:51,407
Hold it like a baby bird,
denise. Pepper "j" bruises.

141
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,410
you have the sacred privilege
of being with someone

142
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:58,248
And recording their precious
memories as they prepare to die.

143
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,216
I'm dying?

144
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:02,952
No, not dying.
Just tonsillitis.

145
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:06,356
So you get to gargle.
gargle, gargle!

146
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:10,093
Why would
you let me go in there?
Why would I stop you?
This is good cheese.

147
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,762
Get off my cheese!

148
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:15,498
How long do final interviews
with actual dying people take?

149
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,667
If you work togeth,
it'll go faster.

150
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:19,636
But let me make
this very clear--

151
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,905
No one leaves
until you're all done.

152
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:24,240
All done or none done.

153
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:28,311
damn.
Boots is gonna be pissed.

154
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,057
You have the voice
of an angel.

155
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:43,092
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, sir.

156
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,328
Not you, ted
if I were ten years younger,

157
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:49,532
And you were
ten years younger--
it's too late, sir.
I've already tapped it.

158
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:53,236
Ted buckland!
I'm sorry.
He brings it out of me.

159
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:56,206
It's okay. I didn't always
treat teddy very well.

160
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:59,742
Say, how about we do
a last night out on the town?

161
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,711
Let me give you
a proper send-off.

162
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:04,380
That would mean a lot, sir.

163
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,883
Ted!
I'sorry. It's him!

164
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,388
An indian
wouldn't wear chaps.

165
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,224
You're forgetting
my backstory.

166
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:16,326
I killed a cowboy,
then took his chaps.

167
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:18,094
I'm also a sheriff.

168
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:21,698
it's not a theme party,
is it?

169
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,868
No, but thank you for the great
early birthday present.

170
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,370
Say cheese.

171
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,706
Well done, girls.
The hell with it.
I'm goin' in.

172
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:32,575
Maybe no one will notice.
Try and blend in.

173
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:36,980
black cowboy?
Son, what are you doing?

174
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,082
Me? He's the indian
wearing chaps.

175
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,618
When it works, it works.
I'm also a sheriff.

176
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,219
What are you guys
doing here anyway?

177
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,188
Picking up some extra cash.
We do bar security,

178
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:49,592
Bouncy house rentals--
we got a line--
we have a line
of homemade salsa.

179
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:53,563
Shut your face, frank. I was
gonna tell 'em about the salsa.
Copy that.

180
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,765
I don't have
you guys on the list.

181
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,834
It's probably under "d"
for dr. D.,

182
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:00,470
Or, um, maybe dr. Dizzle,
perhaps d-to-the-izzle?

183
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,739
Oh, here.
We have a d. Izzle.
That's probably it.

184
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,576
I'm dave izzle.

185
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,845
Hey, hey! It's special "k."
howdy.

186
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:13,182
Melvis, frank. Listen, that
salsa was in-frickin'-sane.

187
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:17,120
These are my plus two.
Dr. Kelso, do you think you?

188
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:19,489
You're gonna have to
ask ted about that

189
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,224
Because this is ted's night.

190
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,293
Ted?
I'm going to say yes,

191
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,095
But I've never had
this kind of power before,

192
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,498
So I'm going to milk it,
okay?

193
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:31,034
Go ahead. Do your thing.
I mean, you gotta...
You...

194
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,041
Let it be so!

195
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,876
Oh, amen.

196
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,245
We have to ask them
25 questions?

197
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,614
This is gonna take
forever.

198
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,482
Ain't no proem, luce.
It's just...

199
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,891
man,
I just thought of that.

200
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,827
Damn,
I'm gonna be a good doctor.

201
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,829
Look, we'll split up
the patients, okay?

202
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,731
It'll be quick and easy,

203
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:03,700
And then we can
get to cole's party.

204
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,637
Done.

205
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,138
Done.

206
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,974
Super done.
My dude is dead. Mm.

207
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:17,613
Peace! Gotta go drown
my sorrows with a jagerbomb.

208
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:19,816
Where's lucy?

209
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:23,419
Um...
What is your birth date?

210
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,922
Probably just find that
in the chart.

211
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:28,992
Uh... How about...
Are you married?

212
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,994
Okay.

213
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,496
Do you think
that when bears hibernate,

214
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:36,065
They have
super long dreams?
What?

215
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,668
You spoke. I got you!
Now you owe me an answer.

216
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,670
You know, tit for tat...

217
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:42,972
Which, by the way,
is a horrible expression.

218
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,407
It sous...
pornographic.

219
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,409
Listen, girlie,
I'm not interested

220
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,412
In answering a bunch of
stupid questions off of a form,

221
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,315
So why don't you just
leave me the hell alone?
Great.

222
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:56,019
Well, I guess it's time
for a little good-bye toast.

223
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,022
Aw, I'm not really
much of a toast guy.

224
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:00,356
A fond farewell...

225
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:03,426
To that skanky blonde
heading out the door.

226
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:06,262
I'm gonna see what other
chickens are in the coop.

227
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:13,936
11 seconds--
you beat your record.

228
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,972
Whoo! I'm spinning!

229
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:18,441
Maybe next time
you should try it with alcohol

230
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:21,277
Instead of soda.
Don'be insane.
This is awesome.

231
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,280
Yeah, it is.
We're lettin' 'em know!
True dat!

232
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:27,784
Who and--and what
are  letting know?

233
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,286
Mine won't talk.
He wasn't even intrigued by

234
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,589
My bear hibernation question.
For the last time, they
don't dream, and nobody cares.

235
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,625
They do,
and everybody cares.

236
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,494
I'm sorry about your party,
but I was very clear--

237
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:40,930
All done or none done.

238
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,800
Hey, guys?
My patient just died.

239
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,235
I'm feeling a little too upset
to keep working.

240
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,005
Really?
What was his name?

241
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,674
Look, I can't do this
right now, drew! I'm hurtin'!

242
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:56,512
You're really gonna
leave us?

243
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:59,515
I don't know if you can see
how much my soul dies

244
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,018
Every time
I let you back into my bed,

245
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,021
But it would make me hate
myself, like, four notches less

246
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:08,157
If I thought you had
one decent bone in your body.

247
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,726
Please don't laugh
because I said "bone."

248
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,196
Hey, look, baby,
I would love to stay,

249
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,965
But I just don't want to.

250
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,579
Whoo! Good one.
Whoo! Good one, boy!

251
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,248
Please, please tell me that
this is just an intermission

252
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,550
Because I don't want
this show to ever end.

253
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:38,221
Why are you re, perry?
To laugh, to cry,
to cry from laughing,

254
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,523
But mostly to laugh
at two desperate guys

255
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,025
On an ice slide
to an irrelevant middle age.

256
00:12:43,026 --> 00:12:45,528
Well, not only have we been
lettin' 'em know--

257
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,531
Is--is that
the correct expression?
Oh, that's it, right there--
lettin' 'em know.

258
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:50,466
Well,
we've been lettin' 'em know

259
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,768
By doing the cabbage patch...

260
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,872
E running man
and the capoeira.
That's right.
That's brazilian dance fightin'.

261
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:57,840
in your face!
Where's the jackass?

262
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,375
jackass, come!

263
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:01,377
What up?

264
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:04,380
Now you are the host of
this party, and to some extent,

265
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,416
The voice of your generation.
And while I sadly acknowledge

266
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,252
That heralds
the coming apocalypse,

267
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,787
I do value your opinion
on one thing in particular.

268
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:14,190
Wow.
You're like shakespeare, yo.

269
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:16,292
I am. I am
"like shakespeare, yo."

270
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,295
Now look around the room
real quick and tell me

271
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:21,030
The five lamest people
that you see.

272
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:23,065
Feel free to start with me.

273
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:26,068
Cool. One--old.

274
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,704
Two--bald and shiny.

275
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,240
Three--super old,

276
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,544
Four--checked out my junk
at the urinal,

277
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:38,281
And... Five--has weird junk.
Number four told me.

278
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,950
We didn't make the list!
nope, we didn't.

279
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,452
You've just been served.
Yeah, and you know what?

280
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:45,755
We're gonna rub it
in your face a little bit

281
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,823
By doing some
brazilian fight dancing.

282
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,226
Five, six, seven, eight...
Capoeira, capoeira.

283
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:00,803
that was outstanding!

284
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:04,106
sometimes, reality takes
the form of a kick to the head.

285
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:07,109
Sorry, bros. You just moved up
to the numbers one and two spots

286
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,146
On my lame list.
Well, I think turk
should be number one

287
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:12,915
Because he appears
to be bleeding.

288
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,685
Other times, it gets
right up in your grill.

289
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,353
Why would you page me?

290
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:20,022
Paul just wants to be
left alone.
Just let us go.

291
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:22,725
We'll come back in the morning
and take another shot at him.

292
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:26,162
Great. I'll go talk to his liver
and tell it to stop failing.

293
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:28,130
You don't get it, do you?

294
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,633
Patients don't do things
on your schedule.

295
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,636
This isn't high school, guys.
This is real. You know what?

296
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,739
Do whatever you want.
I don't give a rat's ass.

297
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,909
Just make sure
you can live with yourself.

298
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm really sorry, c-bear.
I had no idea my range of motion

299
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:51,303
Would be so incredible in these chaps.
That's a lie. I totally knew.

300
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,372
I can't believe
I let you sew my eye up

301
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,141
After l the soda you had.
This night definitely didn't turn out

302
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,143
The way I hoped it would.

303
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:01,446
Oh, hey! Hey!

304
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,049
Did you have us
in the chairs again?

305
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,085
We weren't getting married,
turk. We were becoming men.

306
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,354
Hey. Did you guys dress up
for the kids in the cancer ward?

307
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,089
Yes. We...
Yeah. Yes.

308
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,759
That's what we were...
Yeah,
and then what happened was

309
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,662
One of the kids hit me
in the head with a toy.

310
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,664
Yeah. 'cause he was mad.

311
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,732
'cause he had the cancer.

312
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,902
Okay. We're just...
Hey, how did
the final interviews go?

313
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,404
Not perft.

314
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:29,041
But we decided as a group
that we can live with ourselves.

315
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,276
Well, I know
those things are hard.

316
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,679
Turk and I had to do one
last year.

317
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,148
We couldn't get the guy
to say a word.

318
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,283
We ended up skipping
our big steak night,

319
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:41,553
And we just spent hours
talking to him.
He had a lot
he needed to say

320
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:44,156
Before he passed on.
Yeah, it definely
meant a lot to him.

321
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,658
I gotta say for me, though,
it was probably

322
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,194
One of the most memorable nights
I've ever had as a doctor.
Me, too.

323
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:54,666
Ka-bam!
We just dropped
a knowledge bomb on your asses.

324
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,037
dr. Turk was right.

325
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:02,074
A knowledge bomb had been
dropped on our asses,

326
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,543
So we decided
to take another shot

327
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:07,512
Even though paul wasn't
gonna talk to any of us.

328
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:10,382
what up, nerds?
Hey, this paul dude is awesome.

329
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:12,784
He nailed marilyn monroe!

330
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:15,253
Oh, no. It was actually
marilyn montrose.

331
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,256
Same diff.
Chicks named marilyn are hot.

332
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:21,393
I can't believe you came back.
It wasn't my idea.
Denise made me.

333
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,162
How'd you get him to talk?
We had a conversation.

334
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,832
All hot stuff here did
was ask questions off a form.

335
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,835
Are you, uh, choosing to
smile and ignore the insult

336
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:32,170
'cause he called you
"hot stuff"? Attagirl.

337
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,140
Hey, did you know paulie got
a purple heart in korea?

338
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,309
I didn't even know
we fought korea!

339
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,444
So, paul, how'd you get
your purple heart?

340
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,747
Come on, talk to us.

341
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,685
Oops. That's not my drink.

342
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,920
It's good, though.

343
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,922
Methinks
it's quitting time.

344
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,125
Good night, gooch.

345
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:56,094
Ted.

346
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,629
Ted?
That's it?

347
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,599
I've been your whipping boy
for eight years,

348
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,101
And all I get
before I disappear forever

349
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,837
Is a wet, clammy handshake?

350
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,774
And, yes, I know
that's from my hand, not yours.

351
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,710
And, yes, I know that
we've never really been friends.

352
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,613
And, yes, I know that the gooch
is way too attractive for me.

353
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,481
That's not relevant
right now.

354
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:18,784
It's just always
on my mind.

355
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,453
Please don't leave me
for a baritone.
I won't.

356
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,522
ted, I'm so hammered that

357
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:26,525
The only thing I can think about
are those 30-cent hot dogs

358
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:29,127
At the gas station,
so wrap it up.

359
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,797
You owe me
more than a handshake.

360
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,099
Let's go, honey.

361
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,740
That's not my drink, either.

362
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:45,077
In war, you have to
make the hard choices,

363
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,012
So I shot the man,

364
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:49,347
But I'll never forget
his face.

365
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,450
No way.
You wasted a dude?

366
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,985
Hey,
my buddy killed a guy once.

367
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,522
Backed right over him
in a mini mall. It was crazy.
Yeah, that's the same.

368
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,625
I can't believe you were our age
when all that happened.
Yeah, you and me, both.

369
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,727
Some of our guys
never made it home.

370
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,996
The rest of us
tried to keep in touch,

371
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,499
But, you know,
life gets in the way.

372
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,001
I haven't seen any of them
for years,

373
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,537
But I think about them
all the time.

374
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,574
You know, when you spend
the hardest time in your life

375
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:17,943
With a group of people,
you're bonded forever.

376
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:21,346
What are you guys
still doing here?
All done, none done, remember?

377
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,048
Wow. That crap worked.

378
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,184
I faculty-advised
the hell out of you guys.

379
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:28,753
I think
it dawned on all of us that,

380
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,021
In a way,
we were war buddies...

381
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,526
And we wouldn't be able
to get through med school

382
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:38,063
If we didn't
have each other's backs.

383
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:41,666
Leave him!
Every man for themselves!

384
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,202
Well,
it dawned on most of us.

385
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:49,341
Hey, thanks for
making cole come back.

386
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,276
I didn't make him
come back.

387
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,712
I really hate
talking to that guy.

388
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:56,548
Adds an extra shower
to my day.

389
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,253
I can't believe
it's been 12 years

390
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:04,723
Since we
started medical school.
Wee getting old,
kemo sabe.

391
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:06,825
Well, thank you, lord.
Now you do realize

392
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,760
You could've saved yourself
a lot of embarrassment

393
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,762
And a lot of time
and about seven stitches

394
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,631
If you'd just admitted to that
a little earlier.

395
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,666
Of course, it wouldn't have been
as much fun for me,

396
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,501
And I damn sure
wouldn't have gotten

397
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,136
This teraver.

398
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:20,372
He's gonna want
a copy of that.
No, I won't.

399
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,340
hello, christmas cards!

400
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,376
There's nothing wrong
with getting older,

401
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,878
So do yourself a favor--
get a prostate exam,

402
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,148
Stop wring ironic t-shirts
and just let it happen.

403
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,117
Sometimes we have to embrace

404
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:35,120
The had truths
about ourselves,

405
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:38,123
Whether it's what we really
want to do on a big night out

406
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,126
Or realizing that
you're never as strong alone

407
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,161
As you are together.

408
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,130
Can't believe we found 'em.

409
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,898
I can't believe they came.

410
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:50,068
Three straps!

411
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:01,653
Ted, you're not gonna
just walk out

412
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:04,289
Without saying good-bye
to anyone, are you?

413
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:06,291
Aw, nobody cares.

414
00:16:27,340 --> 00:20:09,461
We're gonna miss you.
All the best, ted.

415
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,930
Is this more like
what you were looking for?

416
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:13,799
Thank you, sir.

417
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:16,401
Oh, uh...
Forgot my keys.

418
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:20,072
I'll be right back!

419
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,475
oh, got 'em! Aw.

420
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:26,745
This is more appropriate.

421
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,981
I'm gonna miss you.

422
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:33,018
Bye, ted.

423
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,554
Good-bye, bob.

424
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:38,056
Well, honey, uh...

425
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:40,623
Play me out.

426
