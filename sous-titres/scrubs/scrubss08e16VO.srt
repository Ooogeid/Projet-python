<i>{\pos(192,220)}After a weekend with Sam,
it's always sad</i>

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:06,143
<i>{\pos(192,220)}driving him the 37 minutes
back to Kim's house</i>

3
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:08,454
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Still, there was one positive.</i>

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,696
<i>{\pos(192,220)}Elliot's a bit territorial.</i>

5
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:13,193
<i>So if I got any physical
contact from Kim...</i>

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,997
Your collar is messed up.

7
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:19,795
<i>On the way home, Elliot
made me pull over for car sex.</i>

8
00:00:22,884 --> 00:00:24,872
<i>I know I shouldn't
exploit her insecurities.</i>

9
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,209
<i>But car sex really appeals
to my exhibitionist side.</i>

10
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,734
Here we are.

11
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,393
That bitch better watch her hands.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,939
Hi, Kim.

13
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,913
JD, you have fuzz in your hair.

14
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,391
<i>I know. I put it there.</i>

15
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:48,367
I need to tell you guys something.

16
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:51,101
<i>It didn't matter
what Kim had to say.</i>

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,806
<i>Elliot was already in car sex mode.</i>

18
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:56,604
To save time, I'll just
take off my underwear here.

19
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,973
Whatever is good for you.

20
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:00,415
<i>Nothing could stop this train.</i>

21
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:07,346
<i>You know. Unless Kim was
dating Elliot's stupid ex-boyfriend.</i>

22
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,201
You know what sucks?

23
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,619
I have to hire
a new Chief or Surgery.

24
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,700
And I just can't fathom giving any
of you tiny-brained scalpel jockeys

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,367
a leadership position.

26
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:23,797
Honestly, so far,

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,036
this is the only candidate
who I'm seriously considering.

28
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,229
The guy has the opposable thumbs

29
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,573
so you automatically know
he can handle the job.

30
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:34,137
And I was just thinking
if you slap a diaper on him

31
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:36,255
and maybe tape
some glasses to his face,

32
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,377
sure as shooting
he'll look professional enough.

33
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,187
Do you know what?
I'm gonna call the gentleman.

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,592
- I'd be great at that job.
- Then go for it.

35
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,892
Chief of Surgery?

36
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:51,003
Baby, one of the most
amazing things about you

37
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:53,104
is that when you want
something badly enough,

38
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:55,015
you always make it happen.

39
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,081
Remember when you
first started working here.

40
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,828
And I had no interest
in dating you, what did you do?

41
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:01,027
I made it happen.

42
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:03,628
And what about when
I had no interest in marrying you?

43
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,978
I made it happen!

44
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,174
Go make this happen.

45
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:08,622
I'm doing it.

46
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,304
Even though
you didn't use to like me,

47
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,987
- I'm your world now, right?
- My whole word.

48
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,785
That's what I'm talking about.

49
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:22,622
No, thanks.

50
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,205
So how's married life?

51
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,972
You have to make compromises.

52
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,432
Like my wife's allergic to raccoons.
So I had to throw out my comforter.

53
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,321
How was your honeymoon?

54
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,748
Did you know that Kelso
stayed in the Bahamas too?

55
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:36,815
I love you.

56
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,738
I love you too.

57
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,719
Let's never leave.

58
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:48,658
Yeah, we saw him.

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,275
Yeah, I'm sorry.

60
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:54,299
I was so blitzed with rum drinks
I could barely remember where I was.

61
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,444
I feel horrible.

62
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,430
Oh no, stop it. At first, you were
like the third wheel from hell,

63
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,911
but then we made you do stuff.

64
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:02,554
Made you pay for our meals.
Got you in a couple bar fights.

65
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,339
On the beach, we bet you
you couldn't eat a starfish.

66
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,115
- And?
- I owe you a buck.

67
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,188
- So you had fun with it?
- Oh yeah.

68
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:10,243
Good.

69
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,475
Folks, I'm sorry
but we have to close.

70
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:15,152
Our pastry maker was
just admitted to the hospital

71
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,739
with a highly
contagious intestinal virus.

72
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:23,418
What the hell. I'm already in it.

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,639
I need to check myself in.

74
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,716
For what?

75
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,192
For that.

76
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,456
So we've been dating about a month

77
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:43,865
and I just didn't want to say anything
until I knew it was gonna go somewhere.

78
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,487
Well, we hit a little speed bump

79
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,645
when I first found out
that Sam was your baby.

80
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,957
Yeah, he got drunk and asked me
to sell him on the black market.

81
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,239
- She wouldn't, but...
- Oh that's sweet.

82
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,498
I just don't understand how you two
even met. Did someone introduce you?

83
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:02,897
I love you.

84
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:06,084
Sweetie, it was over a year ago.
You and I weren't even together.

85
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,775
I figured at most
they could end up friends.

86
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:11,248
Well, you also told me
he was great in the sack.

87
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,831
Kim, I will kill you.

88
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,889
He's not, sweetie.

89
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:17,964
[mouthing]
You are.

90
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:30,774
Season 8 Episode 16
My Cuz

91
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,075
{\pos(192,220}See you then.

92
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,319
{\pos(192,220}They're coming by for lunch
so we can hear everything out

93
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,080
{\pos(192,235}- and get past all this weirdness.
- Sean's coming here?

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,855
{\pos(192,235}You don't realize how much
it sucks to spend time

95
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,633
{\pos(192,235}with someone you used to sleep with.

96
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:45,332
{\pos(192,235}You used to sleep with Kim,
and I have to see her every week.

97
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,185
{\pos(192,235}- That's totally different.
- How?

98
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,536
{\pos(192,235}I don't know. I'm not
some genius that knows

99
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,001
why things that seem the same
are actually very different.

100
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,277
Be crazier.

101
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,486
{\pos(192,235}Did you put on that
Cologne I hate to punish me?

102
00:04:58,072 --> 00:04:59,299
{\pos(192,235}That's insane.

103
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,832
{\pos(192,235}<i>Insanely true.</i>

104
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,087
Go.

105
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:07,025
Now, I know
I gave all of you 5-1 odds,

106
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,265
but no one stitches
an orange faster than me.

107
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:11,357
No one.

108
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,213
{\pos(192,235}I am a... god.

109
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,311
{\pos(192,235}- Done.
- Damn it!

110
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,499
{\pos(192,220}Good. This is where
you interns are located.

111
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,148
{\pos(192,220}Here I was worried you were
out taking care of sick people.

112
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:24,475
Finished. Oh crap.

113
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,505
Leave.

114
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,027
I'll take that.

115
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:29,257
- I heard you were looking for me.
- Yes.

116
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:32,288
I want officially put my name
in for the Chief of Surgery.

117
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,036
{\pos(192,200}That's a good one.

118
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,698
{\pos(192,200}Laugh all you want
but I'm still getting that job.

119
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:39,944
{\pos(192,220}I know we don't always get along personally.

120
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,546
{\pos(192,220}But in my defense, it's
because you're a huge jackass.

121
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,622
I'm the best cutter in
this place. And you know it.

122
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,807
{\pos(192,220}When you put it
that way, you compel me

123
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,125
{\pos(192,220}to consult with
a decision committee.

124
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,562
{\pos(192,220}Say, Perry?

125
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:53,578
{\pos(192,220}Yes, Perry.

126
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:54,910
{\pos(192,220}Listen, I was wondering.

127
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,462
{\pos(192,220}Can Dr. Turk here
be the new Chief of Surgery?

128
00:05:58,582 --> 00:05:59,339
{\pos(192,220}Well,

129
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,063
{\pos(192,220}I haven't hit the bottle yet
today, so I'm not that drunk.

130
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,868
{\pos(192,220}The answer is no.
Not in this lifetime.

131
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,402
Sorry there.
I did everything possible.

132
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:08,663
Strength.

133
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:15,153
{\pos(192,220}- How are you feeling?
- Not great.

134
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,848
{\pos(192,220}But now, when I hurl,
I've been trying to say the names

135
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,963
{\pos(192,220}of my favorite novels so that's fun.

136
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:21,662
Look.

137
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,463
{\pos(192,220}I'm sure I just have an enterovirus,
so order me 40 cc of...

138
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,942
{\pos(192,220}No, you are not a doctor here anymore.

139
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,648
{\pos(192,220}You will not treat yourself.
I'm sticking the interns on you.

140
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,022
Come on!

141
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,036
What happened
to your sleeve there, Tex?

142
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,158
I sewed on orange on to it.

143
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:39,977
I'll take the foreigner.

144
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,184
I'm so happy!

145
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,981
I dropped Sam off
at the daycare upstairs

146
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,250
and they seemed really
good with him, didn't they?

147
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,630
- There were good. It was good.
- Oh, good good.

148
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,455
Good things are good.
So it's good.

149
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:59,725
Stop saying "good", Sean.
You sound like an ass.

150
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,434
You said it too. He said "good".

151
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,840
No I didn't, Sean.
Can you believe this guy?

152
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,607
I need to talk to Kim.
Let's divide up.

153
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,622
I vote yes.

154
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,055
- You said "good".
- Nobody cares, Sean.

155
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,341
Nobody cares.

156
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:21,501
Am I gonna have an office this fancy
when I'm the Chief of Surgery?

157
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,108
It's dangerous to try
to reason with delusional people

158
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,571
so I'm just gonna
go about my business.

159
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:30,872
Okay, I'll go. But only because
it's time for my peer recommendation.

160
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,660
Right here, buddy.

161
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,531
I get embarrassed when
people say nice things about me.

162
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,482
Handle your business.

163
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:41,786
Dr. Turk should be chief because he's
skilled technically, super-efficient.

164
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,694
He's got an awesome dong. He's
great with laparoscopic procedures.

165
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,351
Patients love him...

166
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,678
What was that middle one?

167
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,205
Laparoscopic?

168
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,831
So, you are the best
he could muster up?

169
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,058
No, I'm not the only one.
We all want Turk.

170
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,957
<i>You</i> want him
to be the Chief of Surgery?

171
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:11,086
That depends.

172
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:13,786
Does he get a special
chief hat, like a Police Chief?

173
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,189
If you give him the job,
and I make him a hat,

174
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:18,882
will you force him to wear it?

175
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,097
I was thinking like
an old-time scuba diver helmet.

176
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:23,651
Hello.

177
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,353
You need a new colon.

178
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,510
Is that a maybe?

179
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:33,497
You're ready to do this?

180
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,399
Let's hear some crap out.

181
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,083
I feel guilty because
we used to be friends

182
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:42,833
and now I resent you so much
for having a baby with JD

183
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,433
that sometimes
I dream about you dying.

184
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:50,077
Also, if you ever even touch JD,
I have sex with him in the car

185
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,923
in front of a random creepy
bicyclist that JD thinks I don't see.

186
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,095
- That sounds healthy.
- I think it is.

187
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,482
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

188
00:08:58,156 --> 00:09:00,512
I used to dream
about you dying all the time.

189
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,987
- Really?
- Yeah. Seriously.

190
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,265
- What are the women talking about?
- I'm not psychic, Sean.

191
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,011
But they better not be all chummy

192
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,293
chatting about which
one of us is better in bed.

193
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,499
They're women.
They don't talk about that.

194
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,134
JD's better at sex.
Sean's better at foreplay.

195
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,257
JD's great at foreplay. He just
takes the "play" part literally

196
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,878
so you've got to embrace
all of his games, you know, his...

197
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,227
"Nooks and Crannies",
"Upsy Daisies".

198
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,417
"Who's in There?", followed
after by "What's in There?"

199
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:30,313
- "Mr. Peep Tries on Hats".
- Love that one.

200
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,154
It's not fair that we still
have to be in each other's lives.

201
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,084
I know.

202
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,065
But I also know the girls aren't
gonna let up until we make peace.

203
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,395
So what do you say
we change the tone a little bit

204
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:42,720
and both say something
nice about each other?

205
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,772
I'll go first.

206
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,064
Look at you.

207
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,975
There's no way around it.

208
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,669
You're a beautiful man.

209
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,549
- Thank you, JD.
- Now you go.

210
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,702
- I never agreed to that.
- Beautiful son of a bitch.

211
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,598
We need to stop seeing
each other as enemies.

212
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,038
Sean, you and I have
had sex with the same women.

213
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:05,117
Therefore, we're wiener cousins.

214
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,854
And where I come from,
this right here...

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,047
Stronger than family.

216
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,805
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it ridiculous, fellas?

217
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,241
Nurse Roberts.

218
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,085
Both of them. One night.
May she rest in peace.

219
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,011
Cuz?

220
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,358
I'm not hooking fingers.

221
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:29,511
It won't be official.

222
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,201
We touched, it counts.

223
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,784
I'm just putting an IV in, okay?

224
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,014
Sir?

225
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:41,689
Sir?

226
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,014
Are you okay?

227
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:47,244
One-nothing, Bobbo.

228
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,790
Good one.

229
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,152
Hold still.

230
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,627
Damn it, we're even.

231
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,897
That wasn't a vein, was it?

232
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:58,554
That's okay, sweetheart.
You're probably just nervous.

233
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,353
So why don't you go get a cup of
water to relax and we'll try it again.

234
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,064
Thanks. I'll be right back.

235
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:06,770
Take your time.

236
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,277
The Grapes of...

237
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,713
The Grapes of...

238
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,995
Wrath!

239
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,025
I'm so proud of you for
working things out with Sean.

240
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,883
What can I say?
He's my wiener cuz.

241
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,500
Kim and I are bajingo sisters.

242
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,672
- You always wanted one of those.
- I know!

243
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,586
There's Sammy.

244
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,344
It's okay. It's okay.

245
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:46,511
<i>As a parent, you realize there
are things much more annoying</i>

246
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,510
<i>than your child crying in your ear.</i>

247
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,172
<i>Someday, he'll lie to your face.</i>

248
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,034
Who placed that IV?

249
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:54,626
Another intern did it.

250
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,736
<i>Or he'll relentlessly
pester you for a toy he wants.</i>

251
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,858
You're gonna give me
that job or what?

252
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:06,812
He's a little sad.

253
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:08,988
Can you take him?

254
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,974
He never cries when Sean holds him.

255
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,151
<i>Still, nothing really matters
as long as you know in your heart</i>

256
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,051
<i>that your child loves you the most.</i>

257
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,219
Better, little man.

258
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:21,097
Bye, guys.

259
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,488
{\pos(192,220)}- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

260
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,003
{\pos(192,220)}So Sam stopped crying the
second Sean picked him up, huh?

261
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,052
{\pos(192,220)}- It's harsh.
- I know.

262
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,741
{\pos(192,220)}JD was a little quiet last night.

263
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,948
{\pos(192,220)}But I'm proud of him,
he's really handling it well.

264
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:46,296
Your plan to sex up my old girlfriend

265
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,808
so you can turn my
baby boy against me is over.

266
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,330
Hey, buddy.

267
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,732
No, what's wrong?
What's wrong? It's okay.

268
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,573
How are you doing this?
Are you a sorcerer?

269
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,753
I heard you were hiring Dr. Turk
as the new Chief of Surgery.

270
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,486
- Told her the good news.
- It's not happening.

271
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:13,167
I have tried to communicate that message
to you every single way I know how

272
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,774
but you won't hear it.

273
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,360
Honestly, the only option I have
left is to concentrate really hard

274
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,026
and see if I can shoot my actual
message right into your big bald head.

275
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,116
I know you don't want
to give me the job.

276
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:28,294
My god.

277
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:31,092
It worked. This is
a terrific day for science.

278
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:32,754
Time to call in the closer.

279
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,963
A word.

280
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,795
Why do you always have your
wife fight your battles for you?

281
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,018
I do.

282
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:40,920
Get him, woman.

283
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,819
- What are you doing?
- I'm doctoring my file.

284
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,824
- What are you doing?
- I'm making this special hat

285
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,031
in case Black Doctor
gets the Chief of Surgery job.

286
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:58,154
I need you to guard this door
while I take care of some business.

287
00:13:58,274 --> 00:13:59,265
Why should I?

288
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:00,621
You know why.

289
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:04,232
The bond that can't be broken.
That was 20 years ago, but...

290
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:06,727
I'll honor the code.

291
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,478
You seemed so happy in the
Bahamas. How come you left?

292
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,777
I thought it was a nude beach.

293
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,452
- It was a church, Bob.
- So?

294
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,267
Fine.

295
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,702
I'll go.

296
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,281
Hey, stop him!

297
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,772
It was time to go.

298
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:40,647
Oh, good.

299
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,583
Someone already gave him the shot.

300
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,442
Can I have that? I want to
put it on something I'm making.

301
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,773
- I don't think that's okay.
- It's a hat.

302
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,171
I'm gonna hang on to this.

303
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,134
See, he's fine now.
But when I get close.

304
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:00,404
Doesn't make any sense.

305
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:05,346
Unless of course someone is shocking
him by pressing a remote control button.

306
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,885
- What's that in your hand, Sean?
- Yogurt.

307
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,528
What's at the bottom of it?

308
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,723


309
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,723
- Peach. Peaches.
- Give me that.

310
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,755
You're clean.

311
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:20,105
- See what he did to my last yogurt?
- I know. Calm down.

312
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:22,522
And he said "good"
yesterday, I heard him.

313
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:24,571
You know what?
Give us a minute to talk. Come on.

314
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,737
What the hell are you doing?

315
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,348
I don't know.

316
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,145
Look, after my parents divorced,

317
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,170
my dad really wasn't around for me.

318
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,993
And I promised myself I was gonna
be a better father than he was.

319
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,923
Now, Sam cries like
I'm some kind of stranger.

320
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,438
And I like that Sean has
a relationship with him, I do.

321
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,600
- Thanks, man.
- I'm not talking to you, Sean.

322
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,827
You are a great dad.

323
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,152
Then why can't I hold him?

324
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:03,864
Hi, guys.

325
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:06,428
If you don't stop treating yourself,
I'm gonna have you strapped down.

326
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,530
Naughty.

327
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,665
And you...

328
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:12,408
Just give Turk the job already.
He's a natural leader.

329
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:16,187
Plus I'm about to spit out a second
kid, I could use the extra cash.

330
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,883
I knew damn sure you were gonna
go ahead and make this personal.

331
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,894
Am I supposed to give him a job

332
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,037
because you and I
are such good friends?

333
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:25,650
I wouldn't ask you if
I didn't know he was right for it.

334
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,553
Bob, who's the best all-around
surgeon in this place?

335
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,025
Turkleton, hands down.

336
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,393
Kiss more butt, Bob.

337
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:34,927
And you're giving me lip
for making this personal?

338
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,737
The only reason you're
not giving Turk this job

339
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:40,072
is because of your
personal feelings for him.

340
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,502
- That's just not true.
- Liar.

341
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,456
The Adventures of Huckleberry...

342
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:47,449
The Adventures of Huckleberry...

343
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,207
Don't puke on me, Bob.

344
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:52,703
Sorry. Just a burp.

345
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:55,451
I know you're just
trying to cheer me up.

346
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:56,641
No, trust me.

347
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:59,954
There have been times when I wanted
to tell people you're a terrible dad.

348
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,137
But you're not.

349
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,819
You spend tons of time with Sam,

350
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,831
call him every night
so he can hear your voice.

351
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,432
You write him all those stories
about unicorns. Seriously...

352
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:10,101
- How do you come up with so many?
- They just come to me.

353
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,788
- I got to get them out, you know?
- No, I don't know.

354
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,641
- They're magical.
- They're not.

355
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,292
Whatever is making Sam
cry, it's not about you.

356
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,409
It's about him. Babies are
sensitive to all kinds of things.

357
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:24,856
Bright lights,
temperature, new smells.

358
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,207
The Cologne I've been
wearing to try and punish Elliot!

359
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,913
Thanks for the shower
and the loaner clothes.

360
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:35,529
Look at that face. It's like
he got all of our best features.

361
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,186
No, he got your chin.

362
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:39,452
I'm having a moment.

363
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,722
Bob, would you please
close the back of that thing up?

364
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,943
Calm down, Perry.
It's for the ladies.

365
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,599
I'm sure they're grateful.

366
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:52,847
Why did you check yourself in to
the hospital for a glorified flu bug?

367
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,493
In my defense, I thought
I might also be dealing

368
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:57,909
with some issues
from eating raw starfish.

369
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:02,461
You know what I realized
when I was treating myself?

370
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,240
I miss being a doctor.

371
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,099
Now is your chance to get
back to the game there, big guy.

372
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,651
Am I wrong to not hire Gandhi?

373
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:12,905
I thought it was
gonna be something doctory.

374
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,813
- Of course you're wrong.
- He bothers me.

375
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:18,287
Everybody bothers you. Hell, you used
to bother me when I was the Chief

376
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,648
but I kept moving you up because
you were the best man for the job.

377
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,074
Now, the question is,

378
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,735
"Is Turkleton
the best man for the job?"

379
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,451
Some pretty good stitches
you got going there.

380
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:32,359
I used to be terrible at it,

381
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,529
but Dr. Turk made us practice with
oranges every day to get better.

382
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:39,677
Nice butt.

383
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,272
Thank you, darling.

384
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,865
Suck it, Perry.

385
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,390
<i>Elliot came over later.</i>

386
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,120
<i>Even though it was better, I wouldn't
say the awkwardness was totally gone.</i>

387
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:58,334
Weird flashback, like
the ghost of couples passed.

388
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,257
It's your house, It's your house.
It's so silly...

389
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,570
Ladies should sit.

390
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,472
That's kinda weird.

391
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,212
We're the guests.

392
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:16,758
The guests. The guests
will sit on the couch.

393
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,714
- That's where guests sit.
- Can I get you guys anything?

394
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,440
Wine, maybe?

395
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,203
- I'll have a yogurt.
- Don't start.

396
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,838
You know what we should do?
Sam's napping.

397
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,120
Let's watch this video
I've been making of him.

398
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:31,973
<i>There are moments in your life that make
you realize what you've been missing.</i>

399
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,890
<i>Whether it's an old job...</i>

400
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,423
<i>Or the best person for a new job.</i>

401
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,947
Congratulations.
You're the new Chief of Surgery.

402
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,612
- Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.

403
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,572
I told you. I told you, baby!

404
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,112
I told everyone. Climb!
I told everyone!

405
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,578
Hail to the Chief!

406
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,466
So there he is with
his little red wagon.

407
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:11,595
And that's my cousin's puppy.

408
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:15,435
<i>As I sat there, enjoying
images from my son's young life,

409
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:19,067
<i>I realized I was seeing these moments
the same way Sean and Elliot were.</i>

410
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:20,497
<i>For the first time.</i>

411
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:21,596
<i>But truth is,</i>

412
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:24,809
<i>no matter how hard I tried,
I was gonna miss a lot of them.</i>

413
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:28,319
<i>Because even the best
part-time father in the world...</i>

414
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,552
<i>is still a part-time father.</i>

415
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,325
I think I'm gonna move here.

416
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,101
Great.

417
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,009
{\pos(192,230)}I'm not wearing that.

418
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,481
{\pos(192,230)}It's not up to you.

419
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,874
{\pos(192,230)}Fine.

420
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,788
{\pos(192,230)}It is kinda cool.

421
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,239
{\pos(192,210)}I want it back.

422
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,156
{\pos(192,220)}Too late!
Chief coming through!

423
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:01,978
{\pos(192,200)}Salute!

424
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,432
{\pos(192,210)}There it is!

425
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,931
{\pos(192,180)}I'll just wear my other one.
