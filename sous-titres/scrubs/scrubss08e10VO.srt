00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:03,476
Okay, Mr. Rego,

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:05,879
I know you've been complaining
about the bedpans being too cold,

3
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:09,157
so I used an incubator in pediatrics
to warm this bad boy up for you.

4
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:10,898
Enjoy.

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:15,343
You know, I used to use an incubator
to keep my lunch warm.

6
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,104
Till some whiny new mom complained

7
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:18,848
that her preemie
smelled like a ham sandwich.

8
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:22,304
Weird thing was, I had
a tuna melt in there, not ham.

9
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:24,016
Most newborns smell amazing,

10
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:26,730
and unlucky few
are ham babies.

11
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:30,525
Oh, God. Here comes
the happiest person on the planet.

12
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:32,317
Hi!

13
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:35,209
Oh, hey, oh!
You look so beautiful today!

14
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:36,502
Hi!

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,072
Oh, hi Katie!

16
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,284
All the interns are going out
for drinks. You want to come?

17
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,070
Yeah. I'll get my stuff.

18
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:43,981
How about you, dude chick?

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,273
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
and catch up on my scut work.

20
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,282
You can try as hard as you want
not to be my friend,

21
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,448
But eventually I'm gonna get ya.
Come on, Howie.

22
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,141
If I get drunk enough,
I'll undo my scrub bottoms

23
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,738
and let you do
a shot off my butt.

24
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,806
All right.

25
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:59,324
I've noticed that you always stay here
late and work after your shift is over.

26
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,675
I got a lot of work.

27
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:02,553
If you don't get out of the hospital
every once in a while

28
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,063
and blow off some steam,
this place will eventually crush you.

29
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,634
So go, okay?
For me.

30
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:09,467
Fine.

31
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:10,880
Great.

32
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,469
Oh, my god, Caitlin,
that baby's beautiful.

33
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,811

Ham baby.

35
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,891
What? Oh, hell no.

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,419
Gotcha!

[suspenseful music plays]

38
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,520
Holy Mackerel!

39
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:40,009
Oh my god.
This can't get any worse.

40
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,212
That is one long-ass booby hair.

41
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,720
<i>[J.D.] Like most hospitals,
Sacred Heart makes their interns</i>

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,379

43
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,019
<i>It was never any good,
but this year it would be.</i>

44
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:59,350
Okay, people, before we begin,
you need to accept one simple truth--

45
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:03,755
- We are funny, and you are not.
- Sucks to hear, doesn't it?

46
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,719
We will be writing all of
your sketches. You're welcome.

47
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:10,024
Let's jump right in. I need
two volunteers to go full-frontal.

48
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:10,836
Howie?

49
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,673
No. I have eczema.

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,028
Sunny, Denise, maybe rubbing
some oil on one another?

51
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:17,712
- Yeah, sure, no problem.
- No, not at all.

52
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,148
Okay, well, then let's cut
the leukemia sketch.

53
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:21,726
Dude, no!
That sketch is gold.

54
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,854
Well, if they're not naked,
they're just sad and dying.

55
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:25,102
What's funny about that?

56
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,973
We make 'em British.

57
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:30,637
Good save. It's back in, but only
because this man is a comic genius.

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,980
I have been called
The Black Wayne Brady.

59
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,587
Okay, try
and believe in us, guys.

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,214
This thing has not been funny
for 8 years, when we were interns.

¶ One, two, three, Jesus! ¶

64
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,533
I sure do love me
some Jesus.

There will be a
20-minute intermission.

73
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:10,915
I never saw her coming.

74
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,858
She was killed in a car accident.

75
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,886
I miss her.

76
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,279
Anyway, let's be funny...

77
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,073
For her.

Hey, will you hand me those
blood gas reports, Sonia?

84
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:37,656
You can call me Sunny.

85
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,760
My dad nicknamed me that because
he said I brighten up a room.

86
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,517
Of course in college,
I had a few dark years.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,448
My car was stolen.
I had three--

88
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:48,650
Was it three?
No, four--

89
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:50,470
I had four abortions.

90
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,420
I'm joking.
[laughs]

91
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,801
I'm gonna kill you
with a hammer.

92
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,472
[laughs]

93
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:57,994
Why are you laughing?

94
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,531
'Cause I'm scared.
I'm not that strong.

95
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,376
So...
How was last night, Denise?

96
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,764
I ended up staying here
and finishing my casework.

97
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,042
What the hell?

98
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,697
I mean, at least with my patients,
I'm used to being ignored,

99
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:13,660
like with Mr. Cooper,
after his triple bypass.

100
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,174
I told him to start
eating healthier.

101
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,292
He goes right back to
scarfing down bacon burgers.

102
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,418
And do you want to know
where he is now, denise?

103
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:21,019
He's dead, isn't he?

104
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,796
No, he--
just moved back to Phoenix.

105
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,752
I was going to say that he was
dead, but I think saying that

106
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:28,170
about people who are
still alive is a huge jinx.

107
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:31,068
Look, when I kicked you out
of the hospital last night...

108
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,169
[cell phone ringing]

109
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,010
Please don't be Mr. Cooper dead.
Please don't be Mr. Cooper dead.

110
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,941
Nope, just my mom.

111
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:38,089
Ignore.

112
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,688
Look, I promise I'll get out
of the hospital tonight, okay?

113
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:44,264
Deal. Now come on. I want
you guys both to see this case.

114
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,909
She's a 16-year-old girl
with cyclical neutropenia.

115
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,006
It's a rare disorder
that periodically shuts down

116
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,777
her entire immune system.

117
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,752
Basically, every three weeks
she almost dies.

Hey Briana. Mrs. Tarasi.

119
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:58,224
Just wanted to introduce you
to Sunny and Denise.

covering the floor today.

Oh, cool.

00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:04,197
If you guys give my your cell numbers,
I can text you if I need anything?

123

and their cell phones.

124
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,175
Our generation
never had that stuff.

125
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:10,705
Yeah.

126
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,119
I just kind of feel like,
I don't know,

127
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,974
there's three generations
in the room right now.

128
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:19,717
If you want to instant message me,
my screen name is SunnyHoneyBunny.

129
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,051
Of course it is.

130
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:22,395
Do you have teenagers?

131
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:24,017
How old do you think I am?

132
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:27,294
What's up?

133
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,268
Where have you been?

134
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,165
- Oh.
- How could you be late?!

135
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:31,968
This is our sketch show!

[grunts and screams]

137
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:37,777
That's cool, man.
It's just a sketch show.

138
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:39,733
<i>Our sketch show!</i>

139
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:43,696
Okay, let's assign sketches.
Partner up, please.

[Door closes]
Yikes. Um...

141
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,717
I'll be with Denise.

142
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,354
Problem solved.

143
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,183
Yay. Can we go now?

144
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,586
Good morning.

145
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,205
Okay, I think we should
just get this out in the open.

146
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:03,049
I saw you pluck your...
special hair, the other day.

147
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:06,577
[imitates springing noises]

148
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:11,089
Boing, boing.
[imitates violin playing]

149
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,434
I was there. I saw.

150
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,674
Question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

151
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,037
I have an idea. Let me speak first.
May I? Good.

152
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,200
I believe that you should
give me the hair,

153
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:22,183
Because I have been scrapbooking the most
disgusting things that I could think of,

154
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,096
and I want to put it
on the page in between

155
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:29,448
my decayed molars and my snug,
which is, a snail/slug hybrid

156
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:33,331
that I was able to splice together
in my garage, unsuccessfully.

157
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,996
We didn't see
each other yesterday.

158
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,222
Well, that was unexpected.

159
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,337
Thank you.

160
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:46,446
Okay, Briana,
your chest X-ray looks good.

161
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,197
We should be able
to get you home tomorrow.

162
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,122
I'm just gonna go talk to your mom
about some changes in your medication.

163
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,383
Aren't moms the greatest?

164
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,516
My mom bought me these scrubs
last week just because.

165
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,186
Oh, and this morning
I found this little note.

166
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,166
It says,
"you're super special."

167
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,441
If that's what moms do,
I'm glad I never met mine.

168
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:08,010
[chuckles] "Look at me.
I'm dark and edgy."

169
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:11,272
I love my mom, but I wish
she would ease up a little.

170
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,714
I mean, I know I'm sick,
but not all the time,

171
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,690
and she still never
lets me leave the house.

172
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,895
You know,
I've never had a date.

173
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,669
It's like she's
so freaked out about me dying

174
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:22,375
that she won't
let me have a life.

175
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,036
- She doesn't want your stupid note.
- [whispers] You don't know that.

176
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:31,117
Do I know you?

177
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,417
I'm a friend.

178
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,887
What is Jimmy the overly
touchy orderly doing here?

179
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,056
Dude, he does amazing
impressions. He's a ringer.

180
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:42,479
We could put him in any bit that's not
working, like the Dr. Wen sketch.

181
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,701
[claps] It's almost showtime.
Let's work out some of the kinks.

182
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,869
You guys doing
the Dr. Cox sketch,

183
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,710
<i>make sure you really</i>

184
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,865
stretch out
all your words, okay?

185
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,080
And under no circumstances
are you to tell him that

186
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,391
I wrote the joke implying
he may have a sports car

187
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:02,452
because he has a small penis--
unless he finds it hilarious,

188
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,509
At which point,
you will break character

189
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,121
and say, "John Dorian
wrote that joke."

190
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,873
I will then stand,
give a humble nod like so

191
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,180
and then gesture
for you to continue.

192
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,973
Megan,
you're playing Carla.

193
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,216
That's my wife.
Please show some respect.

194
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,071
Kathy, you're playing Elliot.

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,342
So I want to see some bug eyes,
all right? And-- perfect.

196
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,441
Plus find some cardboard. 

197
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,645
Stick it down the back
of your pants, right?

198
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,817
Make that ass flat, girl.
Let me see what you got right now.

199
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,710
- Yeah, we can go flatter.
- We can go flatter.

200
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,802
- We can go flatter!
- You know what?

201
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,736
I've chewed on that thing
and it's flatter than day-old beer.

202
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:37,023
You know what? I made a funny.
Turk, rewrite.

203
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:38,862
¶ I am already on it ¶

204
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,241
Katie, dynamite
Beardfacé costume.

205
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,679
I can't see anything in this.

206
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:47,470
Performers find a way, Katie.
Use your other senses.

207
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,161
[J.D.] Where are
Sunny and Denise?

208
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:53,230
Well, you know, they're supposed
to be--no, thank you. Cool.

209
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,865
They're supposed
to be playing us,

210
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,002
but they haven't picked up
their scripts or anything.

211
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,932
Hey, Dr. Reid, could we talk
to you about Briana?

212
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:01,783
Her mom is being
way too overprotective.

213
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,864
Unfortunately, milady,
I saw what I saw.

214
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:09,080
You either plucked a giant hair,
or you have mini chest snakes.

215
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:11,355
Maybe you're
just imagining things.

216
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,598
Like that time you thought
you'd built a giant sand castle

217
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,855
in the parking lot, or the time
you said you hung J.D. up like a flag,

218
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,760
totally defying
the laws of physics.

219
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:20,120
I did those things.

220
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,879
Did you?

221
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,818
At least I thought I-- Head games
aren't going to work on me.

222
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,332
Unfortunately for you,
I have a photographic memory.

223
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:31,421
For instance, I arrived
here yesterday at 7:45 a.m.

224
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,900
At 7:50 a.m., I took a nap.
At 2:45 p.m.,

225
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,722
I awoke to find you plucking
a comically large hair

226
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,409
off of your baby feeder.

227
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,518
I then took my afternoon nap, then
I went on break, and then I went home.

228
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,624
Couldn't sleep a wink.
Damnedest thing.

229
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,128
Sad.

230
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,037
Stop walking away from me.

231
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,786
And now I'm sleepy again.
 [mutters]

232
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:56,578
Briana should totally get to live her
life. I'm gonna go talk to her mom.

233
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,130
But you guys gotta
do me a favor.

234
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,321
She's really
starting to get in my head

235
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:00,866
with this whole
"we're the same age" thing.

236
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,720
So I'm just gonna start
throwing out numbers,

237
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,259
and you guys stop me whenever I get to
the age you think I look like, okay?

238
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:09,162
22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 25.

239
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,091
You know what? This is
a really stupid game, okay?

240
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,074
Aren't you guys late
for some sketch show?

241
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:13,943
Crap.

242
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:16,046
[sighs] Idiots.

243
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:20,741
- Isn't this fun, running together?
- Shut up, sunny!

244
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:27,758
- Oh, my god. I'm so nervous.
- Welcome to live theater.

245
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,017
[light applause]

246
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,806
[imitating Kelso] I'm Bob Kelso,
and my life is so empty

247
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,131
that I still
come here every day

248
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,816
to stuff my face with muffins.

249
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,123
And I like prostitutes.

250
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,288
[laughter]

251
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,903
[laughs] That's funny
'cause it's true.

252
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,854

00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,454

hey, I'm The Todd.

254
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:55,114
Wow, looks like we got a full house.
I got a full house in my pants. Boom!

255
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,314

Hello, I'm Dr. Beardface.

257
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,761
I was up all night sewing.

258
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,107
My beard is only this big.

259
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:08,072
Lighten up Seymour,
I took my lumps.

260
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:11,826
Okay, one last chance to admit
the truth before this gets ugly.

261
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,538
- Did I see the nurple hair or not?
- You did not.

262
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,037
- [Katie] Beardface!
- Mm. And so it begins.

263

[imitating Dr. Wen]
Hi. I'm Dr. Wen,

264
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,399
and it's an honor to have you
as a patient, Owen Wilson !

265
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:23,669
[imitating Owen Wilson]
Oh come on, Doc!

266
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,256
What about patient-doctor privacy, huh?
How is that supposed to make me feel?

267
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,902
Mr. Jack Black.

268
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,063

Thanks buddy!

00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:39,720
[imitating Brad Pitt]
Thank you, Dr Wen.

272
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:42,749
I do have to say,
it's very hard covering medical bill

273
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,790
when you have 14 children,
ha ha! [grunts]

274

You know, people always ask me

275

"Hey, hey, Dane Cook!
Hey Dane Cook!"

276
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:50,587
Yeah, they use my full name.

277
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,561
"Hey, what's the deal with
tongue depressors, huh?"

278
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,452
"Is it supposed to make
your tongue sad or something?"

279
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,188
Like, taste it--
"Oh, this muffin taste sad!"

280
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,315
Why do people find me funny?

too much Jimmy.

[J.D.] Off the stage, jimmy!

284
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,747
Okay, Jimmy, yay.

285
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:11,103
Hi, everyone. We're gonna do a sketch
about Dr. Dorian and Dr. Turk.

286
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,054
I don't even know
what we're supposed to do.

287
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,970
- Just follow my lead.
- [whispers] Okay.

288
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,958

00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:21,692
- Look at your mole!
- It's <i>huge</i>!

290
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,818
Here are those lab reports
you wanted, Turk.

291
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,214
Thanks.
I did need those, J.D.

292
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,948
- [J.D.] They're bombing.
- [Turk] Mm, serves them right.

293
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,529
Yeah, who cares about them?
We did it! We did the whole thing.

294
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,882
Good-bye, J.D.
Thank you so much for ev--

295
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,001
Shh.

296
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,913
[audience gasps]

297
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:42,930
How is that funny?

298
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,977
[laughing]

299
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,717
[cheering and whistling]

300
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,101
Hey, Dr. Reid, did you get
a chance to talk to Briana's mom?

301
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:55,907
- Well, I'll tell you--
- Hey, Denise!

302
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,141
We're all going out for drinks
to celebrate. You want to come?

303
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,037
No, I'm gonna stay and study.

304
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,019
And you broke your promise
yet again. Shocking.

305
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,655
Look, I promise I'll go out
tomorrow night, okay?

306
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,651
So what did Briana's mom say?

307
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,604
You know, I've been
thinking about it.

308
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,426
I mean, we have really no idea
what that woman's going through.

309
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,979
I mean, who's to say that she
isn't right to be so cautious?

310
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,760
After all,
it's her daughter.

311
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:19,138
So I decided
not to talk to her.

312
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:20,825
It's really
none of our business.

313
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,005
[cell phone beeps]

314
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,885
<i>Today was the fifth anniversary
of the time Turk and I</i>

315
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,865
<i>met David Caruso
on a Ferris wheel.</i>

316
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,495
<i>Usually to celebrate,
Turk would lift me in the air</i>

317
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:46,195
<i>while I straddled him
and yelled, "eagle!"</i>

318
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:49,479
<i>But this morning I somehow knew
that wasn't gonna happen.</i>

319
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,809
- Hey.
- Hey.

320
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,832
<i>Eagle!</i>

321
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,081
<i>Elliot didn't seem
like herself either.</i>

322
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,770
I don't care what you think
is right for Briana, okay?

323
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,571
If either one of you
hassles her mom,

324
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,805
there will be consequences--
bad ones.

325
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,985
Okay, why are you smiling?

326
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:09,271
I can't help it.
It's permanent.

327
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,690
Donny, muffin please?

328
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,633
Not bran.

329
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,290
Better.

330
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:18,606
What do you want?

331
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,723
I'm gettin' ready to torture
nurse Chest Whiskers.

332
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:21,920
But it's her word against mine,

333
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,190
so I need you to verify
yesterday's incident.

334
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:26,990
What incident?
I wasn't even here yesterday.

335
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:27,971
You were there.

336
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:31,599
Excuse me. What? Shh.
[whispers] He's standing right here.

337
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,823
[whispers] Me?

338
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,728
Okay, I'll tell him.

339
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:38,890
My muffin thinks you're crazy,
and she wants you to go.

340
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:41,146
You tell your muffin
that I think she's crazy,

341
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,147
Maybe <i>she</i> should go.

342
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:43,840
No.

343
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,095
What is happening to me?

344
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:52,543
Nice job.

345
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:56,301
[Denise] That lady has no idea
what's good for her daughter.

346
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,992
I know. I just want to go
over there and smush her face.

347
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,623
So this is you mad?

348
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:04,306
Did you hear me?
I'd like to <i>smush</i> it!

349
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,998
So go talk to her.

350
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,714
I mean, you're both
sort-of-almost doctors.

351
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:11,299
Part of that is doing
what you think is right.

352
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:13,542
- Let's do this.
- Okay, try to act tough.

353
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:15,108
And forget it.

354
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,893
Oh, so now we can't sit
on the same side of the table?

355
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:22,201
We never do that.

356
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,631
We always do up here.

357
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,917
Why did that sketch
bother us so much?

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,080
- We've always joked about our little--
- Don't say it, okay? I hate that word.

359
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,571
It's a bromance, Turk.
You can't fight it.

360
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,305
It never bothered me before
because I thought it was

361
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,004
our stupid little joke that
Elliot and Carla were in on,

362
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,466
but I didn't know that's how
the whole hospital views us, man.

363
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,694
J.D.?

364
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:44,790
Pretty great, huh?

365
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,637
Well, when you're right,
you're right.

366
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,730
- So how's your day going?
- It's pretty good so far.

367
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,135
I see you're eating bread again.
I thought you were off carbs.

368
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,070
J.D.!

369
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,899
I-I'm sorry. I'm back.
Continue.

370
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:56,382
We're senior staff now, so...

371
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,930
Maybe at work we should
tone down the P.D.A.

372
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,828
I agree.
But does that include--

373
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,348
It definitely
includes "Eagle."

374
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,025
Oh. Good.

375
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,506
Oh, look at that.
I'm not hungry anymore.

376
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,100
Briana has so much
to deal with right now.

377
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,710
Just seems like you should
let her enjoy

378
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,061
every normal moment she can

379
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:19,155
instead of forcing her
to hide from life all the time.

380
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,845
As much as I hate
to agree with Dr. ...

381
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:22,891
Dey.

382
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,598
- Your name is Sunny Day?
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:29,565
Okay, as ridiculous as it was for
her parents to name her that,

384
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,076
I think what you're doing with Briana
is a thousand times worse.

385
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,020
My daughter's immune system
doesn't work.

386
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:37,499
Why don't you two tell me
what it's like when your child

387
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,174
risks death
every time she shakes hands?

388
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:42,655
Do you think I care one bit
what you think?

389
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:44,526
We tried.

390
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,599
You know, yesterday Dr. Reid
came in and gave me

391
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:50,893
the same sanctimonious speech,
and I told her the exact same thing.

392
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,521
Hey, what's going on over here?

393
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:57,289
Everything okay?

394
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:58,908
I'm great.

395
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,082
I just don't know
what's real anymore.

396
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,986
But that's okay, right?

397
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:06,173
I mean, so what
if big chunks of my life

398
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,228
were just figments
of my imagination?

399
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,351
So I never went to China
and had a baby with a local.

400
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,001
Maybe I was never
in "The Fugitive."

401
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,843
Listen, this place can
make anyone crazy.

402
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,076
Once, after a double shift,

403
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,199
I swore I went home
and crawled into bed with Turk.

404
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,880
Next thing, I woke up in the
on call room, spooning Dr. Beardface.

405
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,174
Now the guy's always
slipping me hotel keys.

406
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,678
[laughs]

407
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,911
Can't believe you're being so nice
to me when I almost punished you

408
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,466
for something
that never even happened.

409
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:37,043
Please accept my apologies.

410
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:42,788
That was easier than I thought.

411
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,803
No, Beardface.

412
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:51,180
I'm so proud of you, man.

413
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:52,988
You know, I've always emulated you.

414
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,822
I shave my privates bald
to look like your head.

415
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,925
Todd, I'm actually
kind of touched.

416
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,367
Come on.

417
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,226
What's going on?

418
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,575
They're gonna publish
my old therapy paper.

419
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,160
<i>There it was.</i>

420
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,550
<i>He wanted a hug, and I damn
sure wanted to give him one.</i>

422
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,068
<i>But all we could do
was say this...</i>

423
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,262
Congrats.

424
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,446
Thanks, man.

425
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,864
<i>Don't look back.
Fight it. Fight it.</i>

426
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,282
<i>Damn it, you're only human.</i>

427
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:22,999
[voice echoes] Turk!

428
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,134
[panting] I ran
all the way around.

429
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,180
¶ It's guy love, don't compromise ¶
People are gonna look.

430
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:35,927
What people?
¶ It's guy love, between two guys ¶

431
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,601
[slaps back]

432
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,656
Why'd you lie about
talking to Briana's mom?

433
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:48,060
Uh, I'm going first. Why did you go talk
to her after I told you to drop it?

434
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,886
It's not fair
what her mom's doing.

435
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:51,470
And why is that?

436
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:52,875
I don't know.
Because people need to be able

437
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,618
to go out and do things
and live life.

438
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,555
Where have I heard
that before?

439
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,948
Oh, yeah, It's the exact same advice
I've given you 9,000 times.

440
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,919
So you had me get crushed by
that mom just to prove a point?

441
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:06,137
She even had me give you a little push
so you wouldn't wimp out.

442
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:08,111
I'm very bright.

443
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:11,081
Look, I've been there.
I did what you did.

444
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,079
I was an intern.
I've lived at this hospital.

445
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,582
I saw the same exact people
day after day,

446
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,788
which, for the record, makes even
the uggos look attractive after a while.

447
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:22,032
Oh, is <i>that</i> how you got
together with Dr. Dorian?

448
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:25,179
What? No!
Well, maybe at first.

449
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:26,195
No.

450
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:28,322
No.

451
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,772
<i>Sometimes interns
think they know it all,</i>

452
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,967
<i>But the lessons really
never stop coming.</i>

453
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:35,538
<i>Whether you've heard it
a thousand times...</i>

454
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,830
For the last time, get out
of here every once in a while,

455
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,520
Or this place
will swallow you up.

456
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:41,813
What about Briana?

457
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:43,493
<i>Or it's something totally new.</i>

458
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:46,309
So much crappy stuff
happens here all day long.

459
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,840
The best way to get past it
is do what I do.

460
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,385
Just pretend
it never happened.

461
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,623
Hey, sorry again.

462
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,312
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

463
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,061
<i>Of course, some lessons
you pick up on your own...</i>

464
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:05,450
I just got the urge
to buy you a shirt.

465
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:07,486
Well, then, to the mall!

466
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:08,742
Mount up.

467
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,192
Eagle!

468
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,261
<i>Like how important it is
to have a good friend here</i>

469
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,603
<i>to help you get through it.</i>

470
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,044
Anyone sitting here?

471
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,772
Not just anyone. You.

472
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,193
Okay, no more talking
until I'm drunk, okay?

473
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,726
[speaks indistinctly]

474
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,899
Partner up, please.

475
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,058
Val, please don't make a sign
that says "Loser"

476
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,959
with an arrow pointing towards Jo.

477
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,140
Ha ha, now it's--
Now it's pointing towards me.

478
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,270
Very clever. Turk, will you
get the sign, please?

479
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:52,501
- I am on it. Val!
- You guys are doctors.

480
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,260
- I'm tellin' you!
- This is unprofessional.

481
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,059
Got it.

482
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:57,635
This is a different "Loser" sign.

483
00:20:57,718 --> 00:21:00,703
Where is the original "Loser" sign?
There's two now.

484
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,266
- Right there.
- Okay. Can you get that one, please?

485
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,352
I think we should stop
looking for the sign

486
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:06,478
and start looking for the sharpie.

487
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:08,344
'Cause we're
losing control here.

488
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,167
We are not losing control.

489
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:12,500
Okay who wrote that?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
