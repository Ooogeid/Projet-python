1
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:04,767
Hey JD!

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,067
You keep wheeling them in,
I keep wheeling them out.

3
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,189
Awesome! Appropriateness Doug.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,744
Carol. We’re ready for
our sponge bath.

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,587
Thank you, Carol.

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,821
Hey. Why was your baby boy dress
like ceasar, this morning?

7
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,180
I don't have clothe
for Sam in my house,

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,592
so I just cut arm and
leg holes in a pillow case

9
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,799
The gold belt was just so
he wouldn’t feel ridiculous.

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,889
JD, you’re a parent now,
you gotta be better prepared.

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,961
Yeah. That’s why we just stocked up
on extra baby oil lotion and diapers

12
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,873
Why? Is there a party this week-end?

13
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,323
Recently
we realized that with todd,

14
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:40,538
if we didn't move
and stayed very quiet,

15
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:42,917
he'd eventually
get confused and leave.

16
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,745
Anyway.

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,323
Much like one-hit wonder
natalie imbruglia, I'm torn.

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,147
You see, on one hand, I'm
tempted to side with the gandhis.

19
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,244
You do need to buy
sam some clothes.

20
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,359
On the other hand, ever
since you two made a baby,

21
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,583
you've become an even more
annoying 2-headed know-it-all.

22
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:02,220
You hear that, perry?

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,974
That's the sound of your hate
bouncing off our love.

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,105
Attention, dumb-dumbs.

25
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,831
Many of you have been disregarding

26
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:13,042
the hospital's
12-hour shift policy.

27
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:16,098
Now, I don't care if you think
your patients need you,

28
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,849
when your shift is over,
I want you to go home

29
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,176
to your sad, empty lives.

30
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:23,094
Tired doctors make mistakes,

31
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:25,207
and the hospital is liable.

32
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:28,697
Believe me, you do not want to
find yourself in a court of law.

33
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,700
Tell them what happens there, ted.

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,761
Well, the law wear long black robes

35
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,029
and beautiful white curly wigs.

36
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,411
- That's england, ted.
- Are you sure?

37
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,783
Anyway, from now on,

38
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:44,997
anyone caught working
after their shift is over

39
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:48,447
will be sent home immediately
and docked a full day's pay.

40
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:49,649
Ciao.

41
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:54,283
Well, marian, your hepatitis
test came back negative.

42
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:56,747
- That's good, right?
- Yes and no.

43
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,623
I still don't know
what's wrong with you.

44
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:01,536
Well, you'll figure it out.
You're a good doctor.

45
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,801
Will do.

46
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,644
Hey, I'm going to lunch.

47
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,597
I took her culture
to the lab for you.

48
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,570
- Thanks, keith.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,890
Sounds like he's finally over you.

50
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,532
No, he's still alternating
between angry name calling

51
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,521
and whiny pleas
to get back together.

52
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,535
Although he did agree to be civil

53
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:22,423
while he's inside the hospital.

54
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,522
Hello?

55
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,587
Why won't you love me?!

56
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,935
- Why don't you...
- See you tomorrow, keith.

57
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,801
Can you believe a month ago
you were gonna marry him

58
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,487
and I was gonna move in with kim,

59
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,072
and it all fell apart
when we had that almost-moment

60
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:38,649
in the on-call room?

61
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,912
You know, we never
talked about that.

62
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,379
What's there to talk about?
You just tried to kiss me.

63
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,618
I tried to kiss her? What the hell?

64
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,148
Wait a second,

65
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:51,399
there's nobody here to see
my "what the hell?" Face.

66
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,385
What is it? And make it
quick so you don't bore me.

67
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:58,143
A few months ago elliot and I almost
kissed, but now she's saying...

68
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,553
Well, you tried
your best. Now leave me alone.

69
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,319
Slagy, you're up.

70
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,430
A genetic defect that
presents with anemia

71
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,500
and causes copper build up in the liver
and other organs, destroying them.

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,131
What is wilson's disease?

73
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,129
Yes.

74
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,107
Yes! In your face, in your face

75
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,258
what annoying thing
is happening now?

76
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,776
They're playing diagnosis jeopardy.

77
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,681
When you win, you get
to gloat. It's so stupid.

78
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,433
You never got to gloat, did you?

79
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,968
I don't believe in gloating,
it's tacky.

80
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:26,965
"A condition in which the patient
speaks in previously unknown dialect

81
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,814
due to severe brain trauma."

82
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,385
What is foreign accent syndrome?!

83
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:33,088
Yes! In your faces!
Or should I say...

84
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,006
In your faces.

85
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,956
Hello, governor.

86
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:40,308
Throw another shrimp
on the barbie for me.

87
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,052
- Wait, that's irish.
- You're an idiot.

88
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,352
Now I have to go start work,

89
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,936
because in spite of all of you,
i'm going to have a great day.

90
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:52,588
That was the worst day
I've ever had.

91
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,736
- Daddy's home!
- Come here, jacky boy.

92
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,035
Give me a big kiss.
I love you. Good night.

93
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,249
Where the hell are you going?
It's your night to tell him a story.

94
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,583
Oh, no, no, no. I  couldn't be
more wiped out.

95
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:02,921
The nanny's mom died,

96
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,747
and I had to spend the whole
day sprinting around the house

97
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:06,616
trying to avoid having
conversations with her.

98
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:09,298
You don't see me crying about it.
So suck it up and spin a yarn.

99
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,281
Yeah, dad, suck it up.

100
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,088
Ok, jacky.

101
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,593
Will do.

102
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:21,445
There was once a nurse, a surgeon,

103
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:23,938
a doctor, and an idiot.

104
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:26,369
Does this hat make me look fly?

105
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,342
Perry, he's 4. No hospital stories.

106
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,748
Fine.

107
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:34,308
There was once a 2-headed witch,

108
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:39,138
a princess, and a village idiot.

109
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,500
Does this hat make me look fly-ith?

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,690
It jingles when I shake it.

114
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,777
- N there?
- yep.

115
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,746
Ok, here we go.

116
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:06,734
Once upon a time, a long time ago,

117
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,564
there was a little village
known as sacred heartia.

118
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,345
Dammit, giant.

119
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,601
Why is this village so filthy?

120
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,641
Well, irritable
towns woman of color,

121
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:22,645
it could be because this
town's roads are paved with mud.

122
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,845
Or maybe it's because I've been swabbing
everyone's porch with ox urine.

123
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,817
I jest. Only yours.

124
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:31,214
You know why? You've been
telling people I eat babies.

125
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,713
I don't eat babies. With babies,
it's a minute on the lips,

126
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,646
a lifetime on the hips.
I eat toddlers.

127
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,697
I thought you said
she'd be dead already.

128
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,983
Come back later. Say,
do you have any babies...

129
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,385
Toddlers on that cart?

130
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,829
- Nope.
- Well, off to work.

131
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,753
On the outskirts of town,

132
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,935
the princess' handmaiden
was in dire straights,

133
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,010
so her highness sent out
a call for help.

134
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,137
- Good morrow.
- That's funny.

135
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,980
I requested someone
strong and brave,

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,898
and yet here stands
the village idiot.

137
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:05,966
Hey, I'm brave. I just saved this
fish from drowning.

138
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,671
Off you go, little buddy.

139
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:11,175
He's tired now.

140
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,665
Earlier he was dancing all around.

141
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,394
- Run free! Run!
- now, this was no ordinary idiot.

142
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,705
- He was a colossal idiot.
- Run free! Andale!

143
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:23,037
I mean such an idiot
that other idiots would...

144
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,962
- daddy!
- I'm very sorry, dear.

145
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,205
I just wanted to be
real clear with you

146
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,372
about how big an idiot
he actually was.

147
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:32,372
In any case, the princess and the idiot

148
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,490
had had a sorted past.

149
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,710
Look, your highness,

150
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,303
I just came by so you could apologize
for saying I tried to kiss you

151
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:40,343
when in fact, it was
your royal tongue

152
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,377
that tried to storm
my mouth castle.

153
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,302
That's not how I recall it.

154
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,161
Come on, you closed your eyes

155
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,973
and started heaving
your bosoms up and down

156
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:52,058
- and up and down.
- Yeah, that's called breathing.

157
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,722
I'm doing it now.

158
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,919
I know. Can I rest my face on them

159
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,487
- and ponder what you've said?
- No.

160
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,992
My poor maiden is being
tormented by a terrible monster.

161
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,031
She grows weaker by the minute.

162
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,484
A monster?

163
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,062
I mean, she looks ill,

164
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,245
but I think it's a bit of a leap
to say it's the work of a monster.

165
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,771
There's a monster in there.

166
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,489
J.d., she's febrile,
her liver's enlarged,

167
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,734
and her kidney's are shutting down.

168
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,372
Are you gonna help me, or not?

169
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,574
I will.

170
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,362
Keith.

171
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,030
Perhaps if I can save your maiden,

172
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,844
the soul of your heart will soften

173
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:38,860
so I can once again plant
the seed of our love.

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,137
Yeah, look, prince,
this, it's not happening, ok?

175
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,223
Time to move on.
Now, if you don't mind,

176
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:46,399
i'd like to get back
the key to my chastity belt.

177
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,856
Fine.

178
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,320
Come on, peppermint.

179
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,405
That is going to make
so many things so much easier.

180
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,451
Why'd you send him away?
We could have used his help.

181
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,792
- We... Help... Highness.
- Can... Your...

182
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,978
the turla
was once 2 separate witches.

183
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,113
But when they married,
they merged into one.

184
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,436
It made for some
awkward situations.

185
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,443
That's... I'm... What... Talking...

186
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,949
About.

187
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,332
Turla, how can we
defeat the monster?

188
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,976
We... Go... The... Must... To...

189
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:29,395
- Delicatessen.
- What?

190
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,850
I knew they just did that
alternating words thing to bug me.

191
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,500
Now, meet us at the potion shop

192
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,812
so we can get a spell
to stop that monster.

193
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,944
But first we must
stop at the drug store.

194
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,230
I need to pick up something
for her time of the month.

195
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,959
It's our time of the month.

196
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,680
Is that why I keep
crying for no damn reason?

197
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,266
'cause I didn't ask for this.

198
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,619
Do we look fat?

199
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,101
We look beautiful, baby.

200
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,713
- You sure?
- We do.

201
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,517
How are we gonna get there?

202
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:53,880
Don't worry, I got a sweet ride.

203
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,780
This is mortifying.

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,795
Don't listen to her, sasha.

205
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,920
Idiot, I have to ask.

206
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,619
How do you get your hair like that?

207
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,667
You like it? I do it myself.

208
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,804
It's one part horse manure,
one part river mud,

209
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:12,202
and a touch of
my special ingredient.

210
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,147
It's the dark lord's toadie.

211
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,209
My master approaches.

212
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,780
Prepare yourselves for
his untamed vengeance.

213
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,748
The dark lord oslek

214
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,402
was the evil ruler
of the entire land.

215
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,998
Hey, gang, how you holding up?

216
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:32,285
That is a sharp-looking donkey.

217
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,460
Told you.

218
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,332
No speaking!

219
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,223
A warning to all,

220
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,990
any who dare step foot
in my forbidden forest

221
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,750
shall fall and disappear.

222
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,971
I was in the forbidden
forest earlier today and I'm still here.

223
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,034
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

224
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,501
What? Where?

225
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,028
Murphy's shift ended
20 minutes ago,

226
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,763
and he was still here. So now
he's going home without pay.

227
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:01,389
If anyone would like
to join him, test me.

228
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,473
I should at least take
that body downstairs.

229
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,702
I said out!

230
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,104
Take care of that.

231
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,404
Aw, man.

232
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:20,097
There goes my back.

233
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,565
Where you guys able to get
that c-diff test I ordered?

234
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,207
Lab's all backed up.

235
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:27,910
We need those results now.

236
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,754
I'll handle this.

237
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,058
I'll stay here.

238
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,283
God help me, I wish you could.

239
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,483
We need a monster-fighting potion.

240
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,149
Sorry, this customer here is next.

241
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,520
What the hell are you?

242
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,387
I'm the fairy todd something.

243
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,751
Well, step aside,
lest you be dealt with.

244
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,371
Turk, wand.

245
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,502
Yeah, um, about the wand,

246
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,544
I may have let the idiot borrow it.

247
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,737
Aw, man.

248
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,748
You know, I have a big
wand if you want to hold it.

249
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,931
Of course, when it comes
to magic, I just do this.

250
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:08,709
Fairy five.

251
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,099
Turk, no.

252
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,437
You don't let us go first,

253
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,299
i'll never let him
high five you again.

254
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,705
After you.

255
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,647
Still can high five five?

256
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:18,834
Comin' at ya.

257
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,796
I love slapping people five.

258
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:26,391
Your shoelace is untied.

259
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,126
Hey, thanks, man.

260
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:29,793
You know how dangerous this is?

261
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,550
My uncle's whole family
was killed by an untied lace.

262
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,126
Christmas morning, they were
all running down the stairs,

263
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,981
they tripped, and a mad man
hacked them all to pieces.

264
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,857
- I owe you one.
- Can't wait.

265
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:42,075
Guess who got the lab results.

266
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,675
Oh, you guys are amazing.

267
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,376
Damn, the c-diff is negative.

268
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,127
She's getting worse,

269
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,316
and we're not any closer
to figuring out why.

270
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,373
I got to page him.

271
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:03,348
And now we wait.

272
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,162
Hey, can you get rid of this tail?

273
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,858
No problem, buddy.

274
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,065
- I meant with magic.
- He's here.

275
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,520
And then before them

276
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,983
appeared the bravest,
most handsome knight

277
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,113
that any of them had ever seen.

278
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,317
Princess.

279
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:26,297
Princess.

280
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:29,564
Brave knight,

281
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,063
my poor maiden is being held captive
by a monster that can't be beaten.

282
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:36,134
There is no such thing
as a monster that can't be beaten.

283
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,244
Hey, you. Hang on to that.

284
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:45,194
You know, I Miss hanging out with you.

285
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:46,829
Like, alone.

286
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,676
There's not much I can do.

287
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,760
Last night I had some grog with a guy

288
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,702
whe hutmate is a barrel maker.

289
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,886
Let's just say the guy has a saw.

290
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:57,145
Be careful, or I'll make
your chin disappear.

291
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:00,088
- Oh, too late.
- That's not nice.

292
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:02,689
Look, the battle has begun.

293
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,298
My name is percible cox.

294
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,107
You're killing my friend.

295
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,713
Prepare to die.

296
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:23,457
Well, that's new.

297
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,534
I don't know what's scarier,

298
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,589
the monster or that scary old lady.

299
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,142
What scary old lady?

300
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,821
Very funny.

301
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,542
Perry, it's his bedtime.

302
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,274
- But, jordan.
- But, mom.

303
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,643
No buts. Lights out.

304
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,049
Jacky.

305
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,297
Would you like to hear
the rest of the story?

306
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:46,398
Yeah.

307
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,470
Let's see, where was i?

308
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,197
Oh, I remember.
Scoot up for a second.

309
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,165
Give me some sugar. All right.

310
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,934
The knight was getting
his ass kicked.

311
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,409
That's new.

312
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,588
What's the monster like?
Is he nice?

313
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,817
That monster cannot be
slain by sword alone.

314
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,620
Baby, maybe you can
lull the monster to sleep

315
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,368
by telling him one of them boring-ass
stories about your family.

316
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:28,870
That's it.

317
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:32,403
Are you out your mind, woman?
We only got one ball.

318
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:33,642
You were saying?

319
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,014
The only way to save
your fair maiden

320
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,069
is to go to the forbidden forest

321
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,981
and find the golden ring.

322
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,980
The golden ring? Why?

323
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,732
Because finding the diagnosis

324
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,725
is the only way to help her.

325
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,133
Right now you're just
treating symptoms

326
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,805
that are leading you
down the wrong road.

327
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:49,604
You need to go
back to the beginning,

328
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,412
back to every textbook, every
case study you ever read.

329
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:55,741
And most importantly,
to find the golden ring,

330
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,877
you must rember what you heard

331
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,883
when you weren't even listening.

332
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,821
Remember what you heard when
you weren't even listening.

333
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,037
What the hell does that mean?

334
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,836
I don't know, but I can't
find anything in here

335
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,693
to her kidney malfunction,
her lack of clotting,

336
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:09,379
and the internal bleeding.

337
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:12,320
I feel like we're just getting
lost deeper in the woods.

338
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:19,672
- Your ass is bleeding.
- Sasha, are you ok?

339
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:23,110
- No, idiot, your ass is bleeding.
- I know, my tail was ripped off.

340
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,103
If it doesn't scab over,
my soul will leak out.

341
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,076
Why you looking at
my ass, anyway, princess?

342
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,778
Missing what you could have had
when you tried to kiss me earlier?

343
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:33,571
Good morrow!

344
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,473
Idiot, princess,

345
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,315
you shouldn't be
in the forbidden forest.

346
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,571
The dark lord is near. Hide!

347
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,083
Come on, sasha.

348
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:52,800
They're gone.

349
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,344
Thanks.

350
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:58,188
Our shifts ended a half hour ago.
We would have been screwed.

351
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,934
Well, this counts as
the one I owe you.

352
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:02,297
- Fine, we're even.
- Excellent.

353
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:11,568
I'm going to miss those two.

354
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,838
They never once spit on me.

355
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,724
You seem like a nice enough guy.

356
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,803
Why you still working
for lord oslek?

357
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:21,624
I tell most people it's
because I'm under an evil spell,

358
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,902
but really it's
a self-confidence thing.

359
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,407
Yeah, I get that.

360
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,022
Say, you want to go
hollow out some villagers

361
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,433
- and use them as kites?
- Do i?

362
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:44,799
I can't believe
i'm going to die with you.

363
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,821
Who said anything about dying?

364
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,926
It's probably just
some harmless torture.

365
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:51,382
He's right, it's not that bad.

366
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,874
Since we meet
our fate together, I should tell you,

367
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,525
'twas I that tried to kiss you.

368
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,306
No, milady.

369
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,390
We tried to kiss each other.

370
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,223
I know we were both
running away from things, but

371
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,080
do you think that
near-kiss meant anything?

372
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,827
There's only one way to find out.

373
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,025
- Almost there. Ok.
- Can you...

374
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,489
Little bit of tongue, maybe.

375
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:25,081
Your time has come.

376
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,867
- You're both suspended.
- You can't do that.

377
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,003
This is my hospital,
I can do whatever I want.

378
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,340
Get it?

379
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,376
Sir, you can't suspend me.
I'm private practice.

380
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,164
And I've had zero
patient interaction,

381
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,206
so there's no liability issue.

382
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,894
So this can't come back to me?

383
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,082
- No.
- No.

384
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:47,464
Then get out.

385
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,877
A dab of manure.

386
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:00,483
Now, where were we in that dungeon?

387
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,791
Focus.

388
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,608
We have to save my maiden.

389
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,735
But how are we supposed to
find a golden ring in an endless forest?

390
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,306
Remember what you heard when
you weren't even listening.

391
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,167
Am imagining him?

392
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,603
Imaging who?

393
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,625
Asked and answered.

394
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,888
Hey, idiot. Down here.

395
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,156
What's up, bro?

396
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,130
What lives?

397
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,511
I just remembered something.

398
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,548
I was barely listening.

399
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,947
A genetic defect that
presents with anemia

400
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,347
and causes copper build up
in the liver and other organs,

401
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,205
- destroying them.
- What is wilson's disease?

402
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,788
It's wilson's disease.

403
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:43,930
This is for you.

404
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,618
The golden ring.

405
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:54,651
We must make haste
back to the maiden.

406
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,328
To sasha!

407
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,519
We're doomed.

408
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,930
It's ok, I still have turla's wand.

409
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,549
What in the hell is going on?

410
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:07,563
Oops. Let me try that again.

411
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,878
Now that's more like it. Hold this.

412
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:27,883
Hang on, maiden! We're here!

413
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,678
How do we know for sure
it's wilson's disease?

414
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:53,583
She'll have copper deposits
around her iris.

415
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,561
What does it look like?

416
00:19:55,876 --> 00:20:00,007
A little... golden... ring.

417
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,639
That's a great diagnosis.

418
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,318
What are her chances?

419
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,289
We've done all we can.

420
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,060
Now she needs
a new liver, we just...

421
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,285
Got to hope she gets one on time.

422
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,511
And with the monster gone,

423
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:23,791
all was once again well
in sacred heartia.

424
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,127
The turla made peace with itself.

425
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,185
Beautiful kites were flown.

426
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:31,676
Yeah!

427
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:34,486
And the knight rode off
to fight again.

428
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,693
And the idiot and the princess?

429
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:42,873
Well, they decided that their
almost-kiss meant nothing.

430
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,233
Because in the end,

431
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,660
they were both idiots.

432
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,748
What about the maiden?

433
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:54,686
What do you think, jack?

434
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:57,069
She lived happily ever after.

435
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:03,459
Go to sleep. I love you very much.

436
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:07,553
So...

437
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:11,909
So what?

438
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,431
So did the girl make it?

439
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:14,758
Did she get her liver in time?

440
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,750
Is that how it really ended?

441
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:19,072
Let's just say...

442
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,977
That's the way i'm telling it.
