1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,762
Hey, Zeltzer.

2
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:02,966
My family is with me here today,
but all the tables are full.

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,486
Do you mind if we join
you for breakfast?

4
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:06,445
Not at all.
I get family.

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:09,447
I'm here so much
I hardly ever see my wife.

6
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:12,113
That's why I installed
a web camera at my house

7
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,154
so I can see her
during the day.

8
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:16,362
Right now, I'm watching
her do the Dishes.

9
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,763
Who in god's name are
those two naked people?

10
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:21,864
- That's Mr. and Mrs. Dish.
- Get out!

11
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:24,856
Hi, poppy.

12
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:28,683
FYI, I fired the cashier and the
person that made the scrambled eggs.

13
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:31,458
- Their accents were unintelligible.
- What are you talking about?

14
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:34,328
It's one of the benefits of
you being the Chief of Medicine.

15
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,432
I can fire people
under your auspices.

16
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,419
Also, I didn't have to pay for food.

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,371
I got three steaks.

18
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,824
Jordan, that's rid-
Give me one of these.

19
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,817
Why isn't he in preschool
right now?

20
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,387
'Cause he told me they have
the day off for Yom Kippur.

21
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,712
Yom Kippur was six months ago.

22
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,531
I hate school!

23
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,250
Never have been
more proud of you.

24
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:59,512
It's the password
to my webcam.

25
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,196
Think you're going to dig it.

26
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:07,031
Oh, babe.
You got a little smudge there.

27
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,398
- What is that, strawberry jam?
- No, just a little blood from shaving.

28
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:11,962
Oh. Sweety.

29
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,171
Don't worry.
I wasn't shaving myself.

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,371
Say, Jack?

31
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,878
Don't your think your mom
should be just a little embarrassed

32
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,978
since she's constantly being
outwitted by a 4-year old?

33
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:22,616
I hate school!

34
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:23,808
I remember.

35
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:27,345
Can you please not be a jackass
in front of the help?

36
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,486
- I'm gonna get going.
- Okay.

37
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:32,350
- We're still on for tonight, right?
- I'll answer that with this...

38
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,592
- I don't know what that means.
- You're so cute!

39
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:39,555
I'm actually baffled.
Am I gonna see her tonight or not?

40
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:43,465
Was either one of us giving you
a vibe that we gave a crap?

41
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:46,432
Because if so, that's an accident
and we're sorry.

42
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:47,886
Apology accepted.

43
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,996
You know, just because Lady and I
are clicking and you guys aren't

44
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:53,296
doesn't matter really.
Just means we're a better couple.

45
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,183
I'm just tired of him
saying I'm not a good parent.

46
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:58,554
- I am a great mom.
- Oh really?

47
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:00,572
Then where is your son Jack?

48
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:05,909
Damn it!

49
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:07,536
Jack!

00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,274

53
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,495
<i>the question wasn't whether

54
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>It was whether he would live.</i>

55
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,355
<i>Thankfully, Mr. Everett's both
alive and walking today,</i>

56
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:28,246
<i>thanks to an incredibly risky medical
procedure, called "cold therapy".</i>

57
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,665
<i>It's as unproven as
it is controversial,</i>

58

it'll still be pretty

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,184
'cause we're gonna need
to keep the nanny on for Izzy.

62
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:41,988
Are you even listening to me?

63
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,261
I'm not, baby.
But I was pretending to listen,

64
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,269
so I think we can both
agree that means I love you.

65
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,387
Turk, this is serious.
I worry about this stuff.

66
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:52,178
Baby, the only thing I'm worried
about is you having another girl.

67
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,242
- I'm surrounded by girls.
- Surrounded?

68
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:58,542
Yes, surrounded by girls, baby.
You, Izzy, Elliot.

69
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:00,699
- Who else?
- Hey!

70
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:04,852
What's that laugh about?
That laugh is never good for me.

71
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,099
- You're a girl.
- No I'm not.

72
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,193
- What's this show, is it new?
- It's <i>SportsCenter</i>, dude.

73
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,838
If you must do that witch cackle,
can you please do it in the hallway?

74
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,345
Thank you.

75
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:22,310
I've been watching this show
every day since I was 10 years old.

76
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,705
<i>We've asked you,
among many things today,</i>

77
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,770
<i>how do you feel about
the baseball, the football, the...</i>

78
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,171
So, they just sit there
and talk about sports?

79
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:32,287
Your wife is a dirty whore.

80
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:33,610
- Dude!
- Sorry, not dirty.

81
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,142
- Dude!
- Not a whore.

82
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,645
How cool would it be
to be on <i>SportsCenter</i>?

83
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,226
Welcome to <i>SportsCenter</i>.

84
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,849
America has voted.
The results are in.

85
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:45,422
And the worse athlete
in the world...

86
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,175
It's this guy right here.

87
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,612
I like wearing a helmet
'cause I can do this....

88
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,031
And it only hurts a little bit.

89
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:58,170
Congratulations, John Dorian.
You are a giant nerd.

90
00:03:58,713 --> 00:03:59,876
So cool.

<i>It's amazing watching
Turk do his thing.</i>

93
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,875
I haven't been to the future yet,

94
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,076
but I may be the
best surgeon of all time.

95
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,213
Close him up.

96
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,493
Nah nah nah,
nah nah nah.

97
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,425
What are you doing?

98
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:31,731
You were awesome,
just like on <i>SportsCenter</i>.

99
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,168
Nah nah nah,
nah nah nah.

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,806
Nah nah nah,
nah nah nah.

101
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,221
I know, that's what I did...

102
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:42,970
No, hold on a second.

103
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:46,257
Doe a deer.
No, it's do, it's a deer.

104
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:49,369
J.D., now is not
a good time, okay?

105
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:51,779
That kid broke his neck.

106
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,035
I want to thank you
for dinner last night.

107
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:00,520
I've eaten by candle light before,
but never by firefly light.

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,326
It was hard to get them all in the jugs,
but I thought that was worth it.

109
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,360
So what do you
want to do tonight?

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,567
I don't really want to hold
hands right now. Is that okay?

111
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,130
Sure.

112
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,632
You know, that's--
I'm fine with that, whatever.

113
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:15,632
Like teenage girls say,
whatever.

114
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:17,973
We're cool.

115
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,402
Okay, I'll call you.

116
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,673
Okay.

117
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:25,865
Hey, janitor.
Rock solid relationship there.

118
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,299
You know, there's nothing like
looking in someone's eyes

119
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,894
and seeing a part of them die.

120
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,603
There it goes.

121
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,837
Bye bye hope.

122
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:41,123
Everything is fine
between me and Lady.

123
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:42,860
And excuse me for
not having a relationship

124
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,601
built on a mutual affection
for jet-black hate.

125
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,278
We don't hate each other, do we?

126
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:50,193
A little bit, but we make it work.

127
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:53,023
- At least, I can hold your hand.
- There it is.

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,621
What's this?

129
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:57,372
What the hell?
Are you wearing a wedding ring?

130
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:58,834
You're just noticing that now?

131
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:01,428
He's been wearing it for months.

132
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,970
- Months?
- Gotta go.

133
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,036
I'm a cutter.

134
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:14,258
I usually say
"Surgery went great" or...

135
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,879
"He's not gonna make it,
I'm sorry."

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,756
I've never had to tell anyone
that their son is gonna be paralyzed

137
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,581
That's gotta suck.

138
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,965
I wish there was
an easier way to say this.

139
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:28,872
Mr. Hill.

140
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,107
Got you a card.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,686
Great to see you,
great to talk.

142
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,355
The bad new is...
your son can't walk.

143
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:45,324
And see, there's a picture

144
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:47,604
of a kitty cat
in a wheelchair.

145
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,672
Look at the cat, he's shrugging
like "What are you gonna do?"

146
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,241
What are you gonna--
We did it at the same time.

147
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,570
Dude, was the daydream helpful?

148
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,762
Not especially.

149
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:02,461
I need you to focus.
You're better at this than I am.

150
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:03,887
Here's what you're gonna do.

151
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,855
You're gonna go in there and
you're gonna be completely honest.

152
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:10,092
That's all you've got. 'Cause I've been
a doctor for more than ten minutes.

153
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,703
Try not to get too emotional.

154
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,774
If you feel yourself starting
to cry, do what I do

155
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:16,612
and think of that gopher at the end
of <i>Caddyshack</i> when he dances.

156
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:18,430
Got it.

157
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,711
And Turk, most importantly...

158
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,239
Don't give him any false hope.

159
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:27,009
You know. If you go in there
and make him think for a second

160
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,939
there could be
a happy ending for him,

161
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,480
it doesn't work out,
they're gonna blame you forever.

162
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,506
I did that, you remember, with
my patient Mr. Chazznini

163
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:37,113
I think about it everyday.
Good luck.

164
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,384
Mr. Hill.

165
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,489
I'm Dr. Christopher Turk.

166
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,286
I need to talk to you about your son.

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,991
Mrs. Jensen, your brain CT
came back and as you can see,

168
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:54,255
we were able to get all
of the tumor. Unfortunately...

169
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,329
We were not able
to remove this.

170
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,174
That's the song that has been
stuck in your head.

171
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,392
Dr. Cox.

172
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,244
Hey!

173
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:06,578
What gives with you wearing
that thing on your finger?

174
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,495
It's mainly to detour cougars
like Mrs. Jensen here

175
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,525
from hitting on me, but it doesn't
seem to have stopped you, does it?

176
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,689
What's the real reason?

177
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,944
I don't know. Lately, I've been
feeling warm and fuzzy about the kids,

178
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,543
a little less nauseous about you,
and then I found this thing

179
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:26,001
stuck to an old piece of gum
in the medicine cabinet.

180
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,773
I put it on a couple of months ago
and I haven't taken it off since.

181
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,590
Perry, we're not married.

182
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,720
We're two independent people
who enjoy each other's company

183
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,751
and are perfectly happy.
We're the opposite of married.

184
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,687
- I don't want you to wear it anymore.
- Fine.

185
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:44,240
Fine, what do you say I melt it down
into a bullet and shoot myself with it?

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,524
Thank you.

187
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,369
Holding hands isn't so hard, is it?

188
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,759
I guess something's wrong
between me and Lady.

189
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,056
Dibs.

190
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:54,851
Who's Lady?

191
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:58,373
Apparently she's not a fan of hand
holding. And that's what couples do.

192
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,338
That and sleep head to toe.

193
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:03,006
I'm just not sure she's the one.

194
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,849
Zeltzer, when were you sure
your wife was the one?

195
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,319
That was our fourth date
over at her place.

196
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,883
We were sitting by the fire,
just staring into each other's eyes.

197
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,123
And I knew then in there
that she was the one.

198
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,981
I would have told her, but I had
a rubber ball in my mouth.

199
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,710
I've just been zeltzered.

200
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,425
- Mr. Hill.
- It's Rich.

201
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,752
Okay, Rich.
Here's the situation.

202
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,982
Your son is stable,
his vitals are good.

203
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,681
But the damage to his spine
was quite severe

204
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,954
so there's a strong
possibility that he could...

205
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,775
He really loved that car.

206
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:41,565
The one he had the accident in.

207
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,048
He was always cleaning it.

208
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,264
Driving it around
with the top down.

209
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,373
Okay, hum...

210
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:53,049
Rich, the problem with
spinal cord injuries...

211
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,158
Do you have any kids, Dr. Turk?

212
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,752
Yeah, I do.

213
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,644
- I've got a daughter.
- They grew up fast.

214
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:05,773
You know, when Mickey was 12,
he was a hell of a football player.

215
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,964
Rich, I'm trying to talk
to you about your son.

216
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:10,612
- Here's the...
- Yeah.

217
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:13,025
I know you're trying to talk
to me about my son.

218
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:18,782
When I brought Mike in, I saw them
poking at his fingers and toes,

219
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,734
asking if he felt it.

220
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:25,437
Dr. Turk, I have a pit in my
stomach because I'm afraid

221
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,936
you've come here to tell me
my boy is going to be paralyzed.

222
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,850
Tell me it isn't true.

223
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,354
We're not exactly
certain of that yet.

224
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:37,426
You're his doctor,
what do you think?

225
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,601
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

226
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,103
Listen, just something really
funny jumped into my head.

227
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,663
What? Tell me.

228
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:51,235
You remember when the gopher
starts to dance in <i>Caddyshack</i>?

229
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:54,060
Don't do the dance, Turk.
Don't do the dance.

230
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,123
Carla, your husband's not doing
very well in there.

231
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,567
I can't watch right now,
I'm working.

232
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,088
You know, if I was married to him,
I'd be more supportive.

233
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,773
You know you said
that out loud, right?

234
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,712
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

235
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,878
And there's a 90% chance that
the gopher was a puppet, but

236
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,216
this right here...

237
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,867
It's hilarious.

238
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,207
- Dr. Turk, what the hell are we doing?
- I don't know.

239
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,152
Rich, there's a strong possibility

240
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,034
that your son will be paralyzed
from the neck down.

241
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,287
This is unfair.

242
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,025
I'm so sorry.

243
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:31,440
Please tell me there's something else
that you can do for my son.

244
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:33,985
Anything.

245
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,600
Don't give up on Mike.

246
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,696
Please.

247
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:44,087
<i>There's a lot a person can express
simply with their hands.</i>

248
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,571
<i>Whether it's defiance,</i>

249
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,333
What the hell?

250
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,012
<i>Rejection.</i>

251
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,883
Oh, I said I didn't
want to do that.

252
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:57,533
Why?

253
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:01,601
We can...
talk about it later, okay?

254
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,815
Looks like somebody is
getting their ass dumped.

255
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,034
<i>Or even desperation.</i>

256
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:15,733
Please, Dr. Turk.

257
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:17,796
Please help.

258
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,586
Don't do it, Turk.
No false hope, just get out.

259
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,621
There might be
something I can do.

260
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,019
- Dr. Turk? A word please.
- Yeah.

261
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,759
I'm sorry, sir.
One of your patients is very...

262
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,707
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

263
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,829
Don't you remember my
"don't give him false hope" speech,

264
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,025
and my lie about how
I had done it with Mr. Chazznini.

265
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,912
- That was a lie?
- Yes, Turk.

266
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:59,174
I lie to drive my points home.
We both know that about me.

267
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:00,811
Look, I actually have a good idea.

268
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,972
Mr. Hill.

269
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,568
There's a therapy
I'd like to try on Mike.

270
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,738
But here's the thing.
It's very experimental.

271
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,324
I don't care.
We're in.

272
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,586
It's not up to me to make the
decision, I have to talk to my boss.

273
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:26,108
Baby, I need to run
something by you.

274
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,532
Are you trying to annoy me
by wearing your wedding ring?

275
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,409
Because all you really needed to do
was wear that "Who farted?" T-shirt.

276
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,365
Now, hun. And when I say hun,
I don't mean the short for honey kind,

277
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,969
But rather the Attila kind.

278
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:44,409
Despite the fact that wearing our
wedding ring may actually annoy you,

279
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,911
which don't get me wrong is one of
the most stupendous perks

280
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,916
in the history of the planet,
the truth is

281
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,661
I'm wearing it because I want to.

282
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,593
So that's it,
you're just gonna ignore me.

283
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:58,624
As much as I'll ignore the opening of
Hugh Jackman's next cinematic excretion.

284
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:00,597
Jordan, come one.
Bottom line,

285
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:04,265
I'm not telling anyone we're married,
this isn't for other people, it's...

286
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,706
It's for me,
which begs the question

287
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,693
Why on earth would you care?

288
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,505
She can't break up with me
if I don't let her talk to me.

289
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,008
<i>I don't know what was odder. The
janitor spouting random non sequiturs</i>

290
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,708
<i>or Dr. Kelso doing his daily
post-muffin power walk</i>

291
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,720
<i>and rubbing in the fact
that he's retired.</i>

292
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,744
Must suck to be you people.

293
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:30,964
Baby, it's a long shot.

294
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:33,690
But there's a procedure I heard of
called cold therapy.

295
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,096
We'd induce a mild hypothermia
which would minimize swelling

296
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,649
and hopefully reduce
the body's metabolic demand,

297
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,519
preventing his paralysis.

298
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,300
Hey. Do you have a second?

299
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:47,505
Oh honey, I would love to but I'm
just right in the middle of something.

300
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,280
Anyway, between the weak
American dollar and the, uh...

301
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,416
you know low interest rates,
I think you'd be absolute fools

302
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,440
not to buy a house right now.

303
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,996
And-and-and the subprime
mortgage foreclosures

304
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,106
have just made it
a complete buyer's market

305
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:02,456
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

306
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,441
But it kinda made sense.

307
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,122
Look, problem with cold therapy
is that it's controversial.

308
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:12,343
Bottom line: If there are any
complications, that's on me.

309
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,154
I could get sued,

310
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:17,332
lose my license. Hell baby,
we could lose everything.

311
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:18,748
The car, the college fund.

312
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,544
- The house.
- What house?

313
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,085
The one the janitor
was talking about.

314
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:24,640
What am I supposed to do?

315
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,133
What would you do if
it's was one of our kids?

316
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,917
I'd try everything.

317
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,724
There is your answer.

318
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,432
- Say it.
- You're always right.

319
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,120
Well, you were right.
Lady and I are doomed.

320
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,815
Congratulations, Pam.

321
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,741
You think my name is Pam?

322
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:44,889
You know what, I don't care.
I have my own problems.

323
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,646
The worst part is things were
really going great between us.

324
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:49,816
Tell me about it.
Perry and I finally got to the place

325
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:51,837
where we could have
sex facing each other.

326
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:54,780
I finally got so comfortable with her
that I was able to be the real me.

327
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,824
I even told her
I don't want to have kids.

328
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:59,352
I just want to adopt
a really short old guy.

329
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,898
If she wants to break up
with me, that's fine.

330
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,216
But I'm just gonna dump her first.

331
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:06,059
I'm gonna torture him
till he gives up that ring.

332
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,535
Eavesdropping.

333
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,990
Things have been going so great
between J.D. and I

334
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,578
since we started dating again.

335
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,655
- You want to know why?
- Not really.

336
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,667
No one cares that
you two are back together.

337
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:19,833
Why not?

338
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:23,069
Because you've been
doing it on and off for 7 years.

339
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:24,937
And if anyone of us
ever want to have

340
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,997
another stupid conversation
about your relationship,

341
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:33,132
all we have to do is think back and
remember one of the other billions

342
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:36,425
of stupid conversations we've
all had about your relationship.

343
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,355
<i>So Turk,
this Elliot chick is pretty hot.</i>

344
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:43,630
<i>- She got nice boobies.
- Awesome boobies.</i>

345
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,704
<i>- So how's the butt.
- Flat. Just like I like it.</i>

346
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:48,178
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

347
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,157
<i># J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt #
# J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt #</i>

348
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,223
<i># J.D.'s gonna hit that flat butt #
# J.D... #</i>

349
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,715
I was just thinking about the
first time I told Turk about you.

350
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:04,654
Look, you guys both have said
that you've been happy lately.

351
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,502
Why mess that up over a ring?

352
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:09,602
And why throw all of that away
before you even talk to Lady?

353
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:12,413
Since I'm part of a couple again,
I'm gonna give some relationship advice

354
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,726
whether you want it or not.

355
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,809
That's what I do.
I can't help myself.

356
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:16,701
Still,

357
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:20,259
don't tear things apart just because
you're afraid to feel vulnerable.

358
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:25,100
Oh, look at him.
You're adorable.

359
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,026
You got a daddy?

360
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,439
I'm just window shopping.

361
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,699
Okay, Rich.

362
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:35,696
Mike's hooked up to
the thermoregulation system.

363
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,427
His body's now cooling.

364
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,838
All we can do is
wait and hope for the best.

365
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,550
I feel really good
about this, you know.

366
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,086
That makes one of us.

367
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,496
Baby, what am I doing?

368
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,153
I am proud of you.

369
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:55,114
Not just for being smart,
but for being brave.

370
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,354
Kiss me.

371
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,978
Where did you get the idea
for this risky therapy anyway?

372
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:03,683
<i>SportsCenter.</i>

373
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:04,993
Excuse me?

374
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,277
# <i>SportsCenter</i> #
# The place for sports #

375
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,653
- Now is not really a good time.
- Okay.

376
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,168
We should talk.

377
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,221
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

378
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,112
- But.
- But.

379
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,838
- You go.
- Oh no. You first.

380
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,143
- I'd prefer you...
- No, you go first.

381
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,536
I don't know what to say.
Please go.

382
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:27,904
May I?

383
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,834
I'm not really at the talking
part of relationships,

384
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:34,402
but I've given this
a little thought.

385
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:36,589
And, huh... And here goes.

386
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:40,018
If I were a catfish,...
See, that's no good.

387
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,959
Catfish is no good.
Let's pretend we're in Africa.

388
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,666
And you're a monkey
trying to steal my gold.

389
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,260
I'm a germaphobe!

390
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:48,983
What?

391
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:51,957
The reason I don't want to
hold hands is that I am a germaphobe.

392
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,361
Specifically,
a hand-specific germaphobe.

393
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,612
My therapist thinks that part
of the reason I'm attracted to you

394
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,899
is that you clean
germs for a living.

395
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,691
And you're a dead ringer
for my dad. Whatever, anyway.

396
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,432
I've never told anyone this before.

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,319
And I just finally feel
so comfortable with you

398
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,437
that I want to be the real me.

399
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:12,498
You know?

400
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,391
I do.

401
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,810
- You're weird.
- Yeah.

402
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:19,684
I love that.

403
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,330
- Really?
- Yes.

404
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,323
Don't touch the table.
It's full of bacteria.

405
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,002
Thanks.

406
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,932
That sucked.

407
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,237
See you tomorrow, everybody.

408
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:34,809
Bye Bob!

409
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:37,863
They're so cute.

410
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,653
But I still think that we're
the best couple here.

411
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:43,367
- No one cares, Elliot.
- J.D., you're in the relationship.

412
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,452
- You have to care.
- Sorry.

413
00:19:46,906 --> 00:19:49,367
Look, you know what I love
about where we are now?

414
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:50,326
I can tell you...

415
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,622
<i>As I took Elliot's hand and nodded
to make her think I was listening,</i>

416
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:55,529
<i>I started to think
about hands again.</i>

417
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,536
<i>And how they really are
windows to what we're feeling.</i>

418
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,265
<i>Whether it's love...</i>

419
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,125
If you say anything,
I'll kill you.

420
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,962
Come here.

421
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,622
<i>Or acceptance.</i>

422
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,858
This is great.
It's like I'm steering you.

423
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,904
Look out for weird coughing guy.

424
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,504
<i>And sometimes,</i>

425
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,881
<i>they can even express hope.</i>

426
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,548
So you really think it was
the cold therapy that helped him?

427
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:34,618
I don't know,
but I'm glad I did it.

428
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,514
I'm really proud of you, baby.

429
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,051
<i>There's got to be a way
I could get on </i>SportsCenter.

430
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:47,094
<i>Dr. Cox is athletic.
I wonder if he could help.</i>

431
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,578
- What is going on?
- Involuntary luge.

432
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,936
J.D.:
Eagle!

433
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:59,172
- That's gotta hurt.
- Gloria always does.

434
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,735
Look at how his legs
are all twisted.

435
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:07,399
<i>I'm still not sure
why luge is even a sport.</i>

9999
