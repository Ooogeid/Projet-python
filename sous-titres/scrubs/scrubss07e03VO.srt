1
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:05,474
<i>Nothing in my life
could compare to this.</i>

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,724
I'm a dad.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,445
- That's not your kid.
- I know but he reminds me of Sam.

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,003
That's a girl!

5
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:16,220
Stop ruining it! Why do you have to ruin
things? I'm-I'm having a moment here!

6
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:17,504
<i>Let's go.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,381
It must suck that Sam and Kim moved.

8
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,423
What can I do? You know, she
took a job in another hospital.

9
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:25,764
But they only moved like 40 minutes
away, I'm going to see Sam all the time.

10
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,596
Matter of fact: I'm going there tonight.

11
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,003
<i>The new patient's scale had all the
female staffers obsessing about one thing.</i>

12
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,728
- I need to loose two pounds.
- Ah, since Keith and I broke up,

13
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,394
I've been eating and sleeping very
well so... I'm down to dress size.

14
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,759
- You look like you've been sick.
- Turk that's so sweet!

15
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:44,862
Come on baby, let's go
seein' how much you weigh.

16
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,976
<i>We all sensed what would
happen if Turk didn't let go.</i>

17
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:51,590
Girls?

18
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:58,814
Oh no! JD! Heeeelp!

19
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:03,844
210 pounds!

20
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,324
Good.

21
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,696
*Tubbo*

22
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:08,696
What's is saying.?

23
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:13,981
Problem, lady?

24
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:18,915
*Muscles wanted*

25
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,912
Damn you, Carla and
your giant rubber stamps!

26
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,361
- Let it go, Turk! Let it go!
- Sorry...

27
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:37,251
Hey! If you're gonna drive that gas
guzzler, the least you can do is car pool.

28
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,609
Hey! I don't see you
bring anybody to work.

29
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,883
Hey! I just drove my
mum off at the mall.

30
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,135
She... She sits on the seat and...

31
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:50,349
then holds on by tucking her
hands inside my bike shorts.

32
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:53,840
- That's disgusting.
- Yeah. Doesn't feel right.

33
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:58,780
- Hey! It's your engine still running?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:01,294
I let it run all day so I can
leave the air conditioner on,

35
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,162
uhm, hey, it's nice and
cool when I drive home.

36
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,712
I got a gas ups and downs over
lunch but it's worth it.

37
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:09,422
You have to see "An inconvenient truth".

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,622
It would change your life.

39
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,849
- They're ruining the planet.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:19,817
Don't go!

41
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:25,477
- You know what really sucks?
- Being trapped in an elevator with you

42
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,527
while you whine about your stupid life?

43
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,767
You know what? It's actually okay.

44
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,937
All I need to is white noise.

45
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,875
Yeah, I've got this new kid but it's
come at the crappiest time of my life.

46
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,260
Plus, I'm making the fully
mad driver on a scooter.

47
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,896
And if I ever wanna bring Sam here, I can't,
because his stupid flopsy baby neck

48
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,247
isn't strong enough to wear a helmet.

49
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:49,929
- Hi, later.
- Hi, later.

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,142
Anyway, wonder what the cherry on top
on the crap Sunday that is my life?

51
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,344
Tomorrow, my loser brother's
coming here. Not happy.

52
00:02:58,617 --> 00:02:59,961
Dude, you need some perspective.

53
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,339
This guy came here for a simple
spinal fusion. He got septic...

54
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,396
and there was nothing we could do.

55
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,924
Do you still want to complain because
you're brother's coming in today?

56
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,742
Ah... Tomorrow.

57
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,439
Dan's coming tomorrow.

58
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,557
No, actually he's coming in today.

59
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,147
He gave me a call, asked me if I'd help him

60
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:22,219
with some embarassing prank
he wanted to pull on you.

61
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,111
Thanks for the warning,
Turk. You're a good friend.

62
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:26,273
I am!

63
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:29,300
Why are they all here?

64
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,392
- Zombie! Ah!
- AH AH AH AH AH!

70
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:58,939
- Christopher, thanks again for your help.
- Hey man, if it involves making

71
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,710
JD scream like a little
girl, I am there for you.

72
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:04,241
AAAAAAH! I'm a monster!

73
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,561
It takes more planning than that.

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,822
It must be embarassing for you.

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,328
Damn it!

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,882
Three officians in six months
for stress related issues?

77
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:17,345
Really? Well, here's
what I want you to do.

78
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:18,900
Stop...

79
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:22,069
getting... worked up...

80
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,004
over... Again... over...

81
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,377
small things.

82
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:31,086
They're everywhere. This stuff that's
making you goofy, it's all over. Stop that.

83
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,287
Get him out of here.

84
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,389
Dear God.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,327
Here's your coffee, Dr. Cox.

86
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,790
You want me to grab then,

87
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,966
even know I suspect the reason
that you're holding the hand

88
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,288
was because the mug
itself is scolding hot.

89
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:49,169
Now, I sent you out to get me
some jaw, not to give me a burn.

90
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,806
Put the coffee down.

91
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:54,463
Get out. Get out. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

92
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,010
Wow!

93
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,067
Yes, you. Questions? Comments?

94
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,546
You do realize that you just
told the patient to reduce stress

95
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,868
and then yelled at an
intern over... coffee?

96
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:07,538
You are going to be the huge help when
it comes down to write my memories.

97
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,828
I'm so sick of all the
hypocrites around here!

98
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,365
Two words, sweetie: Sun screen.

99
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,450
You know your smoking is killing you?

100
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,160
God, that's delicious!

101
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,876
A patient shouldn't have to take
advice if we can't follow ourselves.

102
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,495
Woman's logic is flawless.

103
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,581
Okay, people, time to save the planet!

104
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,216
- But where to begin?
- My first step was going with

105
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,776
all hemp underwear. It's awesome!

106
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:44,447
Except when the hemp oil sips into
your bloodstream, then it's awesomer!

107
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,446
Sir.

108
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,509
Make it snappy jumpsuit,
I'm already late for my nap.

109
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:54,570
and Ted, so help me, I had better not find
your head indentation on my pillow again.

110
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,674
This hospital is dropping
the ball environmentally

111
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,637
and I would like to volunteer
my services as an environmental officer.

112
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,697
- Will it cost me anything?
- No.

113
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,273
- Knock yourself up, hippie.
- Groovy.

114
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:08,664
Hey, brother...

115
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:13,081
I had to take it 'cause of all the head sweat.

116
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,327
Thanks for buy me a lunch today.
I'm all cash light.

117
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,407
<i>Having Dan here wasn't all bad.

118
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,358
So, Dan, you still living with your mom?

119
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,039
Carla, Dan doesn't live with our mom,

120
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,660
He lives in the apartment
that happens to be in mom's attic.

121
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,321
<i>Yep! Nothing makes my life seem less crappy

122
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,407
<i>that hangin' out with my loser bro.

123
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,107
I mean, sure, there's lots of bats up there
but it's because there's no air conditioning.

124
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,728
- Bats like Hit?
- Mustee Hit, yes.

125
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,447
- Good question, Turk.
- Thanks.

126
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,838
How come you don't point out
when I ask good questions?

127
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,609
Because I don't love you like he does.

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,871
Told you...

129
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:49,670
Actually, JD, I just bought my own house.

130
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,786
How could you afford to do that
on a part-time bartender salary?

131
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,333
I flip houses for living now.

132
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,246
Turns out I'm really good
at this real estate stuff.

133
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,810
Pry 'cause it envolved another
small money lying at double speed.

134
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:03,906
Well, if you're doing so well, how come
you made me buy all your lunch?

135
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,754
Good question, JD!

136
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,239
I wasn't aware we needed a reason
for trying to score a free meal.

137
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:13,090
Can you... can I t...
I just... I'm just...

138
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:16,875
- You have your own sandwich.
- Now I have yours.

139
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,788
- Mayo?
- Why, you don't like mayo?

140
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:21,988
Oh, I guess not.

141
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,695
So, Robin, I see here
that you passed out at work.

142
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,090
Yeah! I saw a ghost!

143
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,508
- Really? No way.
- No.

144
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,528
But I have to mope with
something interesting, right?

145
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,020
I mean, it was so embarassing.

146
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:38,185
Uh, tell people that was your mother's ghost.

147
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:42,067
- I can't. My mom is still alive.
- Ahh, bummer.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,021
Yeah.

149
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,679
Anywho, we run some tests,

150
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,999
Hopefully it will be something
exotic. Wait, maybe not fatal.

151
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,255
Right.

152
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,041
Sip.

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,321
That is hot. Add some half
and half and come back. Go.

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,376
Sorry, this spaces are now for carpool only.

155
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,600
What if someone who's
not a carpool parks here?

156
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,881
Obviously, as environmental officer,
I don't have any real power,

157
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,359
but I can give you this citation,

158
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,506
just as a symbolic gesture.

159
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,888
You'll notice on the back, I made
a list of possible concequences

160
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,064
for violating the hospital's new green policy.

161
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:32,247
If you leave a light on, I'll make you lick
a battery, or eat a light bulb, your choice.

162
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:33,466
Of course.

163
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:36,166
And as for parking in a
carpool only landing, well,

164
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,458
I can't really damage your car, but
I might just throw wasp hive in there.

165
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,407
Hey guys.

166
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,743
Many mess with the locks, he can't get out.

167
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:00,600
Bam!

168
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:03,837
- I'm gonna go with "aw".
- Member! Give a hoots, don't litter.

169
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,818
That was outstanding.

170
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,658
Where's your "can", Dan?

171
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,851
You're so cranky. I'm gonna cheer you up.

172
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:13,260
'Cause last time I went seeing you, JD,
you laid some hard truth on me

173
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,852
that really helped me to turn
my life around, so now,

174
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,406
I got you a little something
to say thank you.

175
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,093
A new car!

176
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,422
<i>Da hell?

177
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,842
So, your tests came back.

178
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,194
Your prealbumine is low,
you've a protein deficiency,

179
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:32,537
Robin, you're malnutrished.

180
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:35,564
I eat.I mean, I'm not anorexic.

181
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:39,397
I read your case history, you're a
vegetarian who runs every single morning,

182
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,676
eats mostly salad,
have got a stressful job...

183
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,318
Robin, you are 5.9"
and you weigh 119 pounds.

184
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,222
You need to gain some weight.

185
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:48,554
Hi there.

186
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:51,296
I'm gonna go head and borrow
your doctor for a quick second.

187
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,305
What the frick? You are ruining
all my shirt! Put me down!

188
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:59,225
What are you doing? Because I gotta be honest
with you, this seems widely inappropriate.

189
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:02,982
Well, I checked your malnutred
patient's chart back there and...

190
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:07,057
and something occurred to me:
you are... you are 5.9" also, aren't you?

191
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,088
Nooo! Put me down!

192
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,715
Freak the hell!

193
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,030
Don't you get for me the fricking scale!?

194
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:17,540
Tha-dha!

195
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:19,906
Come on, JD, this is the perfect gift.

196
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,977
You can't be driving 40 minutes
on a scooter to go to see your kid.

197
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,478
Plus, this is a hybrid.
So you save tons on gas.

198
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:28,362
- I don't want your charity, Dan. Take it back.
- No, judge.

199
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,050
Really? Well, if it's mine...

200
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,271
than I guess that you
won't care if I do this.

201
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,438
Wow! This tee must have
fantastic crash-test reading.

202
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,951
Hey, you! Come over here
and read this number, will you?

203
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,437
No, Boone.
I will kill your family.

204
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,238
- Don't wait up and stumbles!
- Or you say bye to baby Boone!

205
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,128
Got it!
298!

206
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:57,325
Minus my superbuff 180 pounds
make your weight...

207
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,826
118!

208
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:05,578
Which is a full one pound less
than your patient who is in trouble.

209
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,349
Hypocrisy, thy name is, Boone?

210
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,091
Do you wanna finish that for me? No?

211
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,758
- Much more eonugh to follow?
- No.

212
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,095
Is you, Barbie.

213
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,076
Hypocrisy, thy name is you.

214
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,184
I'll take a quick breather.

215
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:30,344
JD, I enjoyed demostration of your lack of
phisical strenght as much as an ex guy, but

216
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,666
What's your problem?

217
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:36,111
Dan, you come here with a new job,
a new house and you give me a car?

218
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,439
So what?

219
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:38,650
<i>Don't say it.

220
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:40,918
You're supposed to be the loser, not me.

221
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,748
Finally! I looseened it.

222
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,390
<i>And than Dan said the last thing
I ever expected to hear from him.

223
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,029
You know what, JD?

224
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:51,801
You need to grow up.

225
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,650
You shouldn't mess with hybrid cars.

226
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,424
- Be gentile.
- Nope.

227
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,115
I wasn't speaking to my brother,

228
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,353
Of course Dan reacted in
the way he always does.

229
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,679
He becaime it character he like
to call "The constant questioner".

230
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,652
Who's that guy?
What behind that door?

231
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,986
When is the next bus to Chicago?
7 o'clock p.m. 300. Where is that girl going?

232
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:19,704
Wanna see me doin' a funny dance?
Wanna see me do it around you?

233
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,849
Break it! Break it! Break it!

234
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,226
New from Mattel it's... Hypocrite Barbie!

235
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,326
Now, when you do waltz into your similarly

236
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:35,886
stick-like patient's room,
I don't want you to feel guilty

237
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:39,822
because you brought on a bag of
salary stakes and air for lunch today.

238
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,306
<i>It's not about you, it's about her.

239
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:51,791
Robin, this colleague of mine pointed out that
i could also stantic pain a few pounds, and...??

240
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,502
I don't wanna be a hipocrite, so how
about you and I do it together?

241
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:55,764
Sure.

242
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:01,256
- He's got crazy eyes.
- I do. Normally kill you.

243
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,959
That's very wasteful. Must you
wash your hands so often?

244
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:11,067
I just changed an 80 year-old man's
diaper, and I'm about to eat'em off,

245
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,877
and so, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna wash away.

246
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,121
Oooh, I do not wanna see this.

247
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:19,073
See what?

248
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,610
He expects me to make you drink my mop water.

249
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:26,124
But... my bucket is all the way down
the stairs, so I'll let you off the hook,

250
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,972
if you promise never to tell Ted.

251
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,203
-Yes?
-No.

252
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,509
I'm gonna take that as "yes".

253
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,519
That's it! Drink it down, baby.

254
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,337
All the sods, too! You've learned a lesson.

255
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,671
Move it, Jolly-green.

256
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,777
What's up your butt?

257
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,908
Yesterday Dan told me that I need to grow up.

258
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:47,224
Me?! I mean, you don't think that, do you?

259
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:53,787
What followed was what I like to call
"the hedgign noise symphony"

260
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,625
- Uhm..
- Er...

261
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,962
- I...
- Uhm...

262
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,532
- Er..
- So...

263
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,801
- Uhm...
- I...

264
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,281
- So...
- Well...

265
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,084
Ha!

266
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:05,087
I-I-I-I-Er-O-Ah-I...

267
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,332
Mmh-Er-Ha!

268
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,463
I-I-I-Well-Er-If-See-Well-Hm-Well-Ha!

269
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:15,307
You-I-I-See-I-Aah-I-Ah-Ah-Uhm-Ha!

270
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:20,384
You-Well-I-Well-I-Well-I-See-Uhm-Ha-haaaa!

271
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,113
Do you think I need to grow up?

272
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:26,159
Well...

273
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,273
You dream your whole life about that moment,
and when it finally comes, you just...

274
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:35,365
you're just not ready for it. Here it goes:

275
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,978
the answer is a sincere, enfatic,

276
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,801
100%definitiveneverbeensosureof
anithinginmylifeunequivocal...

277
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,736
Yes, and the fact that you came to me
means everibody else thinks so, too.

278
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,163
Am I right?

279
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:49,183
Yes.

280
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:51,233
Yes.

281
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:52,682
Oh, yeah.

282
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,634
Oh, hell's yeah.

283
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:58,254
I just needed to find someone who really understood me.

284
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,567
Ooh! My scar!

285
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,886
- Is that face paint?
- Yeah, Carla wants me to trash it.

286
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,493
<i>Oh, really?

287
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:08,175
Dribble me!

288
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:14,670
Between the legs!

289
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,024
- Wow, Elliot, double dessert?
-Yeah.

290
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:22,284
I promised a patient that we'd
gain weight together, so...

291
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:23,155
Wow...

292
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:28,104
It's not every doctor that would take a hot bod
like yours and go all jiggly for a patient.

293
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,969
Has anyone else noticed how fantastic
Dr.Reid has been looking lately?

294
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:36,372
Sop girl.

295
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:39,414
That'll do do it.

296
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:44,332
Hey, why didn't you throw
that in the recycling?

297
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,552
The recycling bin is way over there...

298
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,775
What happened to you?

299
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,712
You're going to change the world, man!

300
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:57,204
I've learned to pick
my battles in this world,

301
00:15:57,234 --> 00:16:00,027
otherwise ya fight, and ya fight, and
one day you'll look in the mirror

302
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:01,473
and there's an old man looking back atcha,

303
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,283
and you have to ask yourself
"was it all worthy?"

304
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,539
It's been 36 hours!

305
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,264
I'm going to say something to you,

306
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:13,270
that's been said to me by
every person I've ever loved

307
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:17,648
I'm really disappointed in you,
you're pathetic and weak,

308
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,187
and I don't love you anymore. Get out!

309
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,234
You don't think I need to
grow up, do you, Turk?

310
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,639
Definitley.

311
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,059
That means a lot, coming from a
guy who painted his head

312
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,651
like some sort of a sports ball.

313
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:32,745
Buddy,

314
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,103
A one thing I love about hanging out with you

315
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,386
is that we get to do stuff
like this, you know, but...

316
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,316
when you leave I go back
to be a husband and a father.

317
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,833
which means paying bills,

318
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:45,160
giving my daughter a bath, and budging on
with Carla so that we can buy a house.

319
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:46,759
Well, you...

320
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,723
Have you had your baby pooped your apartment
and learned how to change a diaper?

321
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,826
Aren't there any instructions on the box?

322
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,994
Have you seen your baby
since Kim took him home?

323
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:57,564
No...

324
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:00,350
Now I say, you think you need to grow up?

325
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:05,719
Do it, do it now.

326
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:09,481
Are you done?

327
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,711
I can't believe I'm such a hypocrite.

328
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,842
I can't believe I gave up saving
the world after 36 hours!

329
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,411
I don't deserve to wear this sash.

330
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,528
I like it on.

331
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:23,509
You two are so boring.

332
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:24,974
Janitors aren't boring.

333
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:28,631
You wanna know the weird defect you both
have that make you screw up like this?

334
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,929
- Please...
- You're both humans.

335
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,024
- Janitors aren't human.
- They are!

336
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:36,667
And Elliot, I'm really annoyed with you
because I gave you this lecture 2 weeks ago.

337
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:41,819
<i>Pay attention, because I don't wanna be
saying the same thing again in two weeks.

338
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:44,349
<i>You're both human.

339
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:47,983
I don't recall that.

340
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:51,753
It's human who want the best for your patient,
even if you can't follow your own advice.

341
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,900
It's human to get passionate about
something and then get complacent.

342
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,941
It's annoying to whine about it all the time!

343
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,344
Janitors don't whine.

344
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,445
Oh, wait, yes we do. That's our thing.

345
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,026
- Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,423
Wanna see the dance again?

347
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,029
Tikitiki Toocatooca Yum Yum!

348
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,708
Actually, Dan, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go over to Kim's and me and...

349
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:16,953
meet my son.

350
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,887
Yeah, yeah. I'm great.

351
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:27,901
You know, JD...

352
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,174
You're the one who told me to get
my life together in the first place.

353
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,112
Well, I never thought you'd do it.

354
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,334
Uh, it's so lovely saying to me.

355
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,113
I'm happy for you, Dan.

356
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,180
You don't know how to turn it on, do you?

357
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:50,063
No idea. I... pushed it from
the parking spot, back there.

358
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,284
- Ok, well, you see this button?
- Yeah, discovered, that's the stereo.

359
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,613
And if you push this up...

360
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,437
Clearly a vent.

361
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:58,615
<i>It's hard to own up to your shortcomings.

362
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:01,430
<i>Like friends tease your own hypocrisy.

363
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,862
April, the nurses told me
that you've been ill enough.

364
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,108
Well, what about you?

365
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,571
This isn't about me, I'm not
the one fainting at the office,

366
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,470
just... do what I tell you to do.

367
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,384
Barbie... there you are.

368
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,674
You're standing sideways so I didn't see ya.

369
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,147
<i>Still, once you do homenut,
you might be surprised

370
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,385
to see that you did make a difference.

371
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:30,353
Dammit! Next time you guys get
pastring crums all over my car

372
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:32,579
you ain't better bring
a scorn for the driver.

373
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,432
Well what do you know? Your carpool thing's stuck.

374
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,122
I guess it's something, right?

375
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:42,777
<i>As for me, I always assumed growing up
happened dogmatically as you got older

376
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,518
<i>but it's really something you
have to choose to do.

377
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,912
- See you tomorrow, Sam, I promise.
- Night, buddy.

378
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,726
<i>I guess I'm finally on my way.

379
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,431
He looks like dad.

380
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:03,567
I know.

381
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:08,328
