1
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,196
I didn't know we were
about to get nasty.

2
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,133
Why do you think none
of my horses are watching?

3
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:24,711
I truly dig how nuts you are.
(laughs)

4
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:26,713
Oh, hey, can I borrow your laptop

5
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:28,982
To do those endocrine system
slides for our study group?

6
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:31,218
What's wrong with yours?
It's super slow right now

7
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,220
'cause I'm downloading
every "golden girls" episode.

8
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,622
(laughs) man, those old chicks
are insane!

9
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:38,992
<i>All right, there was this one episode...
(lucy) while I was pretending to listen,</i>

10
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:41,273
<i>I thought about how everyone
at the hospital</i>

11
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:42,663
<i>Seems to be coupling up.</i>

12
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:43,630
<i>There was drew and denise.</i>

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,667
<i>They were still
in their puppy love stage.</i>

14
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,372
Ugh. Drew, if I wanted
to be with a girl, I could.

15
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,078
Save all the emotional crap
for your diary.

16
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:52,896
<i>Then their was
our dysfunctional mom and dad.</i>

17
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,359
How you holding up?
Fine. You?

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,478
All good. There's no way in hell
you're beating me

19
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,382
At "nds on a coma patient,"
so take your hands off. Quit.
I don't quit.

20
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,451
I don't quit more.

21
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:08,355
(lowers voice) oh, no,
it's his grandson.

22
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:13,126
What are you doing
to my grandpa?

23
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:15,495
Nice try.
That's dr etten's kid.

24
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:18,732
Hey, you, next time try
dialing down the acting a notch.

25
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,301
Less is more.
Go on, get outta here.

26
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:23,704
Fake grandson?
That is some weak sauce.

27
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:26,206
Let me show you how the big boys
play. (whistles) todd!

28
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,008
Yah!
No!

29
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,043
(laughs)
(groans)

30
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,433
What the hell, todd?!
Well, I had no choice.

31
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,481
He found a picture
of adult braces todd.

32
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:37,684
I can't let that get out there.
"rock in a hard place" five?

33
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,520
And the winning streak
continues! Yes, sir!

34
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,622
Thank you for your help,
mr. Sawyer.

35
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:44,791
As a token
of my appreciation,

36
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:47,361
I'm gonna come back later
and smother you with a pillow.

37
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:48,862
Listen up, losers.

38
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:51,031
I'm tiof repeating
the same procedure to you guys

39
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:53,266
Over and over.

40
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,268
I want two sugars, one cream,

41
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,437
And only a splash--and I mean
a splash--of hazelnut.

42
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,706
Okay? Now get outta here.

43
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,810
You are
a wonderful teacher.

44
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:05,812
I'm getting better, right?
Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,814
Sorrys we's late.
Well, not "we."

46
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:10,150
We're not a "we."
(chuckles nervously)

47
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,186
I mean, I know, yes, we're both
late, but we're not, like,

48
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,589
Coming from the same place
or anything, right, cole?

49
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,392
I'm gonna go crush a scone.

50
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,926
She told me you two
were sleeping together.

51
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:22,129
Denise, that was girl talk!

52
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,198
You have broken a sacred bond
between sisters.

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,666
Oh, no.

54
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,835
Now I'm not goa get to wear
the traveling pants this week.

55
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,804
Look, I know that you've got

56
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:34,608
Daddy/food/body/
confidence/horse issues.

57
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:36,576
But cole? Really?

58
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,512
He's only a booty call.

59
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,514
It's just... I can't stop.

60
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:43,550
It's like having a scab you know
you're not supposed to pick at,

61
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,819
But you just can't help it
'cause you have to know

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,255
What's under
that pus-y filled mess.

63
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,924
Call me crazy, but I think
you kids might just make it.

64
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,759
You think?
(both) no.

65
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,263
That was fun.

66
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,098
Torturing her?
Yeah.

67
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,867
We should do more things like
that, you know, as a couple.

68
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,337
Yeah, this makes sense.

69
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:10,710
I know I do not see you
in my cart.
Well, your cart
was in the way,

70
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,146
So she was just gonna move it
for you.

71
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,015
You can't just touch a man's
work equipment all willy-nilly.

72
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,050
Do you see me trying
to perform a tracheotomy

73
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,053
Just because I did security
for the tv show "er"?

74
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:23,056
He and eriq la salle
still go to the same church.

75
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:25,358
You know, the last guy
who mouthed off to me

76
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,362
Has to permanently sit down
when he urinates.
Joke's on you.
I do that already.

77
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:32,532
Bottom line, touch the cart
again and you're going down.

78
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,870
Don't know who she thinks
she is. It's the captain's car.

79
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,738
This could be fun.

80
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,707
Yeah, I'm happy for us.

81
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,009
Now then, students,
our next patient is suffering

82
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,011
From a horrible diase

83
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:48,648
Known as "being dr. Cox's
bitch-itis."

84
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:52,185
You may ask yourself, how does
one catch such a disease?

85
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:54,688
Well, you do so
by losing a bet

86
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,690
Again and again
and again and again.

87
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,258
And again and again.

88
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,595
Until eventually, the disease
renders you helpless

89
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:04,297
To say only
the following phrase...

90
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,935
Dr. Coxy is hella foxy.

91
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,437
(laughter)

92
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,874
When I py,
I play for keeps.

93
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,842
Bank on it.

94
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,844
Our presentation
is at 7:00 a.M.

95
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,846
Cole's supposed to do
all the slides.

96
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:23,350
Lucy, where the hell is he?
Why are you asking me?

97
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,152
Maybe he's napping. Maybe he's
training to be a pastry chef.

98
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:29,789
I don't know
what his dreams are, drew.
This is why
I skipped junior high.

99
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,825
I'm sick of cole.
He's always running late.

100
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,194
And I'm tired
of him asking me

101
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,497
To hook him up
with russell crowe.
Yeah, and he's always
making light of my family

102
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:41,268
For coming to this country
on a boat.
Trang, your dad owns, like,
eight hometown buffets.

103
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,370
Get over it.
What up, nerds?

104
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,906
Cole, did you bring
the slides?

105
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:48,708
Oh, snap. No, no, look,
I was just about to start,

106
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,711
Then my boy boots called,
and he was all like,

107
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:54,681
"yo, cole, it's boots!
Let's go to seaworld."

108
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,686
Dudes, I got to swim
with a walrus!

109
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,023
You know what, cole? That's it.
You're out of study group.

110
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,524
<i>What?</i>

111
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:08,395
Hey, are they actually pissed
about this?

112
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:10,541
Whoa. (scoffs)

113
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,874
Sync by ReHelen

114
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:23,940
www.addic7ed.com

115
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,454
<i>Even though cole had been
kicked out of the study group,</i>

116
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:29,400
<i>He seemed to be doing okay.
Too much work!</i>

117
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,291
And I might have to study on
the weekend? That ain't right!

118
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:35,105
Hey.

119
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,254
Ballpark peanuts.
You know something I don't know?

120
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,223
I know a minimum of
9 million things you don't know.

121
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:42,892
Number 63--art's back.

122
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,660
Who's art?
Who's art?!

123
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,906
This... Is art.

124
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,357
(both imitating crowd roaring)

125
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,778
Hiya! (chuckles)

126
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:54,368
Art's been slinging peanuts
at the ballpark for 40 years.

127
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:57,069
He is a concessionary legend.

128
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,472
You should all bow down.

129
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,140
I'm serious. Bow down.

130
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,009
Now get out.

131
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,677
All right, who wants a key
to a golf cart?

132
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,779
It's right out front,
all juiced up, ready to go.

133
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,781
You can travel in style

134
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,783
Like an old couple cruisin'
the sad folks' home.

135
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,785
Hey, how many keys
did you make?

136
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,787
Mm, just a couple.
Oh, nice!

137
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,856
How did they not see us
stealing their cart?

138
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:19,358
Frank, that cloud
look like a cupcake,

139
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,128
And that one look like
a chili dog.

140
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,730
Man, I hate
being on a diet.

141
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:27,133
Lookit, that one
looks like a turkey leg.

142
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,135
Oh, a big turkey leg.

143
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,937
And a pie, a lemon pie.
Lemon meringue pie.

144
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,774
I will take a key,
thank you very much.

145
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,310
I would never willingly
give you anything

146
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,845
That was not some sort
of fatal virus.

147
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,718
Whoa. Did you see that?

148
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,154
I'm startin' to get a vibe

149
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,222
That drew doesn't
like me or something.

150
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,258
Oh, no. That's how friends
make jokes.

151
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,660
Nah, trust me.
I'm great at reading people.

152
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,629
Hey, that's why
you gotta ask him

153
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,632
About letting me back in
the study group.
Or...

154
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,634
We could let him
come to us.

155
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:03,636
Abou then we'll beack in
in a position of power.
Or...

156
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:05,604
You know, like,
your move, drew!

157
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,640
Nah, come on, please.
He listens to you.

158
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,776
You're smart and nice,
and you smell like the bea.

159
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,779
Okay, I'll do it.
Yeah, not like the kind of beach
with dead fish

160
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,182
And homeless dudes camping
and that weird foamy stuff th--

161
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,250
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah.

162
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:23,696
Look at you guys...

163
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:26,165
Chief of medicine.
Chief of surgery.

164
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,649
It must be nice to have risen up
with each other, huh?

165
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,396
To work with someone
that's got your back.

166
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:33,066
Well, we get awfully busy...
There's not that much of that...

167
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:33,652
With some of the doctoring around here.
Around here.

168
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:34,798
I'll tell you what there, art.

169
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:37,089
Before we do take a look
at that shoulder,

170
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,048
We've been having
just a ton of good clean fun

171
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,707
With one thing in particular.

172
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,454
Dr. Turk,
you have anything to add?

173
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:47,850
I don't think it's, uh,
particularly appropriate

174
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,342
To discuss this
in front of a patient.

175
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,173
<i>Approprio maximus.</i>

176
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:55,997
(monitor beeping steadily)

177
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,956
Dr. Coxy is hella foxy.

178
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,090
(laughs)

179
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,126
(laughing)

180
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,761
I so am!

181
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,372
I bought a candle
to set the mood.

182
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,167
Work with me.
It's all they had.
(closes door)

183
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:15,634
Oh, hey, what did drew say about
me rejoining the study group?

184
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,398
He said no.
Really?

185
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:20,064
Hey, did you remind him
I'm 1/18th american indian?

186
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:23,349
Are you?
I don't know, but I always tell people that.

187
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,219
Makes the white man
feel guilty.

188
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,863
Damn, this sucks.
I'm dyin' on my own.

189
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,207
Yeah, and I'm sad for you,

190
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,584
But we don't want to let this candle go to waste.
Come on, babe. I'm not in the mood.

191
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,339
(sighs)

192
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,509
(blows)

193
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:37,978
(blows)

194
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:39,632
(blows)

195
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,853
A trick candle?
I mean, who finds these funny?

196
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:44,469
(laughs) do it again.

197
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:45,886
Do it.

198
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:46,728
(blows)
yeah!

199
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:50,194
(laughing)

200
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,979
Once we get the c.T. Back ,

201
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,311
It's gonna show the best way for
me to handle it is surgically.

202
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,999
You would say that,
you slice-happy knife jockey.

203
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,796
Here's actually
what's going to happen.

204
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,241
We're going to heal him
through medication and p.T.

205
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,504
Right, physical therapy--
the miracle of stretching.

206
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,390
It sure beats cuttin' arthur
open like he's a pig at a luau.

207
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,194
Why do you always have to be right?
I don't have to. I just am.

208
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,348
Lets handle this like men.

209
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,933
First one to winston hall
gets to decide how we treat him.

210
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,108
You're on. And... Go.

211
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,690
(laughs) oh, yeah!

212
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,563
Whoo!
Ooh!

213
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:22,968
(whistling)

214
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,511
There she is.

215
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,105
You stole our cart.

216
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,229
Now come correct
about what you've done.

217
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:37,694
Don't make me
bring the thunder.

218
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:40,076
'cause once it's been brought,
it cannot be unbrought.

219
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,834
You think maybe
your cart wasn't stolen?

220
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:45,265
Maybe it just left on its own.
What in the name of larry holmes are you talking about?

221
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,026
We've seen the way
you treat that cart.

222
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:50,330
There are patterns of abuse there.
Yeah, I mean, the kicking, the insults.

223
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,756
Skipping maintenance checks.
Don't forget where your bread's buttered, frank.

224
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,439
Clearly, the cart is reaing
to an injustice,

225
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,779
Trying to correct an imbalance in the universe.
Cart-ma.

226
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,342
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Is It?

227
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:02,786
(hn honks in distance)

228
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,052
What the hell?

229
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,302
You know, the "check engine"
light's been on since may.

230
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,500
Just sayin'.

231
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,240
(laughs)

232
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,312
Whoo!

233
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,253
Heads up, geezers!

234
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,931
(brakes screech)
oh, for god's sake!

235
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,668
(turk) I'm gonna win!
No, no, no, no!

236
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,069
(laughs)

237
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,205
(golf cart approaching)
no! No!

238
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:28,995
<i>No!
(tires screech)</i>

239
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,305
Ya know, it's almost gotten to the point...
No!

240
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:32,822
Where I don't enjoy
beating you anymore.

241
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:36,042
That's not true! I love it.
Right, fellas?

242
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

243
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,835
You out here
scopin' the ladies?

244
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:44,646
I hear rebecca b. Has sex
with multiple partners.

245
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,261
(high-pitched voice) what?

246
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,755
(normal voice)
that's how guys talk, right?

247
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:49,423
Not at all.

248
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,647
<i>Actually, we were just talking
about how you told cole</i>

249
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,498
<i>That I said he couldn't
get back into study group,</i>

250
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,444
<i>But you never asked me that.</i>

251
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:58,916
I didn't?

252
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,218
<i>Nope, and since the only thing
I hate more</i>

253
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:04,043
Than entitled little pukes
who don't pull their own weight

254
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,086
Is when people put words
in my mouth...

255
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,824
Cole, you're back
in study group.

256
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:10,002
Hells, yeah.
The boys are back.
Mnh.

257
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:14,186
By punishing her,
I punish myself. Such is life.

258
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:16,650
What the hell, luce?

259
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,380
<i>Sometimes there are no words.</i>

260
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,605
<i>Weuietly do what we can.</i>

261
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,410
<i>And hopefully,</i>

262
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,122
<i>No one comes along and says
what we don't wanna hear.</i>

263
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,056
Whoa. Whose tumor is that?

264
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:34,237
Art's.

265
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,184
That sucks.

266
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:36,393
Yeah.

267
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,460
How you holding up, art?

268
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:46,849
I've been better.

269
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,085
Dr. Cox tells me
there's a surgical option.

270
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,753
I'm interested in that.

271
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,158
Okay.

272
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,002
Okay, um...

273
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,102
Just give me a second
to talk to dr. Cox, all right?

274
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,985
What are you doing?
This surgery is risky

275
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,822
For a patient half arthur's age
and healthier.

276
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:07,023
Listen to me.
This could buy him some time.

277
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:09,244
If we don't do it,
he is dead in six months.

278
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:11,357
It's worth a shot.
It's too risky.

279
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,039
I'm right, you're wrong,
and I'm not doing it.

280
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,892
<i>No, I'm right,
and you are wrong,</i>

281
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,454
And you damn sure are doing it
because I am your boss.

282
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:19,842
You're pulling rank on me?

283
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:23,019
I am. Now if you would,
please say it.

284
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,268
No! I'm too pissed off!
Those aren't the rules.

285
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:28,184
(sighs)
dr. Coxy is hella foxy.

286
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:30,378
Good effort.
Do well in surgery.

287
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:36,314
<i>Okay, hopefully all that stuff
with cole and drew</i>

288
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:39,346
<i>Has just blown over and we can
all get back to normal.</i>

289
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,908
<i>Lucy, lucy, lucy.</i>

290
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,390
If you wanna be in this study
group, you gotta show up on time

291
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,514
'cause you're lettin' us
all down. Right, drew?

292
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,305
Dude, I'm just trying
to learn about mucous.

293
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:50,882
Can we finally
talk about the fact

294
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:54,893
<i>That you and cole are sleeping together?
Thank you, t-bone. I would love to talk about that.</i>

295
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:58,453
No, t-bone! I don't think
study group is the proper place

296
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,189
To be discussing
who slept with who.

297
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,180
Trang slept with me.
Never called me back.
Stuff came up.

298
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,782
Crazy idea--how about we just
who  study in study group?

299
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:08,911
Uh, no can do.

300
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,813
I gotta take a walk
to clear my head,

301
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,649
Maybe grab a fruit roll-up.
I don't even know right now.

302
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,234
(lowered voice) drew!

303
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:17,932
Why would you tell everyone
about me and cole?

304
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,614
There has never been anything
in the entire world

305
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,152
I care less about, except maybe
this moment and "american idol."

306
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,342
Cole told us. He's been
bragging about it for a month.
What?!

307
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:29,385
<i>We are never going to learn
anything about medicine.</i>

308
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,444
(pencil drops to floor)

309
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,144
(panting) you okay?
I just got your message.
I'm fine.

310
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,691
You said you were attacked.

311
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,641
Oh, yeah. That was a lie.
Look at these two.

312
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:42,012
(speaks indistinctly)
they're totally falling apart,
turning on each other.

313
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,130
Okay, I think it's time
to wrap this operation up.

314
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,075
I need you to go find out
who has the cart.

315
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,295
(panting)
you said you were stabbed.

316
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,418
How come you never get my jokes?
Now go. Chop-chop.

317
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:52,245
(chuckles)

318
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,599
You said you were stabbed.

319
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,479
(monitor emitting continuous tone)
we're losin' him.

320
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,953
Art, hang in there, buddy.

321
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:02,034
Start the neo-synephrine drip.
Somebody call cardiology!

322
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,089
Don't say anything.

323
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:13,848
Please.

324
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,599
I don't think I have to.
You'll beat yourself up.

325
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:28,674
(brakes screech)

326
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,675
Damn, girl! You can't just jump
in front of golf carts.

327
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:34,850
That's how gardeners die.
Why are you such an ass?

328
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,886
You think it's so cool

329
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,388
Just to brag to everybody
about how you slept with me?

330
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,358
Do you know how embarrassing that is?
You know what's embarrassing?

331
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,360
That you're ashamed
to be with me.
Maybe I am.

332
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,896
Cole, you call my butt
nicknames in public.

333
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:50,499
What are you talking about?
"boomtown," "lenny" and "the fart zone"?

334
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,601
Plus, you abbreviate
everything.

335
00:14:52,602 --> 00:14:54,570
News flash--
pb&j is already abbreviated.

336
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:55,981
You don't nice to call it
"peebers and jazz."

337
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,108
<i>Oh, like you're so great?</i>

338
00:14:57,108 --> 00:15:00,067
Okay, you're wishy-washy,
you're obsessed with horses,

339
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,366
And there's
that weird role-play

340
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,282
Where you make me pretend I'm black.
Is this coming from cole or deshaun?

341
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:08,020
Both. Look, I know
what people think of me,

342
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,762
And I know I act
like an ass sometimes.

343
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,182
But I thought
you saw through that.

344
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:15,254
Okay? And I didn't brag about
sleeping with you to seem cool.

345
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:18,037
I did it because I'm proud
that a girl like you

346
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,328
Would wanna be
with someone like me.

347
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,473
Boom, outta here.

348
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,236
(brakes screech)
yeah, you're done.

349
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,452
Haven't found
your cart yet, huh?

350
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,045
Nope.
The school assigned us scooters.

351
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,954
I don't have the core muscles
to ride that bitch.

352
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:38,791
Well, maybe if you just
apologize to the cart,

353
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,073
It'll come back.

354
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,881
I'm not apologizing
to no cart.

355
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:43,450
What would it hurt,
captain?

356
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,209
(whispers)
the truth is out there.

357
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,649
Fine, frank. I'll apologize.

358
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,281
I'm sorry, cart.

359
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,850
I'm sorry I scuff you up.

360
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,889
I'm sorry
I take you for granted.

361
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,250
But if you come back,
I promise I'll treat you better.

362
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,974
Happy?

363
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:06,658
Oh, hallelujah!

364
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:09,389
I'm gonna take these.

365
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,804
I feel a lot closer to you.
Me, too,

366
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,699
But I need to keep this messing
with people vibe going, so...

367
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,877
Hey, annoying girl.

368
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:22,554
My fault. Too general.
Blondie.

369
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:26,075
Girl blondie.
Why do you look so sad?

370
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:28,462
It's this thing
with me and cole.

371
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,381
Don't tell me. Tell drew.
He's a great listener.

372
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,701
Why?
If you saw your face, you'd understand.

373
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,208
(scoffs)
have fun.

374
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,180
Drew, I'm really sorry
I lied about the study group.

375
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,870
It's just this thing with cole
is messing with my head.

376
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,154
I know he's a tool, but then
how come I feel so horrible?

377
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:45,178
Because you're
a needy, sad, crazy person

378
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,536
Who constantly makes
bad decisions?

379
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:50,764
Just my first thought. I'm still working out the rest.
Lucy, can I ask you a few questions

380
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:51,816
About your douchey boyfriend?

381
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,911
Um, does he ever
say sweet stuff to you?

382
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:56,275
(chuckles)

383
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:59,801
Man, I never noticed what
a beautiful smile you have.

384
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:03,624
Yeah, kinda.
And when you guys hang out, is it fun?

385
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,832
Does he make you laugh?

386
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,161
(laughing)

387
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:09,492
Maybe.

388
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:12,532
Think about cole right now.
How does he make you feel?

389
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,971
You're smiling.

390
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:17,243
Oh, crap.

391
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:19,029
I like him.

392
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:21,024
Yes, you do. You like him.

393
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:25,112
<i>You like him, you crazy white girl.
But it's cole.</i>

394
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,215
And as sad
as that may be for you,

395
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:32,042
This hospital is so brutal that
if you actually find someone

396
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:34,350
That can help you
get through it, you're lucky.

397
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,130
Because here,

398
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,577
Everyone needs someone
to watch their back.

399
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:41,999
Right, dr, turk?

400
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,161
Absolutely.

401
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:48,782
(laughs) I don't like cole.
Yes, you do.

402
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,109
Damn it!
I feel for you.

403
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:53,138
(sighs deeply)

404
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,442
Came to get your licks in, huh?
I get it.

405
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:05,386
I damn sure deserve it.
You may... Fire at will.

406
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:07,136
Actually,
I came to say thank you.

407
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,699
You showed a lot of stones int.
Making that hard call for art.

408
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:12,637
It was the right choice.
I was just scared to take it.

409
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,854
It cost him his life.

410
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,977
We stole six months from that guy.
You and I both know

411
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,756
That he would've spent most
of that time in this hospital,

412
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:21,853
Just waiting to die.

413
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,868
You pushed me
to give him a chance.

414
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:26,034
You had my back on this one,
and I want you to know

415
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:30,541
That you can always
count on me to have yours.
I appreciate you saying that.

416
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:33,233
Now I know
exactly what it feels like

417
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,757
To be in a morgan freeman movie.
(sighs)

418
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,498
Hey. Come here.

419
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,159
To art.

420
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:48,677
(clink)

421
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,406
(indistinct conversations)

422
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:53,802
Cole, can I talk to you?

423
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,955
Out in public like this?

424
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,116
Don't be crazy.
There's people around.

425
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,968
Excuse me for a second,
everybody.

426
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,208
I just have something
I wanna say.

427
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,414
This is cole aaronson,

428
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,433
And, yes,
he's a bit of a jerk,

429
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,896
And, yes, he's probably
screwed over every one of you,

430
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,721
And, yes,
he loves dane cook.

431
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,332
But none of that
matters to me

432
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:21,677
Because I know it just
started out as a hookup,

433
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,436
I've realized that
I actually really like him.

434
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,756
And so if it's cool
with him,

435
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:30,713
I'd like to introduce you all
to my boyfriend.

436
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,217
Nice speech. Nobody cares.

437
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,517
<i>Some couples just work</i>

438
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:39,552
<i>No matter how odd a pairing
they seem to be.</i>

439
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:43,017
<i>The common denominator
is being there for each other.</i>

440
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,989
Technically, I was right
about arthur,

441
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,879
So I'm-a need you
to give me what's mine.

442
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:47,748
Let me hear it.

443
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,965
All right, but just because
I'm a man of honor. Ahem.

444
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,873
Ladies and gentlemen...

445
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,335
Toot, toot, tootie...

446
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,583
Dr. Turk's a cutie.

447
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,997
(laughter)

448
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,290
Yes, I am.

449
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:08,170
<i>In the end, you just can't
be afraid to move forward.</i>

450
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,979
You're my number one shorty,
yo.

451
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,185
Yeah, that actually
leads perfectly

452
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,705
Into what I wanted
to talk to you about.

453
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:15,980
All ears, boo.

454
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,888
See, now that we're
officially a couple,

455
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:21,016
We're gonna have to start...
Well, changing you.

456
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:25,176
Okay, boo?
(chuckles) wait, what now?

457
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:32,174
Man, this is so hard! How am I
supposed to remember all this?

458
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:34,666
Ile you're my boyfriend,
please refrain from using

459
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,379
The following words
and phrases--crushing "it,"

460
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,408
Ghostriding the whip,
hunting the big dawg,

461
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,842
Redonkulous, wrangle dangle,
shtoops,

462
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,681
The "donk" show, gittin' right,
homeskillet,

463
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,878
Broseph, brosephine
and sexting.

464
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,222
On the serious?
There's another one.

465
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:52,566
Also, substituting your name

466
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,423
For words that sort of sound
like your name--

467
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:58,188
Stone cole, cole war,
piña cole-lada...

468
00:20:58,188 --> 00:20:59,427
You know what I'm saying.

469
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:02,073
<i>Girl, I can't give this all up
cole turkey.</i>

470
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:04,786
Why don't we just
call it a day?

471
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:07,842
And we'll, uh, start fresh in the morning.
Sizzle.
