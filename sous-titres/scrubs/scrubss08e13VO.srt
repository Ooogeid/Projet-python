1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:03,420
Hey, Robyn.
It's good to see you again.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,963
Now according to your chart,

3
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,207
your hair has been falling out,
your nails are splitting

4
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:08,680
and you're fatigued.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,654
Robyn, you're a zombie.

6
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:13,818
Patient also grumpy

7
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,763
and not responding to classic comedy.

8
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,799
Just a little hard to find the funny

9
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,980
when you're 32,
single and balding.

10
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:23,449
Point taken.

11
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,489
We're gonna figure this out, okay?

12
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:28,862
And don't you worry, if you
need me, I will be here all night.

13
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,824
- So you're working tonight too, huh?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,710
I'm new on-call surgical attending.

15
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,954
I kind of signed up because JD
was supposed to be working with me.

16
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,754
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a trip to...

17
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,336
You know what?
It's not important.

18
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,212
No, no. Finish your thought.

19
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:50,383
I didn't want to tell you this. Kim had
a medical conference in Anaheim.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,428
And so JD went and
took Sam to Disneyland.

21
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:56,556
That's impossible. Because
he and I swore to each other

22
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,988
that since we've never
been to Disneyland

23
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,384
that we would go for
our 40th birthday together.

24
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,468
- What do you want me to say?
- That he's not at Disneyland right now.

25
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,110
- Can you tell me that?
- No.

26
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:08,278
You know what? Adults move on.

27
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:10,563
And that's what I'm doing right now,
I'm moving on.

28
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,243
How do you want to handle
tonight's workload?

29
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,285
- I was think...
- I can't do it Elliot!

30
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,602
You know, I tried!

31
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,552
I tried but it hurts too bad.

32
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:20,308
It hurts me deep right here.
I can feel it in my chest.

33
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,873
That man went to
Disneyland without me!

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,654
They got roller coasters that
roller-coaster in the dark.

35
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,093
You don't where
the turns are coming from.

36
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,294
They've got the <i>Finding Nemo</i> ride
where you ride in round with Nemo.

37
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:34,302
It is a ride!
A ride with Nemo!

38
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,459
Tonight's gonna be great. My co-pilot
here is a blubbering man-child.

39
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,547
and the interns begin to think
they know what they're doing.

40
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:43,322
We totally saved that
patient's life up there.

41
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,228
Cancer's our bitch!

42
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,133
No one does a Foley cath
like Howie Gilder.

43
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,239
Up high!

44
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,584
I'm not gonna get mad
because you're new.

45
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,747
But I'm kind of the
high-fiver around here.

46
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,635
From now on, you're only allowed
to high-five when I'm not here.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,379
Are we clear five?

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,361
You may hit that
because I'm instigating.

49
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,315
Now get the hell out of here.

50
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,618
I put that central line
on Mr. Phelps for you.

51
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,600
So next time you
give me an assignment,

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,594
can you make it something
that's a challenge?

53
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,850
- Okay. Next time.
- Make sure you do.

54
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,072
That's my surgical intern.

55
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,366
He's been here less time than
everyone else and that's how he acts.

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,789
You know what we should do?
We should scare the hell out of them.

57
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,778
Full moon tonight, guys.

58
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,608
Wanna know what that means?

59
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,864
Means it's getting
fricking crazy up in here!

60
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,493
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.

61
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:43,964
I'm talking nightmares that
you cannot unsee.

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,517
During my first full moon shift,

63
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:49,753
psych patient Tony Belmont
bit off his own tongue.

64
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:51,482
And threw it at me.

65
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,780
We couldn't reattach
the sucker so I tossed it

66
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:57,494
into that very Hazmat bin.

67
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,269
Later that night,

68
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,718
we heard a sound
coming from in there.

69
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,611
So we open up the lid
very very slowly.

70
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,491
And inside,

71
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:11,419
is Mr. Belmont
holding his own tongue.

72
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,217
Do you want to know
what he said to me?

73
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:16,696
He said...

74
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,994
Nailed it! Give it up!

75
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,443
Guys! High-fiving?

76
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,655
I feel like I've been
more than clear about this.

77
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:31,050
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.

78
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,160
You're my friends, so I hope not.

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,296
I'm sorry five?

80
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:37,966
- Still.
- Still.

81
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:51,663
Season 8 Episode 13
My Full Moon

82
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,449
{\pos(192,220)}Alright, Robyn. Here's the deal.

83
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,471
{\pos(192,220)}The last time you were here, all your
health issues were from malnourishment.

84
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,479
{\pos(192,220)}And now, a year later,

85
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,952
{\pos(192,220)}you're nine pounds lighter than
you were at your lowest rate.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,038
{\pos(192,220)}You know what's weird.
I really have been eating.

87
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,872
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have you talk to
a specialist named Dr. Paulson.

88
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,001
{\pos(192,220)}He's on his way.

89
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,632
Why are you having her
talk to the staff shrink?

90
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,634
Because she's anorexic, Turk.

91
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,391
{\pos(192,220)}You know, I...

92
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:25,199
{\pos(192,220)}I have a complicated
psychological issue too.

93
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,394
{\pos(192,220)}Mrs. Powell, your gall
bladder surgery went terrific.

94
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:33,015
{\pos(192,220)}However I can't discharge you
until I'm sure your pipes are working.

95
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,387
{\pos(192,220)}And since you said it's impossible
for you to go number two

96
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,127
{\pos(192,220)} outside of your house due to the
fact that you're a nervous pooer...

97
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:40,067
{\pos(192,220)}I feel you, sister.

98
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,354
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have to
ask you to pass gas.

99
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:44,136
Excuse me?

100
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:45,529
You know...

101
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,920
I don't do that.

102
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,468
{\pos(192,190)}- Women fart.
- You know.

103
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,147
{\pos(192,190)}- We should go.
- I know they do.

104
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,552
{\pos(192,190)}Cause I have a wife and
a daughter, and they both fart...

105
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,517
{\pos(192,220)}And she farts and I smelt it before.

106
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,463
{\pos(192,220)}It smells like hot dogs.

107
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,834
{\pos(192,220)}Okay guys, full moon is upon us.

108
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,574
{\pos(192,220)}It's only 8:30, we already have
10 new admissions so let's stay sharp.

109
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,824
{\pos(192,220)}Nights like this
are why you got into medicine.

110
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,604
{\pos(192,220)}Sunny, I'm gonna need you to get
that lady in bed six to fart.

111
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,935
- I'm on it.
- Why don't you just pull her finger?

112
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,896
Howie, did you just make a joke?

113
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,569
I did and it felt great.

114
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,772
Good for you.

115
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,099
{\pos(192,220)}And as a reward,
you get the gentleman in bed three.

116
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,477
{\pos(192,220)}He poisoned himself.
We need to know what he took. Go.

117
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:21,534
Gone.

118
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,455
{\pos(192,220)}My pneumonia patient is presenting with
a crap load of fluid in her left lung.

119
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,535
Crap load really
isn't a technical term.

120
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,037
Fine. Bucket load.

121
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,046
{\pos(192,220)}Is she being sassy?
Because I love it.

122
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,707
{\pos(192,220)}More than Space Mountain?

123
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,028
Why, Elliot?

124
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:35,634
{\pos(192,220)}I just forgot about it.

125
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,314
{\pos(192,220)}Derek, can you get Denise's
patient a thoracentesis

126
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,761
{\pos(192,220)}and get that fluid out of there?

127
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,781
{\pos(192,220)}Surgery to the rescue.

128
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,264
{\pos(192,220)}You are welcome.

129
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:46,484
Oh that's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.

130
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:49,352
I'd be careful. The guy
you're in love with is a douche.

131
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:51,829
Where's Katie?

132
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,860
I've been doing post-op
on your hand surgery patient Mr. Gold.

133
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:58,858
He says he can't feel anything
in his arms from his elbows up.

134
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,988
Now, I've been doing
research for hours,

135
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,614
and I think it's either a radiculopathy
or a brachial plexus injury.

136
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,947
Or...

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,703
He's lying. Patients do that.

138
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,497
Katie, a word please?

139
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,291
Look, the man is
homeless and not all there.

140
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,391
You see his bandages? It means
he's been chewing out his sutures.

141
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,259
I'm probably gonna
have to strap him down.

142
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,530
I can find another
way to make him stop.

143
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,768
Suit yourself. If he messes up
my handiwork, it's on you.

144
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:29,952
Hi, Mr. Gold.

145
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,156
Can you do me a favor
and stop chewing on your hands?

146
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,350
Pass.

147
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:39,786
I had to talk to
that shrink for an hour.

148
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,110
Dr Reid, I am not anorexic.

149
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,537
You've lost weight, you're anemic.
Your prealbumine is low.

150
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,783
All symptoms point to it.

151
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,704
Who are you gonna believe?
Me or that stupid chart?

152
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,138
Robyn, I'm a doctor.
We believe everything on the charts.

153
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:57,439
That's why I write
"Elliot has a slammin' tushie"

154
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,021
on every single one,
see? Right here.

155
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:05,752
I keep making jokes at all
the wrong times, don't I?

156
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:09,267
I know that this is hard...

157
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,606
It's only hard because it isn't true.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,353
I've been eating.

159
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,228
You have already made up
your mind, haven't you?

160
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,775
Mrs. Powell, it's not your fault
you don't want to pass gas.

161
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,569
It's society's.

162
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,281
Guys have always been allowed
to do it. There's no shame for them.

163
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:32,118
But if a girl lets out even
a little squeeker, she's a freak.

164
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,037
So come on,

165
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,914
for women everywhere, let's do it
together on the count of three.

166
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:39,649
One,

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
two,

168
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,128
three.

169
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,548
You didn't do it.

170
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,091
Neither did you.

171
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,249
There's people around.

172
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,007
Hey Mr. Swick, I'm Dr. Gilder.

173
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:56,017
I'm gonna grab a chart that doesn't
say "Elliot has slammin' tushie" on it.

174
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:01,314
Much better. And now, Mr. Swick...
This one's got it too.

175
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,525
- Is her butt that nice?
- It's okay for a white chick.

176
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,112
Anyway, I want you to tell
me how you poisoned yourself.

177
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:10,198
- I can't.
- Why not?

178
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,110
Because you're not my doctor.

179
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,837
You may sound like him
and you look exactly like him.

180
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,206
But you're not him.

181
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,868
Excuse me.

182
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,652
Alright thanks, Dr. Paulson.

183
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,189
So...

184
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,847
The staff shrink says that
Mr. Swick has Capgras syndrome.

185
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,217
It's a brain disorder.

186
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:29,884
Basically, he thinks everyone
in his life has been replaced

187
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:31,432
by an identical impostor.

188
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,017
That's wicked cool.

189
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,134
I know, dude!

190
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:38,017
If we sent the twins from radiology
in there, his brain would explode.

191
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,560
Still,

192
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,322
I think it's more important that
we try and figure out what he ingested.

193
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,067
You know?
So he doesn't die.

194
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,777
Yeah, fine.

195
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,415
Hey Katie, how is it going?

196
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:54,138
Doing great over here.

197
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:58,529
It's hard to believe that we were
interns eight years ago, you know.

198
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:00,802
What?

199
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,995
Oh sorry.

200
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,301
My patient has really got into my head
so I'm looking over her case history.

201
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,805
That's crazy boring to me.
So you know what I'm gonna do?

202
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,929
I'm gonna just
continue my conversation.

203
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,931
All the signs point to anorexia.

204
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,678
Do you like being a doctor?

205
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,721
I just want to believe her.

206
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,571
I love being a doctor.

207
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:20,856
It's not like all of those other jobs
where you just sit on your ass all day.

208
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,899
You actually get to do things.

209
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:26,424
Okay, Mrs. Emmett. There's gonna be
a little discomfort from the needle.

210
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:27,680
but not too much.

211
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,610
Prepare to witness perfection.

212
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,320
Did you really just say that?

213
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,263
I also like that doctors
get to think on their feet.

214
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:37,380
I want to commend you for not
disclosing what you ingested before

215
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,702
because well,

216
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,746
you were actually
talking to my impostor.

217
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:41,998
I knew it.

218
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,387
I'm impressed cause
the differences are subtle.

219
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,165
His voice sounds like this.

220
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:49,213
- And my voice sounds like this.
- I heard it.

221
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:53,279
Anyway, what don't you just tell me
what you took before he comes back?

222
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,722
I tricked his ass!
Someone give me some!

223
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:00,227
Look, I came from home
because I couldn't sleep.

224
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:03,215
I've decided I'm not comfortable
with you giving high fives.

225
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,692
Even when I'm not here.

226
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,692
But I just totally nailed a diagnosis.

227
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,719
The fact that I'm not making a
tremendous sex joke right now

228
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,179
about who or what I nailed tonight
should tell you how serious I am.

229
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:17,385
I'm spending so much time
focusing on Robyn's past

230
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:18,895
I'm prejudicing myself.

231
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,729
If I just looked at her
admission form from this morning...

232
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,941
"Young woman who has
undergone a drastic weight loss

233
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:26,061
even though she says
she's been eating."

234
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,545
I know exactly what to look for.

235
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:33,007
Handle your business.
I'll go check on the interns.

236
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:41,537
Katie, no.

237
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,584
- But it works.
- I said no!

238
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:46,147
He's human.

239
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,734
- We got blast off here?
- Nothing yet.

240
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,702
Give me some good news.
I need a win.

241
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,528
He overdosed on acetaminophen.

242
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,742
Here we go.

243
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,585
- Everything all good in here?
- You know it.

244
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,669
But I'm getting some bubbles
coming out with the fluid.

245
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,783
- Is that supposed to happen?
- No.

246
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,413
Step back, please. Thank you.

247
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:17,260
Mrs. Emmett, I need you to hold still.
You might have a collapsed lung.

248
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,011
Quick, tell him that's impossible

249
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:21,419
cause you're the greatest
doctor in the world.

250
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,175
The troops are one for four.

251
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,799
How is it going over here?

252
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,672
Not great.

253
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,734
Robyn is HIV-positive.

254
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,483
That sucks.

255
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,912
When she wakes up,
I have to tell her.

256
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:51,989
Elliot, maybe it won't be so bad.

257
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:54,595
You know, we made a lot
of headway with HIV.

258
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,549
It's not a death sentence anymore.

259
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:58,834
Check on Mr. Maller over here.

260
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,324
He found out he was
HIV-positive today.

261
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:06,030
Admittedly, he's not
psyched about that.

262
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,264
He's actually watching
sports on his computer.

263
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,540
My point is maybe it won't be that hard
telling Robyn she has the "hivy".

264
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:14,609
Hivy?

265
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,452
I heard somebody say it
and I thought I was kinda cool.

266
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,329
Sounds like a dance
the kids do nowadays.

267
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:23,200
Do the hivy, do the hivy...

268
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:26,924
Like this?

269
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,146
Bring it down.

270
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,877
Here it is.

271
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:35,053
- I like when you do the hivy.
- We should not do the hivy!

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,259
Do the hivy...

273
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,771
Mrs. Emmett, we can't
drain the fluid in your chest

274
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,058
until we repair your collapsed lung.

275
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,268
How did I get a collapsed lung?

276
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,715
That happened when
I tried to drain the fluid.

277
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,074
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,104
Okay but when it's fixed,

279
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:58,944
I want the procedure
to be done by a real doctor.

280
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,065
So how long is it before
you become a real doctor?

281
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,323
Is it soon?

282
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:07,850
Back off, okay?

283
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:11,248
Come on, when you act all hurt,
it ruins all the fun for me.

284
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,384
Anything?

285
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,741
Mrs. Powell, when I was a kid,
my mom used to tell me

286
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,718
that farts were demons that were
crawling around in your belly

287
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:26,644
and if I ever let one out,
it would give my grandma cancer.

288
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,891
So I know what you're going through.

289
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,903
But let me tell you
the real issue here.

290
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,401
The number one killer
in hospitals is infection.

291
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:37,819
And since you just underwent
surgery, you're very susceptible.

292
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,493
We need to get you out of here,
but we can't until you do it so...

293
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:43,754
It's up to you.

294
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,048
I'm so sorry we have
to strap your arms down.

295
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,030
Please know I'm just trying to help.

296
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:57,320
Hey Katie.

297
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,232
I can't really talk right now.

298
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,800
Looks like someone got
her first face spitting.

299
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:06,073
See, there's a lot of things
to hate about being a doctor.

300
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,483
For starters, no women
looks good in scrubs.

301
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:10,298
But guys do. It's unfair.

302
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,310
Plus, malpractice insurance,
bad hours...

303
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,909
Yeah, but at least you guys
in medicine get to figure stuff out.

304
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,764
You were like a detective
with your HIV patient.

305
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,336
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.

306
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:24,820
Sometimes I feel
like a glorified mechanic.

307
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:30,429
Well...

308
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,553
Spleen is shot to hell.
I'm gonna have to remove it.

309
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,069
While I'm in there, I might as well
get that gall bladder too.

310
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:39,860
You can leave it in there but... Just
gonna be back in a couple of months.

311
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,561
To be honest with you, I ain't do
great with those "japonese" models.

312
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,686
I'd look good in a jumpsuit.

313
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,894
If you fantasize like JD, you have to
talk like him when you come out of it.

314
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:56,266
I'd look good in it, in a jumpsuit.

315
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,522
- Better.
- Thank you.

316
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,032
Gotta tell you what else
I don't like about being a doctor.

317
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,741
The patients.
Sometimes they're great.

318
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,633
But sometimes, like you said,
they just lie through their teeth.

319
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:10,999
Guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the
effects of the acetaminophen overdose.

320
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,747
It wasn't acetaminophen.

321
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,133
There was a guy in here
before pretending to be you,

322
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,437
so I lied to him
to throw him off the trail.

323
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,433
Dude, you're killing me!

324
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,495
I think the only way I got
through my first year here

325
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:26,446
was leaning on
the people around me.

326
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,794
You know how you found
Carla and I found JD?

327
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,448
You ever think how weird it would've
been if you and I found each other?

328
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:33,748
Elliot...

329
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,757
You're very cute,

330
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,896
but your booty is really tiny,

331
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,944
I don't know what
I would do with that thing.

332
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,399
You could start by smacking it.

333
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:44,031
And secondly,

334
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,961
if we were in a committed relationship,

335
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,989
I'd have gained like
30 to 40 pounds for you.

336
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:50,837
- Really?
- No.

337
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,333
Still this place could
use some jungle fever.

338
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,863
<i>The whole white doctor
black surgeon thing.</i>

339
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,287
Wait, wait.
Why is this happening?

340
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:04,424
That whole pathetic no self-esteem
thing you have going on right now...

341
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:06,804
I'm really vibing that. That's why
I used to date fat guys.

342
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,447
The reason why I work my body
so much now is cause I was...

343
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,890
kind of a heavy kid.

344
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,732
- How heavy?
- 260.

345
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,138
Oh god.

346
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:18,995
We're acting all nostalgic,
but we're barely in our thirties.

347
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,527
We could still do anything
we want with our lives.

348
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,861
You don't think we'll
both be doctors forever?

349
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:26,485
Dr Reid, your patient Robyn is up.

350
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,058
Great.

351
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:29,828
Here goes.

352
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,159
Also, I got Mr. Swick to admit
he actually ate fertilizer.

353
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,377
- How did you do that?
- I may have given him a little slap.

354
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:39,139
You'll do fine here.

355
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,175
It's done.

356
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,262
Just me being a guy,
I have to ask this question.

357
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,325
- What did it smell like?
- 30 years of repression.

358
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,565
And hot dogs.

359
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,006
Good job.

360
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,607
I'm HIV-positive?

361
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,901
You were right.
It's not anorexia.

362
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,924
Wow, that's a...

363
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,406
Huge victory for me.

364
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:15,367
I know it's scary to even
be talking about the "hivy".

365
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,441
The what?

366
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,653
I'm sorry, forget it.
I'm just really nervous.

367
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,663
The point is,
HIV is very treatable now.

368
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,936
This does not have to ruin your life.

369
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:27,046
So I should just... stay positive?

370
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:28,546
Definitely.

371
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:29,968
Because...

372
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:34,259
Even though I really want
to get married and have kids,

373
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:37,533
this will probably make it easier...

374
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:39,600
to find someone.

375
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,413
Don't try to make this okay.

376
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:48,590
This is not okay.

377
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:52,741
This is the worse thing that's ever
gonna happen to me in my entire life.

378
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,312
And you're here to see it so...

379
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,376
you need to find
a way to handle it better.

380
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,164
Cause I get to
handle it however I want.

381
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,132
Do you want me to shut up?

382
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,238
Do you want me to leave?

383
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:38,235
Here. Sorry about the
guy spitting in your face.

384
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,698
Thanks, Howie.

385
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,488
You smell horrible.

386
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:46,061
I showered three times and I can't
get Mrs. Powell's stink off me.

387
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:48,623
It's in my hair.

388
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,437
Where have you two been?

389
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,527
- Nowhere.
- We weren't anywhere.

390
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,041
What smells?

391
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,545
I'm going to go take
a bath in tomato juice.

392
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,391
Look at that.

393
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,601
They have no idea
what's ahead of them.

394
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,163
You know, I never
answered your question earlier

395
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,936
about whether you and I
would always be doctors.

396
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:13,986
You will.

397
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,470
You have this amazing ability
to find joy in everything you do.

398
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,327
Thank you.

399
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:25,630
Whether it's like an operation
you've done a hundred times,

400
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,047
<i>or even teaching.</i>

401
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:32,036
Alright, the trick to this is to get
the needle right between the ribs, okay?

402
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:33,919
Watch. Like...

403
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,007
so.

404
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:41,942
- Nice.
- You wanna get it for me?

405
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:45,953
But as for me,

406
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:50,572
I know you think it was a big victory
figuring out what was wrong with Robyn.

407
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:56,420
But those moments are kind of
like eating a piece of chocolate.

408
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:02,426
<i>I enjoy the satisfaction for about
ten seconds and then it's gone.</i>

409
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:04,384
<i>See...</i>

410
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,870
<i>The thing that sticks with me
is the anguish on a patient's face</i>

411
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,022
<i>when I give them crappy news.
I hold on to that forever.</i>

412
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,526
<i>You're a surgeon,
you occasionally get to fix people.</i>

413
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:20,471
<i>I figure out what's wrong and then most
of the time I can't do anything about it.</i>

414
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,032
<i>I just wish them luck
dealing with it...</i>

415
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:26,242
<i>or try to keep them
alive for a while longer.</i>

416
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:29,025
<i>So you wanna know
if I'll always be a doctor?</i>

417
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,570
<i>I'd have to say, I don't know.</i>

418
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:34,415
<i>I'm a doctor now,
I will be tomorrow.</i>

419
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:38,618
<i>But I can't tell you that if I'm
ever lucky enough to get married,</i>

420
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,468
<i>to have some kids,</i>

421
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>to maybe not need the money,</i>

422
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:47,309
<i>I think I'd walk out of here
and never look back.</i>

423
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,297
But how am I supposed
to express my joy?

424
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,374
{\pos(192,220)}Dude, you gotta find your own thing.

425
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,637
{\pos(192,220)}I'd tell you to do the low arm pump,
but Dr. Fordham owns that.

426
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,224
{\pos(192,220)}Here's the coffee you wanted.

427
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,685
{\pos(192,200)}Deb, relax. It's just coffee.

428
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,319
{\pos(192,210)}Don't tell her there's
donuts in the break room.

429
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,602
{\pos(192,210)}We have donuts?

430
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:23,562
{\pos(192,180)}Anyway.

9999
