1
00:00:00,519 --> 00:00:02,253
Our study group was
a well-oiled machine.

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:04,522
Drew was in charge,
and I was second in command,

3
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:07,291
responsible for two things,
class notes...

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:10,294
Yep, I got the notes right here.

5
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:14,163
and keeping Cole occupied
while we did the real work.

6
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:16,433
Babe, these wheelie shoes are sick!

7
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,468
Okay, I'll just be walking
next to someone,

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,970
then I'll start rolling,
and they're like, "What?"

9
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,474
- And I'm, like, "Later, Tevas."
- God, where should I go next?

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,145
What in the heck do you have

11
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:31,514
on the bottom
of those sneakers, champ?

12
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:34,551
Are... are those wheels?

13
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,488
- Would you show me your glide?
- Go ahead. Roll on out.

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,490
Get your glide on.

15
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:43,527
Dr. Cox was scary when he was
in his regular mood,

16
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:46,797
but him in a good mood
was utterly terrifying.

17
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:50,233
Are you all dying to know
why I'm in such a festive mood?

18
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:54,104
Because you're about to do something horrible
to us? Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!

19
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,540
Drew, you
and your worthless classmates

20
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:00,077
have just won an
all-expenses paid trip to...

21
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:01,611
Hell week...

22
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,613
Six days and seven nights

23
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:06,416
of tests, term papers
and group projects.

24
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,385
By the end of the week,

25
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,821
one of you is going to have
a psychotic break.

26
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,890
How darn good is it
to be me right about now?

27
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,159
"Just this side of fabulous"
is the answer.

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,397
- Just this side of fabulous.
- As much as Dr. Cox loved torturing us,

29
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:23,667
Dr. Turk enjoyed all the perks
of being chief of surgery.

30
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,979
T-dawg! Looking-good five!

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,752
Where's my pastry?

32
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:43,253
Too sugary.

33
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,088
Hey, nothing's too sugary,
woman.

34
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,790
Tell that to your diabetes.

35
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,827
So you worked hard all these
years to become chief of surgery

36
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:52,796
- Just so people would kiss your ass?
- No, I get a parking spot, too.

37
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:55,232
Plus, I get to nickname
people whatever I want.

38
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,168
Hey, what's up, Mac and cheese?
Oh, snap! Ham and cheese!

39
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:01,705
Oh, rainmaker in the house!
What's happenin'?

40
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,976
- What was that?
- Oh, we're taking a break.

41
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,511
Since when? What?

42
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:09,846
Well, we said "I love you"
to each other,

43
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,916
and it's horrible and gross,
and I hate myself and him.

44
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:17,320
Every week is already hell week.
How could it get any worse?

45
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,056
Hey, did you have hell week
at your med school?

46
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,093
Yes, it stressed me out so much,
my throat seized up

47
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:25,262
- for, like, a year.
- God, how bad was it?

48
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,176
I'm not gonna lie.

49
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,178
It left a few
psychological marks.

50
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,446
One of you is
probably gonna crack.

51
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,016
I'm looking at you, Li.

52
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:47,884
But hey, good luck.
Rootin' for ya.

53
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,187
All right, Drew,
you're our leader.

54
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,189
Let's get this goin'.

55
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,826
Uh, get what going? I rarely listen
to you people. No, seriously, Big D.,

56
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:58,595
I fail out of here,
I gotta go to med school

57
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,697
in the caribbean. Dude,
I don't speak "Caribbesian."

58
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:03,767
- So tell us what to do! 
- All right, why does this always have to fall on me?

59
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,403
I don't have the plan.  I don't have
the answer to every damn question.

60
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:09,940
Hey, Drew's right.
Everybody, back up. Give him some space.

61
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,210
He'll figure out the plan
and then text us.

62
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,990
Oh, hell, no!

63
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,992
Yo, somebody's parked
in my spot.

64
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:32,562
Boo-hoo. It takes me
11 minutes to pee.

65
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:35,332
Do you guys know
who "Doc X-treme" is?

66
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,834
Russell Vaughn... surgeon,
best-selling author,

67
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,836
wrote some book about doctoring
in the third world

68
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,973
called "Rebel without a co-pay."
what am I supposed to do?

69
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,008
"Take the bullet
out of his mistress' jaw

70
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,578
- or take a bullet of your own."
- I did the surgery.

71
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,580
Then he shot me anyway.

72
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:54,217
By the way, that mistress
is now my wife.

73
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:56,519
Yeah he is a bit of a douche,

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,822
but every time
he shows up here,

75
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,824
he raises millions
for the hospital.

76
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,260
And he has nailed some top-shelf
international strange.

77
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,695
Greetings. Hi.
Dr. Russell Vaughn.

78
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,931
Yeah,
I'm Dr. Christopher Duncan Turk,

79
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,767
chief of surgery. Listen, man,
you parked in my spot.

80
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,770
Okay, I'm sorry. Um, you know,
I have to remind myself

81
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:16,506
that I'm back in the States,
where status is everything.

82
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,008
It's not everything.

83
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,277
It's just that, uh,
my spot's in the shade,

84
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,312
and I have leather seats,

85
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,081
and my seats get warm
when the sun hits 'em.

86
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,417
I also just recently...

87
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,487
You're going to want
to stop talking now.

88
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,727
I just needed
a moment of peace and quiet.

89
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,997
The other students will not
stop asking me questions.

90
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,966
Oh, puh-lease.

91
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,235
I have a hospital full
of incompetents

92
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,203
hammering me
with asinine questions

93
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,340
every second of every day.

94
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,842
Uh, Dr. Cox?
Your patient in 3 is septic.

95
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,911
Antibiotics or vasopressors?

96
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,280
Antibiotics first.

97
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,483
That wasn't so dumb.
Wait for it.

98
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,419
Oh, did you get my request

99
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,689
for scrubs that hug
a little closer to my wam-bam?

100
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,223
Thank you, Todd,

101
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,060
for being the example to a point
that you don't understand.

102
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,562
You're welcome.

103
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,198
I didn't ask to be put in charge.

104
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,634
I know, number one,
but that's who we are.

105
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,569
We have been blessed and cursed

106
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,805
with intelligence
and wonderful hair,

107
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:24,708
and people follow. You're just
going to have to deal with that

108
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,744
the rest of your life.
No, I'm done babysitting.

109
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,014
I don't want to be a leader.
I just want to be a good doctor.

110
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,416
Fair enough.

111
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,919
...from the same surgery...

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,254
Um, is there something
I can help you with, Russell?

113
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,789
Actually, I'm... I'm helping you.

114
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,826
Dr. Cox told me to jump
on any cases that interested me.

115
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,729
I've got everything
under control in this... room.

116
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,732
Why don't you go
and Russell up your own case?

117
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:53,136
Clever.
I was just telling Irene here

118
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:56,406
that it looks as though she's
gonna need a septal myomectomy. Mm.

119
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,708
Russell, I'll decide
which treatment is best

120
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,644
for my patients.

121
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:04,280
We'll probably go
with what he said.

122
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:10,987
11 minutes to answer a page?
Really? Embarrassing.

123
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,089
It's 4:00 in the morning.

124
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,426
Hey, bedhead, what are those,
horses on your pajamas?

125
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:19,963
Well, I didn't do my laundry.
I have nothing else to wear.

126
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,999
Except more horse pajamas.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,502
Here are the case histories
for your group projects.

128
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:28,038
You will test, diagnose
and come up with treatments

129
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,074
for each of your fake patients.

130
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:34,010
You will then present
your findings in three days.

131
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,013
Number one, you don't have to
work with these stooges anymore.

132
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:40,050
I have a very special project
for you.

133
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:43,019
Where's the rich jackass?

134
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,896
I love hell week.

136
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,952
S o what's my project?

137
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:13,256
Your project is to avoid them,

138
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,224
because they are vampires,

139
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,727
time-sucking monsters
who will torture you

140
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,130
with stupid questions,
mind-numbing incompetence

141
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:21,765
and petty emotional problems.

142
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,767
"I'm so stressed.

143
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,936
I feel like I want to kill myself."

144
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:28,905
Well, what are you
waiting for? Do it.

145
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,708
Okay. Great. So what exactly
is my project?

146
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,211
I want you to focus
on yourself,

147
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,745
on your abilities,

148
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,049
on becoming the amazing doctor
I know you can be.

149
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,750
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,988
Again, really unclear about
what my project is.

151
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:47,023
You're just gonna shadow me

152
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,793
- and stay the hell away from them.
Listen to me, son...
- hey, Drew!

153
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,162
Go. Save yourself.

154
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,196
What?

155
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,764
Run!

156
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,367
Hello, blondie. Is there
anything I can do for you?

157
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,502
Uh, I was just gonna ask Drew

158
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:02,539
who he thought the next leader
of our group should be.

159
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,241
You.

160
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,909
You're the one.

161
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,510
Yeah? You think so?

162
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:12,048
No. I just said that because
you're the first one I saw.

163
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,919
Jambo, doctors. Jambo.
That's Swahili for "Hello"

164
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,888
or "Good morning." Oh, is it?
Really? 'Cause I know what it means.

165
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,924
I had Jambo juice
this morning...

166
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,293
A Berry blast
with an echinacea boost.

167
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,562
It was delicious
I'm-a live forever.

168
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:28,231
You'll be dead. I'll be alive,
though. I'll be alive!

169
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,700
Wow. You sure you didn't
get a fem boost in there?

170
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,202
That was pretty catty.

171
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,738
It's just that Russell
ticks me off, you know?

172
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,208
He comes in here with his book
and his rope bracelets

173
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,443
and his... his wanting
to help me with surgeries.

174
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,479
I don't need anybody's help.

175
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,981
Yeah. This isn't
about surgery.

176
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,716
This is about all the attention
Russell's getting.

177
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,351
You're jealous.

178
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,353
If I'm gonna be jealous
of someone,

179
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,656
it's gonna be a dude
who can breathe underwater

180
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,224
or... or Serena Williams.

181
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,626
That ass is righteous.

182
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,896
I'm just saying, you're kind of
acting like a 13-year-old girl.

183
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,931
Oh, my God. There's Drew.
Yeah.

184
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,867
Did he see me?
Yes.

185
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,169
Is he coming over here?
Yes, he is.

186
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,637
Oh, crap.
Hey, Drew.

187
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:10,106
Hey. Oh!
Hey... there...

188
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,108
You.

189
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,477
Afternoon, good sir.

190
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:17,347
Your face is looking
quite... normal.

191
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,856
All right.
Okay. Yeah.

192
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,258
Okay.

193
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,531
So I thought we could start
with a little bonding game...

194
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,533
"Two truths and a lie."

195
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,867
I'll start.

196
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,937
I am from a small fishing town
in Maryland,

197
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,173
horses are my favorite animal,

198
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:45,775
and I once made love

199
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:49,145
with tennis great Pete Sampras.

200
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:50,780
"Pistol" Pete?

201
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:52,349
Damn, that's hot.

202
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,284
No. See, Cole,
that was the lie.

203
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,786
My mum hooked up
with Michael Chang.

204
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:59,155
All right, look, let's
just forget about the game.

205
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,291
Okay, my mom used to date
Craig T. Nelson.

206
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,560
"Coach" was almost my dad.

207
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,662
Lucy, this is a waste of time.

208
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:07,664
I'm taking over the group.

209
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,199
Oh, damn!

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,234
A coup d'trang!

211
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,236
All right, l keep it together.

212
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,704
Don't get crazy.

213
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:16,706
Lucy, what do you want?

214
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:19,642
If Cox sees me with you,
he's gonna kill me.

215
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,678
Please. I need your help.

216
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,214
I was leading our group,
and they weren't listening,

217
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:26,716
and I felt it happening again.

218
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,219
See, whenever I get
into a position of power,

219
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,254
something changes inside me.

220
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,323
Look, the key to leading
the group is trang.

221
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,291
You gotta get
in that little bastard's face,

222
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,527
and you gotta
let the crazy out.

223
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:39,729
Do you want to see how I do it?

224
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,165
You back the hell up right now
or I will watch you die,

225
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,868
and I will laugh! See?
It's easy.

226
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,938
Ugh. There's Drew.

227
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,040
What an ass.

228
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,676
Why don't you let me fix this?
All right, I'm-a fix this.

229
00:10:53,677 --> 00:10:55,812
Hey, Drew! Come. Come.

230
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,114
Just come.

231
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,184
Hey, how's it going? Yeah.

232
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,719
You guys, come on.

233
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,021
You're in love.
You need to start talking.

234
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,523
Let's get it goin'.

235
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,625
Uh... sorry to interrupt.

236
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,362
Uh, now I understand Dr. Turk's
naive impulse to get it going.

237
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:14,264
He was raised on a diet
of Western television

238
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,765
and airport novels.

239
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,767
But in many less-developed parts
of the world,

240
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:20,270
silence plays a crucial part
of a-a couple's search

241
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,305
for real, true
emotional intimacy.

242
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,474
I'm reminded of an old proverb

243
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,277
from the...
Zambezi River tribe...

244
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,213
"Two hearts forged in silence
grow into one."

245
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,250
Your last tot beckons me.

246
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,519
May I?

247
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,887
Dude, you...

248
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,557
You can't just take
my last tot like that.

249
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:42,826
What the...

250
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,360
Oh, I get it.

251
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,362
Dude starts speaking...

252
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,865
And all of a sudden,
everything's all good, huh?

253
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,366
It's all good now?

254
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,903
Fine. I'm gonna go get
some more tots.

255
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,105
Lucy, have a seat.

256
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,874
We're about to start.

257
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,076
What are you doing?

258
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:02,212
Staring into your soul.

259
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,080
Dominating your mind.

260
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,082
I'm freaking your being.

261
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,984
See? I own that.

262
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,686
That's my vacation home.

263
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,656
I come up on the weekends when
I feel like bringing the hurt!

264
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,827
All right, people.
Let's start on chapter ten.

265
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,866
Uh-oh. It's happening.

266
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:26,169
All right.

267
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,104
We should really go.

268
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,307
Ignore the pagers.
I'm in charge.

269
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,643
Hey, you're right.

270
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:35,878
You're absolutely right.
Everything's fine.

271
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,651
Yes!

272
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:43,686
What the hell happened
to you guys?

273
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:46,389
Dude, it was awesome!

274
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,325
Lucy beat the crap
out of Trang!

275
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:51,527
Best girl fight I've seen

276
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,530
since I paid those two lady
janitors to wrestle.

277
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:57,200
What is that?
Y'all hear that?

278
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,372
Dip! Russell is
eaking it down!

279
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,512
That was
a real Masai warrior dance.

280
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,215
Huh? You got moves
like that?

281
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,883
That's not fair.

282
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,619
I mean, everybody, of course,
they... they hear the music,

283
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,522
but not everybody hears
the music.

284
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:20,656
Are you...

285
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,292
Yo. Beatbox.

286
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,594
What?

287
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,195
Beatbox, son!

288
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,731
I guess I can try.

289
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:36,405
Go, fool!

290
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,947
No, keep it going.
Keep it going!

291
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,583
One leg.

292
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,553
No, no. I got this.
I got this. No, don't pull me.

293
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:54,056
I pulled it. I pulled it. I pulled it.
I pulled it. Stop. What the hell was that?

294
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:56,859
Were you talking
about a specific move

295
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,561
or... or the entire program?

296
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:00,630
Do you respect yourself
right now?

297
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,198
Oh, God, no!

298
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,533
Russell.

299
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,168
Who's named Russell?

300
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,738
A ton of people. But it's
such a girlie name, right?

301
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:11,774
No, not really. Would it hurt
you to build up a brother?

302
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,610
You know what?
I don't need you.

303
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,779
I'm done with this dude
bothering me.

304
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,650
"Hell" can mean different
things for different people,

305
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,486
whether it's being bested
by a rival...

306
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,521
How are we feeling today,
Irene?

307
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,357
Did Dr. Vaughn tell you?

308
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,626
I think I want him
to do the surgery.

309
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,462
Oh, I didn't get a
chance to tell him yet.

310
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:34,897
Russell.

311
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:37,133
or being let down
by a friend...

312
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,102
I tried what you said with
Trang, and it didn't work.

313
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,038
Look, after months
of self-doubt,

314
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,040
I have finally found
my role here.

315
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,576
I am a great number two.

316
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,377
I'm Garfunkel, Drew.

317
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,380
And I am okay with that.

318
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:54,116
But I need you
to be my Micky Dolenz.

319
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,052
That was the band, right?

320
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,154
Yeah, Dolenz and Garfunkel.

321
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:00,456
Couldn't you just come back?
Please?

322
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:03,860
- We need you. I need you.
- Lucy, I'm sorry.

323
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,896
I just don't care. You need
to put on your big-girl pants,

324
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:09,999
suck it up
and figure it out for yourself.

325
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,259
So Drew had abandoned us,
and that was fine,

326
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,295
because I was finding my feet
as a leader.

327
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,264
I was inspiring the group
like my hero,

328
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:27,633
the lesbian president
from "24."

329
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,835
Everybody, get out!

330
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:33,772
I'll do it myself!
You're all useless!

331
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,574
What?!

332
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:38,043
You don't need to worry
about us, buddy boy.

333
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,678
It's my house now,

334
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,648
and it is
all good in the 'hood, bro.

335
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:49,354
Uh... Russel?

336
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:53,559
- Why are you putting my name in the assist column?
- Yes, I picked you to help me with Irene's surgery.

337
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,695
You know, I thought it'd be
a real nice feather in your cap.

338
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,765
Way to go, man. Oh, "Way
to go"! Russell, listen.

339
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:03,001
I don't need any more feathers
in my cap, okay?

340
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,037
I've got a peacock back here.

341
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,839
Major plumage.

342
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,508
I have so much
that I could teach you, I mean,

343
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,244
if you just open up your eyes
and... and let me in, Turk.

344
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,047
Let me in. I'm about to
punch you in your mouth.

345
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:17,549
Fine. But be fair-warned.
I trained with the Mossad, okay?

346
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,552
I could kill you with a
button off your jacket. Really?

347
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,955
Well, I train with
Lamarcus down at the gym,

348
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,824
and he was an NFL linebacker
until he came out the closet!

349
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,767
All right.
I have two minutes.

350
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,870
Here is what
you should be doing.

351
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,740
Thank God you're back, Drew.
Lucy is crazy.

352
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,076
Trang, you haven't even begun
to see crazy.

353
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:45,545
You want to do this again?

354
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,614
You feeling froggy?
Then leap, son.

355
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,650
Stop! All right, I'm not even
supposed to be helping you,

356
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,151
so listen up.

357
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,888
The key to diagnosing
your case study is in chapter...

358
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,891
Drew. Outside. Now.

359
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:02,094
Wait. Drew, what chapter?

360
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:05,197
Wait. What book?
They all have chapters!

361
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,432
You. Now just exactly

362
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:10,035
what in the hell were you doing
in there? Come on.

363
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,738
Now I gave you the keys
to freedom, and you blew it.

364
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:15,140
Now I'm gonna stand here

365
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,209
and watch as you march
back into that hole

366
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,445
and tell those parasites that
they have to do it on their own.

367
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,980
You know what?

368
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,850
I can't do that, because
I'm one of those parasites.

369
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:26,818
In fact,
I'm the king of the parasites,

370
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,788
and whether you like it or not,
they need me.

371
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,691
So... fail me if you want,
but I'm gonna go back in there,

372
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,693
and I'm gonna help my friends.

373
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:38,830
Of course... that is
what you're going to do.

374
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,767
You're like me, number one.
You can't help yourself.

375
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,468
Son, you're a leader.

376
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,405
You had this whole thing
planned, didn't you?

377
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:49,308
You knew I wouldn't be able
to stay away from them.

378
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,010
Yes, indeed.
A piece of advice?

379
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:55,347
Pick a leadership style
and stick to it.

380
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:58,116
But please avoid
aggressive shaming,

381
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,352
because it's
my bread and butter.

382
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:03,789
Yeah. I've seen your work.
Very impressive.

383
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,158
Thank you.

384
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,660
It means a lot to me.

385
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,062
G-g-go, go, go.

386
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:11,797
Go, go.

387
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:13,966
This is embarrassing.

388
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,913
Why are you moping around
like a tiny girl bitch?

389
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:27,983
Wow. Can't you ever
just be like "Hi,"

390
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,619
or even better,
"What's up?"

391
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:34,223
Sure. What's up,
tiny girl bitch?

392
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:36,725
So you're too good
to assist Russell now?

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,028
No, I am the chief of surgery.
I am no one's secretary.

394
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:44,700
Secretary? He's asking you to
help him with a tricky surgery.

395
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,735
Sir, do you just hang around,

396
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,804
waiting for conversations
to weigh in on?

397
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:52,574
Yeah. That and my judge shows
get me through the day.

398
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,345
Now, look, good leaders
don't care about their ego.

399
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,981
If all you want to do is
get massaged,

400
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,416
I've got the number

401
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,485
of a girl who will take you
to the mountaintop.

402
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,687
God, you are a nasty old man.

403
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,055
Thanks, dear.

404
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,324
Turkleton,
let me cut to the quick...

405
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,326
Either you get into
that surgery,

406
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,362
pucker up
and start kissing Russell's ass

407
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:17,966
so he continues to raise giant
sums of money for this hospital,

408
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:18,934
which helps everyone,

409
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:22,238
or you can continue to act
like a... what was that, dear?

410
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:23,640
Tiny girl bitch.

411
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,976
That's right. Either way,
it's your call, chief.

412
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,779
Sir, you're so happy you're not
the chief anymore, aren't you?

413
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:32,315
Every second.

414
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:38,153
All right, we have five hours
to finish this project.

415
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,655
I'll start with the labs and
we'll move on to diagnosis.

416
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,025
Wait. So what, you
think you can just waltz back in here

417
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,095
after abandoning us and be
the leader of our group again?

418
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:49,231
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God!

419
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:52,401
Hey, yo, Drew,
I am glad you are back, man.

420
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:56,405
But I was thinking before we
start, we take a little break.

421
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,808
Garfunkel, handle that.

422
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:00,876
Yeah, you know
what would be great, Cole,

423
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,846
is if you could go get us all
some coffee.

424
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,449
Hey, maybe you could take
your wheelie shoes.

425
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,919
Oh, man. I'd love to,
but some big guys took 'em.

426
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:12,388
Oh. Well, then why don't
you just root around

427
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,223
for mints in my purse?

428
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:17,560
Sometimes being a leader is
knowing when to step up.

429
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,362
"It's important to mention
and briefly discuss

430
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:22,031
the enervation
of the pancreas."

431
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:26,402
And sometimes being a leader
is knowing when to step aside.

432
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,038
Hey, Russell, uh...

433
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:32,475
If you still need a
pair of hands, I'm here.

434
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,977
Good for you, Christopher.
You know,

435
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,279
reminds me of an old anecdote
from my good friend Bono...

436
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:40,082
Could you just cut? He was just
about to go onstage at Wimbledon.

437
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:42,718
It was the... it was the first
album, and the crowd was just...

438
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,354
Now that I guess
we love each other,

439
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,757
we should probably share
all our weird secrets.

440
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,992
All right, you go first.

441
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:52,561
I cry when I watch
"The Bachelor."

442
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:54,296
I watch "The Bachelor."

443
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,766
I, uh, lost my virginity
to a sofa.

444
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,236
- I like when ice skaters fall down.
- Doesn't count. Everybody likes that.

445
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,272
I like when children fall down.

446
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:04,907
I love you.

447
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,643
Fine!

448
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:09,012
I love you, too.

449
