1
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,944
Seriously, I'll beat you up.
Oh, sorry.

2
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:17,791
Okay, we gotta fix this tonight,
because tomorrow night's

3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,080
Birthing class, and Wednesday night is pregnancy sex.
I'm really starting to enjoy that birthing class.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,486
All the grunting and heavy breathing and--
you were the oy one doing that.

5
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,921
I was trying to get something going.
(beep)

6
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:29,357
Wait, what is that
walkie-talkie?

7
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:33,124
I told you to get a baby monitor.
Oh, this--better than a baby monitor.

8
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:36,064
It's long distance.
Where's the other one?

9
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,710
(beep)
(turk) jake cobra.
Come in, jake cobra.

10
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,477
We've been compromised, panther claw.
(beep)

11
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,366
What else did your baby get
that we could play with?

12
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,841
Uh, just give him 30 c.C.'s

13
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,433
Of, uh, medicine, stat.

14
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,516
It's a little hospital issue
I'm dealing with.

15
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:59,196
<i>(lucy) ben was our cadaver.</i>

16
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:01,586
<i>I'd met him on my first day
of medical school.</i>

17
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,086
<i>He was alive then,
and we connected.</i>

18
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:07,005
You look like you could use a grape.
Thanks, ben.

19
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,299
<i>So with ben,
I was the leader of our group.</i>

20
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,482
Drew, isolate the tendon
of the brachialis,

21
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:15,598
And, cole, though I've
almost reconciled the fact

22
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:18,663
That you are both my...
Boyfriend and probably

23
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,770
The human being I respect
least on earth, you know,

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,983
Besides myself--
we didt twice this morning.

25
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,175
Nobody's ever cared about
anything you've ever said, ever.

26
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,362
That's it. Don't even
come by my room later.

27
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,570
Really?
No.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,907
Attention, class.
That awesome!

29
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:38,823
Could we do that again, please?
For me? Please?

30
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,256
Just everybody act busy.
Act busy.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,714
Eyes up! Don't disrespect me!

32
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,580
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,801
There'll be a quiz next class
on the structure of the heart.

34
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,856
Each member of your team will
have to dissect a chamber.

35
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:54,846
Daddy said if I get
my g.P.A. Up, I get a jet ski.

36
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:56,487
Me, not caring.
(pats chest)

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,364
<i>Thought I was clear on that.
Anyway, my friend ben
will propel our group</i>

38
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,428
<i>To the top of the class.</i>

39
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:03,857
<i>I'm so moved, I want to put
those feelings into words.</i>

40
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,918
Dr. Turk, I can't wait to slice
up this old bastard's ticker.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,294
<i>Perfect.</i>

42
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,065
<i>(j.D.) elliot and I had missed</i>

43
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,922
<i>Our last few
pregnancy sex nights.</i>

44
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,958
<i>Tonight, I was ready.</i>

45
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,481
Loose limbs make limber lovers.
(door opens)

46
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,621
Loose limbs make limber lovers.
(door closes)

47
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,790
I'm so sorry.
I was stuck at work,

48
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,027
And then on my way home, I got
a craving for cambodian food.

49
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,080
J.D., they had a salad
that's all beef.

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,389
There's not a frickin'
green thing in this.

51
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:33,499
Well, let's get this party started.

52
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,872
I am totally ready
to get dirty with you.
(romantic music playing)

53
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,160
I don't know if you saw some
of the rose petals, but--

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,239
Mm-hmm. Oh, this is so good.
Yeah, um--over here.

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,167
And then--
go through here--

56
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,348
Oh, wait. Oh, okay.
(romantic music slows to a stop)

57
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,460
Just avoid the breast region.

58
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,546
They're big, but they're
not for touching--too sore.

59
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,132
And let's just
avoid the thighs.

60
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,267
They sort of
are like memory foam.

61
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,335
They leave a handprint.
And I have the elbows

62
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,928
Of a 75-year-old black man.
Honey, you look beautiful.

63
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,652
I'm sorry, sweetie. I just don't
feel super romantic right now.

64
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,098
Do you think it's okay
if we skip tonight?

65
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,161
Sure. This--this was all here
when I got home.

66
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,995
I promisyou,
after the baby comes,

67
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:12,516
Things are gonna go
back to normal, okay?

68
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:14,944
Make sure you chew.
Mm.

69
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,617
I'll get your hair
out of your way for you.

70
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,165
(mouth full) you want a bite,
sweet? It's so good.

71
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,181
No, thank you. I've already
had diarrhea today. 

72
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:21,952
Mm. Well,
I've not pooped in a week.

73
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,932
So yes, j.D. And I are not
having sex right now,

74
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,850
But it's fine. I put it
right into my schedule

75
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,596
For after the baby's born.
What is that, a sex trapper keeper?

76
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,968
Oh, I wish. , it's my
postpregnancy action plan.

77
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,088
See? By week three, I'll have
lost all the baby weight.

78
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,580
Weeks four and five,
I'll be deep

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,694
Into my postpartum depression,
where I'll spend most of my time

80
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:39,320
Crying and then regaining
the baby weight.

81
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,981
And then something
will snap me out of it--

82
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,445
Probably a sunrise
or a hilarious e-card.

83
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:46,662
And then by week six,
we are back to nasty town.

84
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,814
Let's walk in silence maybe.
Yes.

85
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,251
Hi, mr. And mrs. Foster.
How are you feeling?

86
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,428
Oh, he won't stop complaining.

87
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:59,377
I've got lymphoma.
Well, I've got multiple myeloma.

88
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:02,350
You two, come on now.
Nobody wins at cancer.

89
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,663
That's like double
what you've got.

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,856
I likeo start every day
with an exercise in futility,

91
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:14,385
And to that end, johnny legacy,
ulcerative colitis--

92
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:15,974
Tell me the five--
(jordan, voice echoing) perry!

93
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,604
It's behind me, isn't it?

94
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:22,077
<i>(lucy) with every couple,
there's the hard-a</i>

95
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,391
<i>And then the sweet one.</i>

96
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,538
Come here. I can't deal
with this year's clump

97
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,259
Of ugly nerds eyeballing me.

98
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:32,322
<i>Hot biscuits!
Cox is the sweet one?</i>

99
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,598
You know that bag of bones
my sister danni married?

100
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,831
He died. She got nothing.

101
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,185
Burt died?

102
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,438
You're not listening.
Danni got nothing.

103
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:43,138
You need to do your will
so I can get all your stuff

104
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:44,009
Chop-chop!

105
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,034
Ma'am, if you need any help
through thisifficult time,

106
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:50,323
I'm here.
You're that aaronson kid.

107
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,047
Mm-hmm.
I remember your mom
when she was wearing tube tops,

108
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,566
Giving it away to any guy
that would buy her a free steak.

109
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,111
She's so classy.

110
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,318
Oh, dear god, I love you.
(whispers) I love you.

111
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,858
So let me get this straight.

112
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:06,404
You and elliot aren't having sex
till after the baby's born?

113
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:08,975
Yes.
But who are you gonna
have sex with then?

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,175
Oh, she's gonna watch
while you do other chicks.

115
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:15,519
No, no, todd. Neither one of us
is going to be having sex.

116
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,151
I gotta take a walk five.

117
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,971
(snaps fingers)
he's not taking it well.

118
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,748
All the baby books say we'll be
back to our normal sex life

119
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:27,252
In about six weeks.
J.D., those baby books are filled with lies.

120
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,140
You don't know. It's crazy.
You're gonna be changing diapers

121
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,152
Covered in spit-up, all right?

122
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:34,266
You're not gonna have sex for
a long, long, long, long time.

123
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,424
No hide the penny?

124
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,172
No.
No me girl, you boy?

125
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,451
No.
No dirty zulu warrior?

126
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:40,905
No, and that one's racist.

127
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:43,511
Well, I'm--I'm sure there'll
still be cuddling, right?

128
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,369
Turk, I'm a man.
I have needs.

129
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:48,827
Please say there'll be cuddling.
She'll have the baby to cuddle with.

130
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:51,276
That little bastard.

131
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:58,117
Sync by ReHelen

132
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:04,967
www.addic7ed.com

133
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,483
<i>(j.D.) turk freaked me out
about what would happen</i>

134
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:10,833
<i>With elliot
after the baby came,</i>

135
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,886
<i>So I turned to my mentor.
Dorian, I do not need
to hear the pathetic slap</i>

136
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:17,076
And tickle of your
soon-to-be-vanished sex life.

137
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,941
I just feel like I'm racing
against the clock,

138
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,157
Like harrison ford in some kind
of... Harrison ford movie.

139
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:25,784
Talkin' pregnancy sex?

140
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:29,352
Yep, nothing like a girl
with a little junk in the front.

141
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,203
What are you,
some kind of pervy ninja?

142
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:32,890
Oh, thanks, man. Appreesh.

143
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,549
Hey, you know what
you should do?

144
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:37,381
Take your shorty on a babymoon.
What's a babymoon?

145
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,422
It's like a romantic trip
couples take

146
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,821
Before their baby's born.
That's not what I pictured.

147
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:44,977
Breast milk mojitos?

148
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:46,261
(burps)

149
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:50,874
You've had a few too many.
Drunk babies are hilarious.

150
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,208
You know, I haven't
bagged a preggers yet,

151
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,878
But I bet it's like
having sex with a water bed.

152
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:58,986
The baby bump actually has
the tension of an exercise ball.

153
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,381
I was a doula in madrid
for two years.

154
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,153
Oh, drew, so cool.
Been to europe.

155
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,299
Hey, just babymoon it,
dude, all right?

156
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,352
But don't--don't play any jazz
while you're having sex,

157
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,427
'cause I read on the web that
it will make the baby gay.

158
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:15,263
Makes babies gay,
ladies and gentlemen.

159
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,175
Jazz makes babies gay!

160
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:19,180
Future doctor.

161
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,072
You know, drew,

162
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,302
We haven't
really connected yet.

163
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:24,799
Nope.

164
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,667
Is that because
by sleeping with cole,

165
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,281
I've invalidated myself as a person?
Pretty much.

166
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,955
I get that.
So you ready for the big
heart dissection tomorrow?

167
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:35,437
Totally. Plus my dad sent
a care package of smoked meats

168
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,139
From home, so I thought
afterwards maybe you,

169
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,135
Me and cole could go to the park
and have a sausage picnic.
(grunts)

170
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,746
Okay, that sounded weird.
You know what else is weird

171
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:47,017
Is that you've been supervising
our group so much lately--

172
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,461
And you're doing it well, really--
yeah, drew, I'm with someone.

173
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,737
<i>Not where I was going.
I was just gonna say that you</i>

174
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,973
Haven't done any cutting
of our cadaver yet. Hmm.

175
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,539
I know. I'm psyched to get in there.
Hells, yeah.

176
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,285
My woman's gonna go all
edward scissorhands on his ass.

177
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,710
(imitates cutting noises)

178
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,481
(chuckles) I'll make it a hedge.
(imitating cutting noises)

179
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:08,264
Is he, like, really good in bed or something?
He'd have to be, right?

180
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:10,391
I'd hope so for your sake.

181
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:13,360
(continues imitating
cutting noises)

182
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:18,458
Hello.

183
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:20,872
My wife is making me
do a will,

184
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,239
So I'm going to need one of you
to act as my confidant

185
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,160
That I can talk at
but not listen to.

186
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,346
Well played, mr. Suffin.
Dr. Mahoney, it looks like

187
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,508
You're going to be my sounding
board. Congratulations.

188
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:32,989
Have fun.
You're dead to me.

189
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:36,588
So jordan is after my stuff,
but there is no way

190
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:39,580
That succubus is gonna get
my recliner after I die.

191
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,512
It is the one chair
I sit in when I wah tv

192
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,837
And yell at sports figures
and reality stars.

193
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,287
Fine.
Right before you kick it,

194
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,199
Stick a dead bird
underneath the cushion.

195
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,756
That'll get ripe real fast,

196
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:52,769
And you can sit back and watch
the whole show from hell.

197
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,871
Mahoney, you are a promising
young doctor, you are.
(pager beeps)

198
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:57,257
(groans)

199
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,946
(monitor beeping)

200
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,194
(sighs)

201
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,695
I'm so sorry, mr. Foster.
We did everything we could.

202
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,337
Can I have a moment
to--to say good-bye?

203
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:10,706
Of course.

204
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:17,451
They were married 47 years.

205
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:21,622
Rdan and I have been
together for almost 30.

206
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,991
Yeah, but life expectancy for
people your age is excellent,

207
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,578
You know, unless you're
a type-a workaholic

208
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,333
In a high-stress job with,
like, a lot of built-up anger.
Enough.

209
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,902
You're not crying, are you?

210
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,512
(voice breaking)
I was joking at first,

211
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,990
But, um, I'm just having
a pregnancy moment here.

212
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,174
I just... (sniffles)

213
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,646
I'm just really gonna
miss you when you're gone!

214
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,915
(crying)

215
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:48,886
<i>I snuck into the lab to get
ready for tomorrow's exam.</i>

216
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:51,440
<i>Med students are told to keep
a cadaver's face covered</i>

217
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,941
<i>So it doesn't
feel too personal,</i>

218
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,943
<i>But ben didn't like it.</i>

219
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,176
Oh, it's stuffy under there.

220
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,578
Sorry about that.
How you doing?

221
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:05,409
Not too shabby.
You know, I haven't cut you at all yet,

222
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,744
But, uh, I'm gonna
get in there tomorrow.

223
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:11,900
Lucy, we're friends.
It would be an honor.

224
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,494
Aw, ben, that's so sweet.

225
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,680
(stammering)
what are you doing here?

226
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,285
Were--were you talking
to your cadaver?

227
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:24,102
Uh, yeah. I thought I heard that
you were supposed to talk to it

228
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:27,575
Like a plant, so that
it will, you know... Grow.

229
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,845
What are you doing here?

230
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:32,311
Oh! I saw the light on,

231
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,421
'cause, you know, I was over
in my office workin',

232
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,003
'cause I work at night,
you know.

233
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,573
(beep)
(j.D.) I counted to 50.
Ready or not, here I come.

234
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,765
(beep)
(whispering) you didn't
see me, all right?

235
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:43,546
I wasn't here.

236
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,456
You'll do great tomorrow.
Thanks, ben.

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,478
Hello, wife face.

238
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:54,362
Your shift is over, and I'm
taking you on a babymoon.

239
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,943
(chuckles) what?
What are you talking about?

240
00:10:57,062 --> 00:11:00,068
A babymoon is a vacation
you anyour loved one take

241
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,242
Right before your baby
comes out of your special area.

242
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:04,169
And the resort
I found is amazing.

243
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,757
They have horseback riding
and jet skiing.

244
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,084
Oh, is there also
a punching each other

245
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,788
In the stomach contest?
'cause that's another thing

246
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,631
That I can't do.
Well, we could have hotel sex.
You like that.

247
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,058
We could do girl hair
with our towels.

248
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,313
We can turn the temperature
all the way down to 50

249
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,815
And then crank it back up to 80.
We'll be like gods controlling the weather.

250
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,537
Shall we go?
Yeah, let's go. (laughs)

251
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:26,901
<i>(j.D.)
sometimes something small</i>

252
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,567
<i>Can represent
something much bigger...</i>

253
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,208
<i>Whether it's a pen that
represents your mortality...</i>

254
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,409
Jordan, I...

255
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,119
I can't sign a will right now.

256
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,781
And as usual,
please don't call me back.

257
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,905
<i>A suitcase that mocks your one
last gasp of coupledom...</i>

258
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,176
Wait, what are we doing?
J.D., this is ridiculous.

259
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,004
We can't go on
a babymoon right now.

260
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,997
There's 9,000 things to do
before the baby comes.

261
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,276
We don't have time for this.

262
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:55,355
<i>Or a tiny exam</i>

263
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:58,526
<i>That's a whopping 25%
of your final grade.</i>

264
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:00,803
All right,
lucy bennett, you're up.

265
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,501
Let's see if you can
bring it home for the team.

266
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:06,457
<i>(lucy) time to shine.
Here I come, ben.</i>

267
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:08,533
Please don't cut me.

268
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,522
It's not right.

269
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,480
I-I'm sorry, dr. Turk.
I can't do this.

270
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,465
We have to do the babymoon.

271
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:23,937
Turk said that
once the kid's born,

272
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,334
Our lives are gonna change forever.
Yeah, turk also said

273
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,928
That "knight rider" was a documentary.
It's based on fact, elliot. Everybody knows that.

274
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,320
Plus once the kid's born,
you're gonna be obsessed.

275
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,438
You've probably already picked
out what she's gonna wear

276
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:37,817
On her first day of school.
So? That decision brands
you forever. I still have

277
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,251
Night terrors about
my first day of high school.

278
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,653
I wore this suede fringe outfit
because of that movie

279
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,738
"can't buy me love." oh, j.D.,
it's the most amazing film.

280
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:49,494
Fade in--patrick dempsey, a fresh-faced nerd.
Elliot, do you think there's a patrick dempsey movie

281
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:52,758
I haven't seen?
J.D., I know that some couples don't make time

282
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:53,756
For each other as new parents,

283
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:57,290
But we're not gonna be
like that. We're different.
Are you sure?

284
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,770
Because you also said
we were gonna be different

285
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,516
And not fight
the first year of marriage.

286
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,826
You did the laundry,
and you put my work socks

287
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,453
Beside my gym socks, and they
were touching in the drawer.

288
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,827
I mean, that's disgusting.
I had to throw them out.

289
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:08,975
Okay, I n't have time for this.

290
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,106
Lucy, you screwed us.
We're being graded as a team.

291
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,714
Ben's not just a grade to me.
He's a person.

292
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:17,544
Hey, this is bigger
than you or him.

293
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:22,188
This is about a jet ski, yo!
Cole, silence or punching.
You know our deal.

294
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,989
This is ben's heart
we're talking about.

295
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,732
It's where he stores
his feelings and memories.

296
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:31,152
Ladies and gentlemen, apparently
the heart stores memories!

297
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,660
Future doctors!
(descending whistle)

298
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,751
Lucy, you have got to cut.

299
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,049
The jet ski is
the motorcycle of the sea!

300
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:42,638
Ow!

301
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:43,679
Pain is how we learn.

302
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:47,800
Hey, guys, I want you to meet me
in the o.R. In an hour.

303
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,213
Do I still have to hang out
with you as your confidant

304
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:53,536
Even though there's
not a chance in hell

305
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,919
You'reonna listen to anything I say?
Yes.

306
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,615
You know, just because one
of those old, married peop

307
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:02,559
Croaked doesn't mean you or jordan are gonna die.
I shouldn't have brought the will to the hospital.

308
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,540
It was a rookie mistake.
I mean, around here,

309
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,970
You just can't let your work
and your personal life overlap.

310
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,627
Yeah, that was always
ally mcbeal's problem, too.

311
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:13,024
It's so hard being
a working woman in the mid '90s.

312
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:15,780
That's it.
You're out as confidant.

313
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,957
I'd rather have dorian,
for god's sake.

314
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,121
Fine. I'm gonna tell him you said that.
No. No!

315
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:23,698
No!

316
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,896
I'm so glad you chose me
to confide in, perry.

317
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:31,981
Denise caught me up to speed.

318
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,932
By the by, I've got
some lady problems, too.

319
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,776
You do realize that by saying
something like that to me,

320
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,103
You're just continuing
the never-ending cycle of abuse?

321
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,158
<i>I don't do it on purpose.
(j.D.) I do. I love the attention.</i>

322
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,854
So I explained to elliot
that we have to make more time

323
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,353
For each other
before the baby comes,

324
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:49,369
D she won't listen to me.
Dorian, you're a fool.

325
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:51,489
Oh, why do you have
to be that way, perry?

326
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,968
<i>(singsong voice) more, please!</i>

327
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,747
A wife cannot hear logic
from her husband.

328
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,555
It must come
from someone else--

329
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:00,697
A friend, a stranger, oprah.
If barbie will not listen

330
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:03,176
To what's good for her, then you
just gotta make it happen.

331
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,846
You're good. I love
confiding with you, perry.

332
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,021
Let's do more later.
Ooh.

333
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,744
Call you.

334
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,831
<i>Wow. Somebody is
really dehydrated.</i>

335
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,984
I'm-a tell you
about my friend jake.

336
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,245
Jake and I have played
in a weekly basketball game

337
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,632
For about seven years. Our kids
go to the same school together.

338
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,248
He's really important to me,

339
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:30,897
And this is him right here.

340
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:34,818
âª your minds are blown âª

341
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:37,829
So why are we going to be
looking into your friend's gs?

342
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:38,841
For lucy.

343
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,582
Look,
I know ben's real to you.

344
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:45,197
But your patients
are always gonna be real,

345
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:47,035
And the truth is, there are
gonna be many a times

346
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:49,766
Where you're gonna have to hurt
them in order to help them,

347
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,314
Like I'm doing
with my friend here.

348
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:55,429
I'll let you retake
the test again tonight.
(gasps)

349
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:58,450
You ready?
Do blue crabs whistle?

350
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:02,184
They do, when you boil them alive.
(mouths word)

351
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,837
Yes, dr. Turk.
I won't let you down.

352
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:06,859
I'm gonna go study now.
Okay.

353
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,757
So this guy's a friend
of yours, huh?

354
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:10,540
No, I've never met him.

355
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,118
This is just some dude
with appendicitis.

356
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:17,089
âª and he blows
your mind again âª

357
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,679
âª ooh, again âª

358
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,795
Scalpel.

359
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,600
How you doing, mr. Foster?

360
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,134
I'm so sorry about penny.

361
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,082
You know, you always think

362
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,902
You're gonna have
just a little more time.

363
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:35,836
Yeah, I guess you do.

364
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,271
You know, he's right

365
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,126
About the whole
running out of time thing.

366
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,287
I guess, but having
a baby's not like dying.

367
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,545
(chuckles)

368
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:52,601
It's--
it's exactly like dying.

369
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:55,032
We have sam on the weekends.
We know how to handle it.

370
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,410
Yeah, but stepkids aren't
the same. They're a rental.

371
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,182
You gotta take mildly
good care of 'em,

372
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,553
Return 'em with a full tank
of gas and not too many dents.

373
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,769
I'll tell you what there,
barbie.

374
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,770
I'm gonna go ahead
and give you my own version

375
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,935
Of something
your husband told you

376
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,800
But you couldn't hear
because you're married to him.

377
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,391
After that baby comes,
nothing goes back to normal.

378
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:17,352
Time doesn't slow down.
It only gets faster.

379
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:21,101
And then 20 years later
you find yourself signing a will

380
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:24,136
And realizing that you didn't
spend nearly enough time

381
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,881
With the one person
you care most about.

382
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,914
God,
I wish j.D. Had said that.

383
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,327
Ah, don't blame yourself.
I can't understand him either.

384
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,873
Sounds like a bag of cats.

385
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,912
J.D., I got your page.
Look, before you say anything,

386
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:43,027
I wanted to tell you
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

387
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,754
Look, you know
this is what I do

388
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,183
Before big
life-changing events.

389
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,446
I get way inside my own head
and freak out.

390
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,700
Like three weeks
before med school started,

391
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,299
I got way into shoplifting
and watching anime pornography--

392
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,302
I mean, I'm talking some
weird-ass cartoons, man.

393
00:17:56,302 --> 00:18:00,594
Anyway, I love you,
and I'm sorry

394
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:02,108
That I wasn't able
to hear you,

395
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:04,034
And I didn't mean
to ruin the babymoon.

396
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:08,679
You didn't. Panther claw,
the walrus has landed.

397
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,203
(beep)
(turk) roger that.
We're set for go.

398
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:11,930
(beep)

399
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:17,171
(gasps) oh, my god, j.D.

400
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,596
(j.D.) I figured if you
couldn't go to the babymoon,

401
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:22,080
I'd bring the babymoon to you.

402
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,150
You did all this by yourself?

403
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,298
Well, I had a little help.

404
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:29,087
Denise brought
some nonalcoholic beer.
(chuckles)

405
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,351
Yeah, I got it for this dude I'm
railing. He used to be an alkie.

406
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,227
Mm, probably not an appropriate
time to bring all that up,

407
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,951
But there it is.
Thank you.

408
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,474
And I brought some
sensual body chocolate.

409
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,401
Oh.

410
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,631
What's the situation
with those big ol' d's?

411
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,734
Got any milk yet?
He should go.

412
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,930
Get the hell outta here.

413
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,607
Shall we?
We shall.

414
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,951
<i>(j.D.)
well have points in life</i>

415
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,417
<i>When things
get painfully real...</i>

416
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,946
You ready?

417
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:57,437
Yep.

418
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,308
Ow. Ow!

419
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,484
Ben, I haven't even
touched you yet.

420
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:06,507
You're doing a great job.

421
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,664
<i>When thinking about the end
makes you reevaluate the now.</i>

422
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:15,436
There. I just signed
your ridiculous will.

423
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:17,012
But before I give it to you,

424
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:18,498
I'd like you
to make me a promise

425
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:21,563
That just you and I
can go away this weekend--

426
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:24,900
No kids.
The no-kids thing
is not really a big deal,

427
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,540
'cause I don't see them
that much anyway.

428
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,533
But it would be really nice
to get away from the nannies.

429
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:33,493
Your will.
I'd like to propose a toast.

430
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:35,757
To our deaths--

431
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,455
May they be untimely
and inconvenient

432
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:40,027
For all our loved ones.

433
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,781
So sweet.

434
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,964
(clink)
I love you.

435
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,586
(laughs)

436
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:48,546
<i>I guess you're just lucky
if you have someone</i>

437
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:50,260
<i>Who'll go along
for the ride with you.</i>

438
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,180
I can't believe
we're having a baby.

439
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,194
I know.
It's pretty amazing, huh?

440
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,522
This is pretty awesome,
though, right?

441
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:00,432
I mean,
just as good as hotel sex.

442
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:04,870
You know, there is a hojo's
down the street--

443
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,913
Thin walls, scratchyowels,
sketchy types out front.

444
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:11,475
What do you say?

445
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:12,943
for motel sex?

446
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,784
Ooh.

447
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:18,886
It'll be like I'm a senator,
and you're a tobacco lobbyis

448
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,567
We should arrive separately.
(laughs)

449
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:24,322
Or you're a bored housewife,
and I'm a strapping drifr

450
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:26,734
Looking for a warm meal
and some comfort.

451
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,434
J.D., come here.

452
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,485
<i>(lucy)
all my cutting problems over.</i>

453
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,438
<i>No more talking cadavers
for me.</i>

454
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:44,526
<i>There's nothing
to be scared of.
(screams)</i>

455
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:49,146
(screams) dr. D!
What are you doing here?

456
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,781
I'm playing
hide-and-seek with turk.

457
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,382
Don't tell him I'm here.
Close me up. Close me up!

458
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:58,248
(lowers voice) hey, if j.D.
Sees me, I wasn't here.

459
00:20:58,248 --> 00:21:00,859
Close me up. Close me up!

460
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,596
He's never gonna find me.
He's never gonna find me.
