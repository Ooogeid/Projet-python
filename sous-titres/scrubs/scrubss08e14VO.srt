1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:03,973
Here you go, Sammy.

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,582
I know I was supposed
to drop Sam off in daycare,

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:10,183
but the only other kid there was
a creepy little girl with freckles.

4
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:12,752
Please don't give my son
your prejudice of redheads.

5
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:14,890
They're god's mistakes, J.D.
Accept it.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,598
You know what?
Let's not fight, because Sammy,

7
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:22,622
today is the 7-year anniversary of the
first time your daddy and I ever kissed.

8
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:23,786
<i>I forgot!</i>

9
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:26,235
<i>Distract her so you can
run and get some flowers.</i>

10
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:30,046
Darling, do you know what Sam loves?
When you sing <i>Old McDonald</i>.

11
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,329
He does?

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,346
<i>Nobody loved Elliot's tone-deaf
rendition of </i>Old McDonald.

13
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:39,045
# Old MacDonald had a farm #
# Farm... #

14
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:43,769
<i>It was so excruciating I knew exactly
how long it took her to finish.</i>

15
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,177
Look out!
<i>I had 44 seconds.</i>

16
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:49,195
# And on that farm
there was a cougar #

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,926
# Ee I ee I o #

18
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:52,890
# With a... here #
# And a... there #

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,169
# Here a... There a... #
# Everywhere... #

20
00:00:58,587 --> 00:00:59,905
<i>Stupid line!</i>

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,483
<i>You loved shoplifting
when you were a kid.</i>

22
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,248
<i>Just grab something and run.</i>

23
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,595
Be cool, Honky.

24
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,325
Hey, Leonard.

25
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:10,851
What's that?

26
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,069
Leonard, calm down!

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,439
# Ee I ee I o #
Did you like that, Sammy?

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,251
I feel like you raped my soul.

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:31,327
That was wonderful, darling.
I got you a little anniversary present.

30
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,651
Why would you get me a toothbrush?

31
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:37,266
<i>Damn it!
I thought it was a sex toy.</i>

32
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:38,892
<i>Okay, just cover.</i>

33
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,780
I borrowed your
toothbrush this morning,

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,328
when I was showering,
dropped it,

35
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,183
and I may have
peed on it, a little.

36
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,810
You pee in my shower?

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,483
You know baby, I'm making this up.
I forgot to get you a present.

38
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,378
So you don't pee in my shower?

39
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,192
Of course not.
<i>Oh yes I do.</i>

40
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:58,113
You don't have to get me a gift
for the anniversary of a kiss.

41
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,244
That's the best part
about us having dated before.

42
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:04,208
We don't have to deal
with that drama ever again.

43
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:05,391
The best.

44
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,447
- I got you.
- Look...

45
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:14,135
That's how the <i>old</i>
Leonard used to behave.

46
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:15,100
Hook it up.

47
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:21,986
<i>Spring was in the air and
everyone was getting caught up in it.</i>

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,945
<i>Whether it was a new romance...</i>

49
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:27,227
Have you ever been in love before?

50
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,297
Once. She was a janitor.

51
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,226
Well, for her the mop
always came first, you know.

52
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,097
And I was fine, until...

53
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:37,520
One day, I come home from work
early and there they are, in bed.

54
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,585
It was just cuddling,
but still, you know.

55
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:44,667
It's really the emotional betrayal
that makes it hard to talk about.

56
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,385
But you've changed
all of that for me.

57
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,689
<i>Or an old romance still going strong.</i>

58
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:52,680
Excuse me!

59
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,232
Could you hold that please?
Excuse me!

60
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,996
My god, you make me so hot!

61
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,937
Why?

62
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:07,208
<i>Other couples just weren't clicking.</i>

63
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:08,750
Are you mad at me?

64
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,932
I'm not mad, I'm hurt.

65
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:14,258
You've been ignoring me so much
it makes me wanna punch something.

66
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,470
God you're firm!

67
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,329
I'm just bummed about Carla.

68
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,301
Between Izzy and her
being pregnant again,

69
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,303
it's like I don't have
a wife anymore.

70
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,103
She's just a mommy.

71
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,644
Is it that bad?

72
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:30,616
Don't you love listening to her
breathe on the baby monitor?

73
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:31,922
Sometimes.

74
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:33,681
Baby.

75
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,905
I thought you said
you wanted to get it on.

76
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,349
We're not finished?

77
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,949
- We haven't started.
- Oh sorry. Do your thing.

78
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,814
It's pretty bad.

79
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,225
What the hell was that for?

80
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,800
I wanted to see if it was as firmer
when you weren't expecting it.

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,849
- And?
- Firmer.

82
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,191
That's right.

83
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:57,127
Let's call this meeting
of the Brain Trust to order.

84
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,317
As you know,

85
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:03,013
ever since our esteemed member Lloyd
died snorkeling in his father's pool,

86
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,295
we've tried to make do
with the next best thing.

87
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,209
Still, I think we realized
that's not really working out.

88
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,092
Especially since Todd keeps
high-fiving it and knocking it over.

89
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:13,668
Look at how he's posed.
I can't resist!

90
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,713
Yes you can. That is why
I had you over to my garage

91
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,210
last weekend to take
my seminar on willpower.

92
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,100
And you still owe me 60 bucks.

93
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,290
Now, Brain Trust by law 47a
clearly states what, Ted?

94
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,925
- "Live free or die."
- That's New Hampshire.

95
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:33,237
47a clearly states we must
always have exactly four members.

96
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,846
So I proudly announce
the re-instatement of Doug Murphy

97
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:39,090
as a permanent member
of the Brain Trust.

98
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,190
Permanent member until you find
someone you like better, right?

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,410
Come on!
You're just being insecure.

100
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:47,710
Dudes!

101
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:50,593
You're alive!
You're out. Lloyd, you're back in.

102
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:53,334
- We thought you were dead.
- Faked my own death, bro!

103
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,663
I was in debt
big time to a bookie.

104
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,575
Anyway, didn't work out.
Saw me at a mall.

105
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,416
So what's new?

106
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,262
Can I borrow 80,000 bucks?

107
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,988
Can't really swing that, Lloyd.
Our credit lines overextended

108
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,780
since we had Cheap Trick
play at the Brain Trust picnic.

109
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,377
Goodbye Lloyd.

110
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,107
And Doug is back in, permanent!

111
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:15,836
You know, until Lloyd
gets back on his feet.

112
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,971
Okay, meeting adjourned.
And, oh! Almost forgot, jeez.

113
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,437
Ted, pass these out
to everyone in the hospital.

114
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,297
Cardboard five!

115
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,750
I want you in my garage
this afternoon.

116
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,336
Bring 120 bucks.
And a steak sandwich.

117
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,929
Season 8 Episode 14
My Soul On Fire: Part 1

118
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:55,054
- What the hell is this?
- Oh my god!

119
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:59,672
"You are cordially invited to the
wedding of Lady and the janitor."

120
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,986
The janitor is getting
married before me? That's it.

121
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,763
I may actually kill myself.

122
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,492
Of course, I'm the
only one who wasn't invited.

123
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:07,616
Here's yours.

124
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,663
<i>Okay. Do not reveal
how touched you are.</i>

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,751
Turk, could you please pass me
the salt for my baked potato.

126
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,869
This wedding is in three days.

127
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,427
And it's in the Bahamas.
Nobody's going to this thing.

128
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,909
Oh I know I'm not.

129
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:24,462
I heard at night, the octopuses
come out on the land

130
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,812
and drag people up into trees

131
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:30,377
and rip their faces off
with their powerful suction cups.

132
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,110
I guess I was moved
by the janitor's invite,

133
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,906
because I did this.

134
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,247
I know the janitor isn't
exactly a friend to us,

135
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:43,165
but he is a part of our family.
A horrible, horrible part.

136
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,885
Like an uncle who shows up
at your ballet class,

137
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,321
and whispers "Good girl"
when you plié.

138
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,552
- You have an uncle like that too?
- That's not important, Carla.

139
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,654
Still, I think we should use
this as an opportunity

140
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:55,834
to go on a much needed vacation.

141
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:59,148
We work very hard. And
I think it's time to live a little.

142
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,554
You really think we should go?

143
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:06,943
I'm really just sort of
talking to these two tables.

144
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,725
- Just these.
- The two of them.

145
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,607
But you said we
should <i>all</i> live a little.

146
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,137
And I think
you should on your own.

147
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,256
But in this circumstance,
I was just talking at

148
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:20,573
just mainly these,
these two tables focusing here.

149
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,079
Actually...

150
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,038
I'm thinking about going.

151
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:26,848
Bob, I...

152
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,415
I didn't see you there.

153
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,268
So...

154
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:34,732
I am talking to
your table as well, Todd,

155
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,309
but not your chair.

156
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:39,285
Not your chair.

157
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,268
<i>Surprisingly, my friends listened.</i>

158
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,009
We can't go, Turk.
We'd never left Izzy alone before.

159
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,085
Baby, separation is healthy.

160
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,858
You want to know what happens to kids
who are too close to their mothers?

161
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,258
They end up like that.

162
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,851
Mom, when I'm gone,

163
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,782
I guess your feet
will just have to rub themselves!

164
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:58,339
Ted has his own room now.

165
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,928
He only sleeps with his mom
when he's had a bad dream.

166
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,246
Or she has.

167
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:05,534
Honey, all I'm trying to say is that
with Izzy and a new baby on the way,

168
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,181
this might be our last chance
to have some you and me time.

169
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,221
I'm in.

170
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,092
Awesome. Think about it, Elliot.

171
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,693
Three days and you're walking
on the beach in your bikini.

172
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,893
- That's sexy.
- Shut up.

173
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:20,542
Cool.

174
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,142
What? I know I have
to be in a bathing suit.

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,295
Hey Feldman!

176
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:29,389
Fire up the fat vac!
Mama need some lipo.

177
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,260
Dude.

178
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,389
We are in for the Bahamas.
Upstairs!

179
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,794
Downstairs.

180
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:43,106
- I still don't like downstairs.
- Really? You haven't come around yet?

181
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,473
Anyway, I got you a present.

182
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,157
It's an exact replica of the tiki

183
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,653
from <i>The Brandy Bunch
Goes To Hawaii</i> episode

184
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:54,524
Greg had this on when he got
into the surfing accident,

185
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:57,085
Peter had it on when
he saw the tarantula in the bed,

186
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,313
- And Alice...
- Turk, Turk. I've seen it before.

187
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,124
Do you remember the music they
played when anything bad happened?

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,336
Wait, you don't have one.

189
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:08,823
Or do I?

190
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,730
- Downstairs!
- Really?

191
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,206
No! What's wrong with you?

192
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:16,844
I didn't want to do it either,
I think it's stupid.

193
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,820
- Where'd you get them?
- I bought them on the Interweb.

194
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,773
The seller was anonymous
but I think I know who it was.

195
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:27,319
Sold! Finally.

196
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,455
These things have been ruining
my life for too long.

197
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:34,746
The curse is yours, John Dorian.
The curse is yours!

198
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,641
Man, that guy hates normal doors.

199
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:44,699
Do you think if we wear these,
bad stuff will happen to us?

200
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,146
That's kind of the fun, isn't it?

201
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,343
I need your signature on that
spleenectomy patient's discharge form.

202
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:52,808
This pen doesn't work.

203
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,140
That's gonna be annoying.

204
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,925
Now you made my woman all mad.

205
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:00,925
Good god.

206
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:02,482
Tiki-bump.

207
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,446
That was sextastic.

208
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,370
I kind of feel lightheaded.

209
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,288
A good loving will do that to you.

210
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,352
So will not eating for 36 hours.

211
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:18,446
Elliot, just say it was
the good loving, as a joke.

212
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,256
Fine. That was the good loving.

213
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,669
<i>I knew it.</i>

214
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:23,927
J.D.

215
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:26,693
Forget it.

216
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:27,811
What?

217
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,405
Okay. What the hell.

218
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,664
Here goes.

219
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:35,264
I love you.

220
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,516
I love you so much the last thing
I think about before we go to bed at night

221
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:42,205
and the first thing I think about
when I wake up in the morning

222
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,634
is our future.

223
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:44,860
Come here.

224
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:49,590
I love you too.

225
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,037
<i>And there it was.</i>

226
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,543
- <i>A moment so perfect that I...</i>
- That's it?

227
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,460
What?

228
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,953
I did not just say "I love you",
I actually explained how much

229
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,947
I love you, plus you
weren't even looking at me.

230
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,253
But I do love you.

231
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,629
I think you're the most
amazing woman that I've...

232
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,185
No, no. You are not
getting off that easy.

233
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,649
You have to obsess
over it a little like I did, see.

234
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,777
I actually jointed down
some notes in my notebook

235
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:15,413
on how to get into the whole
"I love you" conversation

236
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,201
before I settled on the fake
spontaneous blurting thing.

237
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,253
You do know that
you're a crazy person?

238
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:21,867
- Course.
- Just checking.

239
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:24,837
Now you think about it and
surprise me when I'm not expecting it.

240
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,786
Night.

241
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,317
Elliot, when I think
about our love...

242
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:36,858
- Too soon.
- Okay.

243
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,892
What are you doing? The van to take
us to the airport is downstairs.

244
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:44,823
It's called my job,
it's that little thing I do

245
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:47,465
70 to 80 hours a week
while you're eating, drinking,

246
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,607
napping, spending, plucking,
ignoring the children

247
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,990
and singing rap tunes
into a hair brush.

248
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,118
You forgot about the nanny
cam in the bedroom, didn't you?

249
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,773
# I like it like that #
# She working that back #

250
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,797
# I don't know how to act #
# Slow motion for me #

251
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,673
I did, but I'm okay with it.
Because I'm fly.

252
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:09,297
You realize I'm probably gonna have
to work the entire time we're there?

253
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:12,685
The only thing better than going on
vacation without our kids is going

254
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,021
without our kids and you're too
busy to spend time with me.

255
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:17,231
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

256
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,290
It's an amazing gift.

257
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,337
Come on!

258
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,278
Dear god!

259
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,618
What the hell are you wearing?

260
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:34,136
I just got my Bahamas gear on.

261
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:37,877
Have you seen
my cute white linen shirt?

262
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:39,718
It looks better on me.

263
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:42,109
I know you're very proud
you've been working out

264
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,593
- but we're in a hospital so button up.
- Fine.

265
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,834
The second we get to the Bahamas,
it's going to be raining abs.

266
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,698
Hope Town!
We made it.

267
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:14,562
Baby, look at this place.

268
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:19,045
Okay. So Izzy drank
her whole bottle, right?

269
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:21,833
Okay, great.

270
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:25,968
Excuse me, when you're done with that
phone, may I borrow it to call my kids?

271
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,344
- Really?
- No.

272
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,062
Did you even bother
to tell the babysitter

273
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,897
she has to stay
overnight this weekend?

274
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,148
She'll figure it out.

275
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,536
Ted, wait here for my bag.

276
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,463
Got enough sunscreen on there Ted?

277
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,524
I go through a tube
about every three hours.

278
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,459
My skin drinks it.

279
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,481
What's that about?

280
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,011
Todd went to med school there.

281
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,740
<i>And then we saw
where Todd got it from.</i>

282
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,052
<i>His old professor
was the best high-fiver</i>

283
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,864
<i>in all the world.</i>

284
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:12,081
<i>And then, we'd all have sex
to celebrate surviving.</i>

285
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,010
Chop chop, Ted.

286
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,969
I could kill him here.

287
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,893
You know how much I love you.
When I first...

288
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,693
Not in front of everybody. Plus...

289
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,158
- I'm a little lightheaded.
- Because you haven't eaten in 3 days.

290
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,068
I know what my body can take.

291
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:28,199
Don't care.

292
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,282
Let's go.

293
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:37,554
Tiki time.

294
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,766
Should we go check in
with everybody else?

295
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:41,625
Not yet.

296
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:45,662
I gotta wiz.

297
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,365
There's a bathroom like right there.

298
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:53,037
I know but I'm already in.

299
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,007
Fine, Elliot.

300
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,925
You know, the Abacos
have incredible snorkeling.

301
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:03,384
Since you're not a strong
swimmer, let's say we get

302
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,774
really really drunk and go later.

303
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:09,362
Darling, I distinctly remember telling
you I had to do some work down here.

304
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,322
But if you'd like me to stop so that
we can spend some time together,

305
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:15,217
you just say...

306
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:16,482
a word.

307
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:17,782
Never.

308
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:20,688
Hey, meathead.
I've got a present for you.

309
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,023
I'm thinking of going bonefishing.

310
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:25,141
I'm going bonefishing right now.

311
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,558
And Ms. Sullivan,
thanks so much for that setup.

312
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,158
You're welcome.
Go away.

313
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,217
No way!

314
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,012
- I can't believe you came!
- I know, right?

315
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,247
Why the hell did you come?

316
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,835
I rallied the troops.

317
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,800
I invited you to a wedding in
a foreign country on 3 days' notice

318
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,431
You weren't supposed to come!
I just wanted the gifts.

319
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,270
You see any of
the other 847 invites here?

320
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,128
We're not even
having a ceremony, man!

321
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,811
Fine, then we'll just have
a vacation. No harm done.

322
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,215
All right.

323
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:01,210
- You have to.
- Elliot, you are so right. Honey,

324
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,358
- We're gonna have a ceremony.
- A big one.

325
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,470
I'm gonna kill you.

326
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:15,206
<i>We loved our hotel room, but then Elliot
saw something that made her skin crawl.</i>

327
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:21,900
Here's the towels you wanted.

328
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:23,888
Thanks, sweety.

329
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:28,735
There's no way I'm using those after
that little redhead freak touched them.

330
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,039
I can smell his freckles.

331
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:34,933
I can't believe you hid
this hatred from me for seven years.

332
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,186
Deal with it.

333
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,551
Hey, baby.

334
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,745
What are you doing in there?

335
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,686
Oh just putting some
sunscreen on my face.

336
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,204
Good, cause...

337
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:48,313
I think now might be a really nice time
to tell you that I love you so much...

338
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,633
- J.D, I'm pooing.
- See you at the beach.

339
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,001
I miss Izzy but

340
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,519
I always imagined being
some place like this with you.

341
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,005
Just be here, Turk.

342
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,410
Hey, Diane.

343
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,651
Here comes my ex-wife
and your beard.

344
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:22,455
Fifty percent real. Enjoy.

345
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,341
You two both've gotten a good look?

346
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:27,741
Some of these.

347
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,023
Little of that.

348
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:31,423
Yeah? Good, then we're done.
Give me that.

349
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,937
Oh my god.

350
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:35,642
Conch fritters.
You guys, I'm gonna see you later.

351
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,701
I'm gonna go get like 40 of these.

352
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,395
She should have gotten a lipo.

353
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,257
It does hurt a little bit
when I sit, though.

354
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,634
Hey, Gandhi.

355
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,987
Here comes your better half.

356
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,162
That's what I'm talking a-

357
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:56,627
bout?

358
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,760
She's wearing shorts
and a mom suit.

359
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,948
No. Don't you
nuh nuh nuh my wife!

360
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:05,088
Hi guys!

361
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:06,594
How you doing?

362
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:09,192
I left my cell phone in the room.

363
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:11,742
I'm gonna go back and get it in case
something happens with Izzy,

364
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,027
I'll be back.
How awesome is this!

365
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,130
Doesn't look any better
going away, does it, Gandhi?

366
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:25,671
I got two words for you guys.
Banana and hammock.

367
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:37,574
Baby, you know why
I love the Bahamas?

368
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,586
They got brothers
on the money, check it.

369
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,741
Don't that look like Uncle Dare?

370
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,331
Why aren't you out on the beach?

371
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,367
Because Daddy came to seduce you.

372
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,159
But for me to get my sexy mode,

373
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,716
I'm gonna need you to take off
the hat and stop picking your toes.

374
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,288
It's alright, I'll push through it.
Baby, look.

375
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:02,782
Izzy's not here.
And this is the Bahamas.

376
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,112
The islands of making love.

377
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:07,857
You...

378
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:09,363
Me...

379
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,234
The ocean.

380
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,469
Underwater relations.

381
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,337
Lead the way.

382
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,913
That's the nanny.

383
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,001
This'll just take a second.

384
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,307
Okay. It's cool.
I'm gonna head down to the water.

385
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:28,103
It'll be just like our honeymoon.

386
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:31,539
Nobody will see what we're doing
except for the mermaids.

387
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:34,856
Baby, for the last time,
mermaids aren't real.

388
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,415
- I know what I saw, woman!
- Don't yell at me.

389
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,286
Hi. How is she doing?

390
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,516
You know what else you should do
when you told me when you love me?

391
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,527
Keep your hands away from her mouth.

392
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,486
Hey. D'you...

393
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:56,122
My god, she ate the rine.

394
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,482
Anyway, when you tell me,

395
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,071
make sure I'm wearing something
cute, like my new blue bikini,

396
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:02,890
- it really helps my like pop...
- Elliot, stop, okay?

397
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,194
You told me you loved me,
I told you I Ioved you back.

398
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,106
We both know how
we feel about each other,

399
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:09,871
that should be enough, right?

400
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,951
Stop acting so crazy.

401
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,304
<i>I know it's wrong
but with our relationship clicking,</i>

402
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:22,710
<i>I couldn't help but feel smug
watching everyone else's melt</i>

403
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,051
<i>in the hot Bahamian sun.</i>

404
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:29,194
Oh my god. Are you ever gonna
stop working and have some fun?

405
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:32,491
I knew darn well you were
full of crap when you said

406
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,969
you didn't care if I spent time
with you, but truth be told,

407
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:39,911
I finished all my work on the plane
before we got here,

408
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,292
I just wanted to prove a point.

409
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:50,202
Wind is really taking that baby.

410
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,480
Carla, where are you?

411
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,939
Hey, sweety.

412
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,863
It's okay, it's okay. Mommy's here.

413
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,468
<i>None of that drama for Elliot and me.</i>

414
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,539
<i>For us, it was smooth.</i>

415
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,675
Elliot, where are you going?

416
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,428
She's all mad.

417
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,634
Gary, I'm going to need
<i>two</i> Mamas, please.

418
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:20,070
Thank you, sir.

419
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:24,302
For what?

420
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:28,167
- Can I at least have your fruit?
- Get out!

421
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:33,113
Ted, you had one job.

422
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,454
Keep the people I invited from
actually coming to the weeding.

423
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:39,210
Did you tell them about the octopi
that drag them into trees

424
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,716
and suck their faces off?

425
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:44,350
I did, but they didn't believe me!

426
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:45,403
What?

427
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,495
This isn't a problem.

428
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:50,191
Did you remember to pack the giant
octopus suit I made for you?

429
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,450
Crap!

430
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:52,776
Teddy!

431
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,376
You're killing me!
