1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:02,377
<i>Things were the same around here.</i>

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:04,208
<i>Dr. Kelso was retired.</i>

3
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:05,566
No.

4
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:08,003
<i>But he had also won
free muffins for life</i>

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:10,378
<i>so he still came
to the hospital every day.</i>

6
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,491
- Good morning, people!
- Hi, Bob!

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,423
Hey, Anderson.

8
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:18,231
Before I retired, we never got
to have our heart-to-heart.

9
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,996
I'm not really
a touchy-feely type but...

10
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:24,793
Well, hell, I'll just say it.
You're a jackass.

11
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,475
<i>As usual, Turk and I
were working our asses off.</i>

12
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:32,714
Oh, man. You and Izzy are here.
Come on, to watch...

13
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:35,025
Oh, nice, it's already on.

14
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:36,026
<i>...Sesame Street!</i>

15
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:39,076
It's a good one.
The letter is J.

16
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,755
<i>And Dr. Cox was once again
torturing the new interns.</i>

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,179
Before we start rounds today,
who watches <i>Deal Or No Deal</i>?

18
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:48,293
Get out!

19
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,177
And you. Legally Blonde.

20
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:54,819
Name the three possible causes
of this patient's hematemesis.

21
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:59,303
Peptic ulcer disease,
oesophageal varices, or...

22
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,539
Zollinger Ellison syndrom?

23
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:04,651
- That's actually correct.
- Yes!

24
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:07,170
And if you're wondering
why I say "actually".

25
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,225
You've proven to be such
a vapid helpless incompetent,

26
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:14,357
that for you to say something correct
is a wild departure from the norm,

27
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,979
therefore I decided
I had better pick a word

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,299
that drew attention to the fact that
it was such an extraordinary occurence,

29
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,323
and I--
I went ahead and chose "actually".

30
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,419
- Zwah!
- Who made that noise?

31
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh. I did. I'm a little tired
of her chiper attitude.

32
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,739
So it was cool to see you just slam her.

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,259
So I just went "Zwah!".

34
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,277
So, if I were to ask
you a question like...

35
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:37,800
"What is the next diagnostic move
in checking for Zollinger Ellison?"

36
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:40,393
and you didn't know,
I would say "Zwah!".

37
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:44,281
Nope. Cause I know the answer.
Oesephago-gastro-duodenoscopy.

38
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:45,499
Zwah!

39
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:49,469
Good, but mark my words.
I will zwah you by the end of the day.

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,505
Now, since the rest
of your brains are so tiny,

41
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,457
from now on,
I will speak like a caveman.

42
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:57,169
You, bad doctors. Me, good doctor.
You, follow.

43
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:00,923
Hey, did you guys heard
they're starting to interview

44
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,051
for the new Chief of Medicine?

45
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,887
Actually, they already found someone.

46
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:08,631
That's right, knuckleheads.
There's a new chief in town!

47
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:11,382
That was a mistake.

48
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,935
I'll be watching you, John Dorian.

49
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:18,951
And guess what.
My eyes never close.

50
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,336
Mine neither.

51
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,837
Actually, they do. That was a lie.

52
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,169
I grew up on the street.

53
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,065
No, not the hood.
The Sesame Street.

54
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,176
Patient. Iron high.
Heart swollen big.

55
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,990
You. What make sick?

56
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,377
Hum, could it be hemochromatosis?

57
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,271
Correct. Rounds. Over.

58
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,187
You. Go.

59
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,173
Thoughts on the beard?

60
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,196
- I like it.
- Thank you, Perry.

61
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,948
Course, I'm totally in favor of

62
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:07,267
anything that covers up parts of your
face that were previously uncovered.

63
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:09,259
Yay! You hurt my feelings!

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,341
So? Which intern are
each of you guys gonna choose

65
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,907
this year to be your
personnal protégé/lackey?

66
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,091
I'm going with Katie,
because she's not a jerk anymore.

67
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,927
Plus, we got the same hair.

68
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:22,111
At first, I thought I was going
to mentor both Neil and Garett,

69
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:24,225
because they always
ask me to go roller blading.

70
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,757
Let it go, we don't have the time.

71
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,763
And then I thought,
why not pick a woman?

72
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,967
How about a little
feminine energy in my life?

73
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:34,133
You mean like the kind of energy that
seeps out of every pore in your body?

74
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,511
Elliot, why?

75
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:38,803
You knew that he was going to say that,
I thought that would hurt less coming from me.

76
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,223
Well then thank you.

77
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:41,599
Let's do this!

78
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,185
- Could you help me with something?
- You. Me. Help.

79
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:47,759
Of course, Dr. Dorian.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
All right, Denise.

81
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm going to kick your butt
with scut work for a while.

82
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,345
Still, I really want you
to be yourself around me.

83
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:55,769
Do you really mean that, sir?

84
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,949
<i>Sir!
Loving this girl's energy.</i>

85
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,383
I mean every word, young miss.

86
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:06,023
Well, buddy. You have no idea
how psyched I am to hear that.

87
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,621
I mean, I spent
four years in med school,

88
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,702
talking like this, so I wouldn't
dare threaten all the male teachers

89
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,367
who pee their pants every time
they're even near a strong woman.

90
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:17,712
Seriously, I am so happy
to be done with all that,

91
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,251
I could drop a doose right here.

92
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,667
Well, don't do that here, Denise.
Cause this is a hospital.

93
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,221
<i>What in god's name just happened?</i>

94
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,211
By the way,
how can you stand these scrubs?

95
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:31,275
Mine are so far up my butt right now,
I can taste them in my throat.

96
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,397
You don't have to be yourself
all the time, just some of the time.

97
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,665
It's Ed?

98
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,613
Sometimes, I go by Big Ed.

99
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:42,401
So, Ed. After you place
a central line one that patient,

100
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,327
come and find me, and let me know
whether or not you killed him.

101
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,569
Big Ed.

102
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,097
Dr. Cox, I just wanted to tell you
I really enjoyed rounds this morning.

103
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:53,633
And I'm going to work harder
so you don't just think of me as a...

104
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,939
- What was it?
- A helpless vapid incompetent ass-kisser.

105
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,631
Actually, I don't remember
the "ass-kisser" part.

106
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,475
That's cause I just added it now.

107
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,889
It's great.
Makes it hurt more.

108
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,345
Great.

109
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,145
Katie.

110
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,609
- You don't have to do that.
- I know.

111
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,648
It's disgusting.

112
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,820
You're just under so much pressure,
I've been there.

113
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:19,100
- Really?
- Oh my god, my first week here,

114
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,037
I totally screwed my best friend, JD,
just to look good in rounds.

115
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,143
Well, not literally screwed.

116
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:28,327
I mean. Yes, later, we did it. But that
was for totally different reasons.

117
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,571
And honestly,
there's been talk to death.

118
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,418
But, we are dating again.
Don't tell anyone.

119
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,818
Got it.

120
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:38,747
- Don't bother me, I'm busy.
- I can't make any promises.

121
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:41,451
Dr. Cox! Got those
test results for you, man.

122
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:44,177
You were totally right about
that old dude in bed four.

123
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,825
Sy-Sy-Sy-Syphilis!

124
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,007
I just-- I used to be a deejay.

125
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,153
Sy-Sy-Sy-Syphilis!

126
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,795
Syphilis, syphilis,
syphilis...

127
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:56,875
Get out of here, Ed.

128
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,717
- Right now?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,045
Come here.

130
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,733
Why do I hate that guy?

131
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,988
So, how long have you two been
dealing with the lung cancer?

132
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,526
Well. Jack's last cycle of chemo
was about a year ago.

133
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:17,373
And since then,
there's been no beta symptoms.

134
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:21,015
And his last chest scans
showed no new lesions, so...

135
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,695
Speaking of new things...

136
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,017
<i>Not the time to talk
about your beard.</i>

137
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,121
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
Lesions.

138
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:29,747
Anyway, we've just been
feeling so positive

139
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:32,229
that we haven't even told
our son about the cancer yet.

140
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,171
Mike is only eight.

141
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,545
Hopefully, this is just
a minor infection right now.

142
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,077
Okay, we're going
to run some tests.

143
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,562
He needs
a new chest scan right away.

144
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:43,021
And don't let those idiots
in radiology hold you up.

145
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:46,319
Dr. Dorian, if they pull any crap,
I'll bust some heads.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,879
<i>She really is like having my very own Jo
from Facts of Life.</i>

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,399
<i>Throw her a bone,
so she knows she's growing on you.</i>

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,423
Denise, call me JD.
Dr. Dorian is my father.

149
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,415
Actually, he's Mr. Dorian.

150
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,761
Well, was Mr. Dorian. He's dead, Jo.
He's never coming back.

151
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:04,205
You called me Jo?

152
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,005
You don't like that
as a new nickname?

153
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:09,369
Just a little butch.
I like banging dudes, so...

154
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,170
I've heard that's nice.

155
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,153
Seems like you'll be a host to
a variety of infectious bacteria...

156
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:18,613
- ...or even fungus.
- Plus, it's hard to look at.

157
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,869
I recommend it's removed immediately.

158
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,047
Forget it, you guys!

159
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:26,259
I'm keeping the beard.
Chicks dig on the extra fuzz.

160
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,443
Tell me about it.

161
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:30,025
And you've only got it on
two percent of your body.

162
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:33,853
Hey, what is up, guys?
Can somebody give me a high-four?

163
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,563
- Coming at you.
- No!

164
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,487
Four!

165
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:45,831
Grover five.

166
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:47,880
Come on buddy, let's go.

167
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,421
Hey, was that Dr. Turk?

168
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:51,982
Yeah, why?

169
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,813
Well, everyone's trying
to figure out who he is, because...

170
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:56,075
He's going to pick an intern

171
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:58,523
to do all the medical research
on a paper he's publishing.

172
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,117
So, did you put yourself up for that?

173
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,909
I'm not exactly
super confident right now.

174
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,943
Katie.

175
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:05,646
When I was an intern,

176
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:08,246
this oncologist asked me to assist him
with his research,

177
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,103
and I was too intimated.
And so I said no.

178
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:13,826
So, then he offers it
to this other girl, Gina.

179
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,455
And I really regretted it.

180
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:19,464
You know. At least until we found out
that he was actually watching Gina wiz

181
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,354
through a hole in his office wall.

182
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,894
But had he not been a perv,
it would still haunt me.

183
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,601
Which is why you're going
to go for this, okay?

184
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:28,791
Okay.

185
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:30,965
Bear claw!

186
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,763
So maybe you don't like him
because he freaky stoner weirdo.

187
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:40,142
No, surprisingly that tickles me.

188
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,213
- Did he say "Back in the day"?
- No.

189
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,180
- Did he say "Back in the dizz-ay"?
- No.

190
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,948
- Did he call you Dr. C?
- He did, but I liked it.

191
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,321
- Does he like Hugh Jackman?
- Wrong again. You suck at this.

192
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,806
Perhaps, the problem lies within.

193
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:55,895
By creating false hatred for others,

194
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,564
you don't have to face the fact
that you really hate yourself.

195
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:00,765
Where did you get that,
psychobabble?

196
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,413
From some skank at the mall.

197
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,759
I chill at the food court
on the weekend.

198
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,215
Donnie, I'm out.

199
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,975
Want one?
I got pull here.

200
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:12,069
Donnie!

201
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,310
Hey, what are you guys looking at?

202
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,921
Oh, my god!
Is it a picture of a poo?

203
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,971
No, that's not just any poo, Elliott.

204
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,336
That's Izzy's first poo in the potty.

205
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:27,426
I can't take my eyes off it.
It's gorgeous.

206
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,764
Oh, I accidently hit "Send".

207
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,041
They're back.

208
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:35,959
Jack's are bigger.

209
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,468
Just found my new screensaver.

210
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,739
They're back.

211
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,225
My bad.

212
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,167
Thank you.

213
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,039
Anyway, Turk. My intern Katie
could really use a boost.

214
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,637
Would you do me a favor and consider
her for the paper that you're doing?

215
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:54,788
Sure, no problem.

216
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,610
Oh! Thanks, man.
I owe you one.

217
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,352
My god, look at these.

218
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,932
The owner of those lungs
is going to die like... yesterday.

219
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,496
It's Mr Fremont, patient of mine.
His son's eight years old.

220
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,484
Sorry, buddy.

221
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,234
Got to go tell Denise.

222
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:13,622
<i>As a doctor, you can spend as much
time and energy on your interns</i>

223
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,297
<i>as you do on your patients.</i>

224
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,513
<i>Whether you're frustated by them...</i>

225
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,664
Well, I finished
my double hot chocolate,

226
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,533
and I'm going to head up.
Do you guys need anything else?

227
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,137
No, thank you.

228
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:25,335
All right.

229
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,927
No, it is not just me.
He is hateful.

230
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,797
<i>Or rooting for them.</i>

231
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,139
Okay, I want to thank
everyone who applied.

232
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,319
Unfortunately,
I can only pick one. So...

233
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,555
Ed, congratulations!

234
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:44,403
Oh, sorry, man. I'm listening to
<i>Da Vinci Code</i> on audio book.

235
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,261
It's-- it's riveting.

236
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,311
Damn it.

237
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:53,293
No way!

238
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,999
That was that guy?

239
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,168
<i>For me, I was just hoping to figure out
a way how to tell Denise</i>

240
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,877
<i>that the first patient we were
treating together was going to die.</i>

241
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,276
Listen, Jo.
Mr. Fremont's scan came back.

242
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:08,351
And, his lungs
are covered in lesions.

243
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,385
He doesn't have a lot a time.

244
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:14,017
<i>I was glad I was here because I knew
it would be hard for her to deal with.</i>

245
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,592
Huh. Sucks to be him.

246
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:18,590
<i>Or not.</i>

247
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,387
I think I see what the problem is.

248
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,359
You have a hand inside of you.

249
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,939
That explains so many things.

250
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:36,639
Dude, been having fantasies
about muppets all day too?

251
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,310
No, I'm straight.

252
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,759
That's just uncalled-for.
I'm freaked out.

253
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,673
I told my intern Jo our patient
was dying, she barely even reacted.

254
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,127
That sucks.

255
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:49,291
I cannot believe
that Turk didn't pick you.

256
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,650
Ooh, I'll just have
to withhold sex from him.

257
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,155
I mean, not me, personnally.
But I'm best friend with his wife,

258
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,066
and if I ask her to,
she will get him all worked up,

259
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:00,076
and then say "That was for Elliott."
And then just roll over and go to sleep.

260
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,513
I never really had a shot anyway.

261
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:05,536
I mean, surgery is such a boys club.

262
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:07,184
I don't know about that.

263
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,306
I-just-pulled-your-pants-down-five.

264
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:15,011
Maybe you're right.

265
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:17,780
No sex for Turk tonight.

266
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:18,979
Done.

267
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,322
- Back to this intern that I hate...
- No!

268
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:23,564
I don't want to play
"Why do I hate this intern?" game.

269
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,267
It's no fun, nobody ever wins.

270
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:28,526
Fine. I need to find somebody a little
more qualified to talk about hate anyway.

271
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,874
Look, you and I are alike
in a lot of ways.

272
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,353
We both harbor an internal stuggle
between the desire to do good,

273
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,218
and the urge
to become a master criminal.

274
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:39,000
- We don't
- We do.

275
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:42,190
You hate people,
and I hate people.

276
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,615
What nobody gets is that
we never hate indiscriminately.

277
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:48,445
That is so true.
I only hate those that have wronged me.

278
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:51,804
Like if they stole my stuff,
or put a penny in a door.

279
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:55,078
Or... that guy.

280
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,043
See this look he shot us,
like he's so much better than we are.

281
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,300
Plus, he's only 25, and earlier I heard
him use the phrase "Back in the day".

282
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:05,064
Well, he's dug his own grave,
hasn't he? Let's do this.

283
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,165
Go.

284
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,442
- He's even worse than the other guy.
- Go get him too.

285
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,446
All right, Denise. Here's the deal.

286
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:24,791
We have to tell Mrs. Fremont that
her husband doesn't have much longer.

287
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,184
She's going to want us to do
whatever we can to keep him alive.

288
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:29,728
But we both know that put him
on a respirator is just going to

289
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,508
prolong the inevitable and
eventually cause him more pain.

290
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:35,672
So, I'm going to tell her
the initial bad news.

291
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,824
And then, I want you to come in and
secure the "Do Not Resuscitate" order.

292
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,130
Okay, JD.

293
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,946
You're going to make her get the DNR?

294
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,572
An intern shouldn't have to convince
a wife to let her husband die.

295
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:50,376
She's got to learn
how to show some compassion.

296
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,181
I'm throwing her in
at the deep end.

297
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,330
There's got to be
a better way to teach that.

298
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:56,760
Elmo would love to help.

299
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,785
Denise, could you
come here for a second?

300
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,144
You be the patient,
and I'll be the doctor.

301
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:06,289
How's this?

302
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:10,086
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm going to take care of you.

303
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:13,299
Elmo knows that together,
we can get through this.

304
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,640
And... Scene.

305
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:17,348
I get it know.

306
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:20,192
Oh yeah!
She gets it, she gets it!

307
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,970
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby, yeah baby!

308
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,402
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

309
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,488
Okay, easy buddy.

310
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:27,689
What, she's your woman?

311
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,362
What is Elmo? A seal?

312
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:35,262
- Turk, I'm so mad at you.
- Yeah, I know.

313
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:38,204
Carla dragged me to the
on-call room, stripped butt naked,

314
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,873
did a little belly dance,
and then said "This is for Elliot".

315
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,405
Then took a nap!
What the hell did I did to you?

316
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,644
You're a sexist.

317
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,258
Keep moving, Rhonda!

318
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,880
You ain't moving fast enough, Rhonda!

319
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:53,129
Admit it. Katie never had a chance
with you because she's a girl.

320
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,716
- That's ridiculous.
- Really? Besides me...

321
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:58,104
Can you even name one other girl
that you're friends with?

322
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,333
Carla, and a lovely woman
by the name of Margaret.

323
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,446
Carla is your wife,
and Margaret's your mother!

324
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,910
Elliott, don't talk
about my momma!

325
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,770
Allright, I will
punch you in the head!

326
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,487
Turk, I was Katie once.

327
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,505
I mean, I know what it feels like

328
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,852
to get past over
because you're not one of the boys.

329
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,348
Okay, fine. I should
have given Katie a chance.

330
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,762
Guess what?

331
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,694
Ed's going to let me take his spot.

332
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,268
I didn't want to do it anyway.

333
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,674
The only reason I signed up was
I have this three-way pen,

334
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,970
and I wanted to write my name
in three different colors.

335
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,246
Dude, that's why I picked you.

336
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,916
- Looks cool, right?
- It looks so cool.

337
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,076
So Katie gets to do it?

338
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:35,232
Fine!

339
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,752
Blow it up, girl!

340
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,358
That's it.

341
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,048
I know why I hate him.

342
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,268
Way to go.
Want to borrow my plunger?

343
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,338
Form a perfect seal
around his mouth, and then...

344
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,928
Three times, and...
His Adam's apple pops right out.

345
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:54,612
Theoretically.

346
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,150
Mrs. Fremont.

347
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,500
Your husband doesn't
have a minor infection.

348
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,162
It's the cancer.

349
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:10,114
His body is basically shutting down.

350
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:13,354
He's dying?

351
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,042
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:20,428
No. No, he's been
doing so well. No.

353
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:23,874
It's not time yet. There must
be something that you can do.

354
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,246
Well, we can make him confortable.

355
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,870
But, by the end of the night,
he won't be able to breath on his own.

356
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,538
So, you'll put him on a machine.

357
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,972
I'm not sure you want to do that.

358
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,150
Why?
Why wouldn't I want to do that?

359
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,572
Why wouldn't I want to do
anything I can to keep him alive?

360
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,050
<i>This was going to be rough on Denise,</i>

361
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,587
<i>but I knew it was something
she had to get through</i>

362
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,590
<i>to become
a more compassionate doctor.</i>

363
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:50,296
Look.

364
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,129
Here's the deal.

365
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,740
If you make us intubate him,

366
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,251
we're probably also going to have
to shove a catheter in his lungs.

367
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:59,452
And that sort of thing usually leads
to an infection, and antibiotics,

368
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:02,671
and then, before you know it,
his kidneys are toast.

369
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:05,914
So, even with all our
poking and proding,

370
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,518
we're still not going to
slow down his cancer.

371
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:10,506
So, you'll finally sign the DNR.

372
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,140
But, by then, he would have suffer
way more than he needed to, because...

373
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,650
You were just
too selfish to let him go.

374
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,094
The real Jo never
would have done that.

375
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,844
- Hey, skank!
- What up, skank?

376
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,926
It's all good, skank!

377
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,746
We like to call each other "skank".

378
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,308
Okay, I know
I was a little bit sexist earlier.

379
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,824
But, don't you also think

380
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,410
Katie might have been playing you
a little so she could get ahead?

381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,154
Turk, she wasn't even going to sign up

382
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,512
to help you with your
stupid paper until I told her to.

383
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,692
That's funny, because
I went back and checked.

384
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:48,962
And Katie was the
first intern to sign the sheet.

385
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:51,426
See. It's her name right there.

386
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:52,974
Above Ed's.

387
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:55,914
Skank!

388
00:17:58,058 --> 00:17:59,382
Time to go.

389
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,110
Donnie, I need a way-homer.

390
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,798
See you tomorrow, everybody.

391
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,246
Goodbye Bob!

392
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,394
Syphilis!

393
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:14,030
You zwah'd the hell out of me,
Dr. Cox. It's like you promised.

394
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:17,684
See, I've seen a lot of
crazy things in my life.

395
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:20,860
But trust me, I've never seen
an intern with the time to just

396
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:25,166
hang out in a coffee shop. And it wasn't
until you gave up that research paper,

397
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:28,290
that I finally realized why I hate you.

398
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,132
You're lazy.

399
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,596
Am I not doing
as well as the other interns?

400
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:35,292
You are doing better than most.

401
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:37,586
I don't know, I'm fine with
better than most.

402
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,566
But if that's not being the case,
let me know.

403
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,848
Believe me, I will.

404
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:43,658
Thanks, Dr. C.

405
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,416
I always knew this day would come.

406
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:59,217
How can I still not be ready?

407
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,421
Nobody ever is.

408
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:05,247
What should I do know?

409
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,091
You should go pick up your son.

410
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,530
We'll do our best to wake him up
so you two can say goodbye.

411
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:22,495
<i>And then I realized why I'd thought
about </i>Sesame Street<i> all day.</i>

412
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,794
<i>In a way, you can learn everything you
need to know from watching it as a kid.</i>

413
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,627
<i>Like, always play nice.</i>

414
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,449
Oh please. I've got Dr. Reid
wrapped around my finger.

415
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,241
I'm going to be fine around here.

416
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,021
<i>Always try your hardest.</i>

417
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:42,845
Hey, do you go to the
hematology lecture tonight?

418
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,818
No, can't do, other Indian guy.
'Bout to go get me some pizza!

419
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,206
<i>And even...</i>

420
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,421
<i>It's okay to cry.</i>

421
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,789
Yeah, you were right.
He didn't last long at all.

422
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,963
Didn't expect the waterworks.

423
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,236
See you tomorrow.

424
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:19,603
It's going to be a long year.

425
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,768
By then, he would have suffer
way more than he needed to, because...

426
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,051
You were just
too selfish to let him go.

427
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,071
I'll let you think about it.

428
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:42,587
The real Jo never
would have done that.

429
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:45,576
What she was tring to say is...

430
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,738
You take the good, you take the bad,
and when you take them both,

431
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,199
There you have the facts of life.
