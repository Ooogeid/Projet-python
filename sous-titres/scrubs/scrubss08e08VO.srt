00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:07,201
Ted, what are you doing?

2
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,658
Band practice.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,149
What band?

4
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:11,548
Peons assemble!

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,461
They have to stay within earshot,
it's in the band code.

6
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:18,014
Wow, Ted,
it's kind of like you're their leader.

7
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:19,232
Peons disperse!

8
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,589
Peons assemble!

9
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,316
Enough of the horse play!

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,936
Now we need to practice,
and I can't have you winded.

11
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,909
Now we've only got one shot
to convince Dr. Cox

12
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,431
to let us sing for the sick kids
in pediatrics.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,790
One, two.

# Seasons don't fear the Reaper,

Oh boy, good luck with that.

the upside of death,</i>

20
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,681
<i>it was perfect for my walk
to Dr. Cox's office.</i>

21
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,852
<i>Yep, it was terrifying
going up against the new chief.</i>

22
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:01,335
Perry, for the last time, we need
more negative pressure rooms

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,766
in the infectious diseases ward.

24
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,644
Huh, I didn't hear you knock.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,088
The door was open.

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,282
Then go outside,
close the door, and knock.

27
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:11,901
No, you're just going to lock it.

28
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:12,872
No, I won't.

29
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,722
You know I've been burned before.

00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:15,760
Believe in me.

31
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,100
- New chapter?
- New chapter.

32
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,785
New chapter!

33
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:25,163

00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,681
<i>We still need those rooms.</i>

00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,908
And you sir, are a liar.

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,857
There is no money in the budget.

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,556
And while you're delivering
bad news, please tell Ted

38
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,716
that he can't <i>sing in pediatrics.</i>

39
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:38,557
A cappella music is,
how to put this delicately...

40
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:40,377
ear rape.

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,845
Guys, guys, guys!

42
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:45,225
He said no.

43
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,540
Oh man!

44
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,708
Well maybe, he'll let us sing
for the people in the burn ward.

45
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,809
No, I asked.

46
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:53,060
He said they're already
in enough pain.

47
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,979
Besides, Teddy, hospital already
has someone who sings to the kids.

48
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,879
Who?

49
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:01,225
# One day
# The moon got tired of being

50
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,729
# Up in the sky

51
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,311
# He wandered
# Down through the starlight

52
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:08,531
# And landed on the ocean side
# <i>And he smiled while...</i>

53
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:10,189
That's a cute song.

54
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:11,808
It's not cute.

55
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,565
It's beautiful.

56
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,625

# And guess what

Good news, Cox just added
two new negative pressure rooms.

59
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,521
Great job wearing him down.

60
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:25,821
<i>But still, with Dr. Cox,
winning has ramifications.</i>

61
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:29,464
Janice, you have one ugly baby.
Seriously.

62
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,410
Did you actually teach your son
to be mean to a baby?

63
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:35,818
Not just any baby,
but your baby.

64
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,045

00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,471
We're going to get
10,000 jelly beans.

66
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:41,518
I love you so much.

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,727
They can both be so hurtful.

You got to pick Jack up
from preschool today.

71
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,246
Why can't you do it?

72
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,290
Hello, I'll be busy taking care
of our daughter.

73
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,003
Jennifer is with the nanny.

74
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:09,537
Okay, fine.

75
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:10,809
Jack's school gets out at 2:00

76
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,859
and you know I take a nap
everyday from 11:30 to 3:00.

77
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,960
Are you enjoying your life?

78
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,157
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
And yours?

79
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,653
It's different.

80
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,866
Got your latte, champ.

81
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:26,602
Well now, thank you.

82
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,144
Boy oh boy, you're really digging

83
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,427
the heck out of this whole secret
friendship thing, aren't you?

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,652
Well, it has all
the thrill of an affair,

85
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:34,613
without all that exhausting sex.

86
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,450
Do you realize that I have
to do rounds,

87
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:39,474
see patients,
pick up my son Jack,

88
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,135
and somehow put a dent in all
this bureaucratic ridiculousness?

89
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:43,464
You're the Chief of Medicine,

90
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:46,627
you can't keep doing
all the things you used to do.

91
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,017
You have to let something go.

92
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,814
Just don't drop the ball
with your son.

93
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:52,698
That's what I did with Harrison.

94
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,179
He and his new life partner Caleb
have just opened a boutique 

95
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,667
on Fire Island called
"Everything Mesh".

96
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,335
You like mesh Perry?

97
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:01,379
No, Bob, I don't.

98
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:04,463
Well, I didn't either at first.
But the boxers really breathe.

99
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:06,943
I can do it all.

100
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,178
Craig,

101
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:11,418
I thought I told you I never wanted
to see you in here again.

102
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,729
I'm sick.

103
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,583
I am now officially on the case.

104
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,283
Can I talk to you
in the hall for one second?

105
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:18,558
Sure.

106
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:22,490
Look, I know you and Craig
have a history,

107
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,031
but I'm sure you're swamped.

108
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,522
I don't mind taking this one.

109
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:28,582
No no, Craig was my patient before,
so he'll be my patient now.

110
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:29,750
Plus, if you don't treat him,

111
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:32,285
then he gets to get home
not smelling like cocoa butter.

112
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,400
Mock away, but do you
think it's an accident

113
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,570
that I have the complexion
of a 12-year-old Greek boy?

114
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,714
Don't get me wrong,
I still want you to be

115
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,165
a big part of Craig's treatment team.

116
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:42,510
Say hum, Craig?

117
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:45,849
Is there anything you want
Dr. Puberty Beard to go get for you?

118
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,090
A root beer, please.

119
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,090
Nice to have you on board.

120
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,019
You took the last two root beers.

121
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:57,205
- Give me one.
- No.

122
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,743
This one is for a patient,
and this one...

123
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:02,604
is for me.

124
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,356
The old "Lick the can,
so no one will want it" trick.

125
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:06,712
Too bad I beat you to it.

126
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,233
Licked by Janitor.

127
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,299
You'll find the same note
on your cell phone.

128
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,200
Have you ever seen
such an angel?

129
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,609
Okay Teddy.

130
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:20,776
It's time to throw
down your power rap.

131
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,194
Wow, look at Ted go!

132
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:27,571
Can I help you?

133
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:28,870
No you cannot!

134
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:36,318
Yeah. Every time Ted
chickens out with a girl,

135
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,216
he goes straight to his bike
and pedals home.

136
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,517
Cherish the pain, Ted.

137
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,915
It means you’re still alive.

138
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:46,918
I wish I could help
that bald sweaty bastard.

139
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,457
Maybe you and I could team up.

140
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,687
I bet you think I'm going to say no.

141
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,048
But let me tell you
something about the Dorians.

142
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:55,547
We trust. And we trust hard.

143
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:59,856
It's the reason why every single
Dorian has a loyal army of friends.

144
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:02,929
It's also why last weekend
I flew to the Ozarks

145
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:06,176
for a spontaneous water ski
getaway with Dr. Cox.

146
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,055
He was not there.

147
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,370
Nor was his lakeside cabin.

148
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,306
There had also been
talk of a tire swing.

149
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,755
- In or out?
- In.

150
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:16,385
- For Ted.
- For Ted.

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,068
Yo, chief.

152
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:23,199
For some reason, there are 3 different
shift schedules floating around.

153
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,450
If you don't put out a new one,
you're going to get

154
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,469
every nurse showing up
at the same time.

155
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,296
I'm on it.

156
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,118
Okay. Last patient.

157
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,022
A pre-excitation of the ventricle

158
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,176
due to accessory pathway's
a condition called what?

159
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:38,609
It's Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Nice job.

160
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,661
I'm out of time, so...

161
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm going to go ahead and answer
these last questions myself.

162
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:43,971
Now what is...?

163
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:45,807
Let me finish.

164
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,903
What is Ebstein's anomaly?

165
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:50,644
Great job, group.
I appreciate the effort.

166
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:51,755
Now leave.

167
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,112
Not you.

168
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,215
You didn't raise your hand,
not even once.

169
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:56,537
I wasn't feeling it.

170
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,170
Well, it's perfectly
understandable, but...

171
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,894
for the record,
what is Ebstein's anomaly?

172
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:03,110
Yes, dark haired guy.

173
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,343
Oh, I thought it was just
the hand-rising part.

174
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,347
Okay, I know I was supposed
to read up on that.

175
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:10,559
But Dr. Cox, are you familiar

176
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,868
with those electronic trivia games
they have at bars?

177
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,333
Sure.

178
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,873
My buddies and I bought one
at a police auction,

179
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,254
and we've got this
really intense game going.

180
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,673
And they're going to call me
whenever my team's turn comes up.

181
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,320
Your laziness has finally
caught up with you.

182
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,979
But, no worries.
As your teacher,

183
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,298
I'm going to make sure
you get through all this because...

184
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,515
The next two days, you're going
to sit your ass in that chair,

185
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:38,033
and you are going to learn everything
there is to know about the human heart.

186
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,383
I'm going to come around, every once
in a while, and ask you questions,

187
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,101
and if you don't know the answer,
I'm going to take that textbook,

188
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,347
and I'm going to drive it through
your skull. How does that sound?

189
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,166
- Pretty frightening.
- Good luck.

190
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,008
Look, Ted. You're obviously upset
about the ukulele girl.

191
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,937
So, we've called a truce
to help you out.

192
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:56,820
I'm not upset.

193
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,755
Ted, we found you in a park,
throwing rocks at old couples.

194
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,573
Why should they be happy?

195
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,187
Come on, man!
You can get this girl.

196
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,164
No, no, no,
you don't understand!

197
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:10,177
If I even think about
a girl that hot,

198
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,664
I get the most unbelievable
dry mouth.

199
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,313
I mean, just picturing
her beautiful eyes and her cute sm--

200
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,675
What is that?

201
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,861
It's Jum and tonic.

202
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,081
Gin, rum and tonic.

203
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,303
Don't get him drunk.
He can barely talk as it is.

204
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,164
You don't get drunk on Jum.

205
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,096
It's a breakfast liqueur.

206
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,441
And you know what?

207
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,928
I don't like you telling me
what to do.

208
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:39,923
Truce off.

209
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,317
Truce on.

210
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,227
That was a patient's lab results.

211
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:45,677
And you cannot turn the truce off
whenever you want to.

212
00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:47,495
- Sure you can.
- Fine, truce off.

213
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,120
No. Truce on!
Truce on! Truce on!

214
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:52,430
It's my latte.
And it's scolding hot.

215
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,152
Yeah it is.

216
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,079
Ted, do you want to get this girl?

217
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:59,401
Give her a present. Better yet,
a present that you made.

218
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:02,066
My first date with Lady,
I made her a duck I killed.

219
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,578
Now, you're thinking wouldn't it
have been more romantic

220
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:05,610
to kill it in front of her?

221
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,297
And yes, it would have.
And it was my plan.

222
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:08,925
But in the car, on the way over,

223
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,554
we kind of get into it, you know.

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,452
Maybe I was in a bad mood,
maybe he was, I don't know.

225
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:17,442
But one thing led to another, and then
we're off in the side of the road,

226
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,672
shirtless and...
seeing what's what.

227
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,262
Next thing I knew...

228
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,019
I'm really not comfortable
murdering for her.

229
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,761
Fine. The important thing
is to be confident.

230
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,400
When you talk to her,
you think about something, anything,

231
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,138
that puts you at a confident place.

232
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:38,610
The important thing is to be honest.
Just tell her how you really feel.

233
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,929
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

234
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,132
Yep, those are Jum legs.

235
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:47,841
All right, Craig.

236
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,277
Your CAT scan showed
large lymph nodes,

237
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:51,610
so you got to do a biopsy,

238
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,639
which means we're going to
make a little cut under your arm,

239
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,856
and take a tiny sample.

240
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,361
It's going to hurt?

241
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:58,168
A little bit, but...

242
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,980
it's okay cause I'm going to be
by your side the whole way.

243
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,058
You promise?

244
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,265
Yeah, I promise.

245
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,924
I got one thousand things
I got to attend to here,

246
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,344
I'll check in with you later.

247
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,729
Dr. Cox?

248
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,640
Yeah.

249
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:13,906
I'm scared.

250
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,439
Why don't you tell me
what's scaring you,

251
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:20,008
and we'll see what I can do
to make it better.

252
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:23,205
Okay, Ted.

253
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:26,203
I think we found a way to get you
over your fear of talking to this girl.

254
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:28,595
Kill me?
Cause I'd be willing to try that.

255
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,002
No, Ted. You remember
when you were a kid

256
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:31,855
and your father threw you
in the deep end of the pool

257
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:32,956
to teach you how to swim?

258
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,158
Swim, Ted!

259
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,433
Hey.

260
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,938
Is our friend in there?

261
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:48,660
He's in the corner.

262
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,740
You just spooked him a little bit.
But if we're quiet,

263
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,382
he'll come out on his own.

264
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,444
Hey, guys.

265
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,970
Did you have something
you wanted to talk to me about?

266
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,601
<i>And then Ted remembered what
the janitor had said about confidence.</i>

267
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:19,264
<i>And he knew that there was only
one situation where he actually had it.</i>

268
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,712
Peons assemble!

269
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,563
I heard you playing yesterday

270
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,731
and thought you might
like to jam with us.

271
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,826
I'm Teddy Buckland by the way.

272
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,713
I'm Stephanie Gooch.

273
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:31,977
Well, Gooch.

274
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,257
See if you can keep up.

275
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:38,563
# Carry on my wayward son

276
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,189
# There'll be peace when you are done

277
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,521
# Lay your weary head to rest

278
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:49,353
# Don't you cry no more

279
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,129
# Once I rose above
the noise and confusion...

280
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:56,952
<i>As I watched Ted, I realized that
a little confidence is a good thing.</i>

281
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,286
<i>But, as I saw Dr. Cox rush by,</i>

282
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:03,138
<i>it occurred to me that too much
can get you into trouble.</i>

283
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:06,204
<i>Because if you go around
plugging leaks all day,</i>

284
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,009
Brian, the machine is broken.

285
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,857
There's no way there was
a president named Garfield.

286
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:13,641
Study, or get a book to the face.

287
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,705
<i>you're bound to miss one.</i>

288
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,569
Hey, if you're wondering,
this is what it looks like

289
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,388
when all the nurses show up at once.

290
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:21,890
I'll deal with it in a second.

291
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:25,442
<i>And before you know it,
the flood gates open.</i>

292
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,609
Where the hell is Craig?

293
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,817
Seventeen nurses took him down
for his biopsy at two o'clock.

294
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:32,549
It's past two already?

295
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,513
<i>Then something big
falls through the cracks.</i>

296
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,953
I will pick up Jack
after preschool today.

297
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,969
My massage is right by there.

298
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,817
I'm doing it. End of story.

299
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:46,416
Go away!
You're not my doctor anymore.

300
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,589
Puberty Beard is.

301
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,898
You know, Craig, i was kind of hoping
that nickname wouldn't stick.

302
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,352
Craig, I'm sorry. I just
got a little held up out there.

303
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,277
I know it's not the thickest beard.
It's not like, you know, Santa Claus.

304
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,697
You broke a promise.

305
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,401
Well, have it your way.

306
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:06,361
Just, real quick back to the beard,
you-- you want to touch it?

307
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,750
I really don't.

308
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,681
There is the stud muffin.
How'd it go with Gooch?

309
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,445
We jammed all night.

310
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:19,373
The two of us even sang one of
her songs which made me think

311
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:21,869
I might have a chance with her.

312
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,291
# I've got

313
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:32,165
# Too many questions in my mind

314
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,669
# I've got

315
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,388
# Too many answers to find

316
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:39,852
# Can I

317
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,649
# Give up all I've imagined?

318
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,534
# Am I

319
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,726
# magical enough for this to happen?

320
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,565
- # Because I like you
- # I like you

321
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,410
- # I like you
- # I like you

322
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,624
# And like can lead to like-like

323
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,082
# And like-like can lead to love

324
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,876
# Sure as the stars above,

325
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,940
- # I'd really like to kiss you
- # I'd really like to screw you

326
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:07,707
When we're singing, and the
band's around, everything's fine.

327
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,855
But as soon as we're alone,
I literally can't breathe.

328
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,777
Ted, you're never going to get
close to this woman 

329
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:14,968
until you dig down deep,

330
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,575
and find the courage
to tell her how you really feel.

331
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:19,266
Yeah.

332
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,221
What do you got?

333
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:22,125
For the rest of your life,

334
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,765
100 percent of your communications
with this woman should be in song.

335
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,140
Loving it!

336
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,498
So how is your day going today,
any better?

337
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:31,452
I'm okay.

338
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:34,417
Oh, give it up.
Everybody knows you two are friends.

339
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,815
Oh, please, Carla.
I still hate Bobbo with a--

340
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,520
We're like brothers.

341
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,789
- I'm done hiding this, Perry.
- My head hurt.

342
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:47,022
Well, you wouldn't be so stressed out
if you let people help you.

343
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,065
Let me do the nurses schedule.

344
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,887
No.

345
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:53,021
You don't understand, Carla.
He has to control everything.

346
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:54,384
Good, you're here.

347
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,781
I'm surprised he doesn't try
to control the words I say.

348
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,251
I can control the words you say.
Say something annoying.

349
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,523
- I just--
- Ta-dah!

350
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,316
Look, I've said this before.

351
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:07,158
You cannot be Chief of Medicine
without giving something up.

352
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:11,004
I mean, why on earth
is he still teaching interns?

353
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,966
Because he loves teaching. He needs
to give up some of those patients.

354
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,664
What he needs to do is give up
some of the bureaucratic stuff.

355
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,410
Would you all be quiet for one second?

356
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:21,803
Hey Dorian.

357
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,484
Perry and I are like brothers now.

358
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,126
Bob, he's not going
to take that well.

359
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,961
I do everything for you
and you still won't let me in?

360
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,794
You now what, thank you, Perry.
Thank you for giving me my life back.

361
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:35,868
Because I am done.

362
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:39,074
- JD, he needs our help.
- I'm back in. I'm here for you buddy.

363
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:43,924
I don't need your help,
I am in control of everything.

364
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:48,468
Hello?

365
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,965
Daddy, you weren't here
to pick me up.

366
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,768
So I got scared and tried to find you.

367
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,280
- Jack?
- Daddy?

368
00:15:59,256 --> 00:15:59,909
Hey, Perr'.

369
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm alive!

370
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:09,816
You know. Last weekend, Perry and I
went to the movies together.

371
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,069
So?

372
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,192
Thought you'd be interested.

373
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:15,752
- Was it a romantic comedy?
- Yeah.

374
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,433
Maybe they're all right.

375
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:27,075
I have to give something up.

376
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,689
Sweety, I got to talk
to your dad for a second.

377
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,107
Go over there and staple some stuff.

378
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,375
Cool!

379
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,710
Perry, they don't know you like I do.

380
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:41,950
You're not capable of giving up on
anything that you care about.

381
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:46,034
Whether it's a patient, or your
never ending quest to please me.

382
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,948
I'm going to blow you away tonight.

383
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,185
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
My point is,

384
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,527
is that eventually
you balance things out.

385
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:55,918
Who cares if you can't pick
Jack up from preschool?

386
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:59,249
Just make sure that you're home
in time for his bedtime stories.

387
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:00,420
Thank you.

388
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:02,317
Hey guys!

389
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:05,111
I finally got a brother!

390
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:07,980
Kid's either a genius or an idiot.

391
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:13,214
Hey Ted, would you like
to get a cup of coffee some time?

392
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:14,823
Peons!

393
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:20,001
I was just thinking that maybe,
it could be the two of us.

394
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,365
I thought maybe we could
get to know each other.

395
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,698
You know, I'm an idiot.

396
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,892
I've been dropping all these
subtle hints that I like you.

397
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:48,048
Sideways glances, the secret smiles,
telling you I want to screw you.

398
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,888
You're clearly not interested.

399
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:52,749
Gooch!

400
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm really not what
you would call a winner.

401
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,431
Oh sure, I'm a lawyer,

402
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,350
but that's only because
I took the Bar exam in Alaska,

403
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,852
and they only have like four laws

404
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,451
and most of them are about
when you can and cannot kill...

405
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,274
seals.

406
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,954
And if it seems like
I'm uninterested,

407
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:22,192
it's only because
I've no idea why you would like me.

408
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:28,013
I mean, you are the
most beautiful, perfect...

409
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,021
ukulele player I've ever seen.

410
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:36,641
And no that's not saying much,
because they're usually fat Hawaiians.

411
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:41,559
Still, I think what
I'm trying to say is...

412
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:47,853
Stephanie, I would love
to go and have coffee with you.

413
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,004
What time do you get off from work?

414
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,732
Who cares?

415
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,717
I guess you were right
about the whole honesty thing.

416
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,204
Well, he never would have gotten
to that point

417
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,957
if you hadn't told him
to be confident.

418
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,214
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.

419
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,854
Why is your hand wet?

420
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:10,919
<i>Licked by Janitor.</i>

421
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:12,936
I guess the truce is off.

422
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,128
I'd like to think
it was never really on.

423
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,801
I told you to leave me alone.

424
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:27,997
Yeah you did.

425
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,361
But I can't do that Craig.

426
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,588
I screwed up,
I broke a promise to you.

427
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,332
But I'm sorry.

428
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,709
I'm standing here
asking you to forgive me.

429
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,760
And I'm not leaving until you do.

430
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:45,119
Make him go away.

431
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,255
I can't, buddy.
I have a lot of patients to see.

432
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,840
You're stuck with him.

433
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,599
<i>As I watched Dr. Cox,
I realized, he was going to do it all.</i>

434
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,173
<i>Even if it meant
compromising a little.</i>

435
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:00,894
<i>Like letting a close friend
cross the T's and dot the I's</i>

436
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,824
Here is the first pass
of the nurses schedule.

437
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:05,439
Please feel free to make any changes
you want and put it out.

438
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:06,774
No problem.

439
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:10,828
<i>Or deciding not to bother teaching
someone who doesn't want to be taught.</i>

440
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:11,990
Time's up.

441
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:15,190
You patient has a sodium channel
abnormality in the cardiac tissue

442
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:17,610
which puts him at risk of
sudden death, what does he have?

443
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,514
Actually, I didn't get
to that chapter yet.

444
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,606
There was this trivia thing,
did you know

445
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:26,474
- James Garfield was our twenti--
- It's been two days. You're fired.

446
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>Still, it's all worth it
if you get home in time</i>

447
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:33,706
<i>to read stories to your son.</i>

448
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,631
It's okay.
You'll try again tomorrow.

449
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,870
Come.

450
00:20:56,997 --> 00:21:00,602
Aren't we gonna, you know...
have intercourse?

451
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:04,862
I would, but this isn't my fantasy.
It's that guy's.

452
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,952
He doesn't want to imagine me
doing that with anyone.

453
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,984
Oh what the hell.
Let's get free.

454
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:16,468
Oh, Ted. No, no!

455
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:19,807
What is that?
Is that your butt?

456
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:23,165
It is?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
