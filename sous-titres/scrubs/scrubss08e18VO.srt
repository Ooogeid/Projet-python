1
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:04,977
<i>I can't believe
today is my last day</i>

2
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:05,877
<i>at Sacred Heart.</i>

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,575
<i>I couldn't help
but let my mind drift back

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,807
<i>to my very
first day.</i>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,862
Don't look at me
when we are moving someone.

6
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:12,412
Why?

7
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,156
<i>And from now on,</i>

8
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,737
whenever I am
in the room,

9
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,431
you're definitely
not allowed to talk.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,699
Charge!

11
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,612
Doctor Dorian...

12
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:31,688
Do you <i>not</i> realize
that you're nothing

13
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:34,705
but a large pair of scrubs
to me?

14
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,540
Sticked a penny
in there?

15
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:37,702
No, I was just making
small talk...

16
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:41,360
If I'll find a penny in there,
I'm taking you down.

17
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,202
I thought we cared
about each other?

18
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,190
Oh please, if you don't want
to sleep with me,

19
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:47,037
you'd do
the same thing.

20
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,096
I'd tell you one thing,
the last thing in the world

21
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,425
I want to do
is sleep with you now!

22
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:52,702
Do me right here...

23
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:54,172
Okay.

24
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:54,502
See?

25
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,719
<i>I won in the end though,
because now she loves me</i>

26
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,810
<i>and I get to have her
whenever I see fit.</i>

27
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,641
<i>In fact, I think
I'll use this last day thing</i>

28
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:06,337
<i>to score
some morning sex...</i>

29
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:08,816
I can't believe
today's my last day...

30
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,733
No morning sex.

31
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:10,561
Worth a try.

32
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:14,928
We can kiss if you remember
to lay out mouth wash last night.

33
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:15,851
I did.

34
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,882
Did you water it down
so we can just swallow it?

35
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:19,830
Of course,
I did!

36
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,559
<i>Actually, I did not remembered
to water it down.</i>

37
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:23,351
<i>At all.</i>

38
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,604
- Morning.
- You weirdo.

39
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,632
You'd love it.
How'd you sleep?

40
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,024
Really well
actually...

41
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,469
I know that
you wanna know why.

42
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:36,620
This is my bed!

43
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:38,328
I had it brought here
because it's so comfortable!

44
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,310
You don't have a bed
at your house anymore?

45
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:42,638
Why bother, I've slept here
like every night since you moved.

46
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:44,935
So...
We live together?

47
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,846
Kinda.
I guess.

48
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,453
I feel like
I should've been told.

49
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:50,678
Come on.

50
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:51,908
<i>I see it now.</i>

51
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,089
You've been sneak-moving
in here for days!

52
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,857
<i>The clothes
in the dresser,</i>

53
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:59,295
those girly pillows
on the couch,

54
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,797
this weird picture
of Vegas Showgirl...

55
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,661
Don't make fun
of my brother Berry.

56
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,354
And he looks
very beautiful.

57
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,572
They did a dynamite job
on his boobs.

58
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:09,786
Are those G's?

59
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:10,803
Double D's.

60
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,308
Plus you are the guy
who keeps asking me

61
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:13,593
to bring stuff
over here.

62
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,432
Are you seriously upset?

63
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,287
I am very upset,

64
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,469
I don't even think
morning sex could fix it.

65
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,306
Although,
it might.

66
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:22,106
Fine!

67
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:24,920
Do we have
to move a lot?

68
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,307
We never do
anyway.

69
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,206
True.

70
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,800
Aw, man...

71
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,786
He got
my coffee wrong.

72
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:38,988
How?

73
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,188
It's dirt.

74
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,718
That may be
because I told Donnie

75
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,825
you thought
his coffee tasted like dirt.

76
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,127
Why would you
do that?

77
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,841
Because Donnie is
a vengeful, little punk,

78
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,396
and I wondered to see
what he would do.

79
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:52,519
He's a convicted felony.
Shift the guy!

80
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,624
Aah, I love you Donnie.
Muffin, please!

81
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,897
I still can't believe
you're going back to work.

82
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,242
I miss doctoring.

83
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,657
Any great thing
about locum tenens

84
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,842
is it's part time

85
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:04,342
and you have to go
where they need you,

86
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,300
so it's gonna force
Enid and me to travel.

87
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,777
Finally, you are gonna stop
hanging around here?

88
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,291
<i>Yep.</i>

89
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:11,548
This is my last muffin
in this place.

90
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:14,165
Finally, you're gonna stop
hanging around here?

91
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,388
<i>Uhh, look...</i>

92
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:16,806
He's stuck
on a thought.

93
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,397
If he doesn't get off
within a few minutes,

94
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,332
just kick him,
that's what I always do.

95
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,337
Okay...

96
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,929
I have enjoyed this
stupid coffee spot so much.

97
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,381
I need a momento.

98
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,794
Would you distract the staff
while I steal my favourite table?

99
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,175
I don't think so,
Bob.

100
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,739
Understood,
it's not your fight.

101
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,725
Finally, you're gonna stop
hanging around--

102
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,221
Finally,
you're gonna stop--

103
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:40,485
Finally,
you're gonna--

104
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,266
Oh!
Thank you.

105
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,273
No problem.

106
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:48,698
I wouldn't do that.

107
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:52,021
It's a good dirt.

108
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,955
So I actually did
drift off a bit.

109
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,553
How was
the morning sex?

110
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:03,313
I was
awesome!

111
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,198
Really?

112
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,958
Nah, I never really got
things going,

113
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,304
my peep is sleepy.

114
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:08,732
Hey.

115
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:11,183
JD, I know that
it's your last day,

116
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,988
but I'm not gonna say,
"Goodbye"

117
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:15,311
because even if just
saying the word

118
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,957
this ain't gonna go,
it's gonna make me cry.

119
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,610
Okay, okay, take deep breaths,
deep breaths...

120
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,431
I can't catch
my breath,

121
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:22,794
I can't catch it,
I can't catch it.

122
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,636
Where is it?
Where is it?

123
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,737
Breathe it out,
breathe it out.

124
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:30,493
Okay,
I'm back.

125
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:33,315
Plus, I'm just gonna see you
at our place tonight, okay?

126
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:37,563
Did you just said "our place"?
You <i>are</i> sneak-moving in!

127
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:38,873
Your ears
are playing tricks.

128
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,584
And JD,
people should make a big deal

129
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:41,764
about you leaving
Sacred Heart,

130
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,184
but...
don't get disappointed

131
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:44,643
if it doesn't live up
to expectations

132
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:45,806
you have
in your head, okay?

133
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,926
I think
I'll be fine.

134
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,399
Yeah, I-uh, I know
it's blocking the stairs,

135
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,568
but people
could walk around, right?

136
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,928
You're the greatest.

137
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,529
Get over here.
You're my bear!

138
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,530
That's right.

139
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,018
Growl for me!

140
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,258
What are
those pads for?

141
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,934
Those pads there, my friend,
are for you to fall on.

142
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,311
In honor
of your departure,

143
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,581
I'm about to give you
your final,

144
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,392
full-turbo,
spinning eagle.

145
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:16,726
Prepping for takeoff!

146
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:17,896
Excellent,
now did you get my text

147
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,714
about not eating after midnight,
last night?

148
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:20,989
All I had is
mouthwash.

149
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,353
Let's do this,
come on!

150
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,117
Mounting.

151
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,386
Three!

152
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,144
<i>Two!
One!</i>

153
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:30,196
Eagle...
Eagle...

154
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,631
Are these two
doctors?

155
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:33,977
I'm afraid so.

156
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,697
Never... stop...
spinning me!

157
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:41,296
Eagle!
Whoo!

158
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,844
Find the pads!

159
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,422
<i>I can't find it.</i>

160
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,929
Dude,
follow my voice!

161
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,354
Coming...

162
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,578
There is another hospital
down about 3 miles that way.

163
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:01,599
You okay,
babe?

164
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:02,850
<i>Eagle...</i>

165
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,616
Yeah.

166
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,479
S08E18:
My Finale

167
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,939
Fantastic eagle,
buddy!

168
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,582
Yeah, I really felt
like we nailed it.

169
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,036
So, I'm gonna see you
all day,

170
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,027
I'm worried you did
your goodbye too early.

171
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,895
Oh my God,
I did, I'm such an idiot.

172
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:28,117
It's all right,
I can fix this,

173
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:31,004
We just have to match
that initial goodbye intensity

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,438
every time
we see each other.

175
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,552
Can you do that
for me?

176
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,031
Yeah, I'll just answer you
like this,

177
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,680
"Come here, you!"

178
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,980
Smell like
a weightlifter.

179
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,798
That's cause I worked out
this morning.

180
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,129
Wow...

181
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,409
It's alright.

182
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:45,845
I finally dealt
with the fact

183
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,084
that you'll never hold me
like that.

184
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,098
Maybe we should try,
let's see what we're missing.

185
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:49,570
Yeah?

186
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:53,125
Oh God,
I love the feel of you.

187
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,753
You smell
like a turbo captain!

188
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,651
Dude,
it's finally happeni-ing!

189
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,485
Now I know
what we are missing, guys.

190
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:03,173
You have been...
Yeah, you guys are on to something.

191
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,541
I usually cup the butt
for support.

192
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:06,656
Oh, it's nice.

193
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,190
Oh yeah,
there it is.

194
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,076
Our groins
are usually closer...

195
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,505
Yes, it's like
they're clapping...

196
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,784
They almost
slap each other.

197
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,319
- Yeah, we're not gonna do that.
- Yeah, not gonna do it.

198
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,636
Excuse me.

199
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,184
<i>To hell with
doing my goodbyes too early,</i>

200
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:20,993
<i>I want my moment
with Doctor Cox,</i>

201
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,345
<i>and I want it now.</i>

202
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,089
Doctor Cox,
since this is my last day,

203
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,384
I got you
a little something.

204
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,432
You know,
as a thank you.

205
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,388
Because...
In my mind...

206
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,870
You're the one who made me
the man I am today.

207
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:33,159
You can't blame me
for that.

208
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,611
No,
it's too mean.

209
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:37,102
It's a book
of all your rants!

210
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,848
I always
wrote them down.

211
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:41,020
- Wow...
- Check it out.

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,756
Leather bound,
I did the calligraphy.

213
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,506
The number
next to each passage

214
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,780
is a rating system
from 1 to 5,

215
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,568
depending on how much
that particular rant

216
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,719
hurt me emotionally.

217
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,852
<i>One being something
I could easily shrug off,</i>

218
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,551
and 5 being something that
still makes me want to cut myself.

219
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,106
Oh, look:

220
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,829
"The only way you could be
less productive right now

221
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:01,955
is if you were,
in fact,

222
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,112
the wall on
what you're leaning against."

223
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,721
That one used to be a five,
but now it's a four.

224
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,634
I still well up
when I think about it,

225
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,615
but now
I can fall asleep after.

226
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,144
Who wants to see
what Jordan does

227
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:12,879
when she's bored?

228
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:15,877
<i>Hey,
Newbie,</i>

229
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,205
What if say, I wanna
to locate something in here

230
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,141
about just
how little I care about

231
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,122
any given moment that you and I
have spent together?

232
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,052
<i>Good question.</i>

233
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:28,446
You just go to the glossary,
and you see, "How little I care."

234
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,222
Page 19.
Boom, page turn.

235
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:35,307
Things I care as little about
as JD's last day of residency.

236
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:38,232
Ha-ha-ha-ha,
I remember this one!

237
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,822
Every hybrid car,
every talk-show host,

238
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,820
everything on the planet,
everything in the solar system,

239
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,957
and everything, everything,
everything, everything...

240
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,590
Everything that exist
past, present and future,

241
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,631
and all discovered
and undiscovered to mention is,

242
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:53,984
and of course...

243
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,667
- Hugh Jackman!
- Hugh Jackman!

244
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,478
That was nice, I liked that.
We shared that.

245
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:00,507
<i>Me too,</i>

246
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,346
because it's
the exact sentiment

247
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:04,312
that I wanna
to put out there for you

248
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,947
on your last day
of work here.

249
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:07,847
Thank you
for this lovely present.

250
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:11,664
Okay, um...
You're welcome.

251
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,782
Up close,
you're not a handsome man.

252
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,098
Thank you,
Mrs. Stonewater.

253
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,174
When you gone,
he's gonna hit me.

254
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,268
Mom, he is
not going to do that.

255
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:27,083
Doctor Dorian?

256
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,546
I would never hit a patient,
Mrs. Stonewater.

257
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,561
I am not a hitter.

258
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:31,817
See,
he hates hitting.

259
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,741
Well, I wouldn't say
that I <i>hate</i> hitting.

260
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:34,769
That's a little strange.

261
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:37,460
D-D-Does wrestling count
as hitting?

262
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,574
Because my friend,
Turk and I,

263
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:40,325
sometimes wrestle
and I really like that.

264
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,201
When you're gone,
he's gonna wrestle me!

265
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,939
No, only if you tickle me first,
that's what Turk does.

266
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,467
Now
he wants to tickle me!

267
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:47,583
Are you an idiot?

268
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,212
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

269
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,278
That is not my mom,
okay, uh...

270
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,662
This paranoia,
and a delirium,

271
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,876
and it's last few weeks,
it's like she's just checking out and--

272
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,986
I know it's frustrating,
but I promise you,

273
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,222
we're gonna find
the answer.

274
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,390
<i>He's gonna hit me
when you leave!</i>

275
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,152
I'm almost positive
I won't!

276
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,287
Do you think you need
the "almost" part?

277
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,689
I am very positive I won't!
It will never happen.

278
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,262
Sorry.

279
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,327
You're no doctor?

280
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,454
Actually,
it's my last day.

281
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,780
Yeah,
makes sense.

282
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:23,927
That was hurtful.

283
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,292
Can there be
good without evil?

284
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,258
It's probably a question
for your priest.

285
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm Jewish.

286
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,552
Really?
Shalom!

287
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,117
- What?
- Never mind.

288
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:39,002
That "good-evil" thing
was in my head

289
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:39,728
because I was watching
"Unbreakable"

290
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:41,867
by Manight Shyamalan.

291
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,766
It's "M. Night",
you-you don't say "Ma-night",

292
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,693
it's-it's M. Night,
no Ma.

293
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:47,832
No, it's Ma!

294
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,521
Like Thomas Haur,
F. Maria Abraham.

295
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,035
Don't think so...

296
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,923
- No Ma?
- No Ma.

297
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,074
<i>Well,
that's funny.</i>

298
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,463
Cause we've bowling
the other night,

299
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,828
and he says, "Man, no one ever
says my name right."

300
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:01,320
I said, "Ma, you've got
two bigger problems than that."

301
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,659
One of them
is that seven tense split

302
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:03,714
you live for yourself...

303
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:05,574
<i>And the other one...</i>

304
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:06,948
is how about trying
to write a movie

305
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,329
without a big
twist ending.

306
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,287
Well, he took offence,
got pissed,

307
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,411
he wouldn't talk me
for a good hour, but...

308
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:13,934
He loosened up
on the hay, right?

309
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,485
Yeah, I'm sure
that's a true story.

310
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,858
Anyway, I wanted to do
something big

311
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,681
for your departure,
but now it is my wife

312
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,078
who's taken up
all my time.

313
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,683
I wanted to spend all night
in the lab,

314
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:24,895
but she wanted
to play cards.

315
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,208
You have a lab?

316
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,459
So I decided to go simple.
What would you say...

317
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:31,969
this is?

318
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,519
Seems like a really
gay piece of man jewelry.

319
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,430
It is.

320
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,524
It's also the penny

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,794
that you put in the door,
eight years ago.

322
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,701
For the last time,
I did not put a penny in the door!

323
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,131
- Admit it!
- Oh God!

324
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,696
Why did you
do that?

325
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:46,876
Because
I read in a book...

326
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,725
that if you surprise someone
with an accusation,

327
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:50,137
they're more likely
to tell you the truth.

328
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,733
Nah, I don't really think
that's gonna work.

329
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,246
Okay, well,
I'm not discouraged.

330
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:53,892
You know
what they say.

331
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:54,466
You admit it?

332
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:55,462
Could you stop
doing that?

333
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:56,494
It's nothing's
gonna happen.

334
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,697
Don't feel bad,
I'm probably doing it wrong.

335
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,164
Admit!

336
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:08,520
Doctor Dorian,

337
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,712
<i>if the patient says
his painkillers aren't working,</i>

338
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,705
how do we know
if he's just trying to scam drugs

339
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,339
or if he really needs
more pain meds?

340
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:16,416
What I recommend is
taking a safety pin

341
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,116
and then just give him
a quick little sta-ab, okay!

342
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,222
<i>Kidding.
Guys...</i>

343
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:22,375
We don't ever stab.

344
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:25,791
<i>With pain meds,</i>

345
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:27,373
it's hard to gauge...

346
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:29,568
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

347
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,260
C'mon, squeeze me
like you mean it.

348
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,733
You smell
like it's hot of...

349
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:34,621
It's hot in my heart.

350
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,897
Get out of here.

351
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,104
Okay,
I can understand

352
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,678
that might have
seemed a little girly,

353
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:43,762
even for me.

354
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:44,981
M-m, not really.

355
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:45,567
You know, Jo,

356
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,534
I'm not really taking comments
right now.

357
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,114
No, no, it's sort of
an announcement phase, okay?

358
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:51,911
Announcement
number one:

359
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:55,563
Starting tomorrow, Doctor Cox
will be leading intern rounds.

360
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,672
Sadly,
it is my last day.

361
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,012
You are now
free to comment.

362
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,579
Who would like
to start us off?

363
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:05,887
<i>Nobody?</i>

364
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:06,966
Jo?

365
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,005
It's funny, you were--
you were eager

366
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,935
to make a comment
only moments ago.

367
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,637
No,
I got nothing.

368
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,237
I order you
to comment!

369
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:15,594
Umm...

370
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,835
I'll miss you...?

371
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,433
Oh, Jo!

372
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,584
I'll miss you too!

373
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,024
It's over, Sunny,
it's too late.

374
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,423
There he is...
Speak of the devil!

375
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:28,381
I was just prepping these guys
for you to take over.

376
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,782
Maybe you'd like to
say a few words

377
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,255
about how you and I
got started our relationship

378
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,513
began as
a student and teacher thing,

379
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,342
and then evolved into something
a whole lot more.

380
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:39,800
<i>The floor, Perry...</i>

381
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:41,757
is yours.

382
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,468
I'm okay.

383
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,026
He's okay.
You're okay?

384
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,888
He's okay,
okay, uh...

385
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,090
I guess I'll just have
to settle

386
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,515
for handing over
the ceremonial reins...

387
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,294
Take the reins,
please.

388
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:55,937
Never want to.

389
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:56,772
Take the reins.

390
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:57,537
I don't want
the reins.

391
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,237
- Please, take the reins.
- I'm not taking the reins.

392
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,138
I can take the reins
and just hold them for him!

393
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,901
I felt that could work out
for everyone.

394
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:04,253
Here you go,
they're heavy.

395
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,337
This guy can pull,
haha...

396
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:06,825
No one's
taking the reins!

397
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,594
Well then, what am I gonna do
with the reins?

398
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,021
Reins are on the ground.
Happy now?

399
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,358
<i>Alright, children,</i>

400
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:15,547
tomorrow morning,
I want you prepped

401
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:16,537
on the endocrine system.

402
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,157
At least let me
pass of the torch...

403
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,394
Oh, for the love of God,
disperse!

404
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,349
Can you hold this please,
it's very hot.

405
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:26,910
<i>And just like that,</i>

406
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,127
<i>it was time
to ruin someone's day.</i>

407
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:38,697
She has
Huntington's Disease?

408
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,466
It's a degenerative
brain disease.

409
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:44,505
Causes you to lose control
of your movement

410
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,726
and mental ability.

411
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,892
It can also
change your personality,

412
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:49,061
like with your mom.

413
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:52,507
So, uh,
what do we do?

414
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,095
Unfortunately,
there is no cure.

415
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:58,186
Eventually,
it will take her.

416
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,908
Oh, geez...

417
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,521
<i>Sometimes you just have
to barrel through,</i>

418
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,032
<i>no matter
how much it sucks.</i>

419
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,189
<i>And...
Mr. Stonewater,</i>

420
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,749
Huntington's is caused
by a faulty gene.

421
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,174
And since your mother
has it,

422
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,283
you have a 50/50 chance
of having it too.

423
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,594
We can test you for it,
if you want.

424
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:28,027
If we find out
that I have it early on,

425
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:29,892
are there
any treatment options?

426
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,464
Nothing substantional yet.

427
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,256
I can only tell you
<i>if</i> you have it.

428
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,934
I... can't even tell
when the disease would hit you,

429
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:38,950
if you do have it.

430
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,777
Could be in your 70s,
like your mom, or--

431
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,091
<i>Could be sooner.</i>

432
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:45,729
Could be sooner.

433
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,542
I am so sorry.

434
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:53,942
Do I have
a few minutes?

435
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,415
Sure.

436
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,740
<i>I'm so bummed
about Ms. Stonewater,</i>

437
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,311
<i>I totally spaced and forgot
what's wrong with Benjamin here.</i>

438
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,887
<i>Is he the one
with the broken ribs?</i>

439
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,036
<i>Nope. Maybe he is
the guy with sinus polyps?</i>

440
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,447
<i>I don't think
there is any polyps,</i>

441
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:21,742
<i>but he definitely has some
oily skin issues.</i>

442
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,403
<i>I should try him onto
that dynamite apricot scrub</i>

443
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,576
<i>I stole from Elliot.</i>

444
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:28,346
<i>Oh, come on!
Focus!</i>

445
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,527
<i>I s'pose I could go
get his chart,</i>

446
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,831
<i>but I left it
all the way downstairs...</i>

447
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,128
<i>Come on, man,
you got eight years</i>

448
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,077
<i>of medical experience.
Use it!</i>

449
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,683
<i>Maybe you can
smell it out...</i>

450
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:43,928
<i>I want to say it smells like
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i>

451
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:45,351
<i>What are you doing?</i>

452
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,552
<i>You don't know what
any diseases smell like!</i>

453
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:48,798
<i>Ah, to hell with it.</i>

454
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,923
What do
you have again?

455
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,842
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

456
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,647
Of course you do,
you reek of it.

457
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:55,070
I'm sorry.

458
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:57,950
<i>See, Benjamin understands
that you're human,</i>

459
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,995
<i>that you're having kind of
an overwhelming day.</i>

460
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,966
<i>Give him a smile,
as a "thank you"!</i>

461
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:03,661
I want a new doctor.

462
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:05,964
Uh, no, I've been working
my butt off

463
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,604
taking care of you
for the last two weeks,

464
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,640
so I'm afraid
the answer is "no", Benjamin.

465
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,093
My name is Roger.

466
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,578
I'll get you
a new doctor.

467
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:17,627
What's wrong?

468
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:19,077
<i>Did you find out</i>

469
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:20,457
that I am replacing
your kitchen counter tops

470
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:21,719
with a prettier ones
from my apartment,

471
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:22,278
because if you're mad,

472
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:23,546
I can stop those workers
right now.

473
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,191
What?
No, Elliot...

474
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,197
I'm upset because
Huntington's Disease sucks,

475
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,641
Doctor Cox is a jerk,
I'm such a crappy doctor,

476
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,076
I just got dumped
by a patient,

477
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,546
and no one but you and Turk
even cares that I am leaving!

478
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,023
What about them?

479
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,746
I'm not leaving yet!

480
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,360
I'm just getting some air,
but thank you!

481
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:47,796
Thank you all! You know,
I've always said that

482
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,953
I-I came to Sacred Heart
a boy,

483
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:51,204
and it's turn me into--

484
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,075
They are waving at me,
genius.

485
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,512
I took
my favourite table,

486
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,341
and I'm bailing out
of that coffee place.

487
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,295
Bye gang!

488
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:59,478
- Bye, Bob.
- Bye, Bob!

489
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:02,440
But you left a year ago!
You got cake!

490
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,146
He got a cake!

491
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,602
Who changed my sign?

492
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:11,237
How dare you change
somebody's sign?!

493
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,583
You stupid
sign changers?!

494
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:14,348
Hey, relax.

495
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:15,614
They're sign changers!

496
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,038
I'll fix it.

497
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,702
Oh, that's right,
I forgot Tina in accounting

498
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:24,027
left for eight days
to climb on Kilimanjaro!

499
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:25,133
How cool is that?

500
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:26,644
- Elliot!
- <i>What?</i>

501
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,048
I just think
she's very brave!

502
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,317
With her wooden leg
and all.

503
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,949
Hey Elliot, I can see down
your blouse from here!

504
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,248
I hope
you fall and die, Todd!

505
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,871
What a way to go!

506
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,533
There,
lil' better.

507
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:41,849
So what the hell
did you think

508
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,833
leaving this place
was gonna be like?

509
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,821
Well, I guess I felt there would be
a lot of heartfelt goodbyes...

510
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,294
When I was finally
ready to leave,

511
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,871
it'd be like one of those
great old sitcom finales...

512
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,750
We got a trouble
in here!

513
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,828
We all gonna die!

514
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,027
Why would they wire
all the power

515
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,177
through one switch?

516
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,654
That seems crazy!

517
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:26,001
Well, I'm afraid all
I can offer you is a handshake.

518
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:27,374
I'll take it, sir.

519
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,312
Have a great life,
Dorian.

520
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,359
Thank you.

521
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,501
Get as much tail
as you can.

522
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:34,284
I always do, sir.

523
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,313
Already through
a morning sex today.

524
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,652
Daddy girl!

525
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:42,593
To all goodbyes,

526
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,007
maybe you should just
ask for them.

527
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:45,985
You're right.

528
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,632
<i>My exchange with Doctor Kelso
renewed my strength.</i>

529
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:51,242
<i>Other men had no problem
saying what they wanted,</i>

530
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:55,360
<i>and sure, sometimes it was
a ridiculous, ridiculous request</i>

531
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,093
Admit
that you did it!

532
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:56,752
No!

533
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:57,752
- 'Mit!
- No!

534
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:00,052
Dammit!

535
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:01,195
<i>And sometimes,
it's even</i>

536
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,373
<i>not wanting to know
if you have a fatal disease.</i>

537
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,401
Hey, uh,
Doctor Dorian...

538
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:05,967
I decided not
to take that test, okay?

539
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:07,577
Okay...

540
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:11,080
<i>Either way, it was time for me
to follow their league.</i>

541
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,475
Doctor Cox,
I want something from you.

542
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:16,853
I know you do, Newbie,
and I have been

543
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,828
searching through
this wonderful book

544
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:19,508
that you gave me,

545
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:22,081
trying to find
the exact right speech

546
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:22,960
to share with you,

547
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,959
but alas, there's nothing in here on
"Barking up the wrong tree,"

548
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,601
or even a
"Turn back <i>now</i>

549
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,654
because this doesn't end
well for you" sections, so...

550
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,881
I'm gonna have
to go ahead and wing it.

551
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,405
Let's see what happens.

552
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:36,761
Noobie, I know
that you want this

553
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,714
to be a very special day
for the both of us.

554
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:40,173
I get that,
I truly do.

555
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:43,124
You want feelings to be shared,
you want hugs to flow.

556
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:46,378
But that is not now
nor is it ever been who I am,

557
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,251
and you know that.

558
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:48,955
I'm real sorry there,
Newbie,

559
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,577
but this is not
a special day for me,

560
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,105
it's just...
a day.

561
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,444
If you put that down
in the book later,

562
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:00,511
give it a five.

563
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:01,889
Fair enough.

564
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,466
How could Dan
not want to know

565
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:19,695
if he has
Huntington's Disease?

566
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>Maybe he's in denial.</i>

567
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,699
<i>I mean if it were me,
I've been gone crazy.</i>

568
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:25,917
I'm gonna go
talk to him.

569
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,340
D-I implore you,

570
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,412
please do the one thing
I am beyond confident

571
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:32,957
that you know how to do
nothing do nothing.

572
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,992
It is
the patient's decision.

573
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,549
Has Perry told you
how he feels about you yet?

574
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:39,551
No, and he says
he is not going to.

575
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,640
Well, just wait him out,
you'll beat him in it.

576
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:44,099
Un...
Let it arrive...

577
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:45,620
acceptable...

578
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,076
Unacceptable.

579
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,068
You love torturing him,
don't you?

580
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,047
I do.

581
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,638
How come
you never tortured me?

582
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:55,758
You know like
when I just started.

583
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,756
You were Bambi!

584
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,100
Somebody had to teach you
how to walk.

585
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:02,878
Thank you for that.

586
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,250
For being my teacher.

587
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:09,307
No problem.

588
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,470
Is there anything I can do
to repay the favor?

589
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,669
Tell me my husband loves me
more than he loves you.

590
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,459
It's about the same.

591
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,391
I'll take it.

592
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm gonna miss you,
Bambi.

593
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,785
And I'll miss you too.

594
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,612
- Why are you stopping?
- Why are <i>you</i> stopping?

595
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,208
- I don't wanna say.
- Just say!

596
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,069
Let's face it.

597
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,200
We said "goodbye"
too early,

598
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,827
I don't think
I've got another hug in me.

599
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,020
Honest to God, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

600
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,743
How can I ever
not want to hug you?

601
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,183
Has the world
gone mad?

602
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,948
It's just crazy!
We can do this.

603
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:03,461
You're absolutely right buddy,
come here!

604
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,257
Nope,
not feeling it.

605
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,213
You smell like regret.
Let it go.

606
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,854
Young lady,
are you responsible

607
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,553
for jamming
those elevator doors?

608
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,392
No, good sir,
I am not.

609
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:22,912
Tell the truth.

610
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:26,277
Okay, I did it.
But it was an accident.

611
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:29,130
That's okay.
Because you came clean!

612
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:30,589
And here's ten dollars.

613
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:31,665
Go buy
some ice cream!

614
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:33,569
This is stupid.

615
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,376
He blackmailed me
into doing this.

616
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:37,802
No improving...
Give me the money back.

617
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:39,779
No, my script says
to rip it up

618
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:41,048
and walk away
dramatically.

619
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,315
She was supposed
to be my long-lost sister,

620
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,010
were you getting that?

621
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,940
Look,
it's been a very long day.

622
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,489
Well, long days are
like pancakes...

623
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:55,975
Admit it!

624
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,375
Fine!
I put penny in the door.

625
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,743
It was eight years ago!

626
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:00,311
Oh, what do you know,
it finally worked.

627
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:01,611
It was an accident.

628
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,797
It fell out of my pocket
and rolled into the door.

629
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:07,136
It was my first day,
I didn't wanted you to be mad.

630
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,378
Do you believe me?

631
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:09,799
Yeah,
I saw it happen.

632
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,389
If you saw it happen,
then why did you

633
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:14,283
asked me back then
if I put a penny in the door?

634
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:16,954
It was a test of character.
You failed.

635
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:19,124
And you lost out
on a wonderful friendship.

636
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,020
We could
still be friends!

637
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:33,025
So you're actually gonna stop
working around here?

638
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:34,566
That's right, Ted.

639
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:37,365
So you're actually gonna stop
working around he..

640
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:39,836
- Thanks.
- No worries.

641
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,112
Did you know
it's Doctor Dorian's last day?

642
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,965
You should give him a hug
and share your feelings about him.

643
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:46,087
Do you think
you're funny?

644
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,020
Funny looking pal!

645
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,272
Hey, you.

646
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:56,407
I-I'm trying to develop
my sentimental side.

647
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:58,366
You know,
for my stupid kids,

648
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,366
and you and I
did it once, so...

649
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,566
Take care.

650
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,033
Thanks, Jordan.

651
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:10,266
So you're actually gonna stop
working around here?

652
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,651
Ted, come here.

653
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:16,922
I need to be horrible
to someone.

654
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,782
That's weird
that you came.

655
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,567
Uh, you seem
like you need it.

656
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,072
I am supersensitive
about my skin today.

657
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,136
Focus on that.

658
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:27,764
- It looks really blotchy.
- Yeah, and check this thing out!

659
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,367
- Did you pick that?
- No, it did it by itself!

660
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,106
I wanna touch it,
but I don't!

661
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,503
Did you just page me
to ask me

662
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,967
how much Ibuprofen
to give Mrs. Lensner here?

663
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:41,152
Oh, I was worried
it would excacerpate the patient...

664
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:42,585
It's Ibuprofen!

665
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,531
Here's what you do:
When she wakes up,

666
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,393
get her to open her mouth,
nice and wide,

667
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,299
then get some of those
Ibuprofen pills in your hand, and

668
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,196
throw them at her!

669
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:53,268
Whatever sticks in there,
that's the correct dosage!

670
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,439
And the cycle repeats, huh?

671
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:56,768
Beg your pardon?

672
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,911
You yelled at me
for the very same thing,

673
00:25:58,946 --> 00:25:59,922
when I was an intern.

674
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:01,729
I'm gonna go ahead
and jot that down

675
00:26:01,764 --> 00:26:03,981
as one of the most
fascinating tidbits of the day!

676
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:08,599
<i>So maybe that's
who Perry Ullysses Cox is...</i>

677
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,117
<i>A gruff,
insensitive teacher.</i>

678
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:13,315
<i>And after everything
we went through,</i>

679
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,310
<i>if I'm still just
another student to him...</i>

680
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,909
<i>It doesn't mean
I should be any less grateful.</i>

681
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:19,724
Thank you for everything,
Doctor Cox.

682
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:20,539
Keep moving.

683
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:25,869
<i>I expected that.</i>

684
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,182
<i>I didn't expect this.</i>

685
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,170
We're sorry...

686
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:32,232
About what?

687
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,393
- I blew my goodbye, I did it too early,
- The whole moving in, I totally blew it

688
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,545
- now I can't hug you,
- 'cause I feel like I was

689
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:36,447
- what kind of a friend am I?
- going to lose you end of all...

690
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:38,200
Guys, can you not talk
simultaneously?

691
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:38,923
- I can,
- I can,

692
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:40,176
- but I'm not sure she can...
- but I'm not sure he can...

693
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,770
- That was awesome!
- That was awesome!

694
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,020
Turk,
your goodbye was great.

695
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,925
And Elliot,
I told you to move stuff in,

696
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:50,351
because I want you
to be there all the time.

697
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:51,998
I sublented my house!

698
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:53,597
That's aggressive--

699
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,074
I can't help it,
I lost my mind!

700
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:57,835
Still, guys,
I want you to know...

701
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,016
We're all good, okay?

702
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:00,971
- Okay.
- Thanks.

703
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,988
<i>I understood their neediness,
because I am feeling it myself.</i>

704
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:06,923
<i>And I know
what's causing it...</i>

705
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,253
<i>The future.</i>

706
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:10,471
<i>I wanted to know
what was next.</i>

707
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:13,171
<i>Whether we would make it
as a couple?</i>

708
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,195
<i>Whether I would stay tight
with my friend?</i>

709
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,723
<i>Whether he will even miss me
when I'm gone?</i>

710
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,372
Hey.

711
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:24,230
Hey!

712
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:26,603
Where's your mom?

713
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:29,503
Oh they, uh...

714
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,272
They wheeled her out of her bed
to get some kind of scan.

715
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:34,829
I should probably
go check on her.

716
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,832
Before you go,
I got to ask...

717
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:39,913
Why aren't you
going to get that test?

718
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:44,273
I don't know.

719
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,032
I still might, you know,
in a next few years or... days.

720
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,884
<i>But right now,
if I found out</i>

721
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,005
that I was eventually
gonna die from something...

722
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:03,474
Once you learn that information,
you can't unlearn it.

723
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:07,550
And this way,
my future is still mine.

724
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:11,042
It can be whatever
I want it to be.

725
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:15,374
Does that makes sense?

726
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:17,648
Yeah.

727
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:22,975
Thanks.

728
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,318
You're welcome.

729
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,536
<i>My last chart.</i>

730
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:46,776
So your shift is officially over...
and that'll do it.

731
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:48,963
Nice knowing you,
John Dorian.

732
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:51,718
It was
nice knowing you too...

733
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,576
What is your name?

734
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:56,328
Glenn Matthews.

735
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:57,638
Oh, that was easy...

736
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:58,874
That's easy now.

737
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:00,913
When I was a kid,
I had a horrible impediment,

738
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,991
I'd say "Genn Mafuf".

739
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,003
I'm glad I wasn't there
during those times...

740
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,072
I would have turned you
to pifuf.

741
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:09,669
Why would
you tell me now?

742
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,228
It's first time
you've asked.

743
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:12,346
No, it's not!

744
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:13,265
Pretty sure it is.

745
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,544
I've been here for eight years,
and I don't know your name,

746
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,630
I call you
"The Janitor",

747
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,477
I am sure I've asked you
what your name is.

748
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:19,577
I don't think so.

749
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,577
Really?

750
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,287
People don't wanna know
the janitor's name.

751
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:24,348
You probably
forgotten my name already.

752
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:27,377
- Glenn.
- Glenn...

753
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:28,212
Mafuf.

754
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:32,390
Well then...
Shalom, Glenn Matthews.

755
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:33,509
Shalom.

756
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:38,978
Hey, Tony.

757
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,078
What's up?

758
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:43,720
Adios...

759
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:44,778
See ya.

760
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:48,011
<i>Things rarely go exactly
the way you want them to.</i>

761
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,900
<i>So sometimes you make due
with whatever you can get.</i>

762
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:52,383
Good night!

763
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:53,240
Good night.

764
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,392
Ah, he's finally gone.

765
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,031
Talk about making a big deal
over nothing, you know.

766
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,883
I mean,
Doctor Dorian was fine,

767
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:09,709
but he was no better
than any other doctor.

768
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,335
For the record, he was the best
that ever came through this dump.

769
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,629
John Dorian was the first
and only doctor I ever met

770
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:20,096
who cared
as much as I do.

771
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,366
And you can
forget about him

772
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:23,979
just an exceptional physician.

773
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,980
Because the fact
that matters is he was...

774
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,127
He's a damn
exceptional person.

775
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,820
That's why
people gravitated to him.

776
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:33,985
That's why I did.

777
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:39,134
He was my friend.

778
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:42,981
Thank you, God.

779
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:45,488
That was beautiful.

780
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:47,381
Oh God, no...

781
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,151
It's okay, Perry.
You just said how you feel.

782
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:54,099
Honestly, I am so full
of your love right now,

783
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:56,427
I literally could not take
another drop.

784
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,333
Brace yourself,
I am coming in.

785
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,933
You smell
like a father figure.

786
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:04,745
Oh...

787
00:31:04,945 --> 00:31:05,993
Please stop.

788
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,958
Great job, Sunny,
you said your line perfectly.

789
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:14,868
Oh, thanks!
I worked on it!

790
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:16,740
I knew
it would set you off.

791
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:19,182
Good night,
best friend.

792
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,222
He thinks I'm
an exceptional...

793
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,891
person!

794
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,583
You realize that even
though he gets to leave,

795
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,424
you...
have to stay?

796
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,383
I didn't think
that out.

797
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,198
No.
You didn't.

798
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,262
<i>Endings
are never easy.</i>

799
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,759
<i>I always build them up
so much in my head,</i>

800
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:44,203
<i>they can't possibly live up
to my expectations,</i>

801
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,681
<i>and I just end up
disappointed.</i>

802
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,791
<i>I am not even sure
why it matters to me so much</i>

803
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:49,584
<i>how things end here.</i>

804
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,675
<i>I guess it's because
we all want to believe</i>

805
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,610
<i>that what we do
is very important.</i>

806
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,468
<i>That people hang
onto our every word.</i>

807
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:02,084
<i>That they care
what we think.</i>

808
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,544
<i>The truth is,
you should consider</i>

809
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:07,732
<i>yourself lucky
if it even occasionally</i>

810
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,967
<i>get to make someone,
anyone...</i>

811
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:11,779
<i>feel a little better.</i>

812
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:14,985
<i>After that, it's all about the people
that you let into your life.</i>

813
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,271
<i>And as my mind drifted the faces
I've seen here before,</i>

814
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:20,185
<i>I was taking
the memories of family...</i>

815
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,326
Hey,
little brother!

816
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:25,622
<i>of co-workers...</i>

817
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:28,713
Goodbye-five!
From the Big Dog!

818
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:31,976
<i>of lost loves...</i>

819
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,215
You never called.

820
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:35,682
I miss you.

821
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:38,630
<i>Even of those
who've left us...</i>

822
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:40,786
There you are!

823
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,287
Hi, tiger!

824
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:45,419
<i>And as
I rounded that corner,</i>

825
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,643
<i>they all came at me
in a wave of shared experience.</i>

826
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:55,382
Keep it all
like you do.

827
00:32:57,787 --> 00:32:58,787
Point-flip!

828
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,687
I broke
my penis again.

829
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,254
But this time
it was fun!

830
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:14,563
Take care, bro!
Take real good care.

831
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:18,955
I didn't kill her.

832
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:26,113
Way to live
a cheery gig, bro.

833
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,729
I got me
some white meat.

834
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:38,142
Keep party later,
there'll be prostitutes.

835
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,454
Did you ever
go on that picnic?

836
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,030
Make sure you do.

837
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,596
I hate you so much,
JD.

838
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:55,172
It's like a baget.

839
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:59,836
Hooch is crazy.

840
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:04,195
<i>And even though
it felt warm and safe,</i>

841
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:06,032
<i>I knew
it had to end.</i>

842
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,370
<i>It's never good to live
in the past too long.</i>

843
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:16,918
<i>As for the future,
thanks to Dan,</i>

844
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:18,789
<i>it didn't seem
so scary anymore.</i>

845
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:21,749
<i>It could be
whatever I want it to be.</i>

846
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,293
<i>And who's to say
this isn't what happens?</i>

847
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:54,781
<i>Who can tell me that my fantasies
won't come true?</i>

848
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,567
<i>Just this once.</i>

849
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Good night.

850
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:03,161
Good night.

851
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:46,587
Hey.

852
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:49,463
- Say action.
- Action.

853
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,190
I wanna touch it,
but I don't.

854
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,501
Chief, say what.

855
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:23,822
Oh, that's funny,

856
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:25,028
'cause we were bowling
the other night

857
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:26,672
and he says,
"Man, no one ever says

858
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:27,573
my name right."

859
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,160
I says to him,
I says,

860
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:31,209
"Ma, you got two bigger
problems than that.

861
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:32,613
One of them
is that seven tense split

862
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:33,683
that you left
for yourself.

863
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,731
And another one...

864
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:35,860
is how about trying
to write a movie

865
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,096
without a big
twist ending?

866
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,473
He says,
"What's with the accent?"

867
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:40,610
I say,
"What do you mean?

868
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:41,879
It's just
how I grew up."

869
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,442
He says,
"I will put you in a movie."

870
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:44,666
I said, "Okay."

871
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:47,779
Then we're on a hay ride later,
and he makes a monkey face.

872
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,894
I say,
"What in the world is this?"

873
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,158
He says, "Hey man.
Welcome to the big time."

874
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,924
He slaps me
across the face.

875
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,235
Well, I didn't know
whether to...

876
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,651
or write a screenplay.

877
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,146
<i>Next, hit him.
Act two.</i>

878
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:04,412
<i>Hit him.</i>

879
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,786
<i>Alright, just hit him.
Come on!</i>

880
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:08,121
<i>Come on!</i>

881
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:09,216
<i>Hit him.</i>

882
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,177
Got me,
you got me!

883
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,562
# Tell me, you'll be
listening on Fridays #

884
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,478
# She doesn't really... #

885
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,349
Oh my God,
you're listening!

886
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:21,896
<i>It's a wrap.
Thank Donald for the set up.</i>

887
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:45,419
I'll really miss you.

888
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,292
You'll top me in.

889
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,442
<i>Good night check.</i>

890
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:53,759
<i>There's the season wrap
from Judy Reyes.</i>

891
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,451
- Oh, God...
- Mmm...

892
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,124
Well, you bet...

893
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:02,910
More defense now?

894
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:21,454
<i>Alright, Donald.</i>

895
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,871
- Camera set?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

896
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:37,605
<i>Ha, check it.</i>

897
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:41,005
