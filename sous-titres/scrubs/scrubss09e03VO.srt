1
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:04,061
Hey, man.

2
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:07,254
I'm gonna hit the gym and sneak
in a quick workout. Wanna come?

3
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:09,404
Sweating it out in a steam room isn't
exercising, buddy. 

4
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:12,611
No, it's sit-cercising.
Newbie, gandhi, come here.

5
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:16,430
great. Dr. Cox
and his golden boy med student.

6
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,099
I wanted you to witness this.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,670
Number one, say good-bye
to the number one sign...

8
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,705
Aw, that's too bad.

9
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:27,408
Whoo-hoo! Arriba!

10
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,579
And say hello
to the number one shirt.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,647
What?!
It's beautiful, honestly.

12
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,816
The nicest shirt
I've ever received

13
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,018
From a grown, married man.
Oh, go on.

14
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:40,021
Please leave me alone.
Put it on.

15
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:44,092
Hey, wow. That's--that's
some crazy ink you got there.

16
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,696
What the hell is that thing, anyway?
I don't know. I woke up after a 3-day bender

17
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:50,464
Driving a forklift and sporting this.

18
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:53,000
"my name's drew. I'm so cool

19
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,704
'cause I've been in prison
and I got a tattoo."

20
00:00:56,705 --> 00:01:00,374
mock him,
and I'll eat your soul!

21
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,409
Tattoo spooked you
a little, huh?

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,011
His breath was so cold.

23
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,512
So cold.

24
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:11,018
flapjacks!

25
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:13,520
oh, thank god.

26
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:16,056
I thought I was late
for dr. Cox's class.

27
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:18,525
That would be the biggest
mistake I could make.

28
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:21,028
Damn, girl.
That was a workout.

29
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:23,397
Okay, second biggest.

30
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,899
You know, normally,
I like to sleep in,

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,235
But part of me is...
an early riser.

32
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:31,138
Wow. This should not
have happened... Again.

33
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,173
Not that it wasn't nice.

34
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:35,809
You have small
but surprisingly powerful hands

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,678
And almost no beard.

36
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,481
It's like you were created
in a lab for a woman's pleasure.

37
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:43,384
The thing about cole is that--
No, no.

38
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,120
No third person.

39
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,791
Let's begin
with some "q" and "a."

40
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,593
You, seat filler,

41
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:56,730
Tell me the thickest layers in the walls of veins.
Uh...

42
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,633
Thank you for getting us off
to that rousing start.

43
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:01,135
Who's next? Ah.

44
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Pinup girl
avoiding eye contact?

45
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,906
Ugly don cheadle?

46
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,475
What about you, legacy?
Got anything?

47
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,511
Well, uh, you see...

48
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:13,147
No, curiously, I don't see.

49
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,948
when dr. Cox gets like this,

50
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:17,484
It feels a lot like second grade gym class.

51
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,621
all right, you hairless babies.

52
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:22,823
Show some sack and pick up a ball.

53
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,858
Who wants it? You? Huh?

54
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,394
You? You! You're out!
watch out!Watch out?

55
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:29,363
You!
Not in the face!

56
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:31,765
Sure, in the face!
Take it!

57
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,534
Anybody else?

58
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,636
Oh, thank you, muffin.

59
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:42,576
No!

60
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:47,381
The thickest layers
of the walls of the veins

61
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:50,084
Are the tunica externa.
Correct. Everyone else,

62
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:53,087
Stare into my eyes
so I can clock the very instant

63
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,723
When you first realized that
you're not going to make it.

64
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:58,258
Here we go.

65
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,964
Thank you. That was lovely.

66
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,933
Hey, congrats, bro.

67
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:08,001
You really brought it today.

68
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,437
Oh, but who's that
nippin' at your heels?

69
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,474
uh-oh. It's c-dog.
I'm sorry. I don't speak hipster gibberish.

70
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,410
Oh, I'm talking about this epic
battle you and I are locked in

71
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:19,613
For the number one spot.
Okay, I'm assuming you like to be called "dude."

72
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,049
Love it.
Dude, I don't like the spotlight.

73
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,051
I don't like
the extra attention.

74
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,735
I tried med school before,
and I crashed and burned, okay?

75
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:30,557
Oh, playing it humble. Nice angle.
But careful walking on the tracks

76
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,392
'cause there's
a coal train a-comin'.

77
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:36,330
choo-choo!

78
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:55,480
Sync by honeybunny/ReHelen
www.addic7ed.com

79
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:56,189
I'm always psyched

80
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,159
When dr. D. Asks me
to swing by for office hours.

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,328
So tell me,
how's school going?

82
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,797
Well, my hair is
falling out in clumps,

83
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:06,933
But that's not necessarily
stress. Um, I am get older.

84
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,936
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about, lucy.

85
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,472
You need to be prepared
for when I leave.

86
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:14,274
damn it! Why bring her
to the learning tree

87
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,277
If you're not gonna use it
in your inspiring talk?

88
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,813
My--my point is,
while I'm here, I'm yours,

89
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:23,317
But you also need to...
Branch out. nailed it!

90
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:26,720
I don't know if I can
get through med school alone.

91
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:30,805
Don't worry.
Before I, uh, leaf...you're on fire.

92
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,226
I'll make sure
that you have a mentor

93
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:35,896
You're as close to as I am to mine.
Speak of the devil!

94
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:40,900
Hey, perry, you wanna hang out later?
Sure. And if we can't find any more climbing trees,

95
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,936
We'll just head down to the old
swimmin' hole and skip stones

96
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:48,875
Until the fireflies tell us it's suppertime.
I assume that's a dis of some sort.

97
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,343
Ahh!

98
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:52,845
Oh, snap!
That hurt to watch.

99
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:55,848
Can't wait to see that
on the surveillance tape.

100
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,684
That's right.
We have cameras everywhere.

101
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:01,387
We're watching you.

102
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,489
Drive.
Copy that.

103
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,360
I need a new mentor--

104
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:09,896
Someone strong and not afraid
to express emotions.

105
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,364
Maybe a woman.

106
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:14,567
Give me my chips, you dirty bitch!
Or her.

107
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:17,904
Help me shake this machine.
Dr. Mahoney,

108
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,540
I was wondering if it would
be possible for me to, uh,

109
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,642
Shadow you in the hospital.

110
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:26,012
This is not over,
you filthy whore!

111
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,948
Shadow me? Sure.
No, wait.

112
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,918
I forgot you totally annoy me.
Is there any way you could

113
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,821
Instantly change your entire personality?
I guess I could try.

114
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,357
Even the way you said that
was irritating.

115
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,856
Look, I'm not
the mentoring type, okay?

116
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,596
Go ask turk.
I did, but he said, and I'm quoting now,

117
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:46,599
"I already have dr. Bradley
all up in my business."

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,936
Dr. Turk, thanks so much for
taking me under your wing.

119
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,672
It's such a privilege, I feel
like I should be paying you,

120
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:52,674
So...No,
I don't want your money.

121
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,944
Okay,tearing it up, sir.
No, don't--don't tear up your money.

122
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:59,480
My bad, sir. Taping it up.
Tom, you're ten years older than me

123
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,756
And you have a wife and kid.
Please, have some dignity.

124
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,853
Too late, sir.

125
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,020
I wish dr. Cox
had some time for me,

126
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:09,690
But I get it.
He's a busy man--

127
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:12,051
A very busy... Man?

128
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,987
Cheers.

129
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:25,298
"sy-hwa"?

130
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:28,501
it says, "why?"!

131
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:32,004
Cox and I were drinking beer
and watching sports--

132
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:35,274
Two things you hate.
First of all, turk, I've learned to pretend I enjoy beer.

133
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,276
And secondly, I love sports.

134
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,811
The opening ceremonies
for the winter olympics

135
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:42,814
Is not a sport,and you cried during it.
Oh, you want to talk about crying?

136
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,484
Let's talk about the end of "rudy."
hold on!

137
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:47,487
He got on the field at the end
of the movie with his dad in--

138
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,990
You know what? No. No, we're not going there.
Excuse me, dr. Dorian.

139
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,293
Sorry I missed your class. Can I get the notes?
No. Actually, drew, you can't.

140
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,296
And I'm gonna e-mail
the whole class and ask them

141
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:57,554
Not to share their notes
with you.

142
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:02,211
Then tomorrow,we'll have a quiz on it.
That seems excessive, but okay.

143
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:03,764
What was the lecture on?

144
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,065
I don't remember, drew.
It was 20 minutes ago.

145
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:09,956
What are you doing?
I know, I know.

146
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:12,892
It's just that cox is
draping himself over that kid

147
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:16,862
Like a cheap hussy, and then
I have to find you and perry

148
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:19,898
Canoodling in that sports-themed
tavern pretending you like beer.

149
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,468
Well, we're not pretending.
We actually like beer.

150
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,070
Oh, stop it, turk.
It's me.

151
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,506
I just feel like
I'm being replaced.

152
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:30,609
That'll never happen.Do you wanna know why?
Tell me this instant.

153
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,745
Because you're
john damn dorian.

154
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,013
You're right.
I am john damn dorian.

155
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:38,016
You john-damn right, you are!
Now gimme a chest bump.

156
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,120
Yeah, but don't flex 'cause
it'll knock the wind out of me.

157
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,956
see? Can't breathe.

158
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,458
I'm sorry, white bread.
I'm not currently looking for

159
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,293
A protégé/suck-up.
dr. Mahoney,

160
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:51,363
I am not sucking up.
If I were sucking up,

161
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,500
I would tell you
how much I like your shoes.

162
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,669
Which I do, by the way.
They're mannish, yet flirty,

163
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,672
Like, "hey, boys.
Come watch me build a deck."

164
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,774
Look, I just really, really want to shadow you. Please?
Gurney.

165
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,709
What?  oh!

166
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,045
Uh, I think I'm on your tube.

167
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,447
that's how I eat.
Sorry!

168
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,650
Uh, dr. Mahoney,
if you do let me shadow you--

169
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:14,621
For the last time, no.

170
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:18,979
How you feeling today?
Well, I have my up days and down days.

171
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,391
Some weeks I have more
up days than down days.

172
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,236
Like last week, I had
four up days, one down day.

173
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,625
I was like, "whoo-hoo!
Let's have a party!"

174
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,651
But today I think I could really use a hug.
Lucy!

175
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:28,678
I changed my mind.

176
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:33,061
You can start shadowing me
by hugging mrs. Maroney.

177
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,497
Okay, dr. Mahoney.
Wait a second...

178
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,965
Maroney, mahoney-- that is so funny!

179
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:40,334
Yeah,
not as I understand funny.

180
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:42,469
Take mrs. Maroney down
for her m.R.I.

181
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,939
Oh, can you keep an eye on my son?
Your what?

182
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,710
Excuse me.

183
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:52,646
Hey, watch a kid for me?

184
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,781
No, I'm afraid of kids.
He's 12.

185
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,451
I got shot by a 12-year-old
at a petting zoo.

186
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,220
Besides, I gotta change this
shirt. The neck's choking me.

187
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,957
we get it, drew.
You got a very muscular neck.

188
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,161
All right, team. This should be
fairly straightforward.

189
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,596
Scalpel.

190
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,118
Drew's rubbing this
t-shirt thing in my face.

191
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,511
J.D., what the hell? I'm in surgery.
It's not even the right color for him.

192
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,606
He's clearly an autumn.
You've lost it.

193
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:17,870
Dr. Turk is right.

194
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,053
You should be asleep.
She should be asleep!

195
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:21,909
That's my fault, sir.

196
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,878
If anyone gets sued for this,
it's gonna be me.

197
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,314
Look, you gotta remember,
you're john damn dorian.

198
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:30,050
So think about it.
What would john damn dorian do?

199
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:32,986
W.W.J.D.D.D.D.?

200
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:35,989
Was that too many d's?
Why are you awake?!

201
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,058
this thing is so complicated.

202
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,561
You're not that petty kid
anymore. Just let it go.

203
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:42,396
I could do that, or...

204
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,999
Okay, a patient has hypotension,
hyperpigmentation of skin

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,503
And hyponatremia. What
diagnostic test should we run?

206
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,905
Ooh! I know! I know!

207
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:54,074
Anyone but the board-certified doctor?

208
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,976
Good call. I'll observe.

209
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,912
We do an a.C.T.H.
Stimulation test to diagnose--

210
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,581
Addison's disease!
It's addison's disease!

211
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:04,051
I was gonna say that.
Well, we'll never know, will we, drew?

212
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,253
Walking tall, dorian.
Walking tall.

213
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,689
feeling tall, perry.

214
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,759
Okay, I'll admit it.
Kids are good for something.

215
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,263
I can get you the mints,

216
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:15,711
But if you want these chips,
I might dislocate my shoulder.

217
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:16,586
Chips

218
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:20,100
Fine. Ah, got 'em.
Nicely done.

219
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,402
with my mom
in the hospital all the time,

220
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:24,772
I just figured out how to do this.
Yeah, I never knew my mom.

221
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:28,709
You gonna cry about it?
No. Here you go.

222
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,711
Oh!

223
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,679
Mm, you gonna cry about it?

224
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,662
Excluding number one here,
today's assignment

225
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:41,035
Is for everyone
to drop out of medical school.

226
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:43,315
Your parents' money
would be better stuffed into

227
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:46,031
Garbage bags, packed io
a rocket and shot into the sun.

228
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:50,338
oh, my. This gentleman appears
to be coding. What a delight.

229
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:52,580
Who would like tdive in?
I'm on this.

230
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,316
Where the hell did you get a scalpel?
Uh, present from my unc.

231
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:58,021
Handle's made from elephant
tusk. It's mad illegal, yo.

232
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,289
Step off. Number one, jump in.
Excuse me?

233
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,675
do you know why
I call him number one?

234
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:04,529
It's because he is roger
and ready to do this stuff.

235
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,096
Drew, run the code. What's first?
I don't know.

236
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:09,865
I'm standing right here next
to you. Let's take his pulse.

237
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:12,001
Now tell me which nurse should
go get the crash cart?
Huh?

238
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,270
He who hesitates is lost.
Take a breath.

239
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:15,705
Make a decision.
Uh, her.

240
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:18,708
Tell her to do something.
Go get the crash cart.

241
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,977
Now we're cookin'.

242
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,646
Around here, you can be
thrown into the mix

243
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,748
At a moment's notice.

244
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:28,192
I'll be right back.

245
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:34,355
Um, I've got the results
of ryan's mom's m.R.I.

246
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:38,092
What's it say?

247
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,061
That she's dying.

248
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,602
Bring him back to her room.

249
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:52,206
You just have to hope
you're up to the task at hand.

250
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,041
You're doing really great.

251
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,910
Is this guy dying?
Probably.

252
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:58,913
But he's been circling the drain
for months, so it's no biggie.

253
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:01,248
Now he's unresponsive to c.P.R., what's next?
I don't know!

254
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,019
Sure you do. Think.
I don't!

255
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,410
Come on, drew, tell me.
This is insane! I'm not ready for this!

256
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,703
of course,
if you let someone down...

257
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,771
Newbie!
A little help here, please.

258
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,394
Thank you.

259
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,402
It can turn into
someone else's moment to shine.

260
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,593
there's no better way
to celebrate saving a life

261
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:26,793
Than pretending to like beer.

262
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,497
Ohh, sticky.

263
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,634
Yep, I'm sitting
between my best bud

264
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,370
And my abusive father figure,
watching my new favorite thing.

265
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,138
Footballing!

266
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,841
They're staring.
Quick, talk like a jock!

267
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,410
Sports grass is so lovely.

268
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,653
Here I thought we weren't
bringing our wives this evening.

269
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,755
Speaking of ich,

270
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:48,182
Carla can't make it to
the owlcats game this Friday.

271
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,785
We have an extra ticket.
I'm in! I'm in!

272
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,655
I gotta see this sports grass in person.
Excuse me, dr. Cox.

273
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,391
I don't mean to interrupt,
but, uh, I have to apologize.

274
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,327
I've made a lot of bad choices
in le. Quick example--

275
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,929
I accidentally, uh, set a shrimp
boat on fire once.

276
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,998
It was a long story.
Another time.

277
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,467
But, um, today was
one of those bad choices,

278
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,970
And if I had
the power to go back in time--

279
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,273
You know, drew, we all wish
we had superpowers, okay?

280
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:15,410
Do you know what the perfect
superhero power would be?

281
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,744
candy hands!

282
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:20,838
For me, it would be
the ability to get back

283
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,375
All the time I wasted on people
who eventually let me down.

284
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,845
Awesome.

285
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:30,281
Dude, think about it--
candy hands.

286
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,683
Everything you touch
turns to candy.

287
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:34,385
Whoop! Candy lamp.

288
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:36,320
Candy perry!

289
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,790
No candy perry.

290
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,859
I don't know

291
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,729
How I'll ever be ready
to give people news like that.

292
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:50,001
You all right?

293
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,936
I'm super.

294
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,771
Goway.

295
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,075
Hey.

296
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,911
Hey.

297
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,880
I know the next couple months
are really gonna suck.

298
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:06,117
If I had any questions,
could I, like, call you?

299
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:10,688
Yeah, I dot know, ryan.

300
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:15,460
Well... Okay, cool.

301
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,066
Why is the college mascot
an owlcat?

302
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:25,403
I don't even know what an owlcat is.
I like to think it's what happens

303
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:27,805
When an owl and a cat
fall in love.

304
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:30,408
Hey, there's my kiss-ass
with some pizza.

305
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,601
I'll be back
with a couple of slices.

306
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:35,980
Dr. Dorian. Do you have a second?
No.

307
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,271
I mean, sure.

308
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,276
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ok at! Whoo-hoo!

309
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:49,112
Look at that right there.
Look.

310
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:50,581
Appreciate you.

311
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,787
Oh!

312
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:58,121
Dr. Mahoney.

313
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:59,957
Hey, I need to talk.

314
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,025
Oh, my god.

315
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:06,730
Were you raised by horses?

316
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,932
No.
I wish.

317
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,801
I was just studying.

318
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,636
What's up, shorty?

319
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,605
And fornicating.

320
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:17,241
Cole, get back under
the horse blanket, please.

321
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:20,878
I was thinking that maybe the three of us--
cole! Horse blanket.

322
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,646
Fine.

323
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,816
Maybe we should just go outside.
Great idea.

324
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:28,886
You want me to help ryan
through his mom's death?

325
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,221
It'll only be
a few months, a year, tops.

326
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,457
Come on. It'll be fun.

327
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,894
It'll be like having a really sad pen pal.
What are you doing? You should help him.

328
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,530
Listen up, seabiscuit.
Th isn't my wheelhouse, okay?

329
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:42,432
It's taken me a long time
to get to a point

330
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,801
That I can be there
emotionally for a patient.

331
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,871
You know how I do it?
Every second that they're here,

332
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:50,741
I remind myself that
once they leave this hospital,

333
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,110
Either on their own
or in a box,

334
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,112
They're no longer
my problem anymore.

335
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:57,414
Out the door,
out of my head.

336
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,286
It's the only way it works
for me.

337
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:01,352
I still think you should do it,
but I'll talk to ryan.

338
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:05,389
Good.
And another thing--

339
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,357
I do love horses.

340
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,860
They are
god's most majestic creatures.

341
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:14,598
If they could talk,
they would be so very wise.

342
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:19,670
I've been in a pretty deep hole
the past couple years--

343
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,572
A lot of
self-destructive stuff.

344
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,440
Honestly, the only thing

345
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,776
I've burnt more than
shrimp boats is bridges.

346
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,812
I need to change that.
What do you want from me?

347
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:31,381
I understand you and dr. Cox
have a special relationship.

348
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:33,283
He's kinda like my dad.

349
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,794
Well, I was hoping you could
help me fix this with him.

350
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:39,156
You know, dr-- It's drew, right?
Yeah.

351
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:42,426
Drew, I've known perry cox
a very long me,

352
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,661
And once he's made up his mind
about someone,

353
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:47,564
He's never gonna change it.
I wish I could help.

354
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,502
That's awesome.

355
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,709
You're not gonna
help him out, huh?

356
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,578
Kinda sucks. I thought you
wanted to be a good teacher.

357
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,047
During the day,
I'm a good teacher,

358
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,550
But right now
I'm ready for a little

359
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:09,052
"magnum p.I." crustache.
I'm gonna be magnum p.I.,

360
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,888
And you're gonna be
black higgins.

361
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,024
You should talk to dr. Cox.

362
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,895
I'm questioning
a lot of things today--

363
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,897
Like my choice in men...

364
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,899
hey, babe, check it out.

365
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,902
I'm dr. Wolverine.

366
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,939
And my choice in mentors.
I really don't want to do

367
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,375
Dr. Mahoney's
dirty work for her.

368
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,644
I got this.

369
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,817
Oh, I love that game.

370
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,220
If you want
to beat the level,

371
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,004
You gotta take that sniper out
in the church.

372
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,488
I know. 

373
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:48,859
Hey, I know you guys
are going home today...

374
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,794
So I wanted to give you

375
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,563
My cell phone number

376
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:56,400
In case you
still want to talk ever.

377
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,368
Whatever.

378
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,943
Give me that.
You're horrible.

379
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:09,946
I'll get the sniper.

380
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,193
What the hell are you wearing?
I'm showing my owlcat spirit.

381
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:23,478
If it's not enough, I have
wings and talons in the car.

382
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,120
Is that glitter? Hell, no!

383
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,888
But it came with the makeup kit.
I don't have to use it. Today...

384
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,437
Oh, for the love of god,
francine!

385
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,243
I gotta go get
the tickets at will-call.

386
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,104
Please don't let him
put the glitter on.

387
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:39,569
I've never heard that sentence
uttered about another man.

388
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:43,023
Perry, uh, I want to talk to you
about drew for a second.

389
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:44,997
I-I really think you're
making a mistake with him.

390
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:47,054
Don't you have some gay dance
rehearsal you got to attend?

391
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,881
He has potential, and you know it.

392
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,700
He's too old.
He's experienced.

393
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,115
He quit.
But he came back.

394
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,094
What exactly
do you want from me?

395
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,575
I want you to realize
you set the bar too high.

396
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,944
The attention
that you're giving to drew--

397
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,947
I would've killed for that
eight years ago.

398
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,783
But you weren't ready yet.
I had to break you down.

399
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:10,053
I tamed you... Like a bull.

400
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:12,822
Excuse me, are we approaching
a point here, dorian?

401
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:15,725
Perry, you finally found
someone to believe in.

402
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,994
Don't ruin it by being you.

403
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:24,367
I think I just
mentored my mentor,

404
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,803
But maybe
that's how it always is.

405
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,905
Our roles
are always switching.

406
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:31,608
Sometimes you're a student,

407
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,344
And sometimes you're a teacher.

408
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:38,648
Lucy, you still wantto shadow me?
More than horses love rainbows!

409
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:42,031
Let's go. Too close.

410
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,656
And if you're smart enough,
everyone can learn something.

411
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,659
One more question,
and all you little assassins

412
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,128
Can get out of here.
Someone please tell me

413
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,598
Where the foramen ovale
in the fetal heart is located?

414
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,202
Drew, save us, please.

415
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,740
Uh, the interatrial septum.

416
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,809
Yes. Nicely done.

417
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,545
I'll expect you to be
wearing your shirt tomorrow.

418
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,848
Everyone leave now.

419
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,386
But whatever you do, don't wait
for that pat on the back.

420
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:20,089
Because, believe me,
it will never, ever--

421
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,224
Oh, come on!

422
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:32,784
Oh, I love you, sports grass.

423
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:34,786
It is pretty soft.

424
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:37,822
Pretty soft?
It's like lying on a cloud.

425
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,328
Why did they have to ruin you

426
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:40,601
By painting all
these numbers and lines?

427
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:45,511
Hey, captain. Looks like
we got some more turf freaks.

428
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,090
Found some what?
check this out.

429
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,379
That is disgusting.
Mm-hmm!

430
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,707
Unh-unh.
Warm up the golf cart and get the taser.

431
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:55,732
The mexican one?
El conquistador.

432
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:56,506
Let's do it.

433
