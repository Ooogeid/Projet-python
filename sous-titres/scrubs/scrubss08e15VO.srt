1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:04,251
<i>The second we got to the Abacos
for the janitor's wedding,</i>

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,118
<i>Dr. Kelso, well...</i>

3
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:08,562
<i>He set up shop at the bar.</i>

4
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:12,710
That's the best Bahama
Mama I've ever had.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,431
I'll be the judge of that.
Hi, Bob Kelso. Excuse me.

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,082
Mercy.

7
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,651
If you would be so kind
as to store this for me,

8
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,622
we could get this party started.

9
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:28,607
One Bahama Mama, please.

10
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:32,199
You can have this back
when mine comes.

11
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:36,431
<i>Things weren't going
that well for the rest of us.</i>

12
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:40,078
<i>Jordan wasn't happy with Dr. Cox
for pretending he had work to do.</i>

13
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:44,818
<i>Elliot was mad at me for never saying
"I love you" in a romantic enough way.

14
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,650
<i>And Carla was so busy being a mom...</i>

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,471
# Hush, little baby, don't say a word

16
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,166
# Mama's gonna buy you

17
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,649
- # a mockingbird.
- <i>She left Turk alone at sea.</i>

18
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,064
Hey, what's up?

19
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,410
Ma'am!

20
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,557
Lady?

21
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:17,366
What's up, Blaquaman?

22
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,453
- I think I just saw a mermaid.
- Maybe you just spooked it.

23
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,655
Oh, cute looking eel.

24
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:27,184
- No, I'm naked.
- Alright, that's you.

25
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:30,444
I was supposed to meet Carla
out here for a little "surf and Turk".

26
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:32,375
Took off my swim trunks.

27
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,409
These bad boys just floated away.

28
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,933
Elliot's mad at me because
I didn't say "I love you" right.

29
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:42,507
You know what?
That eel is looking at me funny,

30
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:45,686
- I'm gonna switch over here.
- Yeah, he's got a mind of his own.

31
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:48,818
Plus, I needed to say
how much I loved her.

32
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,350
And I needed to be
looking right into her eyes.

33
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,321
Well, what's the difference?
Look at me and say it.

34
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,034
I love you.

35
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,687
That's about right.

36
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:03,276
And you're naked. Perfect.

37
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,674
Either one of you two idiots
seen my computer?

38
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:07,536
Maybe the mermaid took it.

39
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:09,640
He's not great in the heat.

40
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,524
I did see a mermaid.

41
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,625
<i>Plus, the janitor wanted to kill me for
forcing him to have a wedding ceremony.</i>

42
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,930
If I'm gonna have a ceremony,
I just need a little help.

43
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,933
Go sunscreen up again and call
an emergency meeting of the Brain Trust.

44
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,817
Island style. Where's Todd?

45
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,408
Last time I saw him, he was stuffing
seaweed into his bathing suit.

46
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,180
Sure. Where's Doug?

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,532
Oh, no! I forgot
to give him his invite.

48
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,816
He's getting married and
he didn't invite any of us?

49
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,642
Oh come on!

50
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:42,028
And carrying around
your invitation is just stupid!

51
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,487
You look stupid!

52
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:48,265
Book Doug into the next "Dealing
with rejection" seminar in my garage.

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,889
80 bucks.

54
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,560
80 bucks! Can I take that class?

55
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,097
No room for you, Ted.

56
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,848
Oh, man!

57
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,801
That's not dealing with rejection.

58
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,791
I can work wonders
with you, my friend.

59
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,912
- One hundred bucks.
- Hundred bucks!

60
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,280
Sweet!

61
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,262
Season 8 Episode 15
My Soul On Fire: Part 2

62
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,425
{\pos(192,220)}Salad tastes like sunscreen.

63
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,703
That's because you put sunscreen on it.

64
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:34,804
{\pos(192,220)}Oh, man! I put Ranch on my face.

65
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:35,674
{\pos(192,220)}Alright.

66
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:39,427
{\pos(192,220)}Welcome to the 2nd international
meeting of the Brain Trust.

67
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:42,742
{\pos(192,220)}I'll begin this as I began the
meeting six years ago in Guatemala.

68
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,902
{\pos(192,220)}I'm getting married tomorrow.
And I need help.

69
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:47,040
{\pos(192,220)}Ted, you're in charge
of location and music.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,868
Todd, you are in charge of
locating a Justice of the Peace...

71
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,492
and finding a sea turtle
to serve as a ring bearer.

72
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,238
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,059
Who is this dude?

74
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,413
{\pos(192,220)}That is Ira.

75
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,908
{\pos(192,220)}As per our bylaws, the Brain Trust
must always have a fourth.

76
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,559
{\pos(192,220)}Plus he can speak
to dolphins. Or so he says.

77
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,750
Drink.

78
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,484
Drink.

79
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,202
- The man's a born leader.
- Drink!

80
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:19,488
{\pos(192,220)}- You know what? Let's...
- Drink, damn it!

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,684
<i>Time to smooth
things over with Elliot.</i>

82
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:27,767
Seagull!

83
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,605
Hey, baby!

84
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,961
{\pos(192,220)}Check out this awesome place
Turk and I found this morning.

85
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:36,966
{\pos(192,220)}It's called Tahiti Beach and it's out
like right in the middle of the ocean.

86
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:39,972
{\pos(192,200)}We got a kid to videotape us,
but it was good you weren't there,

87
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,922
{\pos(192,200)}because he has red hair,
I know how that nauseates you.

88
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,176
That's us doing some muscle poses.

89
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,604
Look how firm Turk looks.

90
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,826
Anyway, that's when we realized
the kid was trying to steal the camera.

91
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,381
Dude.

92
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,866
My wife gave me that camera!

93
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:59,644
His mistake was running
backwards with the camera on us.

94
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,279
Are you out of your mind?

95
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:04,152
<i>Unfortunately,
the smoothing over didn't work.</i>

96
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,707
So we're not gonna
talk about yesterday?

97
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>For anyone.</i>

98
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,490
So we are not gonna
talk about yesterday?

99
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,242
So we're not gonna
talk about yesterday?

100
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,811
There's nothing really
to talk about, sweetie.

101
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,181
You were a little crazy
before, now it's over.

102
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,895
What is so crazy about
wanting to hear "I love you"

103
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,081
in a meaningful and romantic way?

104
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,142
Oh, good. It's not over.

105
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:36,113
So you just wasted a whole vacation day
pretending to work just to mess with me?

106
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:39,619
I recall you saying that you were
happy I couldn't spend time with you.

107
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,513
You knew I wasn't serious.

108
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,562
That's how we interact.
That's our thing.

109
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,682
You know what? I'm sick of
pretending we don't like each other,

110
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:50,360
It is distinctly not fun anymore.
Would you like to know why? Because A,

111
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,453
We are over 12. And B...

112
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:56,440
We actually do like each other.
In fact, brace yourself...

113
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:58,232
We love each other.

114
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,184
I can't believe you
left me out there yesterday.

115
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,756
I was in the ocean for so long I had
jellyfish stings on my ding-a-ling

116
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,740
I had to make sure Izzy fell asleep.

117
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,941
Why do you have to be
a mommy all the time?

118
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,416
I still make sure you get sex
at least once a week.

119
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,942
Yeah, but you always start with
"This has to be quickie".

120
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,347
Why do you always say that?

121
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,845
Baby, we both know my
"longies" aren't that long.

122
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,070
I gotta be honest with you, sometimes
it makes me feel like you don't love me.

123
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:30,197
On behalf of all women, I just want to
thank you for equating sex with love.

124
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,555
We think it's awesome
when you do that.

125
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:34,484
You're welcome.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,868
No, I know he's upset. But just
put him on the phone, okay, Carol?

127
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,279
Hey, buddy.

128
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,021
I guess you're pretty bummed
about the wedding mix-up, huh?

129
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,495
No, man. I got a lot going on here.

130
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,784
So what's it like there?
Is it awesome?

131
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,896
It's pretty awesome.

132
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,641
Yeah, I thought it would be.

133
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:55,905
You know what, pal?

134
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:58,841
I'm gonna stay on this
phone with you... I gotta go.

135
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,454
Carol, close me up.

136
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,335
So, I found you
a Justice of the Peace.

137
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,316
Say hello to Van.

138
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,148
- Van?
- Van. Stretch it out.

139
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,292
I drive one of you.

140
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,644
You're right not to laugh.
That was stupid.

141
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:20,592
Thanks.

142
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,311
- Where d'you find this idiot?
- Man got me through med school.

143
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,901
He's the dude we used to
practice all the rectal exams on.

144
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,687
We did a couple of them
right here in this very bar.

145
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,436
Right there.

146
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:32,077
With you.

147
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,930
I find that both
fascinating and disgusting.

148
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,717
You already know I love you.

149
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:43,808
I shouldn't have to make some crazy
gesture. I'm not a big fan of those.

150
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:47,916
You went online for three hours and
spent a fortune getting a tiki for Turk.

151
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,914
Elliot, I don't really think $456

152
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:54,197
for an actual faux marble
imitation tiki is a fortune.

153
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,838
- Was that total or each?
- That's irrelevant.

154
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,953
Weren't you the one who said we are
past this dumb relationship drama?

155
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,771
And I meant it. Then.

156
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:05,614
- But you don't now?
- I'm a girl. That's how it works.

157
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,234
And guess what.
All relationships have drama.

158
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,434
When a woman says there
doesn't have to be any drama,

159
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,336
it's because she's so excited there's
no drama at that particular moment

160
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:17,269
she can't wait to share that feeling
with you before there's any new drama!

161
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,768
I want you to be comforted by the fact
that doesn't sound ridiculous at all.

162
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,976
We're at a wedding! Why can't
you not get to a romantic place?

163
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:26,507
It's not a real wedding!

164
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:30,289
It's a crazy cleaning
person's scam for presents.

165
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,028
Then by all means,
continue being an ass.

166
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:37,116
And do you want to know
why I'm a mommy all the time ?

167
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,134
Please.

168
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,561
It's because I <i>am</i> a mommy.

169
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,850
All the time.

170
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:46,422
I have a baby at home.
I have one in here.

171
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,133
And I have another one!

172
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,721
Who expects me to
work, raise his kids,

173
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,260
buy his clothes,
make his food, run his life

174
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,964
and still have all the energy in the
world left to sex him up every night.

175
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:59,958
Even though his longies are
actually pretty damn long.

176
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,333
I know, right?

177
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,394
You obviously know how I feel about
you. Why are you trying to change me?

178
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,111
This... That works for us.

179
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,799
Remember when my dog died and
you told me he went to doggy hell.

180
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,316
And then you said my mom was gonna
go to doggy hell too when she died.

181
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,223
Because of her dog face.

182
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:20,459
Right.

183
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:23,037
I've wanted to do you
right there in the vet's office.

184
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:26,193
Why are you trying to change
our dynamic? I don't want to.

185
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:29,734
Suit yourself.
Just leave me alone.

186
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:33,102
Just leave me alone.

187
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,353
Just leave me alone.

188
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,965
Fine. I'll see you at the wedding.

189
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,656
Smile for the camera, honey.

190
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,345
Excuse me.

191
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:46,543
Payback time. Let's go.

192
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:47,908
But I...

193
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,528
- Really?
- Let's go.

194
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:50,730
Bye boys!

195
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,940
- You're okay with this?
- I gotta let my man be my man.

196
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,223
Stop it.

197
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:58,625
- Babe, don't be late for the wedding.
- Shut up!

198
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,223
You shut up!

199
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,076
<i>The janitor's wedding day
seemed like any other.</i>

200
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,561
- Good morning, Bob.
- Good morning, Gary.

201
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,376
One Bahama Mama, please.

202
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,304
And if you could, the
electric razor from my bag.

203
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,090
Thanks.

204
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,528
For god's sake, Ted, get some sun.

205
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:28,069
- I've not sunscreened up yet.
- Live a little.

206
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:39,134
It's warmer than I thought.

207
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,381
Damn you, Mother Earth!

208
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,832
Damn you!

209
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,749
Why?

210
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,402
Here's the incredibly
breathtaking view of Hope Town,

211
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,864
And... Well, what do you know?

212
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,990
It's JD. What's he doing here?

213
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,409
Well, he made me
change my wedding plans.

214
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,600
And as punishment, he's got to spend
ten minutes on top of this lighthouse.

215
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,007
- That's all I gotta do?
- That's it, my friend.

216
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,877
Then how come I got
this fish taped to my hands?

217
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:23,906
Seagulls!

218
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:31,064
- Sike! None for you, preggers.
- Damn it!

219
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,546
Do I look like Audrey Hepburn?

220
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:35,445
Yes, of course.

221
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:37,418
Crap, he hates Audrey Hepburn.

222
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,487
No, no. You look beautiful.

223
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,252
Let me fix your hair.

224
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:44,269
Thanks, guys.

225
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:47,024
I just wanna look great
for my honey bunny.

226
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,885
That's my nickname for him.

227
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,429
He also loves it cause
it's his favorite sandwich.

228
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,273
I feel like I finally found
the perfect man, you know?

229
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,692
Oh, please. There's no such thing.

230
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:02,012
Look at Perry. He pretends he's cold
and emotionless, but underneath

231
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:05,115
he's a sweet guy who wants to talk
about our relationship all the time.

232
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:08,164
Face it. Men are just gassy,
selfish, sex-crazed egomaniacs

233
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:11,333
who were put on this earth to
make your life miserable, that's it.

234
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,221
I'm getting married in like ten minutes.

235
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,203
You'll live.

236
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,787
Lady, are this some roots
I'm seeing? This is not your color?

237
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,594
No, i'm actually a redhead.

238
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,559
I'm just gonna grab
a sip of my drink.

239
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,631
I touched it, it's all over me!

240
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:29,264
- Go take a shower.
- Thank you.

241
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,919
Nice hat. Does it
come in a human size?

242
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,970
Shut up.

243
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:45,059
A hungry seabird pooed on my shirt.

244
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:48,252
Go get a new one from the
gift shop, you're gonna miss it.

245
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,907
- Do you think they sell this shirt?
- You're an idiot.

246
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,925
Wait, baby.

247
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,809
- What?
- It's the mermaid.

248
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,519
Then what doesn't she have a tail?

249
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,415
Because she's on land.

250
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,661
Oh my god,
this is the father of my child.

251
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,620
Come on, come on.
We're waiting. Come on.

252
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,788
Alright, I am not
a strong public speaker,

253
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:18,802
nor am I that familiar with the Bible,
so we will do what we can.

254
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:22,963
Now, if you're excited, for our wedding
today, let me hear you say wooh!

255
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,403
Just like that, it's fun if you
throw your shoulders back.

256
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,392
- Try it.
- We're not gonna do that.

257
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,496
Okay, doesn't want to do that.
Here we go.

258
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,380
These guys are getting married today.

259
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,415
And as a special treat, they thought
it would be nice if you all stood,

260
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,776
and they were to sit.
So, shall we?

261
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:46,135
Alright then, it is now
time to join these two

262
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,262
as only the Creator can.

263
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,377
- Where's Bob?
- He's right over there.

264
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:54,852
Of course.

265
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,638
- It's hot!
- Too bad.

266
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,105
Marriage is a dead institution.

267
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:05,946
It hasn't worked for me.

268
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,285
It hasn't worked
for anybody in my family.

269
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,540
But there are certain
signposts you can follow

270
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,392
to try and make the best of it.

271
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,408
Try not to yell at each other.
A great idea.

272
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,819
Don't share any money.
Always sound, sound advice.

273
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:21,069
Never strike each other above
the shoulders. From here down.

274
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:23,913
- From here down, forget it.
- <i>Even though it was a wedding,</i>

275
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,434
<i>none of us were caught up
in the romance of the moment.</i>

276
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:29,227
- <i>In fact before we knew it...</i>
- Don't share cars.

277
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,731
You'll find that it always
has the other person stink on it.

278
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:33,815
And you can't get
that stuff off your shirt,

279
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,818
you're gonna live with it
for the rest of your life.

280
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,428
You don't want it when
you're driving to work, you know?

281
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,926
Before we knew it,
we were already here.

282
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,848
Do you, Ladania Williams,

283
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,210
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

284
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:51,785
I do.

285
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:56,063
Oh my god. We were gonna
find out the janitor's name.

286
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,054
And you...

287
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,146
What? It's 4:37.
"High tide" five.

288
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,522
<i>Damn it!</i>

289
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,967
It's alright. We'll just
start again. No biggie.

290
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:09,494
And you...

291
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,309
That was off the burn!

292
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,918
You know what we'll do?
We'll just say this.

293
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,620
Do you take this lady

294
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,915
to be your lawfully wedded lady?

295
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:26,221
Of course you do. Look at her.
Looks like a ladybug.

296
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,501
Can I just touch right there for...?

297
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,051
You're done. Out.

298
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,397
Terrible job. Good luck.

299
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,130
I just wanna say something
before we kiss, okay?

300
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,996
And thanks for coming,
even though I didn't want you here.

301
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,580
I know that I'm weird.

302
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,679
But, you know, you'd be weird too

303
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,303
if your mother aged
backwards like mine did.

304
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,104
So the thing is that I always kind of

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,578
figured that I would end up alone.

306
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,479
And then you came along.

307
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,246
And you don't just accept my
quirks and my crazy stories

308
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:08,259
and my lies about my mom,
you actually appreciate me for them.

309
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,456
And I don't think I'll ever
stop appreciating you for that.

310
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,589
But I know that I'll
never stop loving you for it.

311
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:18,730
I love you too.

312
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,824
<i>And right then, we all realized
the value of the romantic gesture.</i>

313
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,477
<i>From one person who loves someone...</i>

314
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,717
<i>To another.</i>

315
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:30,048
I remember you.

316
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,357
Wanna get in the water?

317
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:34,779
Fo' shizzle.

318
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,377
What time does that wedding start?

319
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:52,091
Classic stuff Bob.

320
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,239
Everything I do

321
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:00,149
is more fun
if you're doing it with me.

322
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,441
Was that so hard?

323
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:05,068
Oh really?

324
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,877
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

325
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,709
Don't! Don't!

326
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:18,768
I love you.

327
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,386
I love you.

328
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,031
Bahama Mama.

329
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:26,748
Big Mama.

330
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,719
God, it's so beautiful here.

331
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,481
Look, Elliot.

332
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,120
I don't know if it's possible

333
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,334
for me to put how
I feel about you into words.

334
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,003
But I guess I'll give it a shot.

335
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:50,658
I had never really believed
I'd find somebody

336
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,599
that I'd love as much as you.

337
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:58,453
I love you more than
anything in the whole world.

338
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,194
I love you more than Turk.

339
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,287
- Oh my god.
- I know.

340
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,580
That's even hard for
me to say but it's true.

341
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,864
I had to wrestle him
to the ground to get this,

342
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,246
but it’s more
important for you to have it.

343
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:23,936
Look at me.

344
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,369
You're my dream girl.

345
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,562
It's getting a little chilly.

346
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,154
Hey Bob, you've been sitting
here for three days, now.

347
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,974
Why don't you get up and
go see this beautiful island, man?

348
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:12,469
You're right.

349
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:33,414
{\pos(192,210)}I'll have a Bahama Mama, please.

350
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,197
{\pos(192,210)}This is a beautiful place.
