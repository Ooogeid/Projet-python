1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,735
Dr. Reid, I know yoga is
supposed to be good

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:06,514
For pregnant women,
but are you sure this is okay?

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,289
It looks like that baby
could squirt out any second.

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:10,742
Lucy, I'm fine.

5
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,078
Beside I would never
give birth under a tree.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,048
Although j.D. And I did
conceive this baby under one.

7
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,650
It was a christmas tree--
not in our house.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,301
It was still on the lot.

9
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,589
We made a bunch of christians unmfortable that day.
I once got felt up in a pumpkin patch.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,639
Don't you just love the holidays?
It's so nice having someone to talk to.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,127
I feel like I can't go
to the other med students.

12
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:33,762
It's gotten so cutthroat.

13
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:35,418
People will do anything
to get ahead.

14
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:37,510
(typing on keyboard)

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,905
"lost" got canceled, and they're
never gonna air the finale?

16
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,808
So many questions!
Hey, good luck on the test, bro.

17
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:49,005
<i>(lucy) even drew's been acting
like a gunner recently.</i>

18
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,520
Drew, can I borrow
your histology notes?

19
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:55,576
Roger, no. Nothing personal.
I just don't want

20
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:57,357
To help you half-ass your way
through med school

21
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,122
And keep you
from yr true destiny,

22
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,933
Which is to become
the second-best dentist

23
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,664
At a run-down strip mall.
You get it.

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,874
I was a gunner for a while
when I was in med school.

25
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,257
Once I set my roommate lauren's
books on fire

26
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:12,701
So she couldn't study.
Turns out I'd loaned her mine,

27
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,764
So I actually had to buy a whole
new set which she then stole.

28
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,548
Still, in the end, I won
because she got hit by a truck.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,786
I mean, she didn't die,

30
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:23,949
But she's not smart enough to be a doctor anymore.
Is she happy?

31
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:26,711
Oh, she's very happy.
Good.

32
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,656
Now to recap, what is
the number one attribute

33
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:34,672
All med students share
with this skeleton?

34
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,272
Ooh.
Yes?

35
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,524
The hollow area of nothingness
inside the skull?

36
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,772
Exactly. Now it is time
for a bong announcement

37
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,383
About a pointless tradition
brought to you

38
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:46,583
By an empty figurehead
with a failing liver

39
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,628
And an overactive libido...
Mm!

40
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,542
Thank you, perry,
you anger-filled muscle slut.

41
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,196
I miss... This.

42
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:56,148
Yeah, me, too. It kills me
that we're friends now.

43
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:57,777
All right, as you know,

44
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,679
Friday is the annual
white coat ceremony.

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,581
In front of your family
and friends,

46
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,472
You will receive
your lab coats--

47
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:07,868
A symbol of your entrée
into the world of medicine.

48
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,628
These doctors' coats--

49
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,189
Murderers' coats, bob--
because they are all murderers.

50
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:17,670
Anywho, the faculty will
be choosing a keynote speaker

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,916
To represent
the entire first year class.

52
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,850
And as part
of this meaningless charade,

53
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,517
Winston university requires
that each of you sit with me,

54
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:25,534
The chief of medicine,

55
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:29,890
For an irrelevant preceremony interview.
A quick sidebar, perry.

56
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,351
(lowers voice)
can I do the interview

57
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,218
With that little number
in the second row?

58
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:37,236
She said I reminded her
of her grandpa,

59
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:40,232
And I think I could use that
to at least get her top off.

60
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:42,444
You're a hell of an educor,
of her g bob.A,

61
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:43,560
I do it for them.

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,944
So you, uh, are you ready
for your interview?

63
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:53,472
So ready. I can answer
any questions about our classes,

64
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,014
About the hospital--I even
took the time to memorize

65
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,185
Personal facts about
each of my professors.

66
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,514
So bring it.

67
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,509
Well, there's really
only one question.

68
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:03,652
Why do you wantto be a doctor?

69
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,119
You've never been to maine,

70
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,140
And you were college roommates
with michael bolton.

71
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:12,021
Yes, and the latter
fuels most of my anger.

72
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:14,560
I'd like you to come back
with a better answer,

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,510
And if you find you can't
come up with a better answer,

74
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,793
Then please know I'm going to
make it my personal mission

75
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:23,657
To drum you out of this med school.
But you said this was just a meaningless charade.

76
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:26,267
Not for you. Get out.

77
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:28,469
(whispers)
stupid michael bolton.

78
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,744
Hey, buddy.
Not your buddy.

79
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,878
Whatevs, bro.
Also not your bro.

80
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,435
Mmm. Once again,
it's you versus me--

81
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,336
Smarts versus nepotism
for the keynote speaker.

82
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,785
Let the battle begin.

83
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:46,189
There's no battle.
This is something I want,

84
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,420
So I'm gonna crush you.
Yeah, well, good luck, 'cause I got skills.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,396
Check it.

86
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,983
Swish.

87
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:58,952
Hey, drew.
You know how we get hot

88
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:03,211
Over gross and disgusting things?
Yes, and hello, dr. Reid, who I barely know.

89
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,156
'sup, freak?
Hi.

90
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,343
Anyway, check it out.

91
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:09,797
Mr. Warshal passed his kidney stone.
Oh, that's hot.

92
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,864
F.Y.I., that's like passing
a bowling ball through a straw.

93
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,558
They say it's actually
a lot like giving birth.

94
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,229
Super pumped, by the way.
Super pumped.

95
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,703
So I'm taking you
to dinner tonight.

96
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,508
Did you bring anything less bloody tohange into?
Why?

97
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,094
I don't know.
It's a nice place.

98
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:25,533
It wouldn't kill you
to dress up once in a while.

99
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,664
Pretty girl.
You're a pretty girl.

100
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:31,357
I am a pretty girl.

101
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:34,721
Okay, guys.
So nine years ago,

102
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,635
Joseph was my first
appendectomy patient.

103
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,301
Since then,
some scar tissue has formed,

104
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,212
So we're gonna
clear that right up.

105
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,892
Joseph, my old friend,
we'll take care of you.Med,

106
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,122
But first,
you gotta give me what need.

107
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:48,060
<i>Bonjour, dr. Turk.
Ça va bien?</i>

108
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,414
Ha ha!
Brother speaks french.

109
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,212
That's a romance language,
y'all!

110
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,794
Anyway, it says here
that we're delaying surgery

111
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,618
Due to topical irritation
near the incision site.

112
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,914
If you guys will excuse me 
for a second, that'd be great.

113
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:04,499
Dude's a goner.
I see it in his eyes.

114
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,007
He's haitian.
It's a poisonwood berry burn.

115
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,693
How do you know?
Trust me, I know.

116
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:11,225
Boy george!

117
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,797
If you're right, you could seal
the deal for keynote speaker.

118
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,471
Mm. Too little, too late.

119
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:18,410
My fam just donated
another m.R.I. Thingy.

120
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,522
Joseph, we're gonna
solve this puzzle,

121
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,692
And in thanks, you'll say...

122
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:23,997
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

123
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,880
Merci beaucoup! (laughs)

124
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,551
Incredible.
Uh, dr. Turk?

125
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,581
Yes?
I think I know what's wrong.

126
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,665
It's a reaction to the acidic
black poisonwood berry.

127
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,608
They're common on joseph's
home island of haiti--
home island of haiti.

128
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,263
Damn, I was just going
to say that.

129
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:41,725
Keep it up, drew. Catches like
this could save someone's life.

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,470
Dr. Cox? I know why
I want to be a doctor.

131
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,774
I want to use my experience
to make the kind of catches

132
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:56,716
That save lives, To give people
a chance to live--

133
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:57,684
Hold that thought.

134
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,859
Time of death-- 4:23 p..

135
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,275
(lucy) oh.

136
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,733
I am very, uh...

137
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,198
His middle name is ulysses.

138
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:20,148

www.assic7ed.com

140
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:34,436
'sup, holmes?
Don't call me "holmes."

141
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,138
Actually, I like "holmes."
I'll allow it.

142
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,707
What are you doing?
Oh, just surfing the web,

143
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,103
Watching all
the white coat speeches,

144
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:43,020
Cherry-picking the best parts for mine.
Solid plan.

145
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,083
Hey, drew.

146
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,932
Turns out you were right about
the haitian berry reaction.

147
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,918
<i>I guess your diagnosis
wasn't rash after all.</i>

148
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,718
See, j.D.? I told you
they wouldn't laugh.

149
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,408
Genius, man.

150
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:05,771
You lalow at first, then
the white coat thing comes up,

151
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,139
And boom!
You turn into a gunner.

152
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,968
Wh--I'm not a gunner.

153
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:12,956
(scoffs) please.
Always got the right answer,

154
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,401
Being all helpful with
that island berry dude.

155
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,871
Dude,
we are exactly the same.

156
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:18,832
<i>We...</i>

157
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:21,116
Are not the same.

158
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,752
You're a selfish, petty child

159
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,518
Who would screw over
anybody to get ahead.

160
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:27,719
Like you did with roger?

161
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,697
<i>The second-best dentist
at a run-down strip mall.</i>

162
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:32,163
<i>You get it.</i>

163
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,669
I followed him.
He called his folks crying.

164
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,539
It was awesome.

165
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,100
It's like looking
in a mirror, holmes.

166
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,060
(grunts)

167
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,590
Ahem.

168
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,018
Dr. Cox?

169
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:54,533
(grunts)

170
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:59,421
I've done some soul-searching,
and I have a new answer.

171
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,285
T me prep for
the verbal brilliance

172
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,887
That is surely headed
my way.

173
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,935
Ha. Proceed.

174
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,344
I want to become a doctor

175
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:10,099
So I can help people
who can't help themselves.

176
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,837
Lame.
When my grandmother was ill--

177
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:14,449
Boo!
See, dr. Quinn was a medicine woman--

178
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,135
Stop. Now this is when I would
normally launch into a rant.

179
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,893
But I've already told you
what the consequences are

180
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,891
If you don't come up
with an acceptable answer

181
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:22,840
Prior to the ceremony.

182
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,373
Right now you've got
four strikes on you.

183
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:28,731
And even in the adjusted
lucy bennett 5-strike system

184
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,809
That I recently established
to accommodate

185
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,839
All major underachievers--
go ahead and take a second

186
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,567
And be happy that something
was named after you--

187
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,879
Ya still need to ce up
with something better.

188
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,110
One more pathetic,
clichéd answer and you're gone.

189
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,803
That was kind of a rant.

190
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:48,018
Hey, why did you guys
want to become doctors?

191
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:50,128
Oh, actually,
I didn't want to be a doctor.

192
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:53,779
I wanted to be a gymnast.
But I was chesty for my age,

193
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,624
And I had no balce
because when I was 9,

194
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,153
My cousin jammed a piece
of uncooked pasta in my ear.

195
00:08:58,353 --> 00:08:59,844
So the first time I went
on the balance beam,

196
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:01,873
I fell off and broke
my bajingo bone.

197
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:05,707
So really I became a doctor
because my parents made me.

198
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,133
How about you, dr. Mahoney?

199
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,865
I like scabs.
(mouths word)

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,275
Hey, drew,
want to come over tonight

201
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,390
And watch one
of those survival shows

202
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,855
And root forhe guy to die?
Tonight's not a good night, denise.

203
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,436
(elevator bell dings)

204
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:24,659
Hey, work buddy.
Hey.

205
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,517
You have a sec?

206
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:27,493
Yeah.
What do you want to do?

207
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,807
You want to play
a quick "hide the saltine"?

208
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,161
Maybe "giant black doctor"?

209
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:33,830
Damn, those never sounded dirty with j.D.
Yes, they did.

210
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,730
Oh.
Actually, I was hoping
I could get a lile advice.

211
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,747
(imitating woman)
tell mama yo' problems, baby.
I'm having relationship issues
with drew.

212
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,035
(normal voice) I know...
Just what to do.

213
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,283
Great. I'm out.

214
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,958
Okay, so he made a comment
about wanting you to look nice,

215
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,834
And then you blew him off and mocked him.
Yeah, called him a girl.

216
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,174
Oh, fantastic. Okay.

217
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:55,103
Uh, does drew ever do
anything nice for you?.

218
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:59,562
And do you ever doanything for him?
Oh, no. Who wants to travel down that road?

219
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:01,825
Denise, like it or not,
you're in a relationship.

220
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,229
Sometimes you have to do things you
 don't want to do,

221
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,470
Like dressing nice
or, in my case,

222
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,481
Going to the zoo twice a month.
I still don't know why j.D.

223
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,092
Is so obsessed
with those damn penguins.

224
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:12,638
It's because they look
like little formal people.

225
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:15,819
They're--they'r. We like tohink 
turk, if you're out, then stay out.

226
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:19,178
Fine!
So to make drew happy,

227
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,985
I have to start wearing
tutus and prom dresses?

228
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,877
That would look adorable,
but no.

229
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:25,978
Just throw on something sexy
once in a while, you know?

230
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,332
Show him you care.

231
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,107
(high-pitched british accent)
anyone fancy a swim?

232
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,218
(laughs) what?
That's how they sound.

233
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,114
<i>(laughing) that is
the way they sound.</i>

234
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,650
Where are you going?

235
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,632
Hey, cole, you know
how when we make love,

236
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,612
I can't look into your eyes
because they're so empty

237
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,735
And soulless, so I just
cover them with my hands?

238
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,842
Uh, yeah, it's cool.
I can see through your fingers.

239
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:52,002
Well, I can get past that

240
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:54,090
If you'll be real
with me just once.

241
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,706
Why do you want to be a doctor?
Why the hell not?

242
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,477
Now that's a good answer.
How could that be a good answer?

243
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,628
Because he meant it.

244
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,506
What's up, chiefs?

245
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:07,414
(imitates explosion)
I hope the school has insurance,

246
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:08,350
'cause my keynote speech

247
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,754
Is gonna blow the roof off this mother!
You, son, are a very odd little squid.

248
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:16,299
(laughs)
oh, hey, wait. I want to talk to you.

249
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,534
Your academic record is impeccable,

250
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:21,287
And dr. Turk told me about your catch

251
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,920
With the poisonwood berry burn.

252
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,893
You are our choice as keynote speaker

253
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,800
For the white coat ceremony.
Oh! Congratulations.

254
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,967
It's tantamount to getting
half off on a cup of soup.

255
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,825
<i>Who knows why we do
the things we do?</i>

256
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:37,504
<i>Sometimes we're just trying
to make someone else happy.</i>

257
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,403
So you think that outfit is sexy?
Yeah.

258
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,033
'cause I'm free-boobin' it.

259
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,816
<i>Other times we leave people
searching for explanations.</i>

260
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:49,949
I-I don't want to be
the keynote speaker.

261
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,703
But thanks.

262
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,815
Well, that's disappointing.

263
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,103
Hmm. I was gonna say,
"who cares?"

264
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:03,422
<i>But in our weakest moments,
it's all about jealousy.</i>

265
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,106
Hey, dr. Turk, I need to
show you something on the web.

266
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,177
Is it a cat doing something
a human would do?

267
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,579
'cause if it is, I'm in.
Mm, something with drew.

268
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:15,364
And a cat?
No. Just look. This is from ten years ago, dude.

269
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,490
<i>(man) that dream
is finally realized,</i>

270
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,943
<i>And as doctors... (grunts)</i>

271
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:23,714
<i>(microphone feedback whines)
this ceremony is a joke, okay?</i>

272
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:26,936
<i>I'm better than all you fools,
and you guys, too--hey!</i>

273
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:27,991
<i>I have something to say!</i>

274
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,284
<i>I don't need to be
keynote speaker! Okay?</i>

275
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,190
<i>You don't deserve
these coats!</i>

276
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,084
<i>You don't deserve
these coats, okay?</i>

277
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,511
<i>You better rognize!</i>

278
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,128
Have you showed this
to anybody?

279
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,434
<i>(lucy)
still, nothing's as painful</i>

280
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:41,769
<i>As hiding from the past.</i>

281
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:47,772
Hey, drew! "you better recognize"?
It's something people said in the '90s.

282
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:49,088
Cool people?

283
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,818
No.

284
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:57,428
(woman) recognize!

285
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,106
(all) recognize!

286
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,839
Yes, hello.

287
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,762
It's me.

288
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,305
(under breath)
how could this be any worse?

289
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:11,401
(crying) scientists
taught horses to talk,

290
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:14,958
And it turns out because we've
ridden them all these years,

291
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,748
They don't like humans!

292
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:20,054
(sobbing)

293
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:22,734
Ohh. I don't even want
to think about it.

294
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,184
What the hell's wrong
with cole?

295
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,734
<i>Drew.
Doctors are much more than just physicians.</i>

296
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,375
<i>They can be mentors...
Come with me.</i>

297
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,306
<i>Disciplinarians...
Come with me!</i>

298
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:36,682
Aah! Aah! Aah!

299
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,297
<i>Even fashion advisors.</i>

300
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,485
Come with me.

301
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:41,977
I'm with a patient.

302
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:46,468
(scoffs)
dementia? Please.

303
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:48,399
Don't bring that weak sauce
in here.

304
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,834
He'll never know you're gone.
Fine. I'll just take
my jacket off,

305
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,021
Put it over the I.V. Stand,

306
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,995
And he'll probably think
it's still me.
Sweet.

307
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:59,713
Let's see what we have. Mm.

308
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,173
Oh, you definitely need
my blue eyes for this one

309
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:05,256
And my pregnancy boobs
for this one.

310
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:07,605
Honestly, if I could give up
five years of my life

311
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,598
To keep these bad boys,
I would, you know,

312
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,119
As long as I had a guarantee
that I'd live until,

313
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,302
Like, my 80s.
Yeah, you should bring that up to god

314
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:18,179
When he grants you your magic boobs.
Oh, in my head, it wasn't god. It was a genie. Oh, yes.

315
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,213
And we're gonna need to figure
out what to do with these.

316
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:22,997
Wow. You're like the sister
I never wanted.

317
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:26,683
Aw! Oh, really?(chuckles)
 I'm not doing any of this.

318
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,989
That is what the ugly duckling
always says in the movies,

319
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,297
But then she
takes her glasses off,

320
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:33,813
And everyone thinks she's beautiful.
Did--did you just call me an uy duckling?

321
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:36,373
Oh, look. There's lucy.
Hey, lucy.

322
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,443
D you see drew's video?
What video?

323
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,335
Come on!
Too bad about your boy drew.

324
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,363
But no worries.
I'll pick up the slack.

325
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,311
I already wrote
the beginning of my speech.

326
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:48,659
So I open up with a line
from the movie "malice"--

327
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,102
(gruff voice) "you ask me if I
have a god complex? I am god!"

328
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,232
(normal voice)
boom! We're in.
Yeah, you damn sure are.

329
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,082
I don't think the lock
works on that door,

330
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,766
So if he tries to get out,
subdue him.

331
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:04,247
Sleeper hold or full nelson?
Dealer's choice.

332
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:06,396
I'll see what els right.
Fair enough.

333
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:10,671
Come out if you want to, boy.
Daddy's waitin'.

334
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,009
Why am I scrubbing in
again?

335
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,605
The o.R. Is a safe place.

336
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,933
Nobody's gonna yell
"recognize" at you in here.

337
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,334
Can I ask you a question?

338
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:22,345
Why do white people
ruin everything?

339
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:24,524
I only got to say
"fo shizzle" for a week.

340
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,564
A week! And what's up
with you and that video?

341
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:30,284
The psychologists called it
"an unbalanced act."

342
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,286
But I don't care
about that video.

343
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:34,226
I just hate that it
reminds me of who I was.

344
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,921
What are the three
categories of presentation

345
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,970
In crohn's disease?
Stricturing, penetrating and inflammatory.

346
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,148
Sorry, dr. Reynolds. Looks like
nobody else studied. (laughs)

347
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,015
(lowers voice)
psst. Little help?

348
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:52,962
Thanks. (normal voice) oh!
This kid's got a cheat sheet!

349
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,764
That doesn't seem fair to
the rest of us. I'm just sayin'.

350
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,309
I pulled every dirty trick
in the book,

351
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,945
And I still didn't get
chosen as keynote speaker.

352
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,847
<i>That honor went to eric puritsky.
And as doctors... (grunts)</i>

353
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,299
Let me get this straight.
You turned down keynote speaker

354
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,319
Because you're worried
you're becoming that guy again?

355
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,628
I think m already there.

356
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,826
Huh.

357
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,896
Okay. Thank you so much
for letting me dress you up.

358
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,653
I really needed some closure
on the whole makeover thing.

359
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,700
Okay, now take your glasses off,
let that hair down

360
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,235
And act like you don't know
how pretty you are.

361
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:28,142
<i>(slow jazz saxophone playing)</i>

362
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:40,854
(gasps)

363
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,956
There it is! Mm!

364
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,559
What is with the sad face?
(glasses clatter)

365
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,561
Dr. Cox is still in my head

366
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:49,509
About this whole "why do you
want to be a doctor?" thing.

367
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,002
I just--I can't think
of the answer

368
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,202
That he wants, you know?

369
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,285
And you don't think your amazing
new look will take care of that?

370
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,740
I really don't.

371
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:03,174
Then maybe you should stop
looking for the perfect answer

372
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:05,485
And just tell him
what you actually think.

373
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,634
You see that, drew?
That's scar tissue.

374
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:13,523
Nine years ago
when joseph came to me,

375
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,900
I popped out his appendix
and screwed up the closure.

376
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,365
I was so focused
on the abdomen

377
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:21,066
That I blew the cosmesis
of the incision.

378
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,287
Nowadays I know better,

379
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,578
And I can fix it without
making the same mistake.

380
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,019
And because of that,
I don't have to beat myself up

381
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,108
Over something that
happened a long timago.

382
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,932
So what are you gonna do,
drew?

383
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:38,446
(monitor beeping steadily)

384
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:42,115
I'm gonna scrub out.

385
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:43,753
Hey.

386
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,299
I saw that video. Crazy.

387
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,738
Yeah. It's like my own personal
"don't tase me, bro!"

388
00:17:49,454 --> 00:17:51,281
That's why you've been weird, huh?
Pretty much.

389
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:52,745
I thought it was about me,

390
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,206
'cause I wouldn't dress
all girly-gay for you.

391
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:58,026
What? No. I mean,
I guess I'd like to see you

392
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,383
Like that some time, but...

393
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:04,615
I would never ask you
to do that.

394
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,747
I gotta go.

395
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,877
<i>(drew) why do I want
to be a doctor?</i>

396
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,593
(man) ? the sun won't shine ?

397
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,362
Recognize!
Recognize!

398
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,209
<i>Because the road sure as hell isn't easy...
(man) recognize.</i>

399
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,814
<i>And there always seems to be
something standing in your way.</i>

400
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:27,935
(snoring)
? and my plans go awry ?

401
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:31,199
<i>Sometimes it's even yourself.</i>

402
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:33,612
Dr. Cox.

403
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,170
Oh! Dear god.

404
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,133
I don't have
your pfect answer.

405
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,307
At first I thought it was
to make my family proud,

406
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,736
And then I thought
it was about saving lives,

407
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,895
And for one second,
I thought it was a chance

408
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,729
To get closer
to dr. Sanjay gupta,

409
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,624
Who is a beautiful indian man,
and I've never visited

410
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:53,649
That continent romantically,
if you know what I mean.
Unfortunately, I do.

411
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:57,884
Anyway, the truth is
I can't pick just one reason.

412
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,835
Oh, my god.
That's the answer.

413
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,519
I want to be a doctor
for all those reasons

414
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,858
And a million more that I
haven't even thought of yet.

415
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,412
That's not bad.
Come on. Let's go.

416
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,622
We're gonna be late
for the white coat ceremony.

417
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,914
Ooh, plus I look super cute
in white.

418
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,456
Now you ruined it.

419
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:23,875
Luckily, we're surrounded
by amazing individuals,

420
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,013
Talented faculty,

421
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:27,948
Dedicated mentors,

422
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:32,958
Outstanding students
who all strive for excellence.

423
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,310
? and every time
my heart will sing ?

424
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,585
And then there's
the new friends

425
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:42,044
Who make it all
a little easier to handle.

426
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:47,572
So, uh, in closing, I'd like
to give a simple response

427
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:51,267
To dr. Cox's question--
why do I want to be a doctor?

428
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,210
Well... Because...

429
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:57,142
Doctors give people
second chances.

430
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,590
And we all deserve
a second chance.

431
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,370
You better recognize.

432
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,522
(laughter)

433
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,469
(cheering)

434
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:13,128
(drew speaks indistinctly)

435
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,255
Hey, I know how you're really
mad at the internet right now.

436
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,185
Well, it taketh away,
but it also giveth.

437
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,366
(typing on keyboard)

438
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,816
<i>(cole) and meet the crew!
You're welcome.</i>

439
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:30,790
<i>We got styles, tricky,
lil' tricky,</i>

440
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,706
<i>My man boots...
Whoo!</i>

441
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,638
<i>And me--cole fusion.
Are you ready?</i>

442
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,863
<i>'cause this is happenin'!</i>

443
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,797
<i>T's do it, boys!
Whoo!</i>

444
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:42,546
<i>(all cheering
and shouting indistinctly)</i>

445
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:45,209
<i>(engine revving)</i>

446
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,343

00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:50,482
<i>Oh!</i>

448
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:52,238
<i>Oh!</i>

449
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,647
<i>(crying) hey! Don't just stand
there, man! Help me up!</i>

450
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,511
<i>Is my hair still cool?</i>

451
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,694
I forgive you, internet.

452
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,893
<i>Turn it off! Come on! Hey,
turn that off! Get it away!</i>
