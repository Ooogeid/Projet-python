1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:02,535
<i>Life's great.</i>

2
00:00:02,617 --> 00:00:05,642
<i>With the janitor fired,
I can walk the halls without fear.</i>

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,211
<i>I don't even hesitate
around corners any more.</i>

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,530
<i>But maybe I should.</i>

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,703
I-can-feel-a-little-JD-five?

6
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,056
No thanks, Todd.

7
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:16,929
But I can and I want my five.

8
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,568
<i>Plus, Elliot and I were better
friends than we've been in a long time.</i>

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,977
<i>We were going to movies.</i>

10
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,974
- I really liked that.
- Oprah produced it.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,021
<i>We were going out to dinner.</i>

12
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,784
My salmon was great.

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,041
You know, Oprah owns that restaurant.

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,618
<i>And on weekends, when I had Sam,
she even came over for breakfasts.</i>

15
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,998
I could make pancakes,
or we could have...

16
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,357
Oprah O's!

17
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:41,970
And check this out.

18
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:44,758
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

19
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:46,616
That's funny.

20
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,106
That's it?

21
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,917
Not only did I rig this box,
but I got...

22
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,225
Whitney in payroll
to tape her Oprah voice.

23
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:54,557
I've been working on this joke
for over a week,

24
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:56,811
and all you can muster
is a little chuckle?

25
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,745
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

26
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:00,510
Stop!

27
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:02,109
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

28
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:02,998
Broken.

29
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:04,337
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

30
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:05,280
Stop it!

31
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,453
<i>- Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>
- Stop, stupid box!

32
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,353
OK. So, I'm going
to add a little pressure now, sir.

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,720
It's allright, it's perfectly natural.

34
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,419
That was you.

35
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,842
Yeah, I know.
But it's still perfectly natural.

36
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,100
Lovely.

37
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:28,602
It's your own fault.

38
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,750
You're the only attending who sticks
around for an entire exam

39
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,600
when he calls for a surgical consult.

40
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:33,563
Why is that?

41
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,330
No reason.

42
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,822
Oh! So you don't want to say.
That's cool.

43
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:38,603
I know you know hate
that I call Carla "baby" all the time,

44
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,837
so I'll just call you "baby"
until you tell me.

45
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:42,416
- Does that sound good, baby?
- Don't do that.

46
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:43,683
Oh, what's the matter, baby?

47
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:46,357
Look, surgeons always want
to slice people open

48
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:47,709
whether it's the best option or not.

49
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,767
No disrespect,
but you're just not that bright.

50
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:52,269
You have no idea
how to do anything else.

51
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,426
Unfortunately, sick people are also
very very stupid

52
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,445
and will almost always
agree to anything

53
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,307
that a blood-letting corpse carpenter
such as yourself tells them.

54
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:03,055
I simply stay in the room to make sure
they make the right choice.

55
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,830
So you don't trust me?

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,880
Uh, that's right.

57
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:07,438
That is an easier way to say it.

58
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:08,791
Baby!

59
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:10,458
Baby!

60
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,919
There he is, right on schedule.

61
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,121
<i>Maybe it was
the free muffins for life,</i>

62
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:17,752
<i>but Dr Kelso
still hangs out here every day.</i>

63
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:19,017
Morning, everybody!

64
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,686
Morning, Bob!

65
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,339
I'm like Norm in this bitch.

66
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,840
<i>Ted finally said
what we were all thinking.</i>

67
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,593
Why are you spending your retirement
hanging around the place you use to work?

68
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,701
It's so sad.

69
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:36,160
By comparison,
it almost makes my life seem...

70
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,206
No.

71
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,065
Still sad.

72
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,323
Yeah.

73
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,323
Seriously, don't you have
anything better to do?

74
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,517
Come on, people.

75
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,195
I've got tons of stuff going on.

76
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,424
I golf,
I play gin with the boys.

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,041
In fact, I am just here
to stock up on muffins.

78
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,556
Donnie, four roadies please.

79
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:08,449
Today, Enid and I are leaving to go
spend a weekend in wine country.

80
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,491
Of course, you know how Enid complains.

81
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,962
Any place I take her is "whine" country.

82
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,184
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

83
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,006
Anyway, keep my table warm.

84
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,086
Adios.

85
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,257
What are you doing?

86
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:27,153
That's the sound I hear in my head
whenever people leave.

87
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,574
Whatever.

88
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:31,555
I will see you after work.

89
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,733
You should really hesitate before
going around corners.

90
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,768
I was thinking that earlier.

91
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:45,021
Hey, since that Chief Doctor person
that fired me is gone, I'm back!

92
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,711
Yay!

93
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,378
I knew you'd react that way.

94
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:53,350
And since Jimmy, the overly touching
orderly, got his job back too,

95
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,845
I took the liberty of telling him
how much you missed him.

96
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:58,700
I missed you too.

97
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,286
- What's new ?
- Nothing, man.

98
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,518
You seem a little clinched.

99
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,514
Found a treasure-trove.

100
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,812
Where's the gold?

101
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,507
Take my little pickaxe,
and get to it.

102
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,999
- OK, don't. No, no, no.
- Wiggle worm...

103
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,656
- ...This is wiggle worm.
- I'll get my own gold, thank you.

104
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,008
OK, welcome back.

105
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,386
Why ?

106
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,359
See you later, buddy.

107
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,780
Hey. Have a good one, guys.

108
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:34,024
No, wait.

109
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,104
Something's wrong.

110
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,017
What is it?

111
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,650
It's Dr Cox.

112
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,581
He's all up in my business and...

113
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,301
Dr Cox!

114
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,090
Hang in there, bear.

115
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,705
How did you know
that he was hurting?

116
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,411
Did you like...
hear it in his voice?

117
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,662
With Turk, I can always
feel it from his soul,

118
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,887
like a wave of heat.

119
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,928
Are you going to make a joke
about how gay that sounds?

120
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,536
Definitely.
I just don't have the words yet.

121
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:58,880
Well, let me know.

122
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,347
Hello, folks.
I'm Dr Christopher Turk.

123
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,886
You're right so far.
Continue.

124
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,909
Mr Halford, Dr Cox tells me
that you're in need of a new kidney.

125
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,013
And I understand your wife
wants to be the donor.

126
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,832
So, what do you say we run
some tests and see if she's a match?

127
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:16,623
OK?

128
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,577
Dr Cox said you are
the best surgeon here, so I'm fine.

129
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,431
Right on.
See you guys later.

130
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,219
I don't understand.
If I'm the best surgeon here,

131
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,167
how come you're always
looking over my shoulder?

132
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,500
Oh, give me a break, would you?

133
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:31,828
Saying someone is
"the best surgeon"

134
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:35,378
is like saying someone is the
smartest cast member of <i>The Hills</i>.

135
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:36,168
Let's face it.

136
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:39,928
It's just not that tough to float
to the top of the surgical toilet.

137
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,582
Take your fellow-cutter,
The Todd.

138
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,200
Now, he's also
deemed competent enough

139
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,312
to perform a kidney transplant
on that gentleman right there.

140
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,925
Yet... observe.

141
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,503
Say, Todd?
What's for lunch today?

142
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,776
I'm not sure, bro.

143
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,628
This time, I'll just move my lips
as if I was speaking

144
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:01,115
and his tiny surgeon brain
will tell him

145
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:04,511
the glass is now just too darn thick
to hear through.

146
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,485
Can't hear you
through the glass, dude!

147
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,578
- Wow!
- Wow what?

148
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,459
It's true, you're back!

149
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,015
I'm so happy.

150
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:29,915
You don't look happy.

151
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,859
I don't smile a whole lot.
And lately when I try to, it hurts.

152
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,920
But trust me. I'm happy.

153
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,752
Return of the king, huh?

154
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:38,708
Yeah.

155
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:42,419
I can't tell you how much
I've missed having you around...

156
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,936
Jimmy, I'm really not
comfortable with that.

157
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,147
Jimmy, downstairs.

158
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,678
No problem.
See you guys later.

159
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,036
I'm gonna have to teach you
his command words.

160
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,493
Awesome!

161
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm starving,
there's a Coffee Bucks up there.

162
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,572
- Let's grab something.
- I got it.

163
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:03,172
The only way that moment you had
with Turk could have been any gayer

164
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,991
would be if you two went home
and actually made love afterwards.

165
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:10,666
No. Elliot, stop!

166
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:15,282
You know I automatically picture any
visual image someone puts in my head.

167
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,591
You can't do that, it's embarassing.

168
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,489
<i>But not as embarassing as this.

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,965
Dr Kelso?

170
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,374
Aren't you supposed
to be on vacation?

171
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:25,564
Crap.

172
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:28,898
Thanks for tagging in for me, Teddy.

173
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,717
I really need to ease myself back in.

174
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:33,237
Mopping is not like riding a bike,
that's for sure.

175
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,875
No problem.

176
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:36,987
Hey, Dr Turk.

177
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,834
Did you see who's back?

178
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,392
- Hey.
- I know, right?

179
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,919
Oh, that sucks.

180
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,021
What?

181
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:47,500
- It's my kidney transplant patient...
- I apologize.

182
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,363
I said "What?" but I meant
"Move it along".

183
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,382
By the way, what happened to the
janitor they hired to replace you?

184
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,321
We're going to have
to let you go, Marv.

185
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:03,983
But, stiff upper lip.

186
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,493
- I'm sorry, Dr Itor.
- Call me Jan.

187
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,522
I heard he quit.

188
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,951
Mopping's hard.

189
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,082
You're working against
yourself there. Go faster.

190
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,995
I bet you can't wait
to call all your friends

191
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,932
and tell them how pathetic I am.

192
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,242
Actually, sir, we young people
are more into texting these days.

193
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:29,584
JD, be sensitive.

194
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:32,505
Don't act like you're at a ping pong
match between a ninja and Bigfoot.

195
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,843
I know that made no sense, but
he's totally there now in his head.

196
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,693
Look at his eyes.

197
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:42,258
Look at that.

198
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,171
He should be out for a while.

199
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,914
I just have lot more
free time than I thought.

200
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,805
Enid and I were going to travel
all over the country,

201
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,183
but we don't have cash right now.

202
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,327
Elliot, stop doing that!

203
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,230
Who won the ping pong game?

204
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,364
The sasquatch.

205
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,079
Then Turk and I took him
to a carnival to celebrate.

206
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,544
Man, that hairy bastard
loves funnel cake!

207
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:06,514
Amazing.

208
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:08,538
<i>Now it's time to split</i>

209
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,813
<i>before he shares something so personal
that we're trapped here forever.</i>

210
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,610
We should probably get going.

211
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,350
Last thing I expected was

212
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:18,708
to be an old man with no idea
what the hell to do with his life.

213
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,418
Tom, I'm sorry but Darcy
was not a kidney match.

214
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,696
So we need to get you
on the transplant list right away 

215
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,292
so we can find a new donor.

216
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:29,155
Wrong.

217
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,533
You didn't even hear
what I told them.

218
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:32,668
What did you tell them?

219
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,524
- Well, I basically told...
- Wrong!

220
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:36,304
Great news, folks.

221
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:39,201
I had occasion to speak
with Dr Quinlan here.

222
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:43,292
Anyway.

223
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:46,340
Do you see his kidney patient,
Mr Brinkley?

224
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:50,710
It turns out that his wife
is not a donor match for him, either.

225
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,647
And in the coincidence of the day,
she is a match for you sir.

226
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,226
And you, Mrs Halford,
are a match for him.

227
00:09:57,317 --> 00:10:00,972
We do the old switcheroo,
and everybody wins.

228
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,257
So when would I get my new kidney?

229
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:06,250
Mr Brinkley has been in dialysis
for quite some time,

230
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:08,555
so Darcy, whe're going to have
to get him your kidney

231
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,305
 just as soon as possible.
And Tom,

232
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,706
we'll schedule your surgery
for next week.

233
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,524
Look Dr Kelso,
leaving any job is tough.

234
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:20,027
I-- I remember when my cousin
got fired from her job,

235
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:22,646
she was so depressed because
it was the only salon in town,

236
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,563
and all she ever wanted
to do was cut hair.

237
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,235
Here it comes.

238
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:30,249
<i>Both Dr Kelso and I had heard enough
of Elliot inspirational stories

239
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,105
to know that they invariably end
with someone killing himself.

240
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,351
But, then she moved.

241
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:35,779
<i>Uh. Maybe not.</i>

242
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,442
To a better place.

243
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,845
<i>Or maybe so.</i>

244
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,482
Look, give yourself a little time.

245
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,052
You'll figure out how
to be happy, I promise.

246
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:47,667
<i>I'm never ready for
half the stuff that people say.</i>

247
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,861
<i>Whether it's an answer
you didn't expect.</i>

248
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,771
So how did you get hired back?

249
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:52,931
I didn't.

250
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,047
Technicly, I don't work here.

251
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,146
<i>A shocker from a patient.</i>

252
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,496
We've been talking, and...

253
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,736
We don't want to trade
kidneys with the Brinkleys.

254
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:05,658
We'll go on the transplant list.

255
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:08,761
<i>Or this.</i>

256
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:09,875
Thanks.

257
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:13,162
I really appreciate you two
trying to cheer me up.

258
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:14,995
<i>Actually, that wasn't unexpected.</i>

259
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,456
<i>But, this was.</i>

260
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,298
Well, it's nice to see
you two dating again.

261
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,455
<i>It was time
to demand an explanation.</i>

262
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,089
Why would you think we're dating?

263
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,356
Why won't they do the kidney switch?

264
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,771
If you weren't hired back,
why are you here working?

265
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:35,806
I'm not. You are.

266
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,825
JD and I are just friends, Dr Kelso.

267
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,702
I mean, we just like
hanging out together.

268
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:45,052
We rent movies, go on hikes.

269
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,901
On Sunday nights,
we do our laundry together.

270
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,933
Did you know that Elliot's
granny panties

271
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,899
are actually her granny's panties.

272
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:53,491
It's just one pair, JD,
excuse me for being sentimental.

273
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:58,460
So, basically, you two do everything
a normal couple does except to have sex.

274
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,707
Exactly.

275
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,363
Sounds awesome.

276
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:05,523
Pardon me, I had nine coffees
in two hours. Time to drain.

277
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,010
Oh! It's a new shirt!

278
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,451
Hey, do you ever still
think of me in that way?

279
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,467
What way?

280
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:18,011
You know.
In a sexual way.

281
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:25,667
Sometimes.

282
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,469
Do you ever...
think of me that way?

283
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,146
Sometimes.

284
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,347
Put your shirt back on.

285
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,123
I'm just flipping it
so you can't see the stain.

286
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,488
<i>And then I finally said it.</i>

287
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:45,237
Do you think maybe
we should talk about... us?

288
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,451
Maybe we should.

289
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:51,267
<i>And just like that, it was as if
we were off in our own little world.</i>

290
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,534
My guy needs a kidney now.

291
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,667
Why wouldn't the Halfords say yes?

292
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,036
Because they're in no rush.

293
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,987
Plus, the Halfords
don't know the Brinkleys.

294
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,555
So they don't trust them.

295
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:02,643
We're screwed.

296
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:03,787
Awesome.

297
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,886
In The Todd's world, if anybody
gets screwed, it's a good thing.

298
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,685
Of course it is.

299
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,071
Look, I'm here because I want to be here.

300
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,949
But don't worry.
I'm going to get my job back.

301
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:16,859
Oh, good!

302
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,155
What's your plan?

303
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:19,278
I just told it to you.

304
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,982
I'm here, therefore
I will get my job back.

305
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,747
You're making my head hurt.

306
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:25,140
We both know that's not me.

307
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,745
That's from when you were a baby,
and a marble fountain fell on you.

308
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:30,579
Sometimes, my mom
kept my crib in the driveway.

309
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:31,499
Mine too.

310
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,632
But I live my live
by a very specific credo.

311
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,641
Everything works out for me.

312
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:39,197
There is no way this works out for us.

313
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,043
The Halfords are stubborn people.

314
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,331
I got an idea.

315
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,297
<i>If the Halfords don't trust the
Brinkleys to come through for them,</i>

316
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,320
<i>we can just do
the surgery simultaneously</i>

317
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,017
<i>and take trust out as an issue.</i>

318
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,682
That guy is such a jerk.

319
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,354
Don't worry,
he can't hear me through the glass.

320
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,722
You want me to go first?

321
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:06,528
Elliot, I've never been able
to get over the idea of us.

322
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,473
I'm still crazy about you.

323
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,787
I don't really know
what you want me to say.

324
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,455
Maybe you could tell me
if you feel the same way?

325
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:15,402
Yeah!

326
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,020
Maybe you could say it
without sounding angry.

327
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,537
But, JD, you crushed me.

328
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,137
I mean, I gave you my love,
and you threw it back at my face,

329
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,469
and pretty much scarred
me romanticly.

330
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:27,515
I mean, now I'm doomed to a life
of gravitating to safe boring guys

331
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:28,858
that I don't really love.

332
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,716
And I'm repelled by
the ones I care for deeply.

333
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,642
So, thank you... for that.

334
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,653
Look, if it helps,
you hurt me too.

335
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:36,801
Really?

336
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,335
There were so many times
I wanted to be with you so badly

337
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:40,883
and you shut me down.

338
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:43,538
Like when we first met, huh...

339
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,575
When you wanted to be sex buddies.

340
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,161
Oh yeah, but that's when
I felt work so overwhelming,

341
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,431
- And I...
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

342
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,996
I'm sorry, we've just been down
this road so many times, you know?

343
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,665
Seriously, does even talking about it just
make you hate yourself a little bit?

344
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,656
I can't tell from just doing
the normal amount of hating myself,

345
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:08,926
or if I'm at a slightly
higher level of self-loathing.

346
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,581
You're too hard on yourself.

347
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:11,464
No, I'm not.

348
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:13,532
I'm just stupid and ugly,
and I have a pig face.

349
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,811
JD, we're just back here again
because we're both lonely

350
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:20,609
and neither one of us have had
any physical contact for months.

351
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,336
I've had physical contacts.

352
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,562
With who?

353
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,377
All the energies are in you,
I'm just opening the channel.

354
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:30,595
Here it is.
Here it is.

355
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,950
I'd rather not talk about it.

356
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,039
Looks like everybody got
through with flying colors.

357
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,885
Congratulations there, Gandhi.

358
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:41,423
Your ability to bring people together
is very powerful, much like...

359
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,420
Gandhi.

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,172
That means a lot to me.

361
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,368
Because I'm just so
desperate for your approval.

362
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,682
What-- What's his problem?

363
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,613
Is he still mad at me?

364
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,170
Maybe.

365
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,025
I can't be sure.

366
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,489
The Brinkleys never gave the
Halfords a reason to be skeptical.

367
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:05,289
Life would be so much easier
if everybody just trusted each other.

368
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,856
We have so much history.

369
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,434
- Most of it bad.
- Yeah.

370
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:18,383
How can we ever get past that?

371
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:21,245
- We can't.
- Oh, good. That makes me feel better.

372
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:25,264
But maybe, we could remember
all our pit falls like a road map.

373
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,777
Maybe, this time, we could
avoid all the drama.

374
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,551
We don't have
to be that couple where...

375
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,422
one of us says
they're moving out of town,

376
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,914
the other one have to rush
to the airport to stop them.

377
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:37,431
We don't have to argue about
whether or not we want to break.

378
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,842
You watched the <i>Friends</i>
marathon last night, didn't you?

379
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:41,435
I did. I loved it.

380
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:45,801
The point is, Elliot, you're a lot
stronger than you used to be.

381
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,704
And I've changed too.

382
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,591
I have a beard now.

383
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,312
Do you still let that inner voice
of yours control you?

384
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:56,940
<i>This is getting too serious.
Kick her. Kick her in the head.</i>

385
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:58,261
Not as much.

386
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,030
Paycheck time, everyone!

387
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,016
Come on, Whitney.
I like it when you do it like Oprah.

388
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,272
Fine.

389
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,714
<i>Who wants to get a paycheck?</i>

390
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,897
<i>You got a paycheck,
you got a paycheck.</i>

391
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,588
<i>You got a paycheck!</i>

392
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,598
You got to go, man!

393
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:17,097
Everybody's going to see when
she doesn't have a check for you.

394
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,346
It'll be humiliating.

395
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:23,238
Look, you can't just say things are
going to work out, and then they do.

396
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,206
- That's not how the world...
- Excuse me.

397
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,600
I didn't get mine.

398
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:28,819
Who are you?

399
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,999
I'm the janitor. See?

400
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,752
Actually, I'm the old janitor.
I replaced the janitor that replaced me.

401
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:36,690
So, I'm still in the system.

402
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,480
I'll go get you a check.

403
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:41,092
Didn't mean to cut you off, Ted.
You were saying?

404
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:47,266
Mop it off.
Mop it off.

405
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,592
Mrs Winter, this is Dr Turk.

406
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:55,989
He's going to give you an exam and
explain all your surgical options to you.

407
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,020
One second. Hey!

408
00:17:58,971 --> 00:17:59,981
You're leaving ?

409
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,491
Please, don't make me have second
thoughts by asking very stupid questions.

410
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,329
So what, you trust surgeons now?

411
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,903
No, I trust you.

412
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,717
I know we're talking,

413
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:14,956
but it still feels like
we're being so careful, you know?

414
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,801
We're just scared.

415
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,534
I made so many mistakes in my life
because I was scared.

416
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,786
It's the reason I bailed
when you said "I love you".

417
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,146
- It's the reason...
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

418
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:28,680
OK.

419
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,895
But I am scared of
ending our friendship.

420
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,586
What if I get hurt again?

421
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,091
- What if you pick up a new STD?
- For the last time, that was not an STD!

422
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,446
It was a urinary tract infection,

423
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:41,281
and I got it from
having sex with you in a pond.

424
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,449
<i>Yeah you did!</i>

425
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,051
I tell what else
I don't want to deal with.

426
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,360
All the judgements
from everyone else.

427
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,148
Dr Cox, Jordan.
Even Turk and Carla.

428
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,888
I mean, it's almost enough of
a reason not to do anything.

429
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:55,660
Hogwash!

430
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,488
Excuse me?

431
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,828
That ridiculous
drivel you just said.

432
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:03,718
But who am I to talk?

433
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:09,525
Here I am, eating some kind of a
banana nut sawdust muffin,

434
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,835
and hiding out in this crappy excuse
for a Coffee Bucks.

435
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,398
Who the hell cares
what anybody else thinks?

436
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:25,272
Just look into your heart, and
do whatever the hell makes you happy.

437
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:34,989
That's right, Ted. I'm back.

438
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,442
I love it here.

439
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:37,800
Donnie!

440
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:40,982
Moist.

441
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,559
<i>Elliot and I were tempted
to take Dr Kelso's advice.</i>

442
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,646
<i>Because often when you do it,
it makes you happy.</i>

443
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,560
<i>Things have a way of working out.</i>

444
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:51,772
Actually, I normally
get paid twice this.

445
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:54,480
My mistake.
I'll be right back.

446
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:58,461
<i>But it also occurred to us that
you can have the best intentions,</i>

447
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,721
<i>you still fall back into old habits.</i>

448
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:04,985
Shhh. Get out of here.

449
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:13,255
<i>So I guess, the real answer is
that there is no easy answer.</i>

450
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,320
<i>You just have to go for it, or not.</i>

451
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,320
This seems like a good idea.

452
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,194
Who cares?

453
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:42,216
I'm just going to need
to engage my legs.

454
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,671
Alright.
This is just to brace you.

455
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,501
You're a wizzard.

456
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,544
We're just gonna work this out.

457
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,211
- Let it flaw out.
- Flaw.

458
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,566
- Let it flaw out.
- Flaw.

459
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,171
- You like that, don't you?
- My god, help me. Jimmy, I do.

460
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,352
- There it is, let go.
- Deeper, please.

461
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,169
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
