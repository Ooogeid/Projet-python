00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:02,320
<i>(alarm beeps)
(lucy) I finally figured out</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,707
<i>The key to getting everything
done at medical school--</i>

3
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:10,351
<i>Do a bunch of thgs at once and never sleep.
Hey, dad. Don't have a lot of time for our daily update,</i>

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:13,691
But here goes--
school's hard, dorm's gross,

5
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:16,686
Not really dating,
but I am having my lady needs

6
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:19,072
Tended to
by a handsome young stallion.

7
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:19,886
(laughs)

8
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,281
Wow. Just remembered
who I'm talking to.

9
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,884
Sorry, dad.
But since it's out there,

10
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:26,703
Hot damn, I am in the middle

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:29,727
Of a real sexual awakening
right now. Hmm?

12
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,266
Yeah, that's about enough
for me today, too.

13
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:33,163
Talk to you tomorrow.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,132
Baby, what's up? It's 5:30.

15
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,515
I have 9,000 things to do.
Go back to sleep.

16
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,862
Girl, once you wake up
the troops,

17
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,660
You gotta storm the beach.

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,008
You know what? You are
actually on my "to-do" list.

19
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,024
Yeah.

20
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,652
The iliohypogastric
and ilioinguinal nerves

21
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,153
Innervate the groin region.

22
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:57,756
God, I'm great at study-walking.

23
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,251
Oh, good. Dr. Turk.

24
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,615
I scanned those slides
for your lung lecture.

25
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,278
I e-mailed them to you. Did you
get a chance to check 'em?

26
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:08,629
He's gone, lucy.
He's gone.

27
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:10,569
<i>Yesterday was
dr. Dorian's last day.</i>

28
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,848
<i>Dr. Turk was taking it
pretty hard.</i>

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,789
He done gone to zion.

30
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:25,488
What?

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,431
Hey, turk.

32
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,113
Okay, this is
why pregnancy sucks.

33
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,189
Your stupid name took my head
right to "turkey," because I

34
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,551
Have been craving the hell out
of thanksgiving food all week.

35
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:37,375
This morning I actually pounded
a jar of cranberry sauce

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,236
And me dry stuffing.

37
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:42,398
It was like a holiday, only much, much sadder.
You want to talk about sad--

38
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:45,489
I spent the whole morning moping
around 'cause j.D. Wasn't here.

39
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:49,345
It took me about an hour to get out of it.
Oh, he said to say he misses you.

40
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:51,245
He did?

41
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:51,696
Yeah.

42
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:56,798
(exhales deeply)

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,333
It's okay. It's okay.

44
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,003
He reacted the same way
when he got your muffin basket.

45
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,416
Look, turk, I know that you're
hurting, but you're gonna find

46
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,883
Someone else here
to ride the eagle with.

47
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,526
Elliot, you don't
ride the eagle. You eagle.

48
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,679
<i>You choose "toe or thumb?" you
join "fight club with pillows."</i>

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,980
You and j.D. Had a pillow fight club?
The first rule of pillow fight club--you don't talk--

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,550
Yeah, I get it.
No, I don't think you do. Elliot.

51
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,994
Elliot, please don't say anything.
Hey, turkleton.

52
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,322
I know what it's like
to lose a friend.

53
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:22,539
I lost my good buddy steve
back in korea.

54
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:26,633
Sir, that was a horrible war.
Yes, it was, but I'm talking about

55
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,934
A family trip we tookto the '88.

56
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:31,433
I suggested a wife swap
to steve,

57
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,675
And things got pretty weird.

58
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,238
Yes, it was an amazing night,

59
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,551
But was it worth it
to lose a good friend over?

60
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:40,943
Probably.

61
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,175
Great effort in the sack
last night.

62
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,702
Just remember, when I say,
"I hate you. Don't touch me,"

63
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,734
It's not about you.
It's about all men.

64
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,909
Cool. Crap, I'm a
be late for class.

65
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,925
Drew, wait. There's something
I have to tell you--

66
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:57,239
I'm late, too.

67
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,771
You missed your...

68
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,359
Yeah.

69
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:03,712
Oh, my god.

70
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:05,780
(laughs)

71
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,810
I'm kidding. Your face
looks so dumb right now.

72
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,032
Why would you do that to me?
I'm bored.

73
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:13,336
You're lucky
I vibe on crazy.

74
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:17,471
I hate you. Don't touch me.
Fair enough.

75
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:22,236
At patients
with pancreatic disorders.

76
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:22,937
Shh.

77
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,839
Hey, drew.
Glad you could make it.

78
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:30,247
Sorry I'm late.
You should be sorry as I'm giving all of you murderers

79
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,397
The honor of shadowing me today.
There is no penalty forthcoming,

80
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:35,365
However, as it is
an optional exercise.

81
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,269
Optional?
Hey, man, I gotta cruise.

82
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,806
Bunch of crap to do.
You--you cool here?

83
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,833
Now just a second.
You're leaving?

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,876
Well, what the heck
am I supposed to do?

85
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,209
How will the hospital get by,
for god sake?

86
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,084
(mutters) shut it down.
(electricity powers down)

87
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:50,869
Everyone, shut it down. It's over.
(machine beeping erratically)

88
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:55,220
Stop saving lives.
(laughs) man, you crack me up.

89
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,416
Ugh.
(electricity powers up)

90
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,671
Uh, but for reals,
I tta split.

91
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,824
I met this old cat upstairs

92
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,855
Who's got really painful glaucoma.

93
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:05,357
(singsongy) translation--
crazy-ass government product.

94
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:06,970
(normal voice) yeah,
we'll probably hang out,

95
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,541
Maybe watch
some "benson" reruns.

96
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,451
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

97
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:16,916
Number one, remind me again
why I can't kill him.

98
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,144
His daddy built the hospital.
Fair enough.

99
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,338
All of you remain where you are
for a moment.

100
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,189
I'm going to punch through
a wall.

101
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,648
(thud)

102
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:27,521
Maureen, I e-mailed you

103
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,211
Your bachelorette pictures
this morning.

104
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,922
I would have put them
in the regular mail,

105
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,640
But I think we could
get arrested.

106
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,898
Okay, class,
I want to thank ms. Bennett

107
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:37,707
For her help on this presentation.
Thank you!

108
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:41,596
Not really a stand-and-wave
moment. Here we go.

109
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:43,510
What do you mean they're not
the bachelorette photos?

110
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,874
All right, people, we'll start

111
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,122
With advanced mesothelioma of the lung.
(click)

112
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,776
(students laugh)

113
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,234
Now that's not a lung.
Dr. Turk, please--

114
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:57,043
No, lucy, I think this could be
what we call a teachable moment.

115
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,658
Next up should be

116
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:00,438
Pulmonary fibrosis.

117
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,862
(students laugh)

118
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,130
That ain't pulmonary fibrosis.

119
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,794
That's a woman nibbling
on some panties.

120
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:10,597
(click)
looks like the night took
a dark turn, people.

121
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:13,264
Let's see what's next.
Oh, she's back!

122
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,898
Back in action!
(click)

123
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,585
Oh!
(man) ooh.

124
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,976
You can't do stuff like that
to strangers, woman.

125
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,041
It's not right.
Know. I'm sorry.

126
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,812
He's a human being, lucy.

127
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:28,059
He got 9 bucks, okay?
I made it rain. Move on.

129
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:48,639
You all right?

130
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,255
It was a rough surgerydon't
think the guy's gonna make it.

131
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,925
Oh, that stinks.

132
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,377
Yeah. This is
when I really miss j.D.

133
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:59,549
You know, at work,
he'd see me like this

134
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:00,796
And then try and pick me up.

135
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:03,209
Then I'd point to that doctor
over there and I'd say,

136
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,234
"who does that look like
to you?" and he'd say...
Who?

137
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,934
A japanese laura dern.
How do you not see that?

138
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,178
I can't believe
you get to see j.D. Naked.

139
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:14,840
That was weird.

140
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,361
That's okay.
That's okay, turk.

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,442
I can do this with you.
See that nurse over there?

142
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,307
She looks like
a mexican carrie scott.

143
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,369
Who?

144
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:25,991
Childhood friend.

145
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,951
Yeah, she, uh, joined a cult
and disappeared when she was 16.

146
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:32,151
Oh, my god. That could actually
be her if she got really tan.

147
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,827
Carrie! Carrie scott!

148
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,332
No, not her.

149
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,935
Police are right.
She's probably dead.

150
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:40,008
What were we talking about?
I don't remember.

151
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,171
<i>This morning was
such a disaster.</i>

152
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,174
<i>Maybe my problem is that I've
been trying to do too much.</i>

153
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,977
<i>Mm, I decided to do some
optional shadowing of dr. Cox</i>

154
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:52,013
<i>To get my mind off it.
Dr. Cox, may I ask you a question?</i>

155
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,349
Do you see that shadow?

156
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,770
Over there? Do you see how
it's just quietly standing

157
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,894
Against the wall,
not askingnane questions

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,600
That make me crave the sweet
taste  a hollow-point bullet?

159
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:04,765
That's you--
a dumb, quiet shadow.

160
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,772
Act like it.
You know why you should ignore him?

161
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:09,579
Let's just forget for a second

162
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,368
That you sprained your wrist punching a wall.
Oh, I can explain that. I hate someone.

163
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,318
Miss simmo' platelets
are low,

164
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:19,805
<i>So I don't really think heparin's a good idea.
I'd never met dr. Reid, but she seemed incredible.</i>

165
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,132
<i>She went toe-to-toe
with dr. Cox.</i>

166
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,679
But the bottom line is--
I admitted her, so she's mine.

167
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,430
Fair enough. She's yours.

168
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,358
Thank you. Hmm.

169
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,447
<i>She was amazing
with her patients...</i>

170
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:34,450
You're gonna be just fine, kate.
We'll get the blood work back

171
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,319
And then run a simple test
called a bronchoscopy.

172
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,254
<i>She was a loving wife...</i>

173
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,089
J.D., what's wrong?

174
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,559
Yes, sweetie,
turk misses you, too.

175
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,861
What?

176
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:47,296
I don't--he's wearing scru.

177
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,965
His green ones.

178
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:51,534
<i>And she did it all
while being pregnant.</i>

179
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:54,003
Can you hand me that bedpan?
Thank you.

180
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:55,738
(vomits and coughs)

181
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:59,275
Oh, yeah. Much better.
Take that. Who are you

182
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:01,144
And why are you following me
around and staring at me?

183
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:04,647
<i>I'm lucy. I'm a med student.
Be cool, lucy. Be cool.</i>

184
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,917
And I just have to say, you have
the spirit of a noble warrior,

185
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,720
Which is not to say that
you're not incredibly feminine,

186
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,221
Because clearly you are.

187
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,891
I mean, you're, like,
stupid, frickin' pregnant,

188
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:16,392
But also so skinny.

189
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:20,129
I mean, come on. You're like
a snake that ate a tiny horse.

190
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,966
(laughs) my point is, I'd like
to get to know you better.

191
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,769
Oh, so you're crazy.
Oh, yeah.

192
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,668
Oh, that's cool. I'm
dr. Elliot reid. See you later.

193
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:31,378
Who's got food? Mama needs
a refill! I'm dying here!

194
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:34,849
All right, class, we're looking for evidence
Of disease or abnormality.

195
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,791
Hey, dr. T. I heard one time
they opened up a dude's stomach,

196
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,193
And there was a finger
inside of it.

197
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,595
I mean, think about it.
You're in a lab,

198
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,280
You're a little buzzed,
everything's cool.

199
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,405
Then all of a sudden your
dead guy's flipping you the bird

200
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,533
With another dude's finger.
I mean, what?!

201
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:50,116
Denise, could you please handle
this? I've had a really bad day.

202
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,503
I'd love to.

203
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,766
So... You and me?

204
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,057
We're gonna have
a stupid jar.

205
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,301
Every time you say
something stupid,

206
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,138
We're gonna put a nickel
in that jar.

207
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,180
And when that jar
gets nice and full,

208
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,665
We're gonna take it
and beat you with it.

209
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:06,853
Okay?

210
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,538
Dude.

211
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,702
<i>How much fun is she
in the sack?</i>

212
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,330
More scary than fun.

213
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,249
Look cole, you gotta
dial it down a bit.

214
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,758
School newspaper's
coming out next week,

215
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,267
And they're publishing class rankings.
I thought you were already number one.

216
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,078
That's just with dr. Cox.
These are the real rankings.

217
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,018
Everything counts--grades,
participation, grunt work.

218
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,272
Everyone sees.
Really?

219
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:30,126
Yeah.
Huh. Hey, it's all good. I don't
mind if people know my rank.

220
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,837
Okay, it's like
going to the gym.

221
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,352
When you blast it as hard as
I do, you want people to notice.

222
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,194
How much you think I bench?
I don't know, like--

223
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,227
I don't bench. I do high intensity reps.
I'm toned as bal.

224
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,378
What's with the lame writing on your ass?

225
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,888
Is it like a surgeon thing?

226
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:46,294
No, it's for pork chop day,
an old tradition for me and j.D.

227
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:47,618
We made special pants.

228
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,227
His said "pork" on the back.

229
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,745
That's actually why he had that
little sexual harassment thingy.

230
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,337
There's only one left. Do you mind?
No, that's all you. I don't even like pork chops.

231
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,590
Hey, look. There's j.D.
Where? Where? Did he wear his pants?

232
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:02,072
Sucka. I lied. I love 'em.

233
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,135
You're a pork chop keyser soze.

234
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,159
Can you believe that?
Oh, I do. The chops are awesome.

235
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,722
I pounded down 11 of 'em
already, gristle and all.

236
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,828
And I'm a vegetarian,
but the baby--carnivore.

237
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:16,866
Hey, turk.

238
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,711
(sniffs) mmm,
it's like christmas morning.

239
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,631
You want to help me get
her back? This is what we do--

240
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,711
We fill her car up with
pork chops, and when she opens

241
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,083
The door, the pork chops
will slide all over the place,

242
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,410
And she'll have to dig
a little seat.

243
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:34,348
I'm talking about a major inconvenience.
Okay, you're losing it.

244
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,060
We need to get you
a new work buddy, like, today.

245
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,216
Until then, you gotta
just chillax, my brother.

246
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,809
Okay, I cannot pull off "my brother," can I?
No.

247
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,183
At least I nailed "chillax."
No, you didn't.

248
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:49,264
Dr. Reid, you're so inspiring.
Oh, stop.

249
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,725
Go on.

250
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,556
You're totally
the kind of doctor I want to be

251
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:56,666
When I get super old.
Compliment took a bit of a left turn there.

252
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,605
I just don't think you realize
how awesome it is

253
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,613
For me to see a woman
actually doing it, you know?

254
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,047
I just don't think you realize
you're a great doctor,

255
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,465
<i>And you've got your life
together. You're handling both.</i>

256
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,834
Me--I've got nine texts
this minute.

257
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,825
My boyfriend needs me, my dad
wants his daily phone call,

258
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:12,021
My sister maureen is

259
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,656
Freaking out about
her bachelorette party.

260
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,662
She has to have sex with
her fiancÃ© for the first time

261
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:18,466
In case the stripper got her
pregnant--long story.
Oh, sure, sure.

262
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,674
Plus, with all the studying and the schoolwork and--
lucy, you can do it.

263
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,140
You just need to learn
how to prioritize.

264
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,863
Uh-oh. (voice breaks)
I've been so emotional lately,

265
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:29,360
And I just pictured you
as my little sister,

266
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,713
And I'm starting...
To lose it.

267
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,342
Quick. Say something to remind
me of how crazy you are.

268
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,709
Um... I ran out of underwear
today,

269
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,190
So I wore my bathing suit.
Huh. Thanks. All better.

270
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,907
Hey, so you and me got off
on the wrong foot.

271
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:46,924
Nobody's fault. I mean, you put
two alpha dogs in a cage,

272
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:49,437
And there's bound  be
some barking, right? Woof! Woof!

273
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,657
Yes. Yes, we are
exactly alike indeed.

274
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:56,004
See, you get it. Anyway, I just
wanted to talk about my ranking

275
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,351
Before the newsletter
comes out.

276
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,371
Spoiler alert--
you're last.

277
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:00,480
Hey, dr. Cox, please.

278
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,889
If my dad reads
I'm at the bottom,

279
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,317
He might lose it
and cut me off.

280
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,557
Okay, I know I don't act
like it sometimes,

281
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:10,652
But I really do want to be a doctor.
Son, that is the first honest thing you've ever said to me.

282
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,233
Yeah, you know what it's like

283
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,449
To have a miserable,
judgmental bastard for a dad?

284
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:17,670
No. My father was so super sweet
thaty entire childhood was

285
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,047
An endless parade of lollipops
and hugs. Of course I do.

286
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,906
Look, I can't just move you
up in the rankings

287
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,476
Based on nothing,
so for the next week,

288
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,269
If I need something done,
I'll go to you.

289
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,467
-We'll call it "extra credit."
-Great.

290
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:31,676
In fact, go to bed 12. There is
a very, very large sick man

291
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:35,648
There who needs an alcohol bath all over his entire body.
Thank you for the opportunity.

292
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,687
So did he buy the whole
newsletter rankings nonsense?

293
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:42,494
Like an elderly shut-in
talking to a telemarketer.

294
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:43,967
Outstanding.
(mutters)

295
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:45,604
Thank you for meeting me.

296
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,944
So basically I'm looking
for a work friend,

297
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:49,897
Someone to pal around with
at the hospital.

298
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:52,686
I am so ready to take this
relationship to the next level,

299
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:56,007
You know, mentally,
physically and emotionally.

300
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,328
I'm sorry, did you just say
"physically"?

301
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,103
Weird five. Get there.

302
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,621
If you were on a desert island,
what three cds would you bring?

303
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:05,850
Motorhead, metallica

304
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,328
And the original cast recording
of "wicked."

305
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,256
I stage-managed the, uh,
midwestern leg of the '05 tour.

306
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,244
And, yes, kristin chenoweth
is a delight. (laughs)

307
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,744
Why am I here again?

308
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:18,369
How's the food?
This soup is amazing.

309
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:21,514
Shut up, frank.
We are lucky enough to dine

310
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:24,050
With an educated physician,
and you order soup?

311
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:27,020
I'm sorry, dr. Turk. I'll send
him back for a sandwich,

312
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:30,723
Something more fitting.
Talking about soup.

313
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,159
(slurps)

314
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,329
How you doing,ate?
I'm a little nervous.

315
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,865
Is a bronchoscopy gonna hurt?
There'll be a little discomfort afterwards,

316
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:39,936
But you'll be under
for the procedure,

317
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,644
And the whole thing will be over in an hour.
And you'll be here when I wake up?

318
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:47,387
Yeah, of course.
Isn't she the best?

319
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:50,398
<i>I think we're all searching
for something.</i>

320
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:53,567
<i>Sometimes it's a replacement
for the irreplaceable...</i>

321
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,029
Lookit, gandhi, if you expect me
to go all the way,

322
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,631
You gotta step up your game
a little bit here, pal.

323
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,954
Maybe take me out
to a nice dinner,

324
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:03,897
Introduce me to some of your friends.
You're not taking this seriously, are you?

325
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:07,576
Not even a little, and not just
because I want nothing to do

326
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:10,472
With dorian's sloppy seconds.
Work sucks.

327
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:13,721
You, however, have been
lucky enough to have worked

328
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,493
With your very best friend
for eight years.

329
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,083
That will never,
ever happen again.

330
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,974
<i>Other times it's just
a hard-to-reach spot</i>

331
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,045
<i>On a fat guy's back.</i>

332
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:23,756
(groans)

333
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,976
Oh, no.

334
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,738
Dude, a little help?

335
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:29,009
Oh, isn't it terrible?

336
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,713
Mm, awful.
Mm.

337
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,980
(groans)

338
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,630
So ms. Simmons is gonna wake up
in a while.

339
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,497
Can I hang out with you
while you sit with her?

340
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,662
<i>Lucky for me, I found
what I was looking for...</i>

341
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,507
Please. I'm going home.

342
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,956
<i>And she was
a lying, selfish jerk.</i>

343
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,748
Morning, sunshine.
You look rested.

344
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:52,612
Wow, and making time
for the paper, too.

345
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:55,217
That must be nice.
Later, you munch.

346
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,483
Did she just call me
"buttmunch"?

347
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:59,567
Well, she didn't use the word
"butt," though I can't think

348
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,471
Of any other prominent type
of "munch." so, yeah, I think

349
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:03,226
She called you a "buttmunch."
I'm drew, by the way.

350
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,802
So I said to the lady,
"where can a well-hung marine

351
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,060
Buy a pair of shoes
around here?" (laughs)

352
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,838
(laughs) I don't even know
what that is.

353
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,385
Turkleton,
those days are gone.

354
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:17,765
Dr. Kelso, really?
Please tell me

355
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:19,723
You're not another one of
dr. Turk's gentleman suitors.

356
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:23,294
I am indeed. I think it will be
great to have a black friend

357
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,613
To help me out
with the sisters.

358
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:28,610
Get my swirl on.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Mm!

359
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,477
Holy crap. That totally
looks like a korean helen hunt.

360
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,660
No, that's
a japanese laura dern.

361
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,375
No, it's not. I'm gonna get
my picture with her.

362
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,661
Oh, yeah? Ah?

363
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:39,667
Well--well, tell her I loved her
inapanese "jurassic park"!

364
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,185
Hey, you came here with me.
Why you talking to her?

365
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:44,544
No, I'm still here with you. (mutters)
what the hell am I doing?

366
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,950
I always end up
in relationships like this.

367
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,125
For once, get out
with some dignity, bob.

368
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,236
Don't ever call me again.

369
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,567
No, it's okay.

370
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:57,113
Hey, crazy swimsuit girl.

371
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,433
What are you doing?
Volunteering at physical therapy.

372
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:02,234
I'm stretching mr. Biegel's hamstring.
Stop. He'll be fine.

373
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:04,646
How do you know?
He works in the gift shop.

374
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:08,660
You get what you can get.
Please leave.

375
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:13,503
The baby isn't mine, is it?
Get out, kevin.

376
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:17,558
Question--when you called me
"munch," were you referring

377
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:19,335
To richard belzer's
beloved detective character

378
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:20,509
First established
on "homicide"

379
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,317
But best known
from "law & order: S.V.U."?

380
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,124
Crime procedurals
soothe the baby.

381
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:26,582
Luckily, there is a different
one on every nine seconds.

382
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,790
You walked out on ms. Simmons
when she needed you.

383
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,739
I to stay with her all night. She faked out.
She did?

384
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:34,200
Can I get you anything?

385
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,908
<i>(funk music playing)
(mouths words)</i>

386
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,934
Yeah. (scoffs)

387
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,225
It got real in there,
big-time.

388
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:44,710
Plus, I got no sleep and I had
so much do this morning,

389
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,187
I had to do
my dad phone call

390
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,754
While having sex
with my boyfriend.

391
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:50,136
So many things wrong with that,
not the least of which

392
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,340
Is the fact that it's the most
turned on I've ever been.
No filter, huh?

393
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,269
Nope.
Lucy, there was a hospital

394
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,565
Full of residents and nurses
here last night.

395
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,019
If there was a problem
with ms. Simmons,

396
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,770
I would have been called.
Stop making excuses.

397
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,968
You know, I thought
you could do everything,

398
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,113
But I guess it just seems
that way

399
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:08,508
Because you half-ass it with your patients.
(gasps) come with me.

400
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,862
Hey, dr. Cox. I just finished
cleaning that guy's foot ulcer.

401
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,617
How'd that go for you?
Not gonna lie, I yakked on his face.

402
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,186
Otherwise...
(singsongy) crushed it.

403
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:17,075
(normal voice)
what else can I do?

404
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:19,833
Actually, drew here was about
to assist me with something.

405
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,589
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I got it. What's the job?
Sorry, charlie, this is my deal.

406
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,971
No, you know what, drew?
Cole's been really stepping up,

407
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,212
Showing some promise.
I'm gonna let him do this one.

408
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,738
Room 32. I want you to do
a manual rectal disimpactation.

409
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:34,811
<i>Mr. Hanson is very constipated.</i>

410
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,055
You will fix that...

411
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,396
With your hands.

412
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,660
(whispers) oh, lucky!

413
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,438
(flatly) yay.

414
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,385
"sorry, charlie"?

415
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:48,029
I thought it was brilliant.
Eh.

416
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,194
Mr. Valadez is gonna need
another surgery, huh?

417
00:17:56,711 --> 00:18:00,097
Yep. I don't think
he's gonna be able to take it.

418
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,197
That totally sucks.

419
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:05,901
Um...

420
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:10,681
If you want, uh, today's
eileen in radiology's birthday,

421
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,531
And I was gonna go up there
and just steal her cake.

422
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:14,643
I hate eileen in radiology.

423
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,654
I'm definitely in.

424
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,624
She's so nice, it makes me want to cut her throat.
I know, right?

425
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:22,110
I was thinking, after that,
maybe we could stop on three

426
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,909
And then I'd show you the nurse that looks like--
looks like nigerian kelly ripa?

427
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:25,929
Thank you!

428
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:29,911
Lucy, ms. Simmons needs
a new I.V. Placed.

429
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:32,660
Let's say, uh,
you take a shot at it.

430
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,973
Yeah...

431
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:36,492
I, um...

432
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,523
Your hands are a little shaky there.
I'm jacked up on 17 cups of coffee

433
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,910
Because I haven't slept a lot
lately and my head is sweating.

434
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,671
But I'll be fine.

435
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,369
(gasps) don't you think
you should disinfect the area?

436
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,931
Good catch, kate.
What do you think, lucy--

437
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,248
Should we wipe away
all the deadly bacteria

438
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,029
Or just do this
civil-war style?

439
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,043
I really shouldn't be
doing this.

440
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:01,273
No, you shouldn't.

441
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,068
(whispers) one second.

442
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:09,813
Once again, a giant swing
and a miss for lucy bennett.

443
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,025
What's wrong with me?

444
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,634
Lucy, when I got pregnant,
I learned two things--

445
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,380
Ketchup on cereal
is delicious,

446
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:17,466
And sometimes
you have to be selfish.

447
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,322
That's why I went home
last night.

448
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,211
I mean, finally I have
something inside me

449
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:24,078
Forcing me to take care
of myself. See, I'm like you.

450
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:25,103
I probably ended up
in medicine

451
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:27,062
Because I want to try to
take care of the whole world.

452
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,616
But here's the crazy thing
about being a doctor--

453
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,198
You can't even take care
of one single patient

454
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,614
Unless you learn how to
take ce of yourself first.

455
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:37,451
So tell your dad
you can't talk every day,

456
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,367
Have your boyfriend grab a cold
shower every once in a while,

457
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,302
Stop doing slides
for dr. Turk

458
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,722
And let your sister
mess up her own life.

459
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:44,440
That's the key
to being a good doctor--

460
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,080
You first, then the world.
Now go home and get some sleep.

461
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,607
<i>I guess there are lots of ways
to get by in a hospital.</i>

462
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,542
<i>You can just try to suck it up...
Ugh.</i>

463
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,323
<i>Or find someone to make
the day-to-day hell bearable.</i>

464
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:04,043
(mouth full) mmm. Mmm.
(mouth full)
mmm. Get the middle.

465
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,480
<i>For me, it was just about
learning who comes first.</i>

466
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,890
(cell phone rings)

467
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,269
(beep)

468
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,543
Ahh, snoops!

469
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:26,314
(singsongy) ole king cole is
in the house!

470
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:27,691
(normal voice) hey, did
everybody see the newsletter?

471
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:28,690
Check it out.

472
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,361
Number one--aaronson, cole.

473
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:34,838
Isn't that just
an alphabetized list

474
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,474
Of all the students in our class?
Yep.

475
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,565
You gonna tell him?
I haven't decided.

476
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,616
Oh, too bad, bennett, lucy.

477
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,964
(laughs)
what happened, suffin?

478
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,495
You're, like, two-thirds
of the way down this thing.

479
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,790
That is rough!
I don't know, but congratulations.

480
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,738
Yep, old double-a aaronson
nailed it again.

481
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:52,417
You suck, zimmerman!
