1
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:06,571
Dr. Dorian?

2
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:08,736
Katie,
we've been over this.

3
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:11,677
It's inappropriate to interrupt an
attending while he's hitting that.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,671
Particularly while
he's hitting it good.

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:16,023
Turk and I used Katie
as a messenger service.

6
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,212
Dr. Turk liked the drawing
you had me take him.

7
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:20,753
He had never seen himself
as a deep sea diver before.

8
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:23,182
Awesome! Go back and say,
JD says you're welcome.

9
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:24,808
And here's a little
something for your bottom.

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,259
Oh, and he wanted me to ask you if you
wanted to go to the batting cages after work.

11
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,665
Remind him I don't like to do
things that I'm not good at.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,769
Yeah.
That's why we don't have sex much.

13
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:36,341
That hurt me so much,
I lost my breath a little.

14
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:37,278
Ooh! Barbara.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,487
Can you please put Mrs. Newell on a
150 mg of Clindamycin?

16
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,525
Can't we use
Azythromycin instead?

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,785
That way she only requires
one dose instead of four

18
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:46,542
and I won't have
to be running around all day.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,893
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

20
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,872
<i>Elliot didn't think
it was interesting,</i>

21
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:53,391
<i>so they went to the person who settled
all disputes between nurses and physicians.</i>

22
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,979
Okay, I'm glad you guys
didn't let this escalate.

23
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,858
Elliot, I bet you didn't
know that on weekends,

24
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,908
Barbara was a
semi-professional kickboxer.

25
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,489
I did not.

26
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:05,813
Still, doctors decide all prescription
orders and... you know that.

27
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:09,035
<i>Hi-ya!</i>

28
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,431
Oh, my God!
Did she just kick that ceiling top?

29
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,258
Oh, yeah.
She's really good.

30
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:19,498
A little about time, champ.
Beer me.

31
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,395
No problem. Just remember our deal:
I bring the beer

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,000
and you don't tell anybody that
we are now spending time together.

33
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:30,720
You're the new chief, I'm the old chief
who better to guide you through it?

34
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:33,909
I was gonna hit floor and be a
doctor like I have my entire career.

35
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,362
Well, you kiss
that idea good-bye.

36
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:41,231
I spent so much time behind that desk
dealing with red tape,

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,771
my behind still has the
imprint of the chair.

38
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:47,148
You want to see? Since we're
friends now, I could show you my butt.

39
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,922
Bob, I saw it 5 years ago at
Nurse Roberts' above-ground pool party

40
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:53,153
and I am still recovering.
Honest to God,

41
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:57,029
there are times when I close
my eyes, and it's... just there.

42
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,012
That still doesn't change
the fact that you are

43
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,901
going to spend most of your
day trapped in that office.

44
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,358
Look, there are a few key
differences between us.

45
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:08,755
For instance, I know that white leather
shoes are never gonna be "classy".

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,675
I believe that a yard should have trees,
not gay little angel fountains.

47
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:16,195
And I damn sure am not gonna
be stuck in my office all day long.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,907
Enid picked up the damn fountains.
I don't even like 'em.

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,866
Bob?

50
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,416
Fine. I like to pretend that
they're friendly stone people.

51
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:29,146
Alright, I'm... partial to the one with
the tiny wings and the flowers in her hair.

52
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:30,770
That's Leslie.

53
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,436
Dr. Turk wanted me
to give you this.

54
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,695
I warned you about
abusing interns.

55
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,173
That'd better be not
another stupid drawing.

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,023
Elliot, please. Turk just
wanted me to look up a study about

57
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:45,364
intra-operative beta blockade to
prevent post-operative complications.

58
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,089
- Really?
- No.

59
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:50,563
He took a picture of me and
Photoshopped on cactus hands.

60
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:54,164
Look at me! I can't touch
anything I love without hurting it.

61
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,335
Do not do him
any more personal favours.

62
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:58,238
Okay.

63
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,348
Alright... Let me have it.

64
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:01,846
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:06,248
It is my first official day
as Chief of Medicine and...

66
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:09,634
Sure, you've set up some
elaborate, annoying spectacle.

67
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,016
I didn't do anything.

68
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,204
I suppose that giant cake
has nothing to do with me.

69
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,229
No, that's cause Colonel Doctor
has two years sober.

70
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,062
Puh-lease. Just, go ahead and do
whatever it is that you're gonna do

71
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,004
so I might get to work.

72
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,185
<i>Come on!
Think of something!</i>

73
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,003
That was actually pretty
impressive there, Newbie.

74
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,932
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome, Perry.

75
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,512
<i>How lucky was that!</i>

76
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,019
Why are you playing bongos?

77
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,392
It's Monday.
Monday is Bongo Day.

78

"My New Role"

81
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,316
I just had to come
see it for myself.

82
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,666
You are the Chief of Medicine.

83
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,663
I know.

84
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:53,929
It is great to see someone other
than Kelso behind that desk.

85
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:54,976
Ted?

86
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:58,867
This is the first time I've
been allowed to use the couch.

87
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:01,301
Dr. Kelso always made me stand.

88
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,262
Even when I had
thigh reconstruction surgery.

89
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:09,469
His dog, Baxter, ate the
lower half of my hamstring.

90
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,112
Oh yeah.
That was gross.

91
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:14,010
Go and make yourself
comfortable, pal.

92
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,441
So I hope you don't mind
my barging in.

93
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,876
You gotta be kidding me.
In fact, Ted,

94
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,465
go ahead and put Carla on
the "Always Allowed In" list.

95
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:24,977
You got it.

96
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:27,745
Too comfortable, Ted.

97
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,148
Thanks, sir.
I need boundaries.

98
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:34,727
So, you... have a list of who
can and can't come in here.

99
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:37,565
There's the "Always Allowed In" list,

100
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,621
the "Sometimes Allowed In" list,
and the "Never, Ever,

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,376
"Ever, Ever, Ever,
Ever, Ever, Ee-Ever" list.

102
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,908
Who's on the
"Never, Ever, Ever, Ever"?

103
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,768
Dr. Dorian at your service.

104
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:53,414
- How was your weekend, Howie?
- Well, I bought some new soap,

105
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,910
but it turns out
I was allergic to it.

106
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,429
Tried to get a refund,
but I lost my receipt.

107
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,267
I was hoping
you'd just say fine.

108
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,956
Okay, let's start
rounds over here.

109
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,918
Mr. Vaughn,
how are you today, sir?

110
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,684
Pretty good, but could you have
the maid send some fresh towels?

111
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:12,394
Mr. Vaughn has pneumonia.
He was touch-and-go there for a while,

112
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:14,843
but you're bouncing back.
You're gonna be out of here any day now.

113
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:15,683
I hope not.

114
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,384
It's nice being with people
for a change.

115
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,310
We like having you
around too, sir.

116
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,666
If you need anything,
you'll let us know.

117
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:28,882
- What the hell is that?
- Some stupid gift from the Board.

118
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,006
It's a photo of Sacred Heart
when it first opened in 1884.

119
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:35,448
- There's a hybrid in the parking lot.
- I might have the date wrong.

120
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,217
- So where do you want me to hang it?
- Somebody else's office.

121
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:40,241
Are you trying to stop me
from doing my job?

122
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,690
How would you feel if I tried
to stop you from...

123
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,546
Taking patients' wallets
after they died.

124
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:45,706
Doctors don't do that.

125
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,846
Look at you,
sticking with the plan.

126
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,680
Just put it some place,
will ya?

127
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,209
Oh, I gotta go.

128
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,743
- I'll go with you.
- Chiefs can do that?

129
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,638
I'm gonna stay in here all day,

130
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:58,489
I wanna get out and see people,
check on patients,

131
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:00,536
maybe make an intern cry.

132
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,992
Actually, Dr. Cox, you need to look
over the Jayco paperwork

133
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:07,049
and these
nursing home transfer requests.

134
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:08,219
See you later.

135
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,280
What are you doing there, Ted?

136
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:16,694
Dr. Kelso always used to
sign his paperwork on my back.

137
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,052
It's not so bad,
I imagine it's what a hug feels like.

138
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,457
- Is it?
- I'm not gonna hug you, Ted.

139
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,892
Oh.

140
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,074
Hey Carla.

141
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,746
Next time you hang with Dr. Cox,

142
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,671
maybe instead of braiding each
other's hair, you could talk to him

143
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:35,224
about making some new hire

144
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,232
so we don't have to
work forced overtime.

145
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:40,717
Why is Nelly giving
you so much attitude?

146
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,425
Even though
I'm the Head Nurse,

147
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,840
I mostly hang with doctors,

148
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,348
I'm married to a doctor,
my best friend is a doctor.

149
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:47,335
Who's your best friend?

150
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:48,793
You are.

151
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,068
I know. I just wanted to
hear you say that loud.

152
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,883
The point is:
Nurses sometimes think

153
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,106
I'm on the wrong team.

154
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,170
How could they think that?

155
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,955
You're like the
most loyal person I know.

156
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:01,060
Except for the time that you boo-ed
me off the stage at the karaoke bar.

157
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,608
Elliot, you're not allowed to sing
'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'.

158
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,572
I just can't hit those low notes.

159
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:07,021
Sure, that's why.

160
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,301
Look, most nurses
feel under-appreciated,

161
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:11,936
especially by doctors.

162
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,440
It's not that bad here, is it?

163
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,009
You know what the M.D. at
the end of this badge means?

164
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,673
It means, I Make the Decisions.

165
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:19,919
You got that, missy?

166
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,588
I'll see you at home.

167
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,770
And sometimes,
it's not even that subtle.

168
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,321
My post-op patient is still going
in and out of consciousness.

169
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,882
You know what I'd like to go
in and out of?

170
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,232
Disrespecting-nurses five!

171
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:39,771
They're booting Mr. Vaughn.

172
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,155
His insurance won't pay for
him to stay here any longer.

173
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,665
He lives all alone. He's not
ready to take care of himself, yet.

174
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:47,638
You know, I got pull with Dr. Cox.
Let me handle this.

175
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,319
Mr. Vaughn is such a sweetie.

176
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:52,381
You wish you could just bring him
home and take care of him yourself?

177
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:58,468
You're late.

178
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,873
Not five seconds in the door,

179
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,813
and it's already No. 3 on
Mr. Vaughn's Greatest Hits.

180
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,667
You know,
why stop there, Franck?

181
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:09,547
Coming in at No. 2: "You Never
Introduce Me To People At Parties".

182
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,969
And at the top of the charts,
as always,

183
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,937
"What About My Feelings?"

184
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,723
I only say those things
because I love you.

185
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,650
Well, you've got a
funny way of showing it.

186
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,270
You know what?
That might be a little weird.

187
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,637
And how many catheters
do we normally order?

188
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,797
We'll just order that.

189
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:30,895
Great.

190
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,415
And there we go.

191
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:34,900
What d'ya think?

192
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:36,115
Why?

193
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,324
Because, now
you can see the back of it.

194
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,837
See? Life is more interesting when
you look at the back of things.

195
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:44,446
Women, that's obvious.
Baseball cards,

196
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:45,363
puppet shows...

197
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,889
Plus, you get the 3-D effect.

198
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:48,756
Look at this.

199
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,893
Hey, what's that off on the distance,
a hospital of some sort?

200
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,176
Oh, it is a hospital!

201
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,833
No. Never mind.
It took off again.

202
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,473
Here it comes again.
Watch it! Watch!

203
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,597
It's got Terry!
Everyone run!

204
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,087
You know. It's a game.

205
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,579
Try again there, Chewie.

206
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:06,155
And done, we get
the hell outta here.

207
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:07,720
Hey there, New Chief!

208
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,972
Barbie, did you not
see the list outside?

209
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:12,559
I saw it.
I'm a "Sometimes Allowed".

210
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,444
Oh, now isn't
one of those times.

211
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,180
- Yeah, but--
- Don't care. Get out.

212
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:17,278
Man!

213
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,019
I am not answering that.

214
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,066
Carla, finally. A friendly face.

215
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:23,950
The phone won't stop ringing,

216
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,212
everybody and their sister
wants a favor--

217
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,705
Actually,
speaking of favors...

218
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:31,198
I've been noticing all the
recent forced overtime.

219
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,508
Maybe we can hire a
few extra nurses?

220
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,715
Of course.
That's what you wanted.

221
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,382
Just testing out the hammer.
See if it works.

222
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,206
It does.

223
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,425
The Board wants to know why you
haven't submitted a new budget.

224
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,008
Hey! You're not the
only one who can hammer.

225
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:53,281
I'll just...

226
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:55,167
Come back another time.

227
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:56,517
Carla!

228
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:00,384
Stop it!

229
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,429
I can't help you
with the nurses,

230
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:05,865
and I'm really sorry.

231
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:07,648
It's okay.

232
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:11,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

233
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:20,178
Wow!
Nice digs, Perr.

234
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,135
Didn't you see your name on the
"Never, Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever" list?

235
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,543
No! It's not on there.

236
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:26,155
- Ted!
- I'm on it.

237
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,059
Look, my pneumonia patient
is being discharged,

238
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:30,126
and he's not ready.

239
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,345
If he goes home now,
he could develop ARDS,

240
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,423
he could relapse,
even fall and break his hip.

241
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:35,821
I need you to keep him
in here longer.

242
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:36,762
Can't do it.

243
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,704
The Board knows I pull
strings for patients,

244
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:39,989
and they're all over my ass.

245
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,831
I gotta stay below
the radar for a while.

246
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:43,830
Okay, you know what?

247
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,837
- We're cool
- No, we're not cool.

248
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,616
<i>What?
Why aren't we cool?</i>

249
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,920
<i>Oh, must be because
we're super cool.</i>

250
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,000
<i>Ask him.</i>

251
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,750
Is it because--

252
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,801
And no,
we're not super cool.

253
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:58,372
Look, you seem to think that
just because I have this new job,

254
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:01,362
that suddenly I don't realize
that the patients come first.

255
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,225
That I've somehow forgotten
what matters.

256
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:07,074
For the love of God,
I taught you what matters.

257
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:10,800
You arrogant, pretentious,
self-righteous, little jackass.

258
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,522
Are you...

259
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:15,515
hammering in the perfect
spots for emphasis?

260
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:17,196
I was trying to, yeah.

261
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,069
Well, it's just terrific.
Thank you for that.

262
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,376
And you,
get the hell out of my office.

263
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:23,773
Yes, sir.

264
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,130
<i>As I left, I couldn't tell
if that pounding</i>

265
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,349
<i>was the Janitor's hammering,</i>

266
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,055
<i>or just the sound in my head of
Dr. Cox finally being boxed in.</i>

267
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,377
<i>Sometimes,
all you can hope for</i>

268
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,250
<i>is the chance to breathe
every now and then.</i>

269
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,003
This is Chief of Medicine.

270
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:06,145
Well, that's fine.
We will get together

271
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,826
and discuss the NICU
issue on Thursday, then.

272
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:09,841
Alrighty.

273
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:13,881
Are you finally finished
with the project?

274
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,027
Yep, all done.

275
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,198
Oh, boy!

276
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,475
I got the nail in there,
but it's loose.

277
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:23,681
You know what?
I'm gonna go get some putty.

278
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:26,618
If you just hold this right here,
I'll be done... in a second!

279
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,954
Just hold it novel and tight.
Bare the weight.

280
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:31,665
Here?

281
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,581
Right there,
I'll be back in one minute.

282
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:34,581
You're doing great.

283
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:40,320
So, that's what a
Chief of Medicine does.

284
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,625
Oh, now what's with the
lab coat, Bob?

285
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,423
Ah, the old gal down in pharmacy
doesn't know that I've retired so,

286
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,966
she still hooks me up with
free morning-after pills.

287
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,962
Sir, I was just looking
over the...

288
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,064
Dear God in Heaven!

289
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:56,768
Still got it.

290
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:58,357
How's the pulse, Ted?

291
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,731
Nothin'.

292
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:02,880
Why don't you go somewhere
and lie down?

293
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,437
Ah, I don't need to
go (unintelligible)

294
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,846
So, the Janitor still doing
the picture thing, huh?

295
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:12,925
I beg your pardon?

296
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:15,998
Well, everytime he would ask me
for a real office, I'd say no.

297
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,802
So, now if anyone gets a nice,
new office,

298
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:24,280
he gets very angry and he uses
that picture to drive them insane.

299
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,554
Now what the hell does a janitor
need an office for, anyway?

300
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,463
So you wanna discuss the urinal
cake issue on Thursday, huh?

301
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:37,690
Let me check my calendar.

302
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:39,921
Alright, Steve.

303
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:41,071
I'll... huh?

304
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:42,863
What did they do?

305
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,144
Oh, hey, good one!

306
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:46,462
A little racist.

307
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,115
Yeah, you...

308
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,742
You know what? Um,
just give my love to Darlene, okay?

309
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,792
Syphilis, huh?

310
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,208
Well, that's...

311
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,845
I'm not a doctor, Steve,
but...

312
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,489
That seems unusual,
even for syphilis.

313
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,144
I can't believe they're
just kicking him out.

314
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,430
What happened to all that
pull you have with Dr. Cox?

315
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,537
Look, he said his
hands are tied on this one.

316
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:11,959
Poppycock!

317
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,589
- What?
- That's old man for "bullcrap".

318
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,065
You're an odd duck, aren't you?

319
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,140
That's what they tell me,
but I don't see it.

320
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,427
So I asked Dr. Cox about hiring
some extra nurses, and he said no.

321
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:27,505
Did you really ask him, or did you
just compliment him on his new office?

322
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:31,726
- You know what, frick them.
- Frick them? I'm one of them.

323
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,678
Yeah, but they're acting like
a bunch of frick-heads.

324
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:35,393
Sorry, about all the F-bombs.

325
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:39,246
I don't blame them
for being frustrated at working here,

326
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:42,022
because a lot of the times,
I feel the same way.

327
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,186
God! You are so clueless!

328
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,484
You're not mad at me, you're just
frustrated about something else

329
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:47,923
and you're taking it out on me.

330
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,298
I mean, it's like last night,
when my favorite shoes

331
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:53,197
made my toes bleed, and so I called
you a frizzy-haired mega bitch.

332
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:55,854
That's why we had to make the rule,
that we can't just dump on each other

333
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,098
just because we're pissy
about other stuff.

334
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,148
- We need to cancel that rule.
- Yeah, I agree. It was stupid. I hated it.

335
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,906
Yeah, but Elliot,
all nurses want

336
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:03,899
is to be treated
with the same respect

337
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,034
that you doctors get treated with
every single day.

338
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,958
- I do that.
- You do with me.

339
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,382
But what about
all the other nurses?

340
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,074
Like Barbara this morning?

341
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,852
Were you as respectful
as you could have been?

342
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:17,716
And ma'am, you should feel
confident in the decision

343
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,920
to give you Clindamycin,
because it was made by someone

344
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,004
who went to medical school,

345
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,393
and not someone who turned to nursing
after he failed career as a recording artist.

346
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,180
And don't you dare
try to kickbox me.

347
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:30,068
Maybe not totally respectful.

348
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,757
When he gets a startle like
the one I gave him earlier,

349
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,388
he usually sleeps about 18 hours.

350
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,213
Have people been taking care
of him since I left?

351
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,734
We've all been pitching in.
Spending time with him,

352
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,117
taking him on walks.

353
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,461
Who's a good boy?

354
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:55,550
So, why are you so afraid to
get all up in Dr. Cox's grill?

355
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:59,101
We both know we can occasionally
be someone of a vengeful person.

356
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,485
This is demeaning.

357
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,446
I know.

358
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,294
God, that's where I want the picture
for the rest of the day.

359
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:11,809
Listen, if he wanted to find a
place to hide your patient, he could!

360
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,572
He's just stressed,
and out of his elements,

361
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:15,538
and hell, he's scared.

362
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:17,191
And even if he hasn't
realized it,

363
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,374
this job is changing him already!

364
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,954
Because it comes with a whole
host of overwhelming responsibilities,

365
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:25,130
including keeping
this hospital afloat.

366
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,955
I'd help him if he'd let me,
but you know he won't.

367
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,449
When I was Chief,

368
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,083
and Dr. Cox came to begin
complained about something,

369
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,565
I would automatically say no.

370
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,368
And if he never complained again,
I'd know it wasn't that important.

371
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,869
But if he came back
and fought for it, over and over,

372
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,167
I knew it was something
that I have to take a look at.

373
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,722
Now, he's me,

374
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,576
and he's got this
damn voice in his head,

375
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,903
telling him to say
no all the time,

376
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,895
and he desperately needs
someone on the other side

377
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,885
to tell him what he should do,
whether he wants to hear it or not.

378
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,573
And now,
that person is you.

379
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:01,299
Here we are.

380
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,656
- Will he at least be grateful?
- No.

381
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,702
He's gonna hate you for it.

382
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:10,800
Go!

383
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:16,752
What?

384
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,097
Hey guys,
how's it going over here?

385
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:22,797
Awesome...

386
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,543
Look.

387
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:29,384
Barb, I really just want to
come by and apologize

388
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:31,313
for the way I
treated you earlier.

389
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,180
I was planning on waiting for
you in the parking lot tonight

390
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,660
and kicking your teeth in.

391
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,596
- Please don't.
- Even if she tried,

392
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,416
Carla would just swoop in
and protect her doctor friend.

393
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,694
Look, you guys aren't
even really mad at Carla,

394
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:44,693
you're just frustrated by the situation
and you're taking it out on her.

395
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,544
Carla actually had a rule about that
earlier, but we cancelled it because...

396
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,904
You know what?
Probably, not that important.

397
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:53,549
The point is:
Carla's a nurse first.

398
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,823
Even if it means yelling
at her best friend.

399
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,053
That's me.

400
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,680
She said that out loud earlier.
You can ask anyone.

401
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:03,418
Anyway, you can either use her
relationships with us as doctors

402
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,815
to start a dialogue
and make things better,

403
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:09,256
or ignore me, stay pissed,
and you can all hold me down

404
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,400
at the parking lot tonight while
Barb here boot-stomps the face.

405
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:19,132
Taking a pretty long
time to think about it.

406
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,369
Got me there!

407
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,878
Look, that was
what was all gonna go down.

408
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,792
Look, I don't care if you have
to fake a secondary infection or,

409
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,750
claim he's allergic
to his medication.

410
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,813
Mr. Vaughn needs to be back
here in a bed, and you know it.

411
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,812
<i>I got about the answer
I expected.</i>

412
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:38,807
Get out!

413
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:39,738
No.

414
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,064
Actually, you know what?

415
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,416
Stay if you want to.

416
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:46,434
I'm going to get out
of this cage.

417
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:49,331
And I'm gonna go out
and see some patients.

418
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,349
No, you're not.
It's 7:00. Your day's over.

419
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:56,180
<i>It's scary how easy it is to
become resigned to your lot in life.</i>

420
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,440
<i>You just go about your business,
same as always.</i>

421
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:01,782
Oh, I hear you're
the new Personnel Director.

422
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,143
Nice office.
I just have to hang this.

423
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:07,534
That's why even the tiniest
change in a dynamic

424
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:08,979
can seem monumental.

425
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:11,295
Good night, Carla.
Good night, Elliot.

426
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,307
- Good night.
- Good night.

427
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:18,146
- Did you do something good?
- I totally did.

428
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,341
Okay.
Take good care of him.

429
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,253
<i>As for me, I was fine
with my new lot in life.</i>

430
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:31,847
<i>Because I knew the payoff
would always outweight the cost.</i>

431
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,797
Dr. Cox!

432
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,068
Look, I want to thank you for
listening to me about Mr. Vaughn.

433
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:40,961
Yeah.

434
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:42,542
Go to hell!

435
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,725
<i>Or not...</i>

436
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,073
# Swing low #

437
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:59,555
# Sweet chariot... #

438
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,878
Chariot...

439
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,253
# Comin' for #

440
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,643
# To carry me home #

441
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:09,648
Oh, hey, Dr. Ellis.
How's it going?

442
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:11,279
# Swing... #

443
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,325
# Low... #

444
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:17,424
# Sweet chariot... #

445
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:21,864
# Comin' for to carry me... #

446
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:23,487
# Home... #
