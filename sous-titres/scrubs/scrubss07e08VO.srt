1
00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:01,930
All right, Mrs. Cropper,

2
00:00:01,931 --> 00:00:04,143
I think you'll gonna be fine without the antibiotics

3
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:06,759
And you don't think that I'll need a pelvic exam?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,434
But not for the cold, no

5
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:12,849
Do it with the gloves off.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,825
Ok. Either step a side, or I'm gonna go through you

7
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:17,215
Then you go through me...

8
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,911
you go through me hard.

9
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,836
Mrs. Cropper wasn't the only one showing agression

10
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,751
Every since Turk visited his bother last month,

11
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:27,460
he'd been more alpha-male than ever

12
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,455
All right,

13
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,619
we all know the rules of remote wrestling

14
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,449
last man standing decides what we watch.

15
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,156
Man rumble?

16
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,463
I've got next.

17
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:42,467
Right! Right!

18
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,652
No

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,661
I don't care that you've been waiting two hours to be helped.

20
00:00:57,662 --> 00:01:00,316
Thank you for let me think about it.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,029
Right here.

22
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:15,080
I can't believe I've never said this to you,

23
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,134
nobody cares whats you think.

24
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:20,858
Listen, guys.

25
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:24,218
It's come to my attention that nobody around here cares what we think.

26
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,346
Tell me about it.

27
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:30,907
But no!

28
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,296
Exactly.

29
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,256
Sort of.

30
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:36,893
I've figured a way to get our voices heard, ok?

31
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:38,847
It's a little news letter called...

32
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,237
Brace yourselves...

33
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:43,162
Seriously, brace yourselves.

34
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,141
The Janitorial

35
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,024
Todd has a question.

36
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,958
Yes, could I be the photographer,

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,122
so I have a value excuse for wearing this?

38
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,048
What I need, is an investigate of reporter.

39
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:17,394
Somebody, who is blend enough, insignificant enough

40
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:20,386
that he'll be listening in a private conversation

41
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:24,160
get the secrets, but nobody even know if he was there.

42
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,484
I'll do it!

43
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:28,939
Have you been sitting here all time?

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,325
No, first I was in your chair, but you sat on my lap,

45
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,825
remember?

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,688
I said "excuse me", and you said "get up and sit over there"

47
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,470
and I did.

48
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,136
Right?

49
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,513
And...

50
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,099
Hey, Janitor?

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,500
Oh, hey, Ted!

52
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,624
Rate Dr.Reid's butt?

53
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,316
Yes, 9.2!

54
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:11,546
Come down, Enid.

55
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:15,764
It's not my fault that I've been forced down out my job.

56
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,648
Now Enid...

57
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,438
I've got to go back to work...

58
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:37,260
Don't be too pleased with that 9.2, that's out 100.

59
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,747
Dr.Cox, can Sam watch West Side Story?

60
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,210
Helps him fall sleep.

61
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,169
And it makes my heart sing...

62
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,651
All right, I just do it in my head then.

63
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:05,824
Wow, we're watching the game

64
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,353
Put that remote down or be prepared to wrestle.

65
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:13,387
Who ordered to care whop ass? I think you did...

66
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,511
I want you to see this.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,303
Do you see a TV from there, buddy?

68
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,126
Unfortunately, you're going to have to get used to events like this.

69
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,527
Don't... listen... to him... Sam...

70
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,814

Check it out! We made the front page!

82
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:07,345
I know, it's awesome. Now there is no doubt

83

Tracy and Stacy can suck it!

85
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,027
Dude...

86
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh, sorry, Tracy and Stacy.

87
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:18,637
See you, guys, are wearing each others oxygen mask(?).

88
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,230
That's cute.

89
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,959
All right, they win.

90
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,399
-Get two!
-I know.

91
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,491
It's great having a silver bullets like that on everyone in a hospital.

92
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,882
-You sure told him.
-Thanks, herpis.

93
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:00,768
I'm so sorry

94
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,934
Oh, sweetheart, you should. It's your fault.

95
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:27,823
Don't help me. And keep this to yourself.

96
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,233
That'll be our secret!

97
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,912
This is your new patient John, what's your secret?

98
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,224
I can't tell.

99
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:36,191
And besides, you are terrible in keeping secrets.

100
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,589
You know, my brothers are great in keeping secrets.

101
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,720
There was only for a second!

102
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,146
Still gay, though...

103
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,725
Told you!

104
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:49,994
It's official,

105
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,826
The Janitorial is a hit.

106
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,461
But no time to rest,

107
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,556
Doug, the Janitorial is a try daily.

108
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:04,948
I'm right here.

109
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,376
I bought you that scone.

110
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:16,922
I'm kidding, Ted.

111
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,466
Actually, I was't kidding.

112
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,196
Todd, how's the weather section shaping up?

113
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,604
You called me stupid?

114
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,504
Well, it's your stupid paper, right? So...

115
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,041
yeah, you're stupid.

116
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,526
And...

117
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,522
Done.

118
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:55,276
What did I miss?

119
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,159
Hey, dude...

120
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,720
I want you to let him go.

121
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,715
I don't have a problem with you, man.

122
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,334
I should warn you, I've killed the man.

123
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,333
-Sorry.
-That's why. Walk away!

124
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,404
Walk away!

125
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:31,461
We got him.

126
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,759
Well, that was a close one, wasn't it?

127
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,156
Thank godness, your big brave man friend was here.

128
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:36,759
Sam,

129
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,291
I wanna be real clear about this:

130
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,619
that's your daddy.

131
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,168
Not your mommy.

132
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,630
How you get Sam out of day care?

133
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,992
I'll be right here.

134
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,149
It's a nice guy, isn't he?

135
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,706
He's incredible, what's your secret?

136
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,422
Aah, are you pregnant?

137
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,333
-It's his baby.
-That was one dream, Carla!

138
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:25,903
Which have?

139
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,927
I'm kidding, Ted.

140
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,980
I don't wanna eat it again.

141
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,013
Ted.

142
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,241
Here's John's labwork.

143
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:26,339
If you tell me your secret, I won't tell anybody about the time you ate a cricket.

144
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,852
But dude, that's my job, remember?

145
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,447
When Sam gets older I'll teach him about sports and stuff,

146
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:10,673
Turk, we are not married.

147
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,155
Dude, we are little married.

148
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,671
I know, I love it.

149
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,276
You know?

150
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,110
That's it! I am a man,

151
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:42,694
Thank you.

152
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:52,424
I feel alone too...

153
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,598
Oh no...

154
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:12,151
Get up!

155
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:16,033
I knew I had two choices.

156
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,456
Apologize to Turk and admit it was an accident.

157
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:19,446
Or this...

158
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:22,279
Yeah, how you like me now, bitch!

159
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:28,602
So uncool.

160
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,009
I'm gonna kill him... where...

161
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,469
Why are you here?

162
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,424
Could question?

163
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:59,064
How can I possibly have breast cancer?

164
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:00,555
Anyone can get it, John.

165
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,663
What?

166
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,981
No, Dr.Kelso, my cousin didn,t hang himself, ok?

167
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,921
He did, but he lived.

168
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:39,536
That's a nice story.

169
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:41,956
Stop, stop,

170
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,104
stop it, please...

171
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:44,339
There is no touching.

172
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,491
No please, no touching me...

173
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,659
Ok, everyone! Can I get your attention?

174
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,005
That interview is a fake.

175
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,138
It never happens.

176
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:51,873
So,

177
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,681
there is no more touching me.

178
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,436
not now, not never!

179
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,102
Knock, knock, knock.

180
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,679
You've the interview too?

181
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,712
What interview?

182
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,019
Oh, thank God,

183
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,085
Turk will never beat me in front of Carla.

184
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:23,798
What is John's problem?

185
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,974
Yeah, Carla, what is his problem?

186
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,653
One testicle.

187
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,666
These conditions are perfect.

188
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,856
He's a beautiful.

189
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:22,414
Oh my God! It is totally awesome.

190
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,788
Stop, Turk, you're making him cry.

191
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:41,956
It's ok, plant Turk.

192
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,739
Friends.

193
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,238
See? He's learning.

194
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,646
We have to find your ball, Turk.

195
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,945
We have to find it and destroy it.

196
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,973
Look at him, he's dying in there.

197
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,092
Good, he's not dying.

198
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:10,028
Josh.

199
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,899
Fair enough.

200
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,269
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:18,892
Apologize accepted.

202
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:36,935
Occupied!

203
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,279
I know!

204
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,603
Stupid doctor-patient confident

205
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:46,670
It's like to be silenced.

206
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:47,875
It's like last month,

207
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:16,709
Oh my God.

208
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:19,592
Dr Kelso wants my help.

209
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,562
I swear, Elliot, if you don't tell me this secret,

210
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,948
So which one's you lose?

211
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:36,850
How did it happened?

212
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:40,962
That sucks.

213
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:02,780
I'm not really sure.

214
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,108
Turk, if you not being listening...

215
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:09,767
Sam.

216
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,741
Rule model.

217
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,941
I have to win.

218
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,952
So what's you wanna do?

219
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,644
And then we had it.

220
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:28,609
Check out the scar.

221
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,236
This is brilliant.

222
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,691
I've thought you'd like it.

223
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,698
It can even make so afraid to ask for a help, bur instead

224
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,462
we just quietly hope for someone to notice.

225
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,238
Dr.Kelso, I told Carla your secret

226
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,575
we'll gonna help you.

227
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,632
We're going to try to regroup all of the hospital

228
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,077
Are you in on this too, Perry?

229
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:02,687
Nope.

230
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:05,588
First time hearing it, and could careless.

231
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,394
He'll get there.
