1
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:03,978
<i>It's amazing how much kids
stick out to their parents.</i>

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:06,502
You know when I daydream
and go like this.

3
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:09,634
- Dude you totally go like that.
- And checks him out.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:11,697
<i>I wonder what he's thinking.</i>

5
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:16,246
Guys, Sam is hungry.
Can anybody help me out?

6
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,780
Sure, sure. Pass him over
here, I'm boundary to burst.

7
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,145
Thanks. I'd do it myself
but I'm all tapped out.

8
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,692
Turk and I had a milk
fight in the parking lot.

9
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:27,136
I lost.

10
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:30,311
Ok, Chip, latch on,
it's right there. Latch.

11
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,626
Letch. He's latch, he's latch.

12
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:36,107
- Oh! Dude we said truce!
- Count it.

13
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:41,758
- I'm off. You wanna to go shoo some hoops?
- I have a baby strapped to my chest.

14
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:44,441
- So I just won't pass to you.
- Cool, same as always.

15
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:46,899
Or you could spend some
quality time with your daughter.

16
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,918
It seems like you're giving me a
choice but you're really not, are you?

17
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,973
Nope. She's not. And the
only way to get freewill back

18
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:57,769
is to stop caring of you ever get
to hit that again. Am I right?

19
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:58,750
Pretty much.

20
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:03,423
Hey Bob! Some of the other board members
were saying tomorrow is your birthday.

21
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,039
So how old does that make you?

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:09,524
Well, it depends. Are we talking
dog years or horny gold bastard years?

23
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:12,726
I'll be fifty-eight.

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,952
I didn't know it was your birthday tomorrow!
You're are definitely getting a cake.

25
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,957
I'll play what do you
want. Chocolate or vanilla?

26
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,002
Wait, don't answer.
I'm gonna surprise you.

27
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:25,035
- It's gonna be chocolate. I like chocolate.
- Uuuh! Fun!

28
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:28,498
Could you also have the right mind
your own damn business and I sing

29
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,935
and then jam your face into it
so the message really sings in?

30
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,950
How is your vacation going in
your firebreathing mother's house?

31
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:43,802
Yeah, yeah, my mum's a dragon and I'm her
hellspawn, we eat children whatever.

32
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,057
Listen Per, Jack misses you and he won't
go to sleep unless you say goodnight

33
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,484
in that silly voice he loves.

34
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:52,324
Jackie, you're getting all too old for
that now, pal. You're... You're four!

35
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,876
I mean, people are actually even starting to
understand about the third of what you say.

36
00:01:56,254 --> 00:02:00,605
<i>I like like my mama when
bites a coast of pizza.

37
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:05,755
Fantastic. Anyway, so no more
silly voices. Ok there, Jumbo?

38
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,280
Solid parenting.

39
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:10,903
Glad I could help.

40
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,042
- Damn, Izzie! You're looking good, girl!
- Thank you Sam!

41
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:21,023
You not only have a sour spot in your
heart, but you have one in your head!

42
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,753
What do you say we hit up a Wiggles concert,

43
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:27,925
then go back to my crib and pop up
on some formulas, see what happens?

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,995
Come in taste this brown sugar.
Taste this brown sugar!

45
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:37,431
Turk, we can't make them kiss until
Sam can hold his head up for real.

46
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,091
I missed this man.

47
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:41,495
If I'm not at work I'm
taking care of Izzie.

48
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,688
I feel like I don't get to roll
with you. I just do goofy stuff.

49
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:47,434
It's just that when I have
Sam I'm so busy, you know.

50
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:53,229
We're up at six, I feed him, I bath him, and
it's poopy time, then it's his poopy time.

51
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,491
But that's why we need to get
this two together right away.

52
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,804
They need to get married
so we can hang all the time.

53
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:01,221
There's no guarantees, Turk. The
other day I had Sam in the hospital,

54
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,684
and when Dr. Cox brought in his
daughter, he definitely turned his head.

55
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:08,173
Ok, I turned it. But I
can tell he wanted me to.

56
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:12,210
There's plenty of fish in the
sea girl! I don't need you!

57
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,256
Like look at that! You are
hot, baby! What is going on

58
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,194
over there? I want to hit
that, I want to spank it good.

59
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,190
I like to spank it, I
want to get it to you.

60
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:26,823
I'm sorry. Kids, huh? I'll talk to him.

<i>The second I saw Turk I
felt like he had huge news.</i>

67
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,532
- Dude, I have huge news.
- I knew it!

68
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:51,418
Carla get me the afternoon
off. No Izzie, "Just me" Time.

69
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,283
No way, dude, I'm off too. And
Sam's at Kim's, what should we do?

70
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,994
What's the last time we did some stupid?

71
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:00,045
Well... We told Rex we'd
cover his shifts next weekend

72
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,701
if he agreed to follow Hooch everywhere
he went and never tell him why.

73
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,474
Okay. I'm gonna ask
you this one last time.

74
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,507
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm cool.

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,419
Hooch is crazy!

76
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,284
I know, and the best part is:
Rex doesn't know Hooch is crazy.

77
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,174
Hell... He'll know by the end of the day.

78
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:30,274
Anyways... What's the last time we
did something off the hook stupid?

79
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,885
Probably last is the second
day at college. Remember?

80
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,554
When it wasn't just the two
of us. It was the three of us.

81
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:39,075
All right you guys? I know that
we only met yesterday,

82
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,802
but I have the feeling we
gonna be best buds forever.

83
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,035
Hands in.

84
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,698
Chocolate bear!

85
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,421
Vanilla Bear!

86
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:47,712
Caramel Bear!

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,578
Bears for life!

88
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:53,618
If we pool this prank off we're gonna be
the coolest freshmen on the all campus.

89
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,835
- Here we are.
- Let me do it.

90
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,347
What?

91
00:04:57,982 --> 00:04:59,375
<i>Ijo les!

92
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,399
Rest in peace, Caramel Bear.

93
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,722
Dude, just because we never saw Ricky
on campus again, it doesn't mean is dead.

94
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,902
His parents came and packed
up all his stuff, Turk.

95
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,383
And his roomie got straight As
that semester, had not even gone to class.

96
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,738
All righty, then. How are we
feeling today there, Josh?

97
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,130
I'm ok. Little tired, Doc.
How about you?

98
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,898
Well, I'm 47 and recently lost the
ability to break down dairy products,

99
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,902
but otherwise I'm dandy.
Thank you for asking.

100
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:37,421
Whoa! T.M.I.! Right Josh?
Too much informations, huh?

101
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:42,692
Tell you what, I'm gonna let you hang out
with nurse "Early 90s catchphrases" here,

102
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,420
while your parents come out in the hallway
and we'll have a little discussion.

103
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,463
We will be back.

104
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,081
Look, Josh's bloodwork shows that he's
anemic with a high white cell count,

105
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,138
Now, we are not gonna
know anything for sure

106
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,089
until his bone marrow biopsy comes back,
but I'm afraid it might be leukemia.

107
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,260
Oh, my God!

108
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,460
Well, hope for the best.

109
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,700
Ok, listen up!

110
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:11,919
I need a volontaire to clear
these schedules for tomorrow

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,486
beacuse we're going to have
a little party for Kelso's birthday.

112
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,919
Kelso makes my life hell.

113
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:21,139
Now, I know I usually cave, but
there's no way I'm going to his party.

114
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:22,837
I understand, Ted.

115
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,153
Fine, I'll go.
Dammit.

116
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,266
So, I'm getting the cake. I just need
someone to pick up the decorations.

117
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:31,122
Fine, I'll get them. What's happening?!

118
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,562
Uh, and make sure you get 58 candles.

119
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:37,380
58? He told me turn 58 last year.

120
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,411
He told me he was 58 three year ago.

121
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,303
Great. Can anyone help me
find out Kelso's real age?

122
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:43,968
<i>You rang?

123
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:46,409
I know you didn't, I just like saying that.

124
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,293
Although, actually, I do hear bells.

125
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,316
But now They're gone.
Anyway, I'll help.

126
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,439
- Cool, ok, because, I swear on God, she...
- Hold it! They're back.

127
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:58,445
They're gone.

128
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:01,334
No. Ping up. Go.

129
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,393
- Ok, because I thought...
- Stop. Bells.

130
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,164
Bells, bells... No bells.

131
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,094
- Why don't we start with that...
- Stop.

132
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:10,499
Go.
Stop.

133
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,693
Ok, we are both off in an hour,
so I planned a plan.

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,069
You just said the same word
twice in the same sentence.

135
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,319
You just did it too.

136
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,095
That is so weird that I did
even notice that I did that.

137
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,678
Same word four times, one sentence.

138
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,178
- Dude, you're in the zone.
- I feel it. What we're doing, today?

139
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:29,688
Ok. We gotta go old school.
Brace yourself from my arm,

140
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:32,278
World's most giant Black Doctor.

141
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,752
Turk, I thought we are agreed to
save him from black history month.

142
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,435
Then where we wanna scare racist patients.

143
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,551
I know but that guy into a Ford asked me
about I want to finish his fried chicken.

144
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:40,713
But you love fried chicken...

145
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:43,997
And I ate that bad boy like it was my
last meal, but I wasn't happy about it.

146
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,290
- Fine, I'm in.
- Good, because...

147
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:47,856
I need this.

148
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh, my God! That's awesome!
Carla, look what Turk made.

149
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,556
Awesome!
Idiots.

150
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,681
- We heard that!
- We heard that!

151
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,508
Josh's biopsy results.

152
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:08,481
Unfortunately, that's what I thought...
Your son has hairy cell leukemia.

153
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,486
Now, the good news is
it's very, very treatable.

154
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:18,208
If you'd like, I'll be more than glad to go in
there and explain this whole to Josh myself.

155
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:22,054
We already decided that if
Josh didn't help having cancer....

156
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,023
We were gonna tell him.

157
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,727
What just happened?

158
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:35,009
Do you wanna put your hands on the back
of your head, like you do when you're upset?

159
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,313
I do a little.

160
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,183
So, how do we find that Kelso's age?

161
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,259
We pay a hundred people,
age one to a hundred,

162
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:57,479
line'em all up and see
which one Kelso looks like.

163
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:02,991
I say, we cut off Kelso's legs,
and we count the rings.

164
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,815
- That only works on trees.
- And puppets.

165
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,350
Ok, you guys have been super-helpful.

166
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,323
I told you we would be!

167
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:15,047
Still, I think I'm gonna go tackle this on my own
and let the 2 of you get back to hallucinating.

168
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:19,360
Or... you could use these keys
to get into personnel files.

169
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,048
That almost burned me.

170
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,508
- You know what I would have done if it did?
- No.

171
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,899
Burn for a burn, baby.

172
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:39,894
That's in the Bible.

173
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,336
Ow, Hooch is crazy!

174
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,962
Aren't your arms getting tired?

175
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,235
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,058
You believe those people?

177
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,756
Thier kid has leukemia and
they're not even gonna tell him?

178
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,958
- Well, they're his parents, it's their right.
- Oh, come on.

179
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:03,813
Deserves to know what he's up
against, he can handle it.

180
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:06,327
Hell, he's more mature than
most of the Yahoos in this dump.

181
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,383
Check it out. World's
most giant clipboard, huh!

182
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,392
Exhibit A, through Z.

183
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,622
Oh, what's that, Per? I didn't quite hear
you, I wanna make sure I get it all down.

184
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:16,861
Write this down, instead.

185
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:19,344
I, John Dorian... write it down!

186
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,267
I, John Dorian,

187
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,078
am a ridiculous 32-year-old overgrown infant.
I mean, my God,

188
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,292
2 weeks ago you were asking everybody
if you shouldn't grow up.

189
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,202
Here I thought you were
having some big epiphany, that...

190
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,381
you were gonna be more than adult,
now that you have a child.

191
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:36,718
My bad. However, if I forgot
to congratulate you,

192
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:39,410
let me do that now. Way to go.

193
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,407
We are all super-proud of you.

194
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,770
Turkleton, I hired you as a
surgeon, right?

195
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:54,382
- Yep!
- Great job, Bob!

196
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,913
- Hey! What's up, you're ready?
- Yeah, I don't think I'm up for it, man.

197
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,174
- Why not?
- I don't know, Turk.

198
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:06,848
Maybe 'cause I'm 32, and I'm a doctor,
and I have a kid.

199
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,901
I mean, look at yourself, man.

200
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:11,363
You look like an infant.

201
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,537
It's probably time for us to grow up.

202
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:18,108
<i>They say that the truth hurts.
And sometimes it does.</i>

203
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,482
<i>But sometimes it's just surprising.</i>

204
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,216
Robert Kelso, born 1942.

205
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,685
Holy frick! Kelso's 65?!

206
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:32,190
<i>And other times, the truth just wasn't
suppposed to be heard, in the first place.</i>

207
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,804
- How d'you stay, pal?
- Hey.

208
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:36,581
- Mind if I join you here?
- No, go ahead.

209
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:39,430
Little Josh,

210
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,910
I wanted to take a minute here, and
explaining what's wrong with you.

211
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:43,729
Ok.

212
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,694
Inside your body...

213
00:11:57,394 --> 00:11:59,252
<i>It was a moring of dramatic walkups.</i>

214
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,957
<i>After one person dramatically
walks up to another,</i>

215
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,375
<i>Like me to Turk,
cause I knew he was mad at me,</i>

216
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,057
Hey.

217
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,612
<i>or like Ted, to Dr. Cox,</i>

218
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,560
The Winstons are *** that you
told their son about his leukemia.

219
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,766
You did what?

220
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,478
I made a...

221
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,120
<i>Or Elliott, to Dr. Kelso.</i>

222
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,349
I've got a secret.

223
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:20,299
What has 2 thumbs, a funny voice,
and still doesn't give a crap?

224
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,413
<i>Bob Kelso!

225
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,416
I added the funny voice to keep it fresh.

226
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:26,511
Well, I've got 65 reasons why
you should give a crap.

227
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,880
You're old!
Yes!

228
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,228
I've been saying that everytime the
doors opened for the last 2 hours,

229
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,480
and I finally got my man!

230
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,299
Come on, give it up, le this up him.
Still got time! We'll do later!

231
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,600
Turk, I know you're probably
mad at me about yesterday.

232
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,281
- No, we're cool.
- See, I knew you get it.

233
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:45,105
It's just time to leave our childish
ways behind, right?

234
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,671
Hell to the NO!
I'm bringing you back, buddy!

235
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:49,037
I'll see you later.

236
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,950
Are you following me?

237
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,019
- 'Cause I would cut you.
- I'll go around the corner.

238
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,936
The Winstons aren't ready to litigate
yet, but they're still angry.

239
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,115
You need to mitigate the situation

240
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,872
because they have a really good lawyer.

241
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,415
Honestly Ted, I'm just surprised you know
the difference between litigate and mitigate.

242
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,530
Their lawyer Tommy, I'm telling you,
the guy's really good.

243
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,174
- Wish you'd have my back on this one.
- I don't have your back on this.

244
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,784
I just wanna ring sightsees for when you get

245
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,854
- your bony white ass handed to it.
- Not gonna happen.

246
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,455
Doctor Cox, we wanna talk to you.

247
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,459
We'll set to Josh first. Come on.

248
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:32,798
I really don't wanna go
in a mitigation on this one.

249
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,933
Wait?
Yeah... that's right.

250
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,055
you tell your parents what you said to me
when I told of the gentlekemia?

251
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,919
I already know I was sick,
because mom was doing that weird smile.

252
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:45,791
Yeah, that one.

253
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:50,206
The only other time you had that look
was when you told me grandpa died.

254
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,818
Sweety, I'm so sorry.

255
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,896
I'll be right outside here if you need me.

256
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,030
Oh my goodness, what's....

257
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,984
It's my bony white ass... And
it's till very much intact, isn't it?

258
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,039
You just don't get it, do you?

259
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,243
Get what?

260
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:09,447
Chicks, ah?

261
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:13,506
They're all soft and cuddly, but
you'll never get to be with one.

262
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,585
Hey JD, I need a little help.

263
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,577
Relax, this is work stuff.

264
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,442
I have a patient who needs
a perioperate betablocker and---

265
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,140
Now I was wondering if I needed to the
continue his IV drip or intimateing bulses.

266
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,298
- Well, I'd probably start them off...
- Yeah, don't care.

267
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,266
Check this out. Hooch is on the
verge of  a major meltdown.

268
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,982
- Why? Is Rex still following him?
- Not just Rex.

269
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,865
Three other interns are following him too.

270
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,535
They're all after this fellowship.

271
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,331
I said whoever sticks to to him the
longest, I'll give recomandation.

272
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,754
I'm about to use the toilet right now.

273
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:55,216
So I hope you all are happy
with the order that you're standing in,

274
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:59,544
Because if you follow me in there, that
is the order that I'm going to kill you.

275
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:04,544
Oh yeah! Today is gonna be a good day.
Yes it is!

276
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,922
- Come on, buddy!
- See you later.

277
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,680
You read my private personnel files.

278
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,212
You could read mine if you want.

279
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,950
Of course, it says my name is Captain Billy
Stinkwater, and that I'm half gopher.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,853
Sir, I know that you're sensitive
about your age.

281
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:27,119
But getting older comes with tons of perks.
I mean... you can mend more respect,

282
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,866
- you get discounts...
- People think it's adorable when you two.

283
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:33,239
Look, I do not care about getting older.

284
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,375
- Woooooooo.
- See?

285
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,682
- And what your problem?
- None of your business.

286
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,949
Well, if you don't care then let us throw
your party, there's gonna be cake,

287
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,004
- And presents, and...
- We have to get a present?

288
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,430
- Mh... You can have any you
want of my toolbelt. - Sweet.

289
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,869
I'll take that 12-volt cordless rechargeable
nickel-metal hydrate battery power drill.

290
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:53,856
I was kidding.

291
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,969
Too late.
Hand it over.

292
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,713
- Looks expensive.
- It is.

293
00:15:58,943 --> 00:15:59,557
Thank you.

294
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,903
Doctor Reid, let me make
this as clear as possible.

295
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:07,107
I do not want a party.

296
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,943
Fair enough.
There's just one problem.

297
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,148
<i>Surprise!

298
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:15,243
Ted, these are Hanukkah decorations.

299
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,954
They were on sale.

300
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,584
Make a wish.

301
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:26,325
- Awesome, thanks.  - I'm glad you like it.
I stole it from my husband.

302
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:31,279
Hey Carla, I got you some
Kelso cake, it's delish...

303
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,908
- And a dreidel.
- I'm not talking to you.

304
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:37,077
Ok, now if was anybody else, I'd
just say "Thank you" and let it die.

305
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:40,320
But, since it' s you, I gotta know
what it is that I don't get.

306
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,604
- Too bad.
- Oh, come on!

307
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,256
<i>Ok, walk by, so he doesn't even
have a chance to tempt you.

308
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:49,431
<i>What the hell is behind his ear?

309
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,016
I know you see that.

310
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,988
- Why don't you just go ahead and grab it?
- Turk, I am not playing "hide the saltine".

311
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,318
You know you wanna.

312
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,382
- That's 1-nothing me!
- Yes it is!

313
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:03,925
- Wait! Why are you torturing me?
- Wait! Why are you torturing me?

314
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:10,717
- Happy birthday Dr. Kelso.
- Ooooh, thank you.

315
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,575
Oh, my God, is that a smile?

316
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:18,334
Well, it's like the last year, when the
safety brake failed on Enid's wheelchair,

317
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,598
and she started rolling toward
our pool, I told myself: "Bob,

318
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:25,694
it's already too late to stop it so you
might as well sit back and enjoy it."

319
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,840
Sir, I got you a power drill,

320
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,930
I know you wanted one for your hobby shop.

321
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:34,656
The Janitor already gave me one,
nobody likes a copycat.

322
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:36,780
So what do I do with this?

323
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:38,881
Ooh! Thanks.

324
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,294
Heeeey!

325
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:45,432
So Bob, I just dropped by to tell you we need
to find an intrern motorpathic surgeon.

326
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:49,307
Probably Dr. Hooch was involved
in some kind of hostage situation.

327
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,477
Well, Hooch is crazy.

328
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,916
- 65, huh?
- Yeah...

329
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,992
- How about that?
- How about that?

330
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:03,626
Baby, have you been in my
locket? 'Cause i can't seem

331
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:05,525
to find my autographed
Michael Jordan basketball.

332
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:06,568
- Autographed?
- Yeah.

333
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:07,259
- Nooo.

334
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,222
- Ok, we gotta talk!
- Ok, we gotta talk!

335
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,305
If you speak simultaneously with me again,

336
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,453
I'm going to have to kill you!

337
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:14,441
{\a6}<i>to kill you!

338
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,163
I'll tell you why I'm torturing you.

339
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:17,782
Why would you stop being you?

340
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,889
- Because he called me an infant!
- Of course he did.

341
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,139
Plus, two weeks ago you were
all over me about growing up!

342
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,504
But I wasn't saying you needed
to change who you are!

343
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:26,369
I just meant that once you
have a kid you gotta be

344
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,075
more responsible, and you're doing that.

345
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,561
Look at you, you spend
a ton of time with Sam.

346
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,547
Hell, you even started a
college fund for him.

347
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:35,113
He started a college fund? We
didn't start a college fund.

348
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,478
Baby, we're being in team.
How often does it happen?

349
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:38,682
- Get in the game!
- Right.

350
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,125
You're just as dumb as he is!

351
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,111
Of course Josh had to find out what
was wrong with him, eventually,

352
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:46,136
but you were so cavalier about telling
him and taking his childhood away!

353
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,225
I didn't take his childhood away!

354
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:51,779
Oh, really? Because Josh was
spending so much time on his laptop,

355
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:56,228
researching leukemia mortality rates, I had
to give'im a basketball just to distract him!

356
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:58,076
- Wait, what?!
- Turk, we're a team.

357
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:01,174
Who cares about losing your
childhood, I damn sure didn't!

358
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,421
Yeah, because your parents were
volountarily abusive of alcoholics.

359
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,371
Not that there's anything wrong with that,
it was probably... very exciting.

360
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:08,799
Don't take your lead from this
train wreck, if you're lucky enough

361
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,349
to still have a kid inside,
you-you gotta hold on to that!

362
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,161
And if you don't have one,
I bet if you think about it,

363
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:17,933
you want your kids to spend as much
time as possible just being what?

364
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,563
Yeah the only thing I hate more
than simultaneous speaking

365
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:24,206
Is when people try to get me
to finish their sentences.

366
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,741
Just being kids!

367
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,165
That's right!

368
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:31,787
By the way, baby, you're getting my
basketball back from that cancer kid.

369
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:36,856
Oh, sorry.

370
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,921
<i>No matter how old you are, you should
never foget the importance of childhood.

371
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,630
<i>Whether it's letting your kid hold onto his...

372
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,007
How're you doing, Jackie?

373
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,154
Yord again!

374
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,990
- I love daddy!
- I love Jackie!

375
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,264
Get me a kiss!

376
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:54,723
<i>Or holding onto your own...

377
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:56,646
Excuse me, young miss.

378
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:01,491
Would you like to sign this petition to
make our hospital more giant-accessible?

379
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:05,608
How many signatures do we have?

380
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,072
- None.
- Dammit.

381
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:08,644
Excuse me sir,

382
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,784
Excuse me sir, would you like to sign this petition to
make our hospital more giant-accessible?

383
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:15,350
<i> Because everithing happens so fast,

384
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:18,037
<i>it can all slip away before you know.

385
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:22,922
Uh, Bob, as you know it's a policy that
administrators step down when they are 65.

386
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,562
Over the next few months we'll be
searching for your replacement.

387
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:30,568
- Do me a favor and keep this between us.
- Of course.

388
