1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,844
<i>Four months into med school</i>

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,286
<i>And we were getting on each other's
nerves.</i>

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,155
<i>Cole was especially good at it.
Cole, you're wearing my scrubs.</i>

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,958
I had to wear the ones my mom made me.

5
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,886
Babe, you know girl scrubs make my ass pop.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,592
That is so stupid.

7
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:17,856
<i>Damn! Ma wants a bite!</i>

8
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,525
You know, cole,

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,990
You could be a little more
respectful of other people.

10
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:23,661
Fine.

11
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,707
Lovely sweater.

12
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:28,177
It really shows everybody
what you're working with.

13
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,952
There, luce. You happy?

14
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,888
ow! What was that for?

15
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,227
I don't know. I assume you
did somethin' stupid. Did he?

16
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:35,667
Yeah.

17
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,635
One more for luck.
All right, fall in, losers.

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,910
Today, one of you is gonna get
an amazing learning opportunity.

19
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:43,649
Trang, I need you to put a
new gown on mrs. Gainer.

20
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:46,018
Be careful. She's off her meds,
has 4-inch nails

21
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:48,555
And is convinced someone's
trying to steal her skin..

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,792
Hey, talking man baby, come here.

23
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:55,194
I am parked in the 10-minute parking zone.

24
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,231
You want me to move your car? No.
I love the space.

25
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>What I want you to do is</i>

26
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:02,234
To pull out of and then back into the space

27
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,903
Every ten minutes.

28
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,774
If you get bored, here's a ball
and a half a deck of cards.

29
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,979
I want that ball.
Trang, get over here right now.

30
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,258
<i>I didn't envy trang. At some point,</i>

31
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,261
<i>We'd all been caught between dr.
Mahoney and dr. Cox,</i>

32
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:17,554
<i>And it felt like being in a pinball
machine.</i>

33
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>And it always ended the same way--</i>

34
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,011
<i>With dr. Cox winning.</i>

35
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,380
Tiny one, run fast.

36
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,706
Now.

37
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,922
Dr. Kelso, I told you

38
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,492
You can't be coming up in
here stealing all the gauze.

39
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:41,494
I mean, are you building a giant gauze ball?

40
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,163
'cause if you are, I want in.
It's on my bucket list.

41
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,165
Actually, I'm here for a medical reason.

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,401
I had a bit of a scare

43
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:52,207
While I was playing a game of scattergories
with my niece. You're still on the clock.

44
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:54,944
She means the scattergories clock.

45
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,446
She's very competive.

46
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,149
Anyway, I got a little bit light-headed,

47
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,652
So we're gonna run some tests.
I wouldn't worry about it.

48
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:04,122
A few years back, I, uh,
I got a little light-headed myself.

49
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,125
Turns out it was... Well, it was diabetes.

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,960
That's a bad example.

51
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,097
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

52
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,433
Oh, what up, dr. T.?

53
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:15,569
Okay, today, as part of your
practical doctoring class,

54
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:18,072
You will be conducting
physical exams on one another

55
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,342
For the first time. Cole.

56
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,578
Put your pants back on.

57
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:24,280
Oh, my bad.

58
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,949
I thought this was going
somewhere totally different.

59
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,918
People, I said it day one.

60
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,089
I can't teach you without your pants on.

61
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,125
While doing these exams,
some of you may experience

62
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,828
Something we like to call
med student syndrome.

63
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,830
It's a common condition
where med students think

64
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:40,866
They have the disease they're studying.

65
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:43,335
All right, what I want you
all to do now, though,

66
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,405
Is partner up with the person
next to you and get it crackin'.

67
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,808
<i>Getting paired up in med school
was like playing a game</i>

68
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,343
<i>Of win...</i>

69
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:51,944
<i>Lose...</i>

70
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,279
<i>Or frank.</i>

71
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:56,482
Spoiler alert-- my skin's super flaky.

72
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,619
<i>Man, I just got totally frank'd.</i>

73
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:02,789
I really appreciate you
taking time to check me out.

74
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,791
I'm gonna take care of ya,
but first, as you know,

75
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,428
We gotta knock out one of
these patient histories,

76
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:11,432
And we both know how weird these can get.
Yes, deeply, deeply weird.

77
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,634
What do you say we just dive right in?

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,637
Are you currently taking any medications?

79
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,706
Have you had sex with multiple partners?

80
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,908
You exercising regularly?

81
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,977
And have you traveled
outside the United States

82
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,280
In the last couple months? Yes. Hell, yes.

83
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,784
Uh, yes--I go to the
bathroom ten times a day,

84
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,120
Which for me is cardio. Natch.

85
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,122
I recently flew to bangkok,

86
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,425
But I didn't actually get off the plane.

87
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,027
Right.

88
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:37,096
That little stunt you pulled with trang?

89
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,900
Not cool. I needed him
for real hospital work.

90
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,902
Having him move my car, I'll have you know,

91
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,772
Was hospital work of the highest order.

92
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:46,808
That's exactly what trang needed--

93
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,843
Driving back and forth in the parking lot,

94
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:51,079
Reinforcing every
stereotype of asian drivers.

95
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,416
Look, you're the one who put
me with the med students,

96
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,386
So don't undermine me.
Who's in charge of 'em, you or me?

97
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:58,822
I am in charge of you,
and by the transitive property,

98
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,325
Anybody you're in charge
of I'm also in charge of.

99
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,061
You see, I'm the boss around here.

100
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,063
I pretty much do whatever I want.

101
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,066
For instance, I can use
the intercom to whistle.

102
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,867
Any loose change-- automatically mine.

103
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:11,936
And I never have to buy chocolate bars

104
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,871
From any of my colleagues' awful children

105
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,940
To support their horrible school band.

106
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:17,842
I can do whatever I want,

107
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,844
And you just have to stand and nod,

108
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,880
Like the sweet-mouthed
little man-boy monkey toy

109
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,548
That you truly are. Mine.

110
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:24,939
Ugh.

111
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,509
Leave.

112
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:32,122
<i>Even though dr. Turk warned us
about med student syndrome,</i>

113
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,625
<i>We couldn't help ourselves.</i>

114
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,726
Dr. Turk, I've got scurvy and rickets.

115
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,862
How did I get all the pirate diseases?

116
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,865
That's a walk in the park

117
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,000
Compared to my early onset dementia.

118
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,635
Where's my phone?!

119
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,904
Actually, cole does have a
weird mole on his chest.

120
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,872
Man, forget that mole.

121
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,042
I'm more worried about
the pain in my throat...

122
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,044
The t-pain. Hmm.

123
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,314
<i>?T? my voice sounds hella cool ?T?</i>

124
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,217
Listen, guys, calm down.

125
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,219
You're all fine. Everything's good.

126
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,554
That's a bruise. You're just ticklish.

127
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,123
And you, my friend,
you got ink on your tongue.

128
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:09,927
Stop eating your pen.
Cole, the mole on your chest...

129
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,863
Well, actually, the mole on your chest

130
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,831
Is something we need to check out.

131
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,901
So, cole, uh...

132
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,203
Unfortunately, the biopsy shows
that your mole is malignant.

133
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:21,871
You have melanoma.

134
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,840
Skin cancer?

135
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,541
Oh, my god, cole.

136
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,210
<i>?T? oh, snap ?T?</i>

137
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,379
<i>?T? I got a funky cancer mole ?T?</i>

138
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,381
How'd you know it was gonna be malignant?

139
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:33,917
Oh, I didn't. I was prepared for both ways.

140
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,022
<i>?T? check my rhymes 'cause
my mole is benign ?T?</i>

141
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:41,326
?T? I can't do this all on my own ?T?

142
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,095
?T? no, I know ?T?

143
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,997

146
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:53,938
<i>cole's cancer thing was really freaking me
out.</i>

147
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,982
Hey, check it. I put
orange soda in my I.V. Bag.

148
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,685
<i>I'm like a hamster, yo. Cole--not so
much.</i>

149
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,254
This is serious. You have cancer.

150
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,291
<i>Lucy, it's n cancer cancer.</i>

151
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,026
Hey, that kind of cancer is for uglies

152
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:09,252
And dudes who keep laptops on their balls.

153
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,796
Well, then, bobbo, I figured out
what's causing the fainting.

154
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,297
Men don't faint.

155
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,532
We take unintended decisive naps.

156
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,800
It's just vagal syncope.
Nothing to worry about.

157
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,803
That's a relief. So just fill
my prescription for blue steel.

158
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,805
I'll be on my way.

159
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,674
There is one other thing.
Unfortunately, given your age

160
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,909
And your current insurance regulations,

161
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,445
They're not gonna let you drive anymore.

162
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,039
Oh, that's crazy! I'm a great driver.

163
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,421
Hey, what's up?

164
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,448
Nothin'. Ah, I was about
to grab some yogurt.

165
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:51,564
Ah, I guess I can bum rides.
Well, it's good, actually.

166
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:55,134
You don't know how many
times I've been out late

167
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,169
And had to pass on that seventh drink.

168
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,162
No more mr. Responsible!

169
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,108
Oh! Ha.

170
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,744
What about him? How's he gonna die?

171
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:09,447
Red nose. Beer gut. Definitely liver
failure. No way. Check out his shirt and
his callused hands.

172
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,782
He probably works around a lot of machinery.

173
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm thinkin' nail gun to the head. You said
that about the nurse who just walked by.

174
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,987
I think you're overestimating
how many people

175
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,156
Actually own nail guns. Whatever.
That's how I wanna go.

176
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,192
hello?

177
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,829
Number one, I need you to
prep some forms for dr. Kelso,

178
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,900
Get the notes for today's
lecture out of my office

179
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,870
And set my dvr to record "big bang theory."

180
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:34,040
The whole world is watching this thing,
and I've got to know why.

181
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:37,343
I gotta go. Dr. Cox needs
me to do a bunch of stuff.

182
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,911
Cox? You're leaving me for cox right now?

183
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:41,947
Yeah. Is that all right?

184
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:45,016
No. Yeah, that's fine. Go.

185
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:49,720
It's just, all this talk about,
you know, dying

186
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,990
Rascal... Flatts paws.

187
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,025
You had a dog named rascal flatts paws?

188
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,994
It's an indianame, okay?

189
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,630
We got him from a navajo rescue center.

190
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,666
I taught him how to skateboard.

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,602
He was really good,
until my dad ran him over.

192
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,571
The bastard did it on purpose.
Wait, are you screwing with me?

193
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,573
Yeah, drew, that's what I do.

194
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,576
I make up stories about my
dead skateboarding indian dog

195
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,078
And my abusive father just to mess with you.

196
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,547
That's... Yeah.

197
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:19,249
Oh, just forget it.

198
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,353
Uh...

199
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:24,288
No, it's fine.

200
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,657
I'll stay.

201
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,326
After our examinations yesterday,

202
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,996
We discovered a malignant
melanoma on cole's chest.

203
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,165
He's been generous enough

204
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,433
To let us use his case as a teaching tool.

205
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,468
Mm! You hear that? I'm a tool, yo.

206
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:40,962
Pal-- drew, he's sick.
Let's just let it slide.

207
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:45,309
This slide is a magnified
image of cole's mole.

208
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,745
How is it different from a benign one?

209
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,781
Well, it's dark with undefined edges.
You're dark with undefined edges.

210
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,183
That doesn't even make any sense.
You don't make sense.

211
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,186
Okay, you know what?
We'll just move on to the questions.

212
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:56,754
Uh, dr. Turk,

213
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,990
Doesn't melanoma sometimes
spread into the lymph nodes?

214
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,325
Well, they caught it early,
so that's an extreme scenario.

215
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,328
you're an extreme scenario.

216
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,264
I'm sorry, dr. T.
He just keeps settin' me up.

217
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,934
Thanks again, turkleton,
for giving me the lift.

218
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,237
Hitching rides with students
was not working out.

219
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:16,841
The constant stops at keg
parties and strip clubs--

220
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,576
They just weren't into it.

221
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,077
But hey,

222
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,412
Nobody hustles bob kelso
out of the champagne room.

223
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,714
<i>That is my house.</i>

224
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,316
if I even step into the
parking lot of a strip club,

225
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,318
Carla--she could pick up the scent

226
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,554
Of glitter and vanilla body
wash like nobody's business.

227
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,523
I'm telling you, it's like
she's a stripper bloodhound.

228
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,525
Oh, well, I gotta get home early anyway.

229
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,095
I wanna read the internet
before they take it down.

230
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,397
I'm not exactly sure
that's how that works, sir.

231
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,199
Damn! What?

232
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,201
Talked through my taco.
Totally forgot to savor it.

233
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,069
I'm-a go get another one.

234
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:50,339
I'll be back in five minutes, okay?

235
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,741
You know what?

236
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,743
Ten minutes. Line looks kda long.

237
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,745
I know you think this surgery's no big deal,

238
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,247
But are you sure you don't
want your parents there?

239
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,283
Yeah, I'm good.

240
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,218
And besides, they're on some
bike trip around iceland

241
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:05,954
Taking pictures of puffins...
Whatever the hell those are.

242
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,757
What about your boys?
I could give them a call for you.

243
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:11,226
Nah, topher and bootsat

244
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,561
For getting into a fight with criss angel

245
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,830
At a porn convention. It sounded awesome.

246
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,836
I could at least make sure our
study group is there. those fools?

247
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,038
They're your friends.
They wanna be there for you.

248
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,708
All right, I guess it's cool if they come.

249
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,877
Oh, sweet! Cancer party!

250
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,579
Like, tons of my uncles died of cancer

251
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:31,215
So I know exactly how to do this.

252
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,219
Oh, but theirs was sad.
This one's gonna be fun.

253
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:37,055
Number one, just exactly
what in the hell happened?

254
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,457
You didn't do any of the
stuff that I asked you to.

255
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:41,860
I'm sorry. Denise was
going through something.

256
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:43,929
I was in a really emotional place.

257
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:46,098
Let me see if I got this straight,
dr. Mahoney.

258
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:48,134
You, who think that women in labor

259
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,303
Need to cool it on the emotional theatrics,

260
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,305
Suddenly became a needy girlfriend

261
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,609
At the exactame moment that I
required number one's help?

262
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,779
What's going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on here.

263
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,514
This one thinks

264
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,516
That just because you're
having emotionless intercourse

265
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,687
That you are the one med student
who will listen to her over me.

266
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,222
Sweetie, ignore him.

267
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,825
I need you to take a
patient to get an m.R.I.

268
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,462
And I need you to prepare
slides for the immunology exam.

269
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,464
The one thing I kn for sure
is that drew is not gonna

270
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,465
Sacrifice his entire medical career

271
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,533
For the steely caress of
your cold robot pinchers.

272
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,426
Well, let's let him choose. Fine. Drew?

273
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,908
Oh, hey, bob. I am so
sorry to keep you waitin'.

274
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,910
I've been dancing as fast as I can up there.

275
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,912
But I just need 15 more minutes
to see another patient,

276
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:34,980
And we will get out of here.

277
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,550
Ah, take youtime. It's already
been 10 minutes. What's 15 more?

278
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,353
why don't you just go inside
and have yourself a seat?

279
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,355
Oh, a nice warm seat for the old-timer, huh?

280
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,524
Gee, tnks. Will there be an afghan?

281
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,927
I don't want to get a draft
while I'm doing the jumble

282
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,664
And clipping articles to
send to my grandchildren.

283
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,399
I appreciate that you're frustrated...

284
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,136
Not being able to drive,
losing your independence.

285
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,838
It's gotta be pretty hard on you.

286
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,873
What the hell are you talking about?

287
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:02,209
Look, perry, just because we had
a couple of nice conversations

288
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,178
And a few backyard beers last summer,

289
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:07,214
It doesn't mean we're butch
and sundance, all right.

290
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,182
So just forget all this soul mate stuff

291
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,718
And just go bring the car arod.

292
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:14,344
You know what, bob? Find your own way home.

293
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:17,656
Hey, guys.

294
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,593
I wanted to talk to you about something.
You want us to go cole's surgery.

295
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:24,130
How did you know? It's written on your hand.

296
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,532
I've been forgetting things recently.

297
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,668
You should eat more grains.
You know, I was just thinking that exact...

298
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:30,870
Oh.

299
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:34,340
So... Can I count on you all to be there?

300
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,810
Why? He never supports us.

301
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,446
Yeah. Last month, I ran a charity 5k.

302
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,482
But when I asked cole for a donation,

303
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,452
He burped in my face and
told me it was for the kids.

304
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,655
But it would mean a lot to
him if you guys were there.

305
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,857
Really? Because every
time I ask him how he is,

306
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:51,227
He shows me his ass and says, "ask them."

307
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:53,763
Look, if you don't wanna do it for him,
then do it for me.

308
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,764
And if you don't wanna do it for me...

309
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,435
then do it for the cupcakes'll bring. Maybe.

310
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,437
<i>I tried to make sure cole wouldn't be
alone.</i>

311
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,739
<i>Although for some, solitude can be a
relief.</i>

312
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,741
Have you seen drew suffin?

313
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:09,410
Med student but, like, 900 years old?

314
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,412
Hey, you seen a med student

315
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,413
Thinks he's way cooler th he is,

316
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:15,415
Kinda has a serial killer vibe?

317
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,844
<i>But sometimes it can remind you
of a growing frustration.</i>

318
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:25,961
<i>And even if you think you're
just fine on your own,</i>

319
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:28,030
<i>You can feel surprisingly abandoned.</i>

320
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,656
I thought you said people were coming.

321
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:36,562
Cupcake?

322
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,520
Hey, where did you go?
I went to the campus store

323
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,857
And got some things to cheer you up, like...

324
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,859
A winston university mini fan

325
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,462
Because this surgery is gonna be a breeze...

326
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,932
A license plate frame

327
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:58,234
Because you are gonna
drive away that cancer.

328
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:02,739
And...

329
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,809
Because you are gonna hoot, hoot, hoot...

330
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,779
Actually, I just really think
he's cute. Can I have him?

331
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:11,015
Whatever. Keep it.

332
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,918
Look, it's not all bad.
I'm here. We have cupcakes.

333
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,921
We can lie in bed and watch tv all day.

334
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:20,625
No, the remote's broken and
it's stuck on t history channel.

335
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,961
I don't care about stuff
that's already happened.

336
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,397
I'm really sorry no one came.

337
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,034
Yeah, I was fine without anyone,
but you had to promise.

338
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,669
You had to do the whole lucy thing of,

339
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:32,138
"oh, they'll come. They'll listen to me.

340
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:34,340
I think horses should go into space."

341
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:35,942
I never said that.

342
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:39,412
Why would I want fewer horses
on earth? That's crazy.

343
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,081
What's crazy is thinking
that you could cheer me up.

344
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,417
You know, that is just
the kind of jerky thing

345
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,419
That makes people not
wanna be there for you.

346
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:49,688
Well, I don't need them and
I don't need you either.

347
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,658
Okay, so take your cupcake
and your license plate frame,

348
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:55,160
Leave the mini fan and go.

349
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,663
Whatever you want.

350
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,632
Oh, come on, lucy!

351
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,901
"judge mathis"?!

352
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,938
The med student who was supposed
to pick me up never showed up.

353
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:07,975
I've been out there forever.
What do you want from me?

354
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,345
Helpe out with this paperwork
thing so I can drive again.

355
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,282
It's just some stupid insurance rule.

356
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,251
Well, that's a pretty big favor there, bob.

357
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:19,086
And since according to you
we're not real friends--

358
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,754
Which makes perfect sense

359
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,757
As your only real friends
are a bottle of discountin

360
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,759
And the metal handrail in your shower--

361
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,284
I'm gonna go ahead and say no.

362
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,597
Look out.

363
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,499
What are you doin' here?
I got a text from drew.

364
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,692
Yeah, me, too.

365
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,841
What's going on? You texted me
that a patient's coding in here.

366
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,477
You texted me,
"come and show me your boobs"?

367
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:47,914
I may have switched those texts,
which does raise the question--

368
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,574
Why did you show up then, dr. Cox?

369
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:55,756
Dr. Kelso?

370
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,324
Sorry, son.

371
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,860
I came in to use the bathroom
while you were sleeping.

372
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:03,129
But I've been watching tv for
the last 45 minutes. Yeah.

373
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,165
I got caught up in this article
about how they make tortillas.

374
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,568
There's a lot of steps.
Well, what are you in for?

375
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:12,704
Oh, I got the cancer. Woof.

376
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,473
I'll tell you what'll make you feel better--

377
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:18,500
Giving an old man your pudding cup.

378
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:24,249
Uh, lien, for reasons I don't understand--

379
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,351
Probably related to childhood memories

380
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:28,352
Of my father dressedp like my mother,

381
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:31,355
Screaming, "am I pretty?
Am I pretty? Am I pretty?"

382
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,724
You two are my closest
relationships in this place.

383
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,159
Congratulations.

384
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:38,763
But I cannot handle being stuck
in the middle of you guys.

385
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,799
You have got to work it out.

386
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:43,235
You brought us here to make us talk?
That's ridiculous.

387
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,504
About as ridiculous as
your five o'clock shadow.

388
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,907
Honest to god, there are
so times during rounds

389
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:51,611
When I look over at you and it's
like I'm teaching yasser arafat.

390
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,948
Really? I see a slightly
gayer george michael.

391
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,150
<i>Oh, so see that. Mm.</i>

392
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:59,043
<i>Could you please be more alike?</i>

393
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,724
You know, we are kind of alike.

394
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,692
And actually, a lot of my best moves

395
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,595
I learned from watching you. Oh.

396
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,597
Rememberthat 2-page list

397
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,633
Of careers she'd be more
suited for than medicine?

398
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:14,203
She cried for the entire weekend. Really?

399
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:17,772
Gosh, you hope you reach these kids,
but you never know.

400
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:20,599
You just never know.

401
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,979
Sorry your mom couldn't make it.

402
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,881
She's a hell of a woman.

403
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,817
Next time you see her,

404
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:36,054
Tell her that bob kelso said,
"I still see sugarplums."

405
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,190
She'll know what it means. Does it mean that

406
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:41,727
You want her to make you
one of her holiday cakes?

407
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,696
Yeah, that's what it means.

408
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,297
Yeah.

409
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,799
So where are your friends?

410
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:49,801
They never showed up.

411
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:52,103
Man, if one of them needed me, I'd be there.

412
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:54,396
Okay, like, when trang
asked me to help him move,

413
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,475
I said no because I didn't
want with my hilarious jokes.

414
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,811
Are you scared about this?

415
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,312
No.

416
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:05,072
Okay.

417
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:11,155
Look, I'm totally freaked out,

418
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,392
And I pushed away the one
person who was here for me.

419
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,760
Old man...

420
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,361
Your stinkin' forms.

421
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:19,597
Enjoy driving again.
Try not to kill anybody.

422
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,299
what was that?

423
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:25,703
He just did me a big favor,

424
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,339
Even though I was a real douche to him.

425
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:31,609
And was just...

426
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,913
Scared about getting old,

427
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,082
Losing my independence.

428
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,984
It sucks.

429
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:42,088
I don't want people to know when I'm scared.

430
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,389
It's weak.

431
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,357
Yeah, I-I-I used to be like you--

432
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,759
You know, putting up a front,
shutting people out,

433
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,428
Acting like you don't need anybody.

434
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,530
Fortunately, though, I got past all that

435
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:54,532
Because you see,

436
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,967
The best thing about letting people know

437
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,002
How you really feel about them is

438
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:03,073
Then no matter how big
a jackass you've been,

439
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:06,401
They'll still show up for
you when times are bad.

440
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:12,183
Hey, I got your message.
Didn't you listen to the whole thing?

441
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,786
Yeah. Then why are you wearing a bra?

442
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,212
I'm not.

443
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,294
Thanks for coming.

444
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,663
I was a jerk, and you didn't deserve it.

445
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,765
I know you were scared.

446
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,791
I'll be here when you get out, okay?

447
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,472
<i>Sometimes ego gets in the way
of what's best for you,</i>

448
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:35,574
<i>Whether it's combining forces...</i>

449
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,609
Now, now, this guy has
never prepared for class

450
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,545
A day in his life.
What's say we start with him?

451
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,047
The weird shoes,
the--the skinny chicken legs.

452
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,183
What are you guys doing? Oh,
you were right about us. We are so alike.

453
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:48,118
So we decided to team up

454
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:51,054
And make life hell for the med
students. What have I done?

455
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,257
<i>The opportunity to thank a friend...
That's the good stuff.</i>

456
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:57,093
I swiped it from the bar
at the country club.

457
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:59,729
You're welcome, bob.

458
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:01,664
<i>Or the chance to do something nice</i>

459
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,433
<i>For the people in your life because
you actually do care.</i>

460
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,501
Hey. Look, I know we're gonna studying late,

461
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:09,104
So I bought you nerds dinner

462
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:11,406
Did you b, graze, touch, dip, drag

463
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,408
Or spread your stuff on any part of this?

464
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,677
Wanted to. Decided not to.

465
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:16,845
Cole...

466
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,213
?T? repair it ?T?

467
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:20,782
I just wanted to do
something nice for you guys.

468
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:24,677
Oh, hey, dr. Kelso's driving again.

469
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:31,629
Oh, yeah.

470
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,964
that's about right.

471
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,100
?T? I'm losing ground ?T?

472
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:39,370
Hey, I wanted to talk to
you about skin cancer.

473
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,140
It's very serious but easily preventable.

474
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:43,742
Always wear sunscreen,

475
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,677
Get a full body checkup annually,

476
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,078
And when you go to the beach,
stay covered up...

477
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,646
Unless you're a hottie,

478
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:52,682
In which case you should take
it all off and get weird.

479
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:54,651
We're trying to make a video
about cancer awareness.

480
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:56,719
Okay, what about hottie awareness?

481
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,721
Have you been to the beach lately?

482
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,756
It's all families eatin' hard-boiled eggs.

483
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,357
Okay, that ain't right.

484
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:04,327
You know what? Just g--hey,
go--go press--press "record."

485
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:06,396
I got this. I'll figure it out.

486
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:08,031
Hotties, remember this--

487
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:11,252
You cannot get skin cancer on your taters.
