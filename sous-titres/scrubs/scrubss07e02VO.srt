1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,536
<i>My last few days have all started
the same. Saying this to Kim:

2
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:05,538
You're amazing.

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:06,692
<i>Then whispering:

4
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:08,019
I love you.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,090
<i>to our baby and and hoping
that Kim wasn't wondering

6
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:12,061
<i>why I hadn't said the same thing to her.

7
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:17,489
There is something that just
the diven doctors can't stomach.

8
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,617
That is so gross. I might vomit.

9
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,793
Oh, is that the patient with
the infected neck wound?

10
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,315
- Worse.
- Hey guys.

11
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:27,431
Like the image of your ex fiancee.

12
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:29,369
- How's it going, Keith?
- You ruined my life.

13
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,102
- See you!
- Excuse me, nurse?

14
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,519
Could you be a doll and give Bobby
Franklin, there, a shot of penicillin?

15
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:37,675
Why can't he do it himself?

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,951
Because, Carla, he's Dr. "No shot".

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,766
He's like the only pediatrician kids
like because he never give shots.

18
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,897
Hey, remember when you wanted to be
the doctor who never said "terminal"?

19
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:50,779
I'm sorry but your grandmother
has an inoperable brain tumor.

20
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:52,444
Is it terminal?

21
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:54,256
I wouldn't say that...

22
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,824
- So she still has a chance.
- No.

23
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:01,314
Yeah, it's okay. I mean, Dr. "won't say
terminal" has got all the mouthful, anyway.

24
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,881
Didn't I tell you to treat Mr. Meltzer?

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,668
Yes but he won't let us, because...

26
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:10,137
No, no. Remember our new system so that
I never have to hear your voice again?

27
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:17,680
"He doesn't want to be treated by interns",
with your "i" dotted with an heart

28
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:20,001
and a little frowny face at the end.

29
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:24,736
It's incredible, your handwriting is actually
more annoying than your voice.

30
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:28,896
Regardless, you interns
are the future of this hospital,

31
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:30,999
if you don't treat patients, you won't learn.

32
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:35,219
What you have to do is walk over to
Mr. Mellsor and then say these words:

33
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,095
"I'm your doctor, deal with it".

34
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,684
Can you say that?

35
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,239
I'm your doctor...

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,990
Not you, never you.

37
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,906
I am your doctor, deal with it.

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,823
Peachy.

39
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:55,329
- Why you looking so sad, now, lifer?
- You were right about Kim, I don't love her.

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,813
Oh, that's tough.

41
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,557
Do you wanna get some exercise
and clear your head?

42
00:01:58,602 --> 00:01:59,884
- Uh uh!
- Okay.

43
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:04,309
Thanks, buddy. I needed this.

44
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:08,642
- are you gonna break up with her?
- No way. we are having a baby, man.

45
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,562
Statistics say that the kids end off way
better off if their parents stay toghether

46
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:15,513
even if it's not a great relationship,
so... I'm in for good.

47
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,883
Plus, Kim is amazing, so...

48
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:21,157
Hopefully, one day I'll wake up
and just be... hell over hills.

49
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,584
Yeah, that happens a lot.

50
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,039
Hi, guys.

51
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:26,902
- Hi.
- Hi.

52
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:28,861
Is Izzie in the room?

53
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:32,616
Turk hadn't checked, so he had
a 50/50 shot of answering correctly.

54
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,108
Sleeeping like an angel.

55
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,662
Really?

56
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,892
Because she's on my back!

57
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,861
That's unfortunate.

58
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,684
How can you come home and
not checking on your own child?

59
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,717
You know what? I'm so sick of
this stupid videogame, that's it.

60
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,186
I want that out of that house.

61
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,280
Come on, I just got this thing. I'm already
on the 5th level. Just let me finish!

62
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:54,357
- Carla, let him finish!
- Oh, you can have it!

63
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,059
Family comes first, Turk.

64
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,327
Baby, studies have shown that using joysticks
can improve a surgeon sexterity.

65
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,061
- You can have this one.
- I'm gonna kill you!

66
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:05,945
That's my baby pager.

67
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,637
I'm having a baby!

68
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:10,195
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be a "bluncle"!

69
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:13,340
- A black uncle.
- Oh, right.

70
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:15,513
You guys, I know when I first brought
this happy thought I was cheesy,

71
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,894
but now that this actually happening, can we
do a three-person celebratory jump hug?

72
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,078
Pleeeeeeease?

73
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:21,330
For you.

74
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,942
- Wooooooooh hooooooo!!!
- Ah ah!!

75
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,662
You' were right, that was cheesy.

76
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,028
Should have listened.

77
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,658

82
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,096
Finally we get to meet Sam.
I wonder what he looks like.

83
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,279
Oh, I just wanna help you baby.
I mean what more can you ask for?

84
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:52,502
Any second now...

85
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:53,400
What the...

86
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,991
So that's what that song's about

87
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,934
<i>I wondered where he was hiding...</i>

88
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,462
Jd, I know we've had our ups and downs,

89
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,849
but I'm really glad we're
going through this together.

90
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:19,245
Me too.

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,560
<i>And I really was.</i>

92
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:25,734
Ok Kim, you're still a few hours away, and I
understand you'll be wanting an epidural?

93
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,333
Yes, but I hate pain so much
I'm hoping there's

94
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,803
a pill you can give me so that getting
the epidural itself won't hurt.

95
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,163
- Ha ha...
- Ha ha...

96
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:36,031
Why does she think I’m joking?
I hate her and her chat monkey face.

97
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:39,935
Kim your quite voice is
a little louder than usual.

98
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:42,713
The delivery nurses usually
get the anesthesiologist

99
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,283
to deliver your pain medication,
but we are little under stuff, so..

100
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,886
- Jd!
- I'll be in charge of the epidural

101
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,104
And as soon as you are ready, I'll have
it make you so numb you're gonna feel

102
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,549
 like you 're passing a marshmallow.

103
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:56,238
- But that sounds sticky and uncomfortable.
- Passing a unicorn...

104
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,604
That's a big horse with a horn!

105
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,562
- Passing a rainbow!
- That's better!

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,831
Ok

107
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:07,662
Uhm.. Jordan.

108
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,209
Go away.

109
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:11,522
Let's go see mommy!

110
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,880
Our daughter needs to go
the hospital.

111
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,425
Her rash is spreadin'
and she could use a steroid shot.

112
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,092
Why can't you just do it here?

113
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,300
Jennifer has uropathy

114
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:24,505
And over the next couple of years plenty of
doctors are gonna be poking and prodding her.

115
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,252
I would like her to see me as her
father, not as just anther white coat

116
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,482
that she would forever associate with pain.

117
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,705
Totally legittimate argument.

118
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:33,516
Ah.

119
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,804
If three months olds didn't have
the memory of an earthworm...

120
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,750
Could you please just
support us on this one?

121
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,668
Fine. I'm right behind you.

122
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,756
Wow that's real talent.

123
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,952
Babe I promise you, I would be home
as soon as Kim delivers.

124
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,151
Yet JD needs me, and I really
wanna be there for him.

125
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:01,676
Ok.

126
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:05,190
Hi people, listen up!

127
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,644
I need to beat this videogame before
Kim delivers Jd's bastard child,

128
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,115
It takes two people do it,
so I can't do it by myself,

129
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,300
- Who's with me?
- I would Turkleton,

130
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,823
but I only play Pacman
and that car jack game.

131
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,272
There's nothing like scoring a caddy
and going down on street hos.

132
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,697
- Sir what you're doing here so late?
- I live here.

133
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,213
Enid kicked me out of
the house, six weeks ago.

134
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,262
She wheeled in and caught me
hitting on her speech therapist.

135
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:30,141
C'est la vie. Now, if you don't
mind, I've got a zac coming.

136
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:32,661
Dude!

137
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,257
We're friends at night.
I'll play.

138
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:38,217
Yes.

139
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:42,039
What are your thoughts on cloth diapers?

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,243
'Cause if we got black ones with orange spots

141
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,161
- our kid would look like Bam-Bam.
- JD.

142
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,074
You've been so great.

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,003
I'm feeling really connected
to you, you know?

144
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:55,120
How are you feeling about us?

145
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,552
<i>Oh no, wrong time for this
conversation, but there's no way out.</i>

146
00:06:59,164 --> 00:06:59,596
Vivian.

147
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,781
<i>Oh thank you Perry much.</i>

148
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:05,513
We heard that you're having a baby, we just
wanted to come by and say congratulations.

149
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,178
- Really?
- No, I'm looking for the pediatrician.

150
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:09,531
It's not here.

151
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:13,969
- Sorry, baby JD.
- Her name's Jennifer Dylan,

152
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,696
not JD.

153
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,971
<i>I'm calling her JD forever
and he can't stop me.</i>

154
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,114
All the best there, Kim. Please
know that the entire world

155
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:23,517
is praying that the dominant
genes are yours.

156
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,858
<i>Thank God, there's no way  Kim
remembers what we were talking about.</i>

157
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,599
<i>Hell, I don't even remember
what we were talking about.</i>

158
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,655
- What are we talking about?
- I was asking how you're feeling about us.

159
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:33,729
<i>Damn it!</i>

160
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:36,905
I've been work up the courage
to tell you that...

161
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,841
- I'm falling...
- No! Don't say it.

162
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:41,185
Why not?

163
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:45,293
Look, I think you're amazing, but...
I'm just not ready to say it back yet.

164
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:47,373
That's ok.

165
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,865
I really hurt you, so it makes sense

166
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:54,011
that you'd need more time to get there.

167
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:56,759
<i>Bullet dodged.</i>

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,868
Hey, what the hell... JD, I love you.

169
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,308
Cool!

170
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:08,602
Dr. Cox! We heard that
you were waiting for

171
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:09,970
- the pediatrician.
- Oh, please.

172
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,299
Remember our rule?

173
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,460
We... We heard that you were
waiting for the pediatrician...

174
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,733
Uh, he's at home so we paged him and he said that
we should give your daughter the shot ourselves.

175
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:24,865
There is no way in hell that I'm letting
an incompetent intern touch my child.

176
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,165
Oh, oh, but... But you said we are the
future of the hospital and we need to learn.

177
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,365
You need to learn on patients
not related to me.

178
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,054
Ones that I don't care if you kill or maim.

179
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:38,338
- We are your doctors, deal with it.
- Yeah, we are you're doctors.

180
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,218
Why don't you always talk that way?

181
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,665
Because it hurts my throat too much.

182
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:51,612
- Ok, all we have to do here is kill space goblins.
- And what's my motivation?

183
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,608
You're motivation is
to kill space goblins.

184
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,264
Yeah, but like killing them
because I hate them

185
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:58,853
or because I don't share
their space goblin values?

186
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,143
Whatever you want.

187
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:01,862
Good shot.

188
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:04,866
What are you doing?

189
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,808
I'm taking a few moments to speak
on behalf of our fallen adversary.

190
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,332
Are you kidding me right now?

191
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:12,495
Forgive me, space goblin.

192
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,648
If it weren't up for the Navas
Level setting and the

193
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,704
ten cups of coffee I had earlier
today, you might have bested me

194
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,664
this day in the marsh of Cathrick.

195
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,718
We're not too different, you and I.
Just bide your arm-mounted cannon and

196
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,076
your insatiable taste for human flesh...

197
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,868
You realize that while you're talking this alien
in front is shooting you in the face, right?

198
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,678
Well, well that was just rude.

199
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,629
Get some!

200
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:41,300
Ok. Not answering Kim's "I love you"
was akward, but at least it was over.

201
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,184
So, do you think you can
ever be in love with me?

202
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,536
<i>Let it go, woman!</i>

203
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:48,225
Kim, let's focus on having the baby.

204
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:49,299
Answer the question.

205
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,267
<i>Lie to her.</i>

206
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:51,633
And don't lie to me.

207
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,900
Look, I think you're amazing, right?
I have... I have mentioned that.

208
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,948
And... And even though I'm not...
you know, in love with you right now,

209
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:04,355
I really hope that one day I wake
up feeling what you said you feel,

210
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:07,021
even though I kinda asked you not to say it.

211
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,535
- Do you really hope that?
- With all my heart.

212
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,825
Because I always dreamed of finding a guy

213
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,311
who hoped he can fall
in love with me, someday.

214
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:17,879
- Really? That's kind of weird.
- No! JD?

215
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,509
Do you actually think that's enough for me?

216
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,287
There are a lot of guys out
there who think I'm a good catch.

217
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,379
The words "Cute as a button" have been
thrown around in more than one occasion.

218
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:30,307
- I know that Kim, you're amazing.
- Stop calling me amazing, ok?!

219
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,326
Would you even be with me if
I wasn't dropping this kid?

220
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,143
I don't know how to answer that.

221
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,017
I think you just did.

222
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,802
You know what?

223
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,031
We're done.

224
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:48,667
What... What are you talking about?

225
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,666
- We're having a baby!
- Yeah, we are, but

226
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,775
I deserve to be with somebody who
doesn't need to cross his fingers

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,921
and hope that he falls in
love with me. Maybe, someday.

228
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,774
Ahhh, it's over, JD.

229
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,404
WHERE THE HELL IS THE EPIDURAAAL!?

230
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,693
<i>It's funny how even the best
intentions can blow up in your face.</i>

231
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,658
Don't worry. I've practiced this
on tomatoes like a hundred times.

232
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:18,458
<i>Whether you meant to keep your
daughter from associating you with pain.</i>

233
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:21,064
Step away from the child.

234
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,419
Oh my... ok...

235
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:28,032
<i>Or you simply intended to
get closure on a videogame.</i>

236
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,457
This is what you call
"Being there for JD"?

237
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,564
Oh my God, I don't think I
could be any angrier at you.

238
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,897
Oh yeah? Well, you're about to find
out cause I'm finishing this videogame.

239
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,105
Hihihi!

240
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:45,002
<i>And though you have every intention
of making a horrible situation better.</i>

241
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,045
Ok, looks I could rally for this baby!

242
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,590
No way! Wait! Wait! Wait!
What about my epidural?

243
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,098
Kim, you're fully dilated.
It's too late for the epidural.

244
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:53,638
You should have told told me sooner.

245
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>You often find out that
you've made it worse.</i>

246
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,790
YOUUUU!

247
00:11:57,993 --> 00:11:59,352
You're amazing.

248
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:07,222
WAAAAAH I HATE YOU SO MUCH JD!

249
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,661
Don’t worry all women say that stuff
during labor, she doesn’t mean it.

250
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,718
- I DO! HE JUST BROKE UP WITH ME!
- What?

251
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,482
Nonono, technically I didn't break up with
her, I just told her I don't love her.

252
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,253
- Who did he say that to?
- The mother of his baby!

253
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,643
No, he didn't.

254
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:21,258
<i>Man, she looks familiar...

255
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:22,732
GET OUT!

256
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,930
No, I'm not letting you go
through this alone.

257
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,160
I have someone else I can call!

258
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,864
Keith, I get it, I ruined
your life, stop calling.

259
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,591
- (Kim Moaning)
- Oh, hey, Kim.

260
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,397
Lok it, I know that I called you at home
and I threatened to kill your dog,

261
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:43,785
but thanks again for coming
in there, Dr. Callahan.

262
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:47,066
No problem. It's not like
I need a lot of sleep to

263
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,439
- practice medicine on small children.
- This'll only take a second.

264
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,481
My daughter needs a shot for a dermatitis.

265
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,425
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do
that, I'm Dr. No-Shot.

266
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,307
You're kidding, right? You're a pediatrician, you must...

267
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,710
- give the occasional shot...
- Sure.

268
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,602
My name is Dr. Occasional Shot, but it's not.

269
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:07,859
Look, I have been a doctor
for these kids for years,

270
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:11,500
I don't want them balling every time they see
me because they associate me with pain.

271
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,745
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,125
And why aren't you
giving your daughter the shot?

273
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:20,380
I don't want her to forever
associate me with...

274
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:21,529
<i>pain.

275
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,538
What? I didn't-I didn't catch that.

276
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:24,086
<i>Pain.

277
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,993
Is it your inside voice?
You can-you can pick it up.

278
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,878
Mydaughtertoforeverassociatemewithpain.

279
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:28,922
Ironic...

280
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,515
We'll just have one of the
nurses to give it to her.

281
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:36,773
I don't want any nurse in this
town to touch my daughter.

282
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:40,318
I can't believe you're still
playing this stupid game.

283
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,638
- Hit him with the firesaber.
- Hit him with a lamp.

284
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:44,553
There's no lamp in this game, sir.

285
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,310
I was talking to your wife.

286
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,547
Hit Turkelton with this lamp.

287
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:50,785
Oh, Carla, good.

288
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:54,120
Listen, I need you to give my kid
a shot, it'll only take a second.

289
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,650
No, I can't do it. I'm literally
shaking with rage.

290
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:57,431
See?

291
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:04,528
I would give her a shot, Perry, but this...
is scotch, and I'm all Hasselhoffed out.

292
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:06,165
Allright.

293
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,288
- Janitor, you're getting pummled.
- That sounded like criticism.

294
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:13,697
- I don't respond well to criticism.
- Whatever, you still suck.

295
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,106
- I'm out.
- No, dude, come on.

296
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,168
Baby why'd you have to go and say that?
I can't finish this game by myself.

297
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:24,833
Find all might leave, jump on that Warthog.

298
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,580
You drive, I'll mend the machine-gun
and kill all the Jackals.

299
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,577
You've never been more sexy to me!

300
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:40,220
Oh, that's disgusting!

301
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:41,294
Uh. Hey, Keith.

302
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,621
- Burn in hell.
- Hm.

303
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,458
I'm so sorry about you and Kim.

304
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,492
- Is there anything I can do?
- Just take care of her.

305
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:51,514
Ok.

306
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,027
God, you're having a baby!

307
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:59,322
- Wanna do a celebratory jump?
- Nah, Turk, Carla and I tried one earlier,

308
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,079
- turned out to be lame.
- Oh, please...

309
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,587
You privately loved it, though
still don't want to admit it.

310
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,141
<i>God, she knows me!

311
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,370
Hey, you! D'Barbie go that way?

312
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,511
Thanks.

313
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:12,681
- GET OUT!
- Oh.

314
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,136
Dear God. It is like Baghdad in there...

315
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:19,794
Look, Noobie, I'm on the
virge of losing of my mind,

316
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:23,699
Do you have the time to give my daughter
a shot, now that you've ruined your life?

317
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,500
- Will you talk me through when I'm going to?
- Absolutely not.

318
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,286
- Then find someone else to help you.
- Oh, damn, fine. Ok.

319
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:33,807
Fine. But if you use the words "emotional
rollercoaster" I am on your teeth.

320
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,300
Deal. I just feel like I'm
on this like emotional...

321
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:39,041
- ride of some sort...
- Oh...

322
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,228
Kinda like a...

323
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,372
Baby, you are awesome!
Did you play this before?

324
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:47,684
Listen,

325
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:52,305
I discovered the game when Izzy had colic and
I was up all night, and I became addicted.

326
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,121
That's actually the main reason why
I wanted it out of the apartment.

327
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:59,543
Oh... I thought you were mad because
I'd rather play the game than play with Izzy.

328
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,552
Which I guess it's sometimes true, baby...
don't get it twisted that girl is my world,

329
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,841
but every now and then I gotta do my own
thing. You've heard of anger-pains?

330
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,521
I get sports-pains. And "watch
Judge Dredd with JD"-pains

331
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,383
Turk, you think you're
the only one who gets pains?

332
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,552
I get "Put on my tight jeans and walk down
the street to see if anybody horns"-pains.

333
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,052
They do, actually. I mean, how do you think I
became addicted to this game?

334
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:24,492
Every parent needs to
take some time off.

335
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:26,887
You're damn right, they do.

336
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:30,131
Hell, my son Harrison is a grown man,

337
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,481
and I still get urge to
slip away during his visits.

338
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:37,235
Of course, it may have more to do with
this new boyfriend he has.

339
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,095
I swear. You could line up
a hundred gay men,

340
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,704
and Harrison would pick out the attention
starved by poor ex-con everytime.

341
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:49,626
Oh!

342
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:53,725
Harrison! Your ears must
have been burning!

343
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,558
And now, what do we do?

344
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,554
We kill one more alien boss,
and then we've finished.

345
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,807
I like your style.

346
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:05,223
Of course you had to break up with him.

347
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:09,337
No one you love should ever sell
your car without asking

348
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,380
and then blow all the money on meth.

349
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,390
The kid's not even born yet, and
I'm already screwing up his life.

350
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:19,927
I just wanted him to be really happy,
and normal, you know?

351
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,360
Ok, first one, noobie,
we're talking about your kid.

352
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,755
So the whole normal part
was never gonna happen.

353
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:27,697
- And... you didn't mess up his life.
- Ah, come on, statistics show

354
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,371
- that kids whose parents stay together...
- "Statistics show" who... who cares,

355
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,926
what statistic's showing?

356
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:34,475
Look at medicine. 80% of people,

357
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:38,359
with pancreatic cancer, die within
5 years, 95% of appendectomies,

358
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,283
occur with zero complications. But...

359
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:43,227
we both know pancreatic
cancer patient that lived,

360
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,764
and appendix patients
that unfortunately... passed.

361
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,558
Statistics mean nothing to the individual.

362
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,757
You're either gonna be a good
parent to that kid, or you're not.

363
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:55,619
I mean, hell, your parents were divorcing,
and somehow you managed to become

364
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,795
a relatively successful doctor,
and I'm sure there's...

365
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:03,743
someone... somewhere... who would be
proud to call you their son.

366
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,339
- Would you be proud to call me your son?
- This conversation's over.

367
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,717
- Carla, are you done yet?
- Not yet.

368
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,553
<i>As I looked around the room, I thought
about the things parents do for their kids.</i>

369
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:21,690
<i>Like going to extraordinary lenghts,
to ensure their child never fears them.</i>

370
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,078
Ok, let's keep looking.

371
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,668
<i>Helping them mend their broken heart.</i>

372
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:31,887
Oh, why can't you still be with Gary?
I always liked him.

373
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,897
What do you mean
"He stole your fillings"?

374
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,787
<i>Or staying up late, to make sure there's
one less distraction around.</i>

375
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,791
Game, and that's game,
and that's how we do!

376
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,952
And that's how... we do!

377
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:46,718
That's right.

378
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,585
<i>And I realized parenting is
about sacrifice.</i>

379
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:53,521
<i>And I had to go in there
and be there for my child.</i>

380
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:56,128
<i>Even if that meant taking
some well-deserved abuse.</i>

381
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,972
GET OUTTA HERE, YOU JERK!

382
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:00,979
No.

383
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,147
Ok, I need you to stop pushing for a minute.

384
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:08,150
- You're a piece of crap.
- You're doing great.

385
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:11,041
- I hate your hair.
- Impossible, nobody does.

386
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,977
Almost there...

387
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:17,881
Are you two ready to be parents?

388
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,186
<i>And right then I couldn't
help but wondering.</i>

389
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,710
<i>Are you ever?</i>

390
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,259
Anyway, I hope you... I hope you
want two words about us.

391
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,952
We'll be home real soon. Bye.

392
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,451
I love watching her sleep.

393
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,138
I can't believe we finished that game!

394
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,888
Oh, baby.

395
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,847
I finished it a bunch of times.

396
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,166
- Word?
- Hmm, hm.

397
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:58,933
He's so beautiful.

398
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm really glad you came back in.

399
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,400
Me too.

400
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:07,141
It's weird, you know.

401
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:11,579
This is the end of our relationship,
but it's sorta just the beginning.

402
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,024
Can I hold him?

403
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,502
Of course.

404
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:20,222
Here's your daddy.

405
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,460
Hiii.

406
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:26,102
Hi, handsome.

407
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:29,008
Welcome to the world, Sammy.
