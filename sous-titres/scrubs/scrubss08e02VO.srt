00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,578
Hi!

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:08,754
I'm trying to keep a non-medical
personnel from coming back here.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,011
I'm the Chief of Medicine.

4
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,954
And I'm the Chief of Slag Smacking,

5
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:14,730
so I'd keep moving
if I were you.

6
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:16,171
That's very clever.

7
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:18,545
Being clever is
not how I got the job.

8
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:20,237
Smacking slags is.

9
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:21,972
<i>Unfortunately for Jordan,</i>

10
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,168
<i>Dr. Maddox can zero in on
someone's biggest insecurity.</i>

11
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,440
- You're old.
- Oh!

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:31,394
<i>See, she was an oncombination
of super-friendly...</i>

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,669
Hey, rockstar!

14
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,215
<i>...and soul-less.</i>

15
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:36,164
This guy's insurance
only covers three days

16
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,895
of 'Why so you care?', so you gotta
get him out of here today, okay?

17
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:39,835
And you know what?

18
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,094
I'll take care of it.

19
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,782
Oh, do you know what I did
for the first time last week?

20
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:48,162
Wind surfing.

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,786
By the way,
it is really... aargh!

22
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:52,440
I wouldn't know about that.

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,433
Trust me, it is.

24
00:00:58,388 --> 00:00:59,577
This guy!

25
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:01,990
Die! Got you!

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,448
God! Won't you die?!

27
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,003
Treat him and streed (sp?) him.

28
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,256
<i>And she wasn't the only woman
who was driving me crazy.</i>

29
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:13,940
Listen, Jo...

30
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:16,592
Medically speaking,
your performance is outstanding.

31
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,587
But you're not
great with your patients.

32
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,475
Watch Ed.

33
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,744
See, he develops a rapport.

34
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,742
Now I know Ed's not perfect...

35
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,146
Matrix! All three movies,
one house. You in?

36
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:27,733
Sure.

37
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:28,922
Sorry, no room.

38
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,765
For starters,
I heard he smokes plants.

39
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:35,932
Still, I need you to connect
with your patients, okay?

40
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:37,844
If they need some sympathy,

41
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,401
dig down in your soul and find some?

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,492
Yo, Mr. Harris?

43
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,909
Sucks you'll never walk again.

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,973
Hell yeah, awesome!

45
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:48,023
Better, right?

46
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,363
No, no, Jo...

47
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,319
He lost his feet.

48
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:52,192
<i>I don't have time for Jo,</i>

49
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,847
<i>because once a year,
Turk and I go to a great steakhouse</i>

50
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,307
<i>and have the most
romantic night ever.</i>

51
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:57,799
Dude!

52
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,136
<i>And that magical
evening was finally here.</i>

53
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,678
Steak Night!

54
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:03,865
- Give me some of this! Oh!
- Oh!

55
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,423
How come I don't know about
that super-tight new greeting?

56
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:08,994
Steak Night!

57
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,539
It's not a greeting, Ed.

58
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:11,646
It is now.

59
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:12,439
Sean!

60
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,450
Steak Night!

61
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,829
How does he start
things so quickly?

62
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,346
He is very talented.

63
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:22,050
May your mushrooms always be sautéed
and your onions always be grilled.

64
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:23,831
Gravy, fellas!

65
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:24,842
Gravy, Ed.

66
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:26,264
Cream spinach, yo!

67
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:27,538
- No.
- Okay.

68
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:33,345
'My Last Words'

69
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:40,591
VO Made and Edited by: VeRdiKT
[subscene.com]

70
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:45,727
Dude.

71
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,844
You've seen the new
administrative assistant?

72
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,823
<i>For some reason, whenever I see
a pretty girl, for the first time,</i>

73
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:54,201
<i>I always imagine her
hair blowing in slow-mo.</i>

74
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,523
<i>Unfortunately,
Turk knows this,</i>

75
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,821
<i>so I have to snap out of
it before he messes with me.</i>

76
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,216
Heya!

77
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:09,391
Too slow.

78
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,058
Dude, I almost had you.

79
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,931
A score one for J-Dism.

80
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,303
Hot dog pin!

81
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,944
Count it, hockey-face.

82
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:20,143
Listen, you shouldn't be wasting
your calories on hot dogs, anyways.

83
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:22,520
For God's sakes, Steak Night
is five minutes away.

84
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:23,369
Hey.

85
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,144
Shall we sing?

86
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,672
<i>The Steak Night song
was to be sung</i>

87
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:30,070
<i>every Steak Night that had
been for the last decade.</i>

88
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:31,666
All clear!

89
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,169
<i>The dance was new.</i>

90
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,482
- We're going to Steak Night!
- We're going to Steak Night!

91
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,546
- We're going to eat it right.
- We're going to eat it right.

92
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:39,550
- Steak is such a treat.
- Steak is such a treat.

93
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,407
- It is the world's best meat.
- It is the world's best meat.

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,860
- We're going to Steak Night!
- We're going to Steak Night!

95
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,664
- We're going to eat it right.
- We're going to eat it right.

96
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,676
Excuse me, doctors!

97
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,947
- What is your problem, lady?
- What the heck, yo? Listen to me.

98
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,778
- We like to do a thing.
- You don't interrupt people--

99
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,524
All right, calm down, calm down.

100
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,721
We'll finish in the
bathroom at the restaurant.

101
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:58,475
I'm so sorry,
could one of you change the IV in 103?

102
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,711
Nothing like the
taste of fresh bag.

103
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:10,898
I just picked it this morning.

104
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:13,099
The only thing that
would make it any better

105
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,773
is if it was being hooked up by that...
foxy, little dish over there.

106
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,298
Damn, my psychée.

107
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,995
So, Mr. Valentine.

108
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,867
Call me George.

109
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,904
George.
What are you in for?

110
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,826
<i>We think of hospitals as places
where people go to heal.</i>

111
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,380
<i>But there are also places
where people go to die.</i>

112
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,182
<i>And George was definitely going soon.</i>

113
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,368
Ischemic bowel disease.

114
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:50,544
I'm so sorry.

115
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:53,814
Oh hey,
I've lived 70 plus years.

116
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:56,205
I've had a great old
time while I was here.

117
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:57,845
<i>He's over 70?</i>

118
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,620
<i>Black people have the greatest skin.</i>

119
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,372
No.

120
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,368
But honestly,

121
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:05,306
I don't know why people
are so afraid of dying.

122
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:06,564
Tell me about it.

123
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:09,598
When you're around death as much as
we are, you kinda lose your fear of it.

124
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:11,364
It's one of the
benefits of working here.

125
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:12,075
Yeah.

126
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,017
Look, we're on our
way out to dinner,

127
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,743
but is there anything we
can get you before we go?

128
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:17,848
I'd kill for a cigar.

129
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,679
You know, I'm dying and I'm
not allowed to have a cigar?

130
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,192
What are the nurses
thinks gonna happen?

131
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:23,270
They're probably thinking

132
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:25,239
you could accidentally
ignite that oxygen tank

133
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:28,095
and it would blow up the whole ICU,
pretty much killing everybody here.

134
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,009
Boom!

135
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,850
How about a beer?

136
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:35,497
Listen to him,
who behaves that way at a mini-Martin (sp?)?

137
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,930
I'm sorry Turk, but when I put
that single beer down in the counter

138
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,710
and the 18-year old check-out
kid is like, 'Oh, big night!'

139
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,396
It just pissed me off!
You know, I mean...

140
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:44,796
Who was he to judge us?

141
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:47,901
He needs to know we're not two
lame-o's with nothing going on.

142
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,641
So that's why you bought
that box of condoms

143
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,128
- and a flare gun.
- Exactly.

144
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,353
Now whenever he thinks of us,

145
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,220
he'll picture us putting a beer,
sexing up the ladies

146
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,303
and shooting off flares,
you know, like men do.

147
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,471
That does sound pretty awesome.

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,254
I knew you'd come around!

149
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,610
- We did it that. We did it that.
- Pow, pow!

150
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:08,655
Incoming!

151
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:11,725
Hey, guys,

152
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,441
I assume you've already met

153
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,656
my sharp, young lawyer who
is gonna help me with my will.

154
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,799
You said I could help you!

155
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,319
All this work for nothing!

156
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:23,717
Ted! Ted!

157
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:25,683
He means you.

158
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,760
Oh, man!

159
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,719
I did this all in my typewriter.

160
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,463
I'll be back in 11 hours.

161
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,703
Oh God, that tastes good!

162
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:47,239
You guys gonna join me, right?

163
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,018
Nah, they are kinda frank (sp?) on
doctors drinking beer here.

164
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,669
And plus, I'm allergic to barley.

165
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,911
Wait, I've seen you
drink beer before.

166
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,482
And every time I did,

167
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,882
I had to have an
antihistamine first.

168
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:57,811
I don't remember that.

169
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:59,725
Fine, Turk,
I'll tell George the truth.

170
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,447
Even though I'm a man,
I don't like beer.

171
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,939
I prefer Appletinis,
they make me feel fancy.

172
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:08,091
There. You hurt,
and embarrassed me. Are you happy?

173
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,065
A little bit.

174
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:09,885
Guys,

175
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,313
don't you have a dinner to go to?

176
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,314
George, don't worry,
there's no rush.

177
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,686
No, no,
don't you stick around on my account.

178
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,436
Come on now,
I've got family coming pretty soon.

179
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,054
I'm fine.

180
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,604
<i>And then I said the only
thing I could think of</i>

181
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,692
<i>to a man who
might not be here tomorrow.</i>

182
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,929
It was nice to meet you,
George.

183
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:30,230
Yes, it was.

184
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:32,281
You too.

185
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,362
- We're going to Steak Night.
- We're going to Steak Night.

186
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:38,389
- We're gonna eat it right.
- We're gonna eat it right.

187
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,839
Ted, 3-part harmony!

188
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:44,685
Steak is such a treat,
it is the world's best meat.

189
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:45,776
Big finish!

190
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:47,247
Steak Night!

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,284
Hot dang, just like a choir!

192
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,025
Hey, are you working
on George's will?

193
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,054
Can you make two copies?
We need one for his family.

194
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:56,918
They're headed down here.

195
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:57,671
Family?

196
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:02,463
He-He's leaving all his stuff to charity,
he doesn't have any family.

197
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,600
Not G! Aww!

198
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,297
- Why would George lie?
- I have no idea.

199
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:11,777
So, he's all alone.

200
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,365
What do you wanna do?

201
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,469
We're going to Steak Night,
and dammit, we're gonna eat it right.

202
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:23,962
Not preferred if you put
your hand right there, buddy.

203
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,604
Yeah, but he likes to be here.

204
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,009
<i>I know it seems callous to leave,</i>

205
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,645
<i>but whoever takes
care of George tonight</i>

206
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,746
<i>will be just as compassionate as us.</i>

207
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,474
Mr. Valentine,
I'm Dr. Mahoney.

208
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,113
My attending really wants me
to connect with my patients

209
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:45,158
so if it's okay with you, I'd thought I'd
get the ball rolling in a personal story.

210
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,544
Okay, you can call me George.

211
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:49,487
Awesome, I'm feeling it.

212
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:52,411
So George, last Friday,
I'm at a bar,

213
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,642
I take this guy home.
He's a little fat, whatever, right?

214
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:58,594
Plus, chubsters are so grateful,
they usually try harder.

215
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:00,271
Anyway,
right in the middle of things,

216
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,519
he's sweating and snorting
like a hairy rhino.

217
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,825
And I just start to hate myself,
like really, really hate myself.

218
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,961
So without even thinking,
I just headbutt him,

219
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,512
right in the face, bam, clock him in
between the eyes and knock him out cold.

220
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,184
So...
That's what I got.

221
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:17,394
What do you got going on?

222
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:19,975
I like golf.

223
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:22,903
<i>When you get down to it,
taking care of a patient</i>

224
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,447
<i>means more than anything.</i>

225
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,651
<i>Even Steak Night.</i>

226
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:28,221
- Hey, George.
- We'll take it from here, chuckles.

227
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:29,938
- Yeah.
- So long.

228
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,285
I think I just saw the Devil.

229
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,780
So, what happened to dinner?

230
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,105
<i>We don't want George to
feel like he was a burden,</i>

231
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,050
<i>so we had to come up
with a great excuse.</i>

232
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,625
Giant oak tree
fell on the restaurant.

233
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,733
What restaurant?

234
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,222
Steak Cookers.

235
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,040
- Maestros.
- Maestros.

236
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,283
Oh man, I used to eat
there all the time.

237
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:58,043
<i>Turk's upset because he thinks
when George gets outta here</i>

238
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,330
<i>he'll drive to Maestros
and see that we lied.</i>

239
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,168
<i>Now he's relieved because he
remembered that George is about to die</i>

240
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,263
<i>and he's never leaving here.</i>

241
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,897
<i>And now he feels guilty
for thinking that thought</i>

242
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,674
<i>and he wants to punish
himself physically</i>

243
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,360
<i>but he can't because
we're with a patient.</i>

244
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,042
Dude, what the hell?

245
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,779
- You wanted me to do that. You know it.
- Okay, fine. Thank you.

246
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,062
So, George, why did you lie about
your family coming to visit you?

247
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:22,142
Uh, I'm a grown man and I don't
need anybody to hold my hand.

248
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,605
Besides, you guys have
better things to do.

249
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:28,881
Hell, you don't even know me.

250
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,880
<i>But right then, we did know George.</i>

251
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:35,954
<i>He was a proud guy who didn't want
us to see how scared he really was.</i>

252
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:37,876
<i>We knew what we had to do.</i>

253
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:40,437
<i>We were gonna get him
past his fear of dying.</i>

254
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,748
<i>Step one:
Get to know him.</i>

255
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,022
So, no family, huh?

256
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:47,795
My wife died. Years ago.

257
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,179
Any kids?

258
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,137
Nope.

259
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,933
<i>It was like pulling teeth!</i>

260
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,815
And what did you guys
do for a living?

261
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,488
Barbara taught history.
I coached football.

262
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:58,996
I played football.
Head defense, safety.

263
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,262
You?

264
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,590
Oh no, I-I didn't, uh,
I didn't play sports, per say.

265
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:09,112
George, I was the, uh, mascot
for the girls' volleyball team.

266
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,286
Really?

267
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,476
Wear a costume?

268
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,517
Oh, great costume,
I wore a bandana and a half-shirt.

269
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,982
At away games,
I wear Spurs,

270
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,369
which, in retrospective, is sort of weird
'cause we weren't the Cowboys.

271
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:24,577
You must have looked
very beautiful.

272
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,494
I felt beautiful.

273
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,671
Guys, quick word?

274
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:34,443
Look, if you wanna hang out with
patients after your shifts are over,

275
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,240
you have to change
into your streets.

276
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,888
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

277
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,593
Can we go?
Cougars only drink free till 9.

278
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,036
- What about MILF's?
- Oh, I forgot I had kids.

279
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,382
<i>Step two:
Just keep babbling until he finally opens up.</i>

280
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,763
I don't know how
I wanna go,

281
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:53,004
but I do know what I
want down with my remains.

282
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:57,041
Are you really comfortable
watching TV like this?

283
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,516
Is it Rowdy?

284
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:00,932
No.

285
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:02,737
Is it JD?

286
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:04,936
Yes!

287
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:06,670
You'll get used to it.

288
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,543
Pretzel?

289
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:15,127
You gotta stop bringing
him into our bedroom.

290
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:18,229
- I'll teach you how to do my hair.
- I already know how to do your hair.

291
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:20,730
It's not an Afro, Turk,
you can't just pick it.

292
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,834
Oh, man.

293
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,963
Did you just
make a noise, George?

294
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:25,525
Come on, George.

295
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,039
Talk to us.

296
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,732
I'll tell you one thing.

297
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,599
I sure didn't think
I'd go like this.

298
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:37,915
<i>Now that George was talking,</i>

299
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,233
<i>he went to a question
everyone goes to first.</i>

300
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,024
So...

301
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,181
Tell me, do you think there's
anything after this life?

302
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:45,398
Definitely.

303
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,394
He already has a first
day in heaven planned out.

304
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,432
It starts with a dip
in the milkshake pool,

305
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,218
then we'll work our
way over to the cloud

306
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,988
where beautiful women spend
quality time with one another.

307
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,407
You know, in a special way.

308
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,761
Like, a lesbian cloud?

309
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,274
Not like a lesbian cloud, George.

310
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:06,198
An actual cloud, full of lesbians.

311
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:10,573
I just hope I die before my wife
so I can have some fun up there.

312
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:14,372
<i>Oh, when Carla dies,
heaven is going to suck!</i>

313
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,662
That's all very nice.

314
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,011
But we can't know for sure.

315
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,122
I know for sure.

316
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:22,811
I'm a man of faith, George.

317
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,716
I've seen people come back
from the brink of death.

318
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,241
And you'd be surprised how
many of them say the same thing.

319
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:32,992
"I saw a white light," and we're
overcome with the feeling of peace.

320
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,383
That's what comfort to me.

321
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,188
Hey, Mr. Valentine!

322
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,866
I re-did your will on a computer

323
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:50,670
and to make it less depressing,
I used a fun font.

324
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,866
Really, Ted, fun font?

325
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,576
I like seeing my name in Squiglees.

326
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,578
Oh yeah, that's the font!

327
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,527
Recognise!

328
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,548
- What's happening?
- It's this new thing Ed came up with.

329
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,452
When you disrespect someone,
and they, in turn, burn your ass

330
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,155
you must... recognise!

331
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:13,169
Fine, Ted, I recognise.

332
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,531
Hell, yeah!

333
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,752
Hell, yeah!

334
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,954
- I hate Ed.
- I know.

335
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,728
Hard to believe.

336
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:23,380
My whole life goes down
to these four pages.

337
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,748
I wondered if
anybody would remember me?

338
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:30,794
Come on, George.

339
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:32,706
When my dad died,

340
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,407
I thought my brother and I were
gonna be the only two to remember him.

341
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:37,689
I was totally wrong.

342
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,366
When we were, uh, growing up,

343
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,522
there was this one
homeless guy in our town.

344
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:48,386
We used to call him
Mr. Long-Beard Stinky Pants.

345
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:52,959
Uh, because he had this
really long beard and, uh, his pants--

346
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:53,689
He gets it.

347
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,067
...they were stinky.

348
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,571
Anyway, every time
we went out to dinner,

349
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:01,455
my father would make us
give him our left-overs.

350
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:03,696
My mom hated that.
She used to be like,

351
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,181
"He's just gonna use those
pork-chops for drugs."

352
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,695
My mom drank a lot.

353
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:14,098
The point is,
a couple months ago,

354
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:18,602
I-I went home and there's this clean,
shaving guy working in the pizzeria.

355
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,933
He takes me aside,
and says,

356
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,658
"Your father was a great man."

357
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:28,878
It was Mr. Long-Beard Stinky Pants.

358
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,075
Although now,
he prefers Kevin.

359
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,158
Anyway, George, I...

360
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,038
I promise you...

361
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,549
People are gonna
remember you the same way.

362
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,163
Thank you very much.

363
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,897
Wow, it's kind of emotional in here.

364
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,428
You guys keep this up eventually,

365
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,797
you'll all get your periods on
the same day, which is kinda cool.

366
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,586
Denise, a quick word.

367
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:58,851
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and
ban you from Mr. Valentine's room.

368
00:15:59,108 --> 00:15:59,825
Whatever.

369
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:00,955
All the patients are stable,

370
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,114
so I'm just gonna go catch
some Z's in the on-call room.

371
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,301
Who's the chubster?

372
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:07,154
I don't know.

373
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,330
Meet me in the on-call room,
pants down, lights off.

374
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,422
I just wanted to say,
"I am so psyched that you called me back--"

375
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:20,891
No, no, no talking.

376
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,931
And if you touch me too much,
God help me, I will headbutt you again.

377
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,493
I love you.

378
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:32,968
<i>And finally, George only had
one fear left to tackle.</i>

379
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,267
At the end...

380
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,966
Is it gonna hurt?

381
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:40,375
No, you won't imagine
the pain you'll have. (sp?)

382
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,613
But how is it gonna happen exactly?

383
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:44,121
Maybe if I knew

384
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,254
what was coming,
I'd be able to handle it better.

385
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,983
Well, uh...

386
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,359
Eventually, it will become
harder for you to breathe.

387
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:55,814
But you won't be gasping for air;
you'll just...

388
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,165
Feel more drowsy.

389
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,817
And as the rest of your organs,

390
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:04,184
begin to fail,

391
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,655
you'll just, sort-of,

392
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,866
go.

393
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:12,572
I'll just go?

394
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,097
I like that.

395
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,267
<i>And there it was, </i>

396
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:24,012
<i>The fear was gone and all
the remain was acceptance.</i>

397
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:31,587
No.

398
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:35,639
No, I know what you
guys are trying to do,

399
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,415
I just can't get over the
fact that one minute I'm here

400
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,242
and the next, I'm not?

401
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,537
<i>And that's when Turk and I
told George how we really felt.</i>

402
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,860
George, I'm terrified of dying.

403
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:46,735
Me too.

404
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,949
But, why'd you lie?

405
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:51,535
We fight death for a living,
every single day,

406
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:54,009
we can't let it know we're afraid
of it or it will kick our ass.

407
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,111
There we are.

408
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,268
Everybody's scared.

409
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,159
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

410
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,658
Oh, well then what in the
hell do I have to hope for?

411
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:10,007
Well if it were me,

412
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,712
I would just hope that my
last thought was a good one.

413
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:17,696
Well then, that's it?

414
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:18,976
That's it.

415
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,053
You thought that was deep?
That was...

416
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,087
That wasn't deep.

417
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,012
Sorry.

418
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,215
I'm over here dying.

419
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,682
That's all,
that's all you can come up with?

420
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,625
<i>Turk and I spent the next
few hours in that room.</i>

421
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:39,033
<i>Just talking...</i>

422
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:40,564
<i>Hanging with George.</i>

423
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,491
When Turk and I were in college,

424
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,978
we were roommates.

426
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,574
Hey...

427
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,064
Guys.

428
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:23,239
I'm getting a little tired.

429
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,597
Okay, well,

430
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,128
take a quick nap.

431
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,928
You guys are gonna be
here when I wake up?

432
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:32,691
Of course!

433
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:36,889
Hey, man...

434
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,277
That beer,

435
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,409
tasted great!

436
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,935
<i>George never did wake up.</i>

437
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:52,406
<i>And even all that talking
didn't make death any easier.</i>

438
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:54,114
<i>At least, not for us.</i>

439
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:58,519
<i>Maybe in the end,
all you can really hope for...</i>

440
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,717
<i>is that your last thought is a nice one.</i>

441
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,562
<i>Even if it's just about the taste</i>

442
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:17,022
<i>of an ice, cold beer.</i>

443
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,306
George was right.

444
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,713
This beer is good.

445
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:26,007
I wouldn't know,
I don't really like beer.

446
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:28,797
Goodbye, George.

447
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:42,554
<i>Action!</i>

448
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:45,068
I have the same nightmare, every time.

449
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:48,417
That I'd die and leave my
family and friends behind.

450
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:51,290
I'm diabetic, so...

451
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:53,627
I'm probably gonna go before him.

452
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:54,611
Hopefully.

453
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:55,499
Dude!

454
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:56,921
I'm gonna have you stuffed.

455
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,274
Carla already said, "No."

456
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,586
I must stuff her too.

457
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:00,767
You promise?

458
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,065
I'm gonna keep her
in the closet, though.

459
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:03,227
Alright, but don't tell her.

460
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,430
She don't need to know nothing.

461
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:06,822
But you're in next to each other.

462
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:07,519
<i>Cut!</i>

463
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,788
<i>We can't use that.
Come on!</i>

464
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,158
