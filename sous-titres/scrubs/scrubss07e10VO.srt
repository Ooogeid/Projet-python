1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:03,561
Time re changing.
Dr. Kelso had quit,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:06,204
so the board had made Dr. Cox
the interim chief of medicine.

3
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:08,833
I don't want everybody
making a big deal out of this.

4
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,576
I'm certainly not going to.

5
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:12,570
- Dr. Cox...
- Chief Dr. Cox.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,618
Right. The board wants to know when
you're coming to the budget meeting.

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:17,999
Tell them I will be right down.

8
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,492
He's on his way.

9
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:22,674
- You're not going, are you?
- Not now, not ever.

10
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,263
How exciting is it that
you run this place now?

11
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:28,167
I'm so proud of you. It's like
a whole new day has dawned.

12
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,746
Do me a big favor there, barboo.

13
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,983
Get that prescription filled for me.

14
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,658
"One chill pill."

15
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,640
That's for you. Unlimited refills.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,519
Hey, chief? I need your approval

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,801
on the settlement letter from the
drug company that makes plomox.

18
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,311
Turns out if diabetics take it,

19
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:43,649
it can cause hypertension
or even death.

20
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,734
Diabetics can die from what?

21
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,445
From not doing the laundry this
morning the way they promised to.

22
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:51,500
Baby, I ain't never
promised to do the laundry.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,195
I promised I'd try to get to it.

24
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,936
And I wasn't able to.

25
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:58,843
You know what? I don't have time

26
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:00,992
for all this plomox crap.

27
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,970
My daughter's having
her shunt removed

28
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,258
Granted, not a
life-threatening procedure,

29
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:07,736
but still, I have to be
there to hold jordan's claw.

30
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,459
And besides, this stuff
happened on bob's watch.

31
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,339
I'm quite certain he'd
want to take care of it.

32
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,261
Won't you please give him a call?

33
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,546
He wasn't receptive.

34
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:28,643
Dr. Kelso's absence wasn't bad news

35
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,541
for everyone in the hospital.

36
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,628
- We have a quorum.
- Thank you, ted.

37
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:37,979
I would like to welcome everyone

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,601
to the new brain trust clubhouse,

39
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,059
or, as I like to call
it, the brain house.

40
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,422
Can I make a motion?

41
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,599
If by a motion you mean
a literal motion

42
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:49,749
in which you simulate
a crude sexual act,

43
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,350
then absolutely not.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,776
- Withdrawn.
- Gentlemen,

45
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,548
the first order
of business is this...

46
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,881
From now on, our tri-daily meetings
will all take place right here.

47
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,357
Can we just take this office?

48
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:03,577
Ted, we live in a
country called america.

49
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:05,156
And in america,

50
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:08,130
every man is free to do
as he or she wishes

51
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,439
and to claim anything he or she
wishes with the simple act of--

52
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,569
Planting a flag.

53
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:16,549
In the same manner, I claimed
my parking space,

54
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,776
the dead opossum
across the street, and doug's sandwich.

55
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,211
How'd he do that?

56
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,329
Thank you.

57
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:27,283
So, I forgot
to do laundry this morning,

58
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:29,029
but I stood up to carla anyway.

59
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,292
Wow. That takes a lot of ball.

60
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:34,837
See, I made it singular 'cause
you only have one manberry.

61
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,513
Not for long.
I'm getting an implant.

62
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:41,251
Why? Is it because your balance
is off? I didn't want to say anything,

63
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,255
but you have been turning
left more often than usual.

64
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,833
No. It's not 'cause... Look.

65
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,200
I don't even care. It's not like
anyone notices.

66
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,931
I never stopped noticing.

67
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,447
Anyway, carla wants me to get it, so now
I have to pick out a prosthetic.

68
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,517
Hello, and welcome to ball mart.

69
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,579
Oh, turk, look at all
the different styles!

70
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,970
This one has a diamond stud in it!

71
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,106
And... and this one says
"i'm with stupid"

72
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,195
and has an arrow
pointing to the real one.

73
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,828
This one has a thermostat
and doubles as a hand warmer!

74
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,184
You know, that would be perfect
for next weekend's ice fishing trip.

75
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,803
I can't believe we all fell
through that hole in the ice!

76
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,941
If we don't warm up soon,
we're all going to die.

77
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:23,742
Hey, why aren't you cold?

78
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,976
All right. Come on.

79
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:33,250
All right. Now,
nobody makes eye contact.

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,152
This is heaven.

81
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:37,770
Careful, y'all.
That bad boy runs hot.

82
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,668
You're telling me.

83
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,087
Hey, guys. How was fishing?

84
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:44,663
It was all right.

85
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:47,480
Best trip ever! Ice fishing five!

86
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,093
Hey.

87
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:55,123
You're going to be late
for your shift.

88
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,864
I got to stop
with the long fantasies.

89
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:00,421
They're never worth it.

90
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:04,859

For The High-Five Team and SeriesSub.com

94
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,608
All right, kid. I expect
updates on my daughter

95
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,153
every 15 minutes. Or what, perry?

96
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,842
You will be let go.

97
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,627
I love that you're the boss now.

98
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,469
Honest to god, it almost
makes you seem attractive.

99
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,533
Thank you. How in the hell did
kelso deal with all this paperwork?

100
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:36,957
What do you want, ted?

101
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,047
Now that you're chief,
i'm your number 2.

102
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,423
I think you'll find me
more than qualified.

103
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,517
I'm hardworking, reliable,

104
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,489
and I recently figured out
how to open up my briefcase.

105
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,579
Congrats. Take a look at that for me,
and grab me a cup of coffee.

106
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,190
No sweat.

107
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,480
Ohh, I just had it.

108
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:03,436
- Dr. Cox...
- Chief Dr. Cox.

109
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,710
Hey. Your initials are c.d.c.

110
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,748
That was my nickname
in my sorority.

111
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,476
- "crying drunk chick."
- Of course.

112
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,089
Anyway. You know
that plomox lawsuit?

113
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,376
Well, last year, I prescribed it
to one of my diabetic patients

114
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:17,085
who might be entitled to
some of that settlement money,

115
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,633
so I was just wondering
if you could have someone

116
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,282
cover my patients
while I go meet with him.

117
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,607
Whatever it takes to
get you to stop talking.

118
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,865
Hey, I'll drive you if we
can pick up sam from daycare

119
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,889
- on the way back.
- Yeah. Thanks.

120
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:27,945
Cool.

121
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,744
I just want you to know

122
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:32,380
my thoughts and prayers
are with your daughter.

123
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,395
Can you make him stop talking?

124
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,250
I've tried for 7 years.

125
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,539
It can't be done.

126
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:43,255
Ok. Izzie is down for her nap.

127
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,848
What's with the champagne?

128
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,688
Celebration. Izzie
sleeping through the night

129
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,377
and us finally finding
a nanny who's not a thief.

130
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:52,760
I still don't think we
needed to fire Mrs. Norton

131
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,242
just because she ate the
last of your rice pudding.

132
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,543
I wrote my name on it, ok?

133
00:05:57,643 --> 00:06:00,303
No! It's... no, wait. I wrote my...

134
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:01,727
Sorry.

135
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,145
The point is, for the first
time since you were pregnant,

136
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,232
I feel like we finally
have time to be us again.

137
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,030
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it!

138
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,656
- Let me do it.
- Baby, come on. No. No.

139
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,463
- I know how to do it.
- Just c... look.

140
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:16,218
Baby, I got it. Look what...

141
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,886
Baby...

142
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:21,483
To us.

143
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,419
Ted, what are you doing?

144
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,118
I'm bringing a cup of coffee to Dr. Cox.

145
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:31,197
Why? That's not your job.

146
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,714
Come on. You got
a fresh start here.

147
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:34,927
You going to stick to the same
dynamic you had with Dr. Kelso?

148
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,442
Remember how that started?

149
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:41,897
Hi, Dr. Kelso. Theodore
buckland, licensed attorney.

150
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,649
Ted, Before you get started...

151
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,463
And trust me, I hate asking this...

152
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:49,385
Would you mind doing me one tiny,
little, non-work-related favor?

153
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,451
No problem, man.

154
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,723
Make sure you get the
backside of that grill.

155
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,800
I hit the neighbor's cat
last night.

156
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,182
Quick little bastard. I had
to cross 2 lanes to get him.

157
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,941
My point is, you could
be a whole new ted.

158
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,565
Now, come on. Turn around.

159
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,873
Chest out. Stand tall.
Chin up. Blink your eyes real fast.

160
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,841
Just kidding. That was
for me. Give me that.

161
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,828
- Don't you have to clean that up?
- Not on tuesdays.

162
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:20,009
I want you to get in there and
tell Dr. Cox what's what.

163
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,726
- Dr. Cox?
- Chief Dr. Cox.

164
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,439
Chief Dr. Cox, i'm a lawyer.

165
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,567
I shouldn't have to get you coffee.

166
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,553
How do you feel about that?

167
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,458
Can't even pretend to care.

168
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,326
Fine. No more getting me coffee.

169
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:37,974
Yeah!

170
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,935
Yeah!

171
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,071
Yeah!

172
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,987
Is this really that
big of a moment for you?

173
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,315
Yeah!

174
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,581
Ugh. My patient's running late.

175
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:52,319
Why are we meeting him here?

176
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,117
Because the last time I met
a patient at their house,

177
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,506
I ended up at the news.

178
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,622
- Was that the crack raid?
- It was.

179
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,266
We're just going to wait?

180
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:04,139
I wish turk was here. I wonder
what he's doing right now.

181
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,463
I just want to make sure
everything's normal.

182
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,805
I'm only feeling one testicle.

183
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,504
Yeah, you are.

184
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,870
Why do you wish turk was here?

185
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,528
I don't know. We goof around.

186
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,517
Why can't you goof around with me?

187
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,095
Elliot, our friendship is
different than mine and turk's.

188
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,505
I can goof around, j.d.

189
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,488
I can goof around hard.

190
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,124
- Really?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,635
Then follow me.

192
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,111
And now, we wait.

193
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,585
Hey, Mr. Middle eastern manager guy.

194
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:46,415
I hope you got a tight
grip on that drink.

195
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,405
One cheeseburger and fries...

196
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:59,952
All right. You're going to hold on
to that new confidence, yeah?

197
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:03,112
There's cindy. Let me see
the new ted in action.

198
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:04,532
Hey, cindy.

199
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,845
I want to make you pregnant.

200
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,910
How did I do?

201
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,963
For the first time, I'm
looking down at your bald head,

202
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,904
and I'm not just seeing
my reflection.

203
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,363
I'm seeing a man. Come on.

204
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,818
Nice work on the renovation, boys.

205
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,358
We also had an organ donor
come into the morgue today,

206
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,375
so I'd like to introduce
our new mascot...

207
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:29,911
Barry morris' brain.

208
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,959
I dub that gross. Second?

209
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,831
Ok. Noting the minutes as gross.

210
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:37,205
Now, next order
of business... activities.

211
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:39,249
I had an idea for tonight.

212
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:43,259
- Why don't we play cards?
- It's tuesday, ted.

213
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,612
On tuesdays, you guys clean
the hospital, remember?

214
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,383
We went over this when
I threw down your coffee.

215
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,298
I want to play cards!

216
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,915
I am not being ridiculous.

217
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,991
To be safe, I'm going to line
your boxers with bubble wrap.

218
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,003
- Esta loca.
- Look.

219
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,167
We haven't talked about
whether we want another kid,

220
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,928
and if something happened,

221
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,139
I just don't that
decision to be made for us.

222
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,974
No decision's been made.

223
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,521
Are you sure?

224
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,670
I know there's only one down there,

225
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,127
but he's the better one.

226
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,987
He's like tina turner
after she left ike...

227
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,455
Stronger, more confident,

228
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,863
and is going to have a
very successful solo career.

229
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,114
Ok?

230
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:23,929
Ok.

231
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,370
It's funny every time.

232
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,769
Are you Dr. Reed?

233
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:32,440
- I'm adam candy.
- I never treated you.

234
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,679
Oh, great. I called the wrong one.

235
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,830
Wait. If you weren't my patient,

236
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,921
then why did you agree
to meet me here?

237
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,900
- You said there might be money.
- Well, there isn't. J.d., let's go.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,494
Wait. This looks promising.

239
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,325
The truth is, we bring most
of our trouble on ourselves,

240
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:50,134
whether it's creating a
monster in your own ranks...

241
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,389
Ok. So, everyone has their mop.

242
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,228
Why do we always have
to do what you want to do?

243
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,210
Or pulling a prank that causes
an irate customer

244
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,239
to yank a fast food manager
through a window

245
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,703
and drive off with him.

246
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,309
What are you doing?

247
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,473
That's new.

248
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,958
Yep. Even something as simple
as opening a bottle of champagne

249
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,870
can have huge ramifications.

250
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,499
Still bubbly.

251
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,393
So, are we still celebrating
the same thing as before?

252
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:25,100
No. I want another baby, now.

253
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,856
You want another minute
to think about it?

254
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:39,816
Yeah. Ok.

255
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:47,733
The manager's fine.
Luckily, he maced the driver

256
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,044
with a packet of hot sauce
before they got to the freeway.

257
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,736
Ok. He doesn't know you
caused this, so stay calm.

258
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,635
- Any more information I should know?
- yes. But not about this.

259
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,691
We're doctors. We like
to give out health tips.

260
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,452
You should wear sunscreen, even
with your dark complexion.

261
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,361
Nice save.

262
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,303
We did it. We put up the sign.

263
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:06,118
You should also stay hydrated.

264
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:08,401
J.d., we have to take
responsibility, ok?

265
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,908
You going to cuff us?

266
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,688
For a paper sign? No.

267
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,726
You know how many people
get shot around here?

268
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,828
She probably does. You know she
got caught on tv in a crack den?

269
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,035
Why?

270
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:20,290
I'm sure he probably
knows. It's on the docket.

271
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,409
Ok. There's one thing we have to remember,

272
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,628
and that's that I decide
what's best for the brain trust.

273
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,881
I thought this was a democracy.

274
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,738
Oh. Then it's just
miscommunication.

275
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,048
No. The brain trust is
a dictatorship

276
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,392
masquerading as a democracy.

277
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:39,603
I know that you all
remember when I seized power

278
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:42,511
during the revolution
of '02, when I overthrew kyle

279
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,976
during the battle of the
basement supply closet.

280
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:47,227
Or have you forgotten your history?

281
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:51,510
Well, maybe I'll just
start my own brain trust.

282
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,100
You can't. Brain trust
is a registered trademark.

283
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,289
I own that name. And chanel.

284
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,084
Well, maybe i'll just call it
the brain bunch.

285
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:01,629
You wouldn't dare.

286
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,473
Whoo! Brain bunch!

287
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,747
I'm staying. Brain trust!

288
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,189
You mind switching? You
know this guy makes me crazy.

289
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,506
Oh, fine.

290
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:14,087
- Whoo! Brain trust!
- Brain bunch!

291
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,651
Ok. I'm ready to tell you what I think.

292
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,757
I think pregnancy
was really tough on you

293
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,140
and the post-partum stuff put
a strain on our relationship.

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,909
And we finally got our life back, and
so, it's really hard to think about

295
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,951
having another baby right now.

296
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:35,709
There, I said it.

297
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,927
Kick my ass now, if you want.

298
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:40,244
Turk, I'm not mad.

299
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:43,066
To do this, we both have to be onboard.

300
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,167
Just...

301
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,974
Promise me you'll
keep thinking about it.

302
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,479
Yeah. Come here.

303
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,773
Hey. Did you know that
women actually have a hormone

304
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,133
that helps them forget all
that horrible pregnancy stuff?

305
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,850
Really? That's interesting,
'cause men have a hormone

306
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,300
that helps them forget about
sleeping with fat chicks.

307
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,829
You used that hormone a lot when
you were younger, didn't you?

308
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,515
Frick.

309
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,421
I can't find adam candy.

310
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:12,809
All right. What was he wearing
the last time you saw him?

311
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,730
J.d., that was 3 years ago.

312
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,063
Why do you care so much
if this guy gets money?

313
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,719
I didn't ask for your help, ok?

314
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,923
What's going on here?

315
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,348
This is a brain trust table.

316
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,877
I don't see your flag on it.

317
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,661
That's 'cause we're
not using flags anymore.

318
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:34,777
We're using, uh... Napkin holders.

319
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,273
There. Brain trust table.

320
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,061
Those 2 should have
their own sitcom.

321
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:45,895
I'm a lawyer

322
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,467
I'm a janitor

323
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,515
together, we adopted
a cute little kid

324
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,893
we're legal custodians

325
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,677
get it?

326
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,580
I'd watch that show.

327
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,788
Would you?

328
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:02,699
Dr. Cox please report
to the board meeting?

329
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,952
Dr. Cox.

330
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,710
Chief Dr. Cox.

331
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,310
Correction Chief Dr. Cox.

332
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,670
- That was weird.
- Nah, it's not so weird.

333
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,922
I'm just having them do the
announcements right over there.

334
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,430
Hey, jordan, you look nice today.

335
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:19,185
Thank you.

336
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,744
What's the deal there, gumball?

337
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:24,098
Carla wants another kid,
but I'm not sure yet.

338
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,696
I can't help but go to
a dark place, you know.

339
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:29,259
We're already blessed with this
beautiful, healthy daughter.

340
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,993
What if the amino comes back

341
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,263
and it's the worst possible news...

342
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,855
It's another girl?

343
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:38,347
- You're having another baby?
- I don't know yet.

344
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:41,008
I'll tell you what I don't know,
what I'm going to do about new ted.

345
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,299
Who's he talking to?

346
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,726
Another baby would be so cool, dude.

347
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,095
- Old ted was cool.
- Which one is ted?

348
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:48,950
Did he have a baby
with the janitor?

349
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,357
Only in their sitcom.

350
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,328
Legal custodians

351
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:53,997
get it?

352
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,258
You people are driving me crazy.

353
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,101
You know who's driving me crazy? Elliot.

354
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:01,175
She's obsessed with getting money for
one of her patients who took plomox.

355
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,077
I should have more patience
with new ted.

356
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,017
He means the other kind
of patience, right?

357
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:07,041
I'm not sure. I'm lost.

358
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,443
I'm lost, too.

359
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:09,758
Me, too.

360
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,432
How do I make this decision?

361
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:13,339
That decision has
already been made.

362
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,060
If carla wants to
have another baby,

363
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,499
she's going to have another baby.

364
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,993
The one thing you got to focus on

365
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,177
is getting something out
of this deal for yourself.

366
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,619
I created new ted, so I
should deal with it myself.

367
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,268
Thank you very much.

368
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:26,448
Glad to be of help. I'm out.

369
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,458
You want to get
something good from carla?

370
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:31,994
You got to just pretend that you
really don't even want another kid.

371
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:33,237
But that's not true.

372
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:36,013
Yeah, but you walk around this
hospital acting like you have 2 testicles,

373
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:39,000
- and that's damn sure not true.
- And I'm in.

374
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,902
We're having a fake one put in.

375
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:42,824
If carla wants to have
a baby so badly,

376
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:44,554
why would she insist
you have a surgery

377
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,818
that could potential harm
your one working nut?

378
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,200
Carla doesn't want the prosthetic.

379
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:52,109
- I do.
- Why would you lie?

380
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,173
Sometimes, you say you're
doing something for someone else

381
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,287
when you really want
to do it for yourself.

382
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,264
I get it. Maybe that's
what elliot's doing.

383
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:01,890
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm just doing this thing

384
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,481
where I use a slice of wisdom
from someone else's life

385
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,564
to solve a problem in my own life.

386
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:08,062
Seems coincidental.

387
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,043
And yet, I do it almost every week.

388
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:15,559
Good news. Jennifer's procedure
is done, and we get to leave this room.

389
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,034
I'm not quite sure which
one I'm more excited about.

390
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:19,545
Come, now.

391
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,313
It was never about him, was it?

392
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,203
It was about you.

393
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:33,193
Your patient adam candy...

394
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,829
You thought you killed him.

395
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,883
Forgive me for being one
of those weird doctors

396
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,183
who's concerned they might
have killed a human being.

397
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,905
Well, I checked
with county records,

398
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,460
and, uh, your patient did die.

399
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:47,686
He was hit by a truck.

400
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,089
Yes.

401
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:53,336
So, it wasn't the plomox?
He didn't have a heart attack?

402
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:54,907
He may have, you know,

403
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,036
in the split second before the truck
hit him. It's hard to know for sure.

404
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,096
Why didn't you tell me
the truth, elliot?

405
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,922
What, because we're
such great friends?

406
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:06,973
J.d., after hanging out with me for
10 minutes at that fast food place,

407
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:08,841
you were wishing
that turk was there.

408
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,941
And that hurt your feelings?

409
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,906
I was psyched to hang out with you,

410
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:14,731
so psyched that I even caused

411
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:17,762
some middle eastern man to
get kidnapped and driven away,

412
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:19,915
which is probably
the exact kind of thing

413
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,917
he came to this country to avoid.

414
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,825
I'm off, and as you can see,

415
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:28,146
sam is jonesing
for his afternoon latte.

416
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,343
Want to join us?

417
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:33,016
Why? Because you feel guilty?

418
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,931
No. Because I want
to hang out with you.

419
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:44,151
Don't look at him.

420
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,906
There are many ways
to restore a relationship.

421
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,816
Whether it's by extending
an olive branch...

422
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,974
What the hell are you doing here?

423
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,649
Take it easy. Just hear me out.

424
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,658
I would like to call to order
tonight's meeting of the brain trust.

425
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:00,932
First item of business,
tomorrow night's activities. Ted?

426
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:03,649
I believe you think it
would be fun to play cards.

427
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,117
Well, as a matter of fact, I did.

428
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,245
Or by striking a bargain.

429
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:11,168
Still not sure
about this baby thing.

430
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:14,684
I just think we've been so connected
lately, and I really don't want to lose that.

431
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,504
How can I convince you
that we won't?

432
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,486
Agree to have sex with
me every day for 2 months.

433
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:19,752
- One month.
- ok.

434
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,544
But that means if I
tap you on your shoulder

435
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,216
and you're in
the middle of something,

436
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,943
you got to drop it like
it's hot and give it to daddy.

437
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,996
- Deal.
- Deal.

438
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:30,909
Or by making a good
friend feel like just that.

439
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:34,111
Hey, guys, the barista
said sam looked like us.

440
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,055
It's so weird how people
think that we're the parents.

441
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,942
Well, I understand why
they think he looks like me,

442
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,063
'cause we both have blue eyes
and have the little button nose,

443
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:43,162
but you, it's probably
the finger toes,

444
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:45,935
'cause you both have crazy long
toes. So, What do you guys think?

445
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:47,474
Where did they go?

446
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,087
I don't know. I don't know.

447
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,637
You are the cutest.

448
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,823
He loves that. Do it again.

449
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:58,990
