1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:05,206
<i>(j.D.) sacred heart--
eight years of great memories.</i>

2
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:08,610
<i>This place will live forever.</i>

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,912
<i>They tore down
the old crappy hospital</i>

4
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,515
<i>And rebuilt it
on the med school campus.</i>

5
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,783
<i>I'm just back
to teach some classes.</i>

6
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:18,920
<i>First, though, I need to do
my morning good luck ritual.</i>

7
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:21,990
And seven.
That's one good luck kiss

8
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,058
For every month
you've been in there.

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,694
Are you done yet?
Not yet.

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,497
And thank you for making
mommy's boobs so much bigger.

11
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:31,166
They're almost jugs.

12
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,469
Seriously, I think I can
probably rest 'em on your head.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,571
Check it out.
Okay. Yeah.

14
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:40,475
Whoa! Talk about
a 10-gallon hat.
(chuckles) how cool is that?

15
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:44,712
Donny, no questions right now,
okay? This is private.
They're still looking.

16
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:48,016
I said this is private!
Turn around!

17
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,519
That was heavy.
Hey, do good today.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,988
Bye.
Bye.

19
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,393
I can still feel them
on my head.

20
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:01,963
How sweet is he?

21
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:05,300
<i>Part of me hates
how familiar this seems.</i>

22
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,136
<i>I hope I can find a way
to make this all feel new.</i>

23
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:10,138
<i>(woman) oh, my god.
The first day of med school.</i>

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:13,141
<i>Everything is so new. I mean,
just look at all these people</i>

25
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:16,311
<i>Who don't know that I used to
wear a back brace.</i>

26
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:18,913
<i>I can look left.</i>

27
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:22,784
<i>Yep, new sights, new sounds,
even new smells.</i>

28
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,920
Kiwi.

29
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,289
What?
I smell kiwi.

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,992
Yeah, it's my shampoo.
I love kiwis, okay?

31
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:33,461
I love them, too!
Actually, that's not true.

32
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:35,997
They're hairy.
They look like monkey nuts.

33
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:38,032
Don't smell people.
It's weird.

34
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,001
I'm lucy.

35
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,103
I don't care!

36
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:45,039
<i>Regroup, lucy. Find an ally.</i>

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,709
Hi. I'm lucy.

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,111
Cool. Hey, after class,

39
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,947
You want to go somewhere,
get weird with each other?

40
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:56,251
I feel like you skipped
a few steps.
Hey, come on. You already know
if you're in or out.

41
00:01:56,252 --> 00:02:03,591
So what's the deal, girl?

42
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:06,761
Not interested.

43
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:09,130
Medicine is...

44
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,368
Well, it's a dead career.

45
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,937
Thanks to insurance companies
and malpractice lawyers,

46
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:19,040
You have absolutely no hope

47
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,976
Of finding a rewarding
or satisfying profession

48
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:24,946
In this once noble field.

49
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:29,217
The only exception to this very
true rule is the following--

50
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:34,155
<i>If you are lucky enough to go
to a great medical school,</i>

51
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:39,427
Then, my children,
you got a real shot.

52
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:43,064
Because to call this particular
school a "crap house"

53
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:45,166
Would be
an honest-to-god compliment.

54
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,902
Plus, m the only teacher here
worth a damn,

55
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,705
And I already hate
each and every one of you.

56
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,374
Would you like to know why?

57
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,842
Well, it turns out

58
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:57,045
You're not actually
medical studen at all.

59
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,180
You are all murderers
and assassins

60
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,283
That have been sent here
to try to kill my patients.

61
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,118
Here's the bottom line--

62
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:07,088
If you do get a good clean kill
on a patient,

63
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:12,760
Go ahead and take a pinkie
or an ear as a trophy.

64
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,363
I am ready for you,
have been for a while,

65
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,032
So watch your ass. Good day.

66
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,835
Okay. I hope everyone enjoyed
orientation with dr. Cox.

67
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,171
I'm dr. Mahoney,
your student advisor.

68
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:27,175
Here's some crappy pizza.

69
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,876
Joining us, gramps?

70
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,479
You know, 'cause you're old
for a med student.

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,115
They told me to give out
fun nicknames for team building.

72
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:36,417
It's working.

73
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,752
Look, uh, drew,

74
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:41,222
I don't like dealing with,
well, people.

75
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:44,058
And all these kids
obviously look up to you.

76
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,028
I've never spoken
to any of these people.

77
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,130
I can still feel a bond,
and I thought,

78
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,466
Why don't you deal with
the whiny, emotional stuff?

79
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,635
And in return,
I will let you do that.

80
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:57,739
Look, just, uh, let me fly
under the radar.

81
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,877
Please.

82
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,280
I guess I should answer any
annoying questions you all have.

83
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,282
Yeah, monkey nuts.

84
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,952
Uh, I just wanted to thank you,
on behalf of all of us,

85
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,687
For getting us pizza.

86
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,189
<i>There. Smelling incident fixed.</i>

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,258
<i>Yeah, they gave me money
to do it,</i>

88
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,227
Along with
free room and board

89
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,262
To attend
to your emotional needs.

90
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:23,798
Speaking of which,
little administrative thing--

91
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,767
If you're going to
kill yourself--

92
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,735
I'm looking at you,
sad eyes--

93
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,804
Do it off campus,

94
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,573
'cause it is a buttload
of paperwork.

95
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,809
All right, everyone,
pay attention,

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,447
Because my spleen is right here.

97
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,015
Whoops!

98
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,284
This feels more like
my private-time area.

99
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,654
Wouldn't it be easier if you
could see what you were doing?

100
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,956
This is the way I'm doing it,
cole!

101
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,958
Or maybe
you're just uncomfortable

102
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,028
Because it's a black man's head
on a fake white man's body.

103
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,864
That's right, people.
It just got real up in here.

104
00:04:56,865 --> 00:05:00,001
In my class,
you will each be graded

105
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:04,739
By the color of your skin.

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,940
F's.

107
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,275
There he is.

108
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,643
Yes!

109
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,216
Dude!
What the hell are you doing?!

110
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,251
I thought
it'd be more dramatic

111
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,253
If we spotted each other
from afar

112
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,389
<i>And then ran
to see each other!</i>

113
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,357
But now if we meet
in the middle,

114
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:25,359
We'll wind up somewhere
inside the hospital,

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,196
And this really feels like
more of an outside thing!

116
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,164
If you count to ten
before you run,

117
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:34,435
I should be able to get
downstairs and over to you!
I'm already counting!

118
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,338
Three, four...

119
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,007
Hey, dr. Turk.
Not now, denise.

120
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:42,310
Turk!

121
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,766
<i>I'm late. Gotta go.</i>

122
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,808
Mm.
Mm. You smell like prison.

123
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,245
When was the last time
you guys saw each other?

124
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,779
This morning. We carpooled.

125
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,982
But we haven't worked together
in over a year.

126
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:24,485
You know
what I'd like to do now?
Is it go to vermont
anmake this thing legal?

127
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,988
Talk to the hand.
Remember that?

128
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:30,024
(high-pitched voice) eagle!

129
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,893
(normal voice)
oh, hey, perry.

130
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:34,328
I'm really looking forward
to teaching wi you.

131
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,998
Onward.
(high-pitched voice) eagle!

132
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,635

I'll have you know
this is the very jacket

136

Worn by michelle pfeiffer
in "dangerous minds."

137
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,979
All I had to do was sew
these elbow patches on

138
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,014
And take the shoulder pads out.
Hmm.

139
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,317
By the way, what ever
happened to the janitor?

140
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:11,753
Oh, dude. It was
the day after you left...

141
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,989
When's that little buddy
of yours coming back?

142
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:17,926
He's never coming back.
He's gone for good.
He's right here, isn't he?

143
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,095
Where would I be hiding him?

144
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,497
But he's coming back...
No.

145
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,266

saw him again.

Dr. Kelso,
what are you doing her

149
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,016
I'm teaching
a couple of classes.

150
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,085
J.D.'s gonna teach here, too.

151
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,053
<i>(chuckles) oh, turk,
sometimes I'll teach them.</i>

<i>Sometimes they'll teach me,</i>

153
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,691
But we're always going to
inspire each other.

154
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,994
You're still
such an odd little fruit.

155
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,029
Is that woman's jacket?

156
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:57,065
No, it's a man's small.
Yes, it's actually the jacket
from "dangerous minds."

157
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,035
He doesn't need to know that.

158
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,971
Dr. Kelso, I heard about
enid's passing. I'm so sorry.

159

Well, you bottom out,

160
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,009
And then you persevere.

161
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:10,645
(wspers) yeah.
I feel like I can say
the worst is over.

162
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:13,315
How long ago did she pass?
About two days.

163

I'm a frequent flier.

164
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,620
Congrats, I guess.

165
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:22,024
No, no, no. That means I'm in
and out of the hospital a lot.
Oh.

166
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,726
Ben. Ischemic bowel disease.

167
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,895

No stealing food

I saw that. Spit it out.

172
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:40,075
Now eat it again.

173
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:43,311
<i>At least we know
you're a good listener.
Score!</i>

174
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,414
You should all follow 19's lead,

175
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:49,284
And I call her "19," because
instead of using your names,

176
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:51,853
I'm going to go by where
you currently rank in my hd.

177
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:54,689
Now who can tell me what artery

178
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:58,393
Goes above the optic chiasm
to the cerebral hemispheres?

179
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:00,162
Supermodel in the back.

180
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,164
(australian accent)
I'm fairly certain

181
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,966
It's the anterior
cerebral artery.
What?

182
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,305
I'm not understanding a word
ththat she's saying,l artery.

183
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,340
And, people,
I can teach anyone.

184
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:15,110
You just gotta speak english.

185
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,579
I'm australian.
Still not getting it.

186
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,315
Everyone, leave. (whistles)

187
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,219
I'm sorry
about the grape thing.

188
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:28,457
Oh, don't sweat it, 42.
Is my number going down
because I'm talking to you?

189
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,329
Why was michael in my room?

190
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:37,332
His name isn't michael.
Well, he has a weird
serbian name that I can't say,

191
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,334
So I'm calling him michael.
He loves it.

192
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,903
I don't. My name is ilyevic.

193
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,438
Mike, just go.

194
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,441
<i>Young michael informed me
that you told everyone</i>

195
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,610
To come to me
with their personal problems.

196
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,846
Yeah, I did.
I checked on you.

197
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:52,814
You've already been
to med school

198
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:54,816
Once already
when you were 21.

199
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,919
And you didn't just flame out,
you, like, you went nuclear.

200
00:09:57,987 --> 00:10:00,388
Seriously, how was prison?
It was cold.

201
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,425
You couldn't just let me be.
Well, I'm gonna take

202
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:06,228
The high road and not mention
your mannish voice

203
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:09,131
And all the pictures you have
in here of your friends.

204
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:12,634
Tell me,
which one's your b.F.F.?
You are a giant douche.

205
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:14,836
I know.

206
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,638
Want to take a shower
together?

207
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,507
Fine.

208
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:22,244
I know you think you're so hot,
but I'm not a fan.

209
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:28,817
Hey, I'm not happy about this
either, okay?

210
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:31,786
Welcome
to internal medicine, gang.

211
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:35,090
My name is dr. John dorian.

212
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,959
Hey,
should we be taking notes?

213
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,761
That's a good question, fellow.

214
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:41,863
What I'll tell you is
I don't like to really stop.

215
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:43,398
That ruins my flow.

216
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,535
So what I'm gonna do is give
a subtle nod like so...

217
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,603
As a signal, okay?

218
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,772
Now back to my name.

219
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,674
I prefer "dr. D.,"
or in a pinch, "dr. Dizzle."

220
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,710
But if you see me
out in the quad--
there is no quad.

221
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:59,214
I'm not a big fan of the t.A.S
doing a lot of speaking, denise.

222
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,682
Okay?

223
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:03,018
Oh, wait. Wait. That was
an accidental nod, you guys.

224
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,587
No note taking.
No note taking, okay?

225
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:08,990
Now if you see me
out in the quad...

226
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,893
I want you to think of me
as more than your teacher.

227
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:15,363
I'm also your friend, all right?

228
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,933
Okay, we're definitely
gonna need a new signal

229
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,402
For the note-taking thing.

230
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,671
This guy's trying
to die on me again.

231
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,340
Who wants to play
patient roulette?

232
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,008
<i>Please not me. Please not me.</i>

233
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:34,482
There ain't no use runnin',
little girl!

234
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:37,252
First one to bring me
a med student gets a juicy bone.

235
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:40,021
He gets a juicy bone.
You gotta yell!

236
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,259
91, here's how we play.

237
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,995
I'm not gonna do anything
to help this dying man

238
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,397
Until you answer these
three very simple questions--

239
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:51,233
At is it called
when a blood clot

240
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,335
Occludes a branch
of the pulmonary artery?

241
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,370
What is it called when
tuberculosis affects the spine?

242
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,273
And what was the name
of the african nba center

243
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:01,009
Who did this
whenever he blocked a shot?

244
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,745
Oh, I'd hurry.
His heart's slowing down.

245
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,780
And he's dead,

246
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:08,316
Not because of you.
I'm not insane.

247
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,019
He was dead
when we walked over here.

248
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,456
But just a stunningly
horrible job nonetheless.

249
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,962
All right. We finally found
a signal that works--jazz hands.

250
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,163
Love it.

251
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,299
Guys, tomorrow you'll be divided
into groups,

252
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,301
And you'll be given
your cadavers.

253
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,603
So great first day, everybody.

254
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,539
Who wants to keep this party
going?

255
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,509
If so,
meet me back here at 6:00.

256
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,145
I will have beers, on me.

257
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:40,148
Everyone take a mixed cd
on their way out.

258
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,451
For those of you who are fans
of a young miss miley cyrus,

259
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,353
I recommend the green ones.

260
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:48,290
She's heavily featured.

261
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,259
Dr. Cox?
Professor.

262
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,495
Professor cox?
Actually it's both.

263
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,197
Dr. Professor cox?
Yes?

264
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,034
Sometimes I feel like you're
not even trying to teach me.

265
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:01,036
I'm not.
I generally don't waste time

266
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:05,307
With people
who aren't gonna make it.
Oh. Thanks.

267
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:07,208
<i>Thanks?</i>

268
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,683
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a sec?

269
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:18,086
What do you want?
Well, um, I get the whole
trial-by-fire thing--

270
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:21,222
And you're wonderful at it,
really.
Don't ever touch me.

271
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,858
Sorry. Um, but you seem
to go out of your way

272
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,694
To pick on the weakest kids.

273
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,263
Ybe you could,
I don't know, not do that.

274
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,865
Thank you for the feedback.
It's invaluable.

275
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,001
You don't mean that, do you?
I don't.

276
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,970
And since you don't see yourself
as one of the weak ones,

277
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,506
Maybe a good solution
would be for me to unload

278
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:41,443
My years of rage and frustration
and pain onto your head

279
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,445
And your head alone.

280
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:46,214
Are--are we locked down to that,
or can we keep spitballing here?

281
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,116
Very locked in.

282
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,584
Looking forward to it.

283
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,823
Not you. Just something I say
whenever I'm pissed...

284
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,492
When I'm with a whore.

285
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,794
Whoa!

286
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,963
None of them showed up.

287
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:04,099
I got us all these
glow-in-the-dark necklaces

288
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,735
So we wouldn't lose each other
when we were out on the town.

289
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,870
It's their first day
of med school.

290
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,406
Come on.
You remember how we were.

291
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,743
Nerds!
Losers!

292
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:17,245
(bicycle bell tinkles)
I feel so alive.

293
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:22,817
Everybody at that party
had sex.

294
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:26,187
No.

295
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:28,256
<i>(j.D.) we all go through life</i>

296
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,425
<i>Worrying about
what other people think of us.</i>

297
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:39,267
Man, I must be
the worst teacher ever.

298
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,603
<i>The truth ,
the harshest words</i>

299
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:45,340
<i>Are the ones we say
about ourselves.</i>

300
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,642
You okay, sweetie?

301
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:50,345
No, ben.

302
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,647
I don't belong here.

303
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,858
<i>(lucy)
I was so depressed yesterday.</i>

304
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:00,828
<i>To cheer myself up, I made what
I think is a great decision.</i>

305
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:02,763
<i>Sometimes one perfect night</i>

306
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,532
<i>Can change your whole outlook
on life.</i>

307
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:09,803
(camera phone shutter clicks)

308
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:13,674
<i>Yep. I've got a good feeling
about this guy.</i>

309
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,679
Hey, darling. I'm dr. Cole.
I'll be your physician.

310
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:21,482
So... What are we dealing
with here?

311
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:25,018
Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
Oh, giant drag.

312
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,186
Hey.

313
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,588
Come here.

314
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:30,224
Hope you enjoyed your last day
of med school.

315
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,493
Yeah, I don't see it.
I'm sorry. What?

316
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,561
You know that bust
you pass on your way

317
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,463
To pick up
your tiny paycheck?

318
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:39,533
Notice any resemblance?
Symmetric features, strong jaw.

319
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:42,636
Yeah, that's my pop-pop--
paid for this whole building.

320
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,638
So here's the skinny--
I'm teflon.

321
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:47,541
You can fire bullets at me
if you want, but be careful.

322
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,511
When they ricochet off me,
they sometimes hit other people.

323
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:52,412
Pa-chi. Pa-ching.

324
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,814
Don't pa-chi me.

325
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:57,251
Pa-ching.
Don't you pa-ching me!

326
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:00,420
<i>My dad always says
every day is a new day.</i>

327
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,856
<i>So today I'm gonna
be confident, strong,</i>

328
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:04,992
<i>And nothing will knock me
off my game.</i>

329
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:08,662
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>

330
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,464
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

331
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:12,432
Has anyone seen
the crash cart?

332
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,935
Ah, it's, uh,
over by bed four.

333
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,905
Now can you make that out?

334
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,940
I think I heard the words
"bear fight,"

335
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,609
But that makes no sense.

336
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,578
You're right.
That's super fun.

337
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,414
I love doing things with you.
Thanks, perry. I needed that.

338
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:30,317
I'm having a little trouble
getting my teacher groove going.

339
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:33,754
Maybe you suck at it.
Why do you have to lash out,
perry?

340
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:36,957
Stay open for business
in here,

341
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,525
In your heart cage.

342
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:41,128
I guess I'm just tired
of weeding out the weak

343
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:45,232
To protect the rest of the herd,
like I always do.
Maybe you could mix it
up a little.

344
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,068
Try in-investing emotionally
in one of them.

345
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:51,138
A kid stood o me
just the other day,

346
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:54,041
And... I kind of felt
connected to him.

347
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,609
Good, good, good.

348
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:57,844
I'm--I'm sure
you probably knew him

349
00:16:57,912 --> 00:17:00,380
For--for all of 30 seconds.
It's not like I tried

350
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:04,251
For--for eight years or anything
to get your love.
I thought we were over this.

351
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,922
<i>I'm drowning here.
I wish there was just someone</i>

352
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,492
<i>Who could fly up
and rescue me from all this.</i>

353
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,494
<i>(j.D.) I feel like
I'd get back on track</i>

354
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:17,497
<i>If I could just find
one student to connect with--</i>

355
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,499
<i>One kid that really needs me.</i>

356
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,369
<i>I mean, that's what it's
all about, right? Reaching out.</i>

357
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,506
What's your name?
Drew.

358
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:29,109
I'm taking an interest
in you.

359
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:30,811
Carry on.

360
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,946
That's not good for me,
is it?

361
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:34,948
Drew, you know I d care.

362
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:37,584
Come on. Grab me like a man.
Let's do this.

363
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:41,622
Ah, what up, dizzle?

364
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:44,124
You dropped something.

365
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,993
I got it.

366
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,528
<i>I'm not always a believer
in serpity,</i>

367
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:52,733
<i>But sometimes the world
just brings things together.</i>

368
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,503
I was chasing that,
so it's mine.

369
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:59,072
It's a naked picture of me.

370
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,541
It fell out
of that cole kid's notebook.

371
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,944
Oh, don't be sad.

372
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,579
It's just--oh, wow!

373
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:09,082
That is a very graphic
naked picture of you.

374
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,085
You know, we're gonna go over
a lot of that stuff in class,

375
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,087
So don't worry about it.
I shouldn't have looked.

376
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:17,691
I'm both a married man
and a beloved professor.
I know. You're dr. Dorian.

377
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,826
This area's
technically the quad,

378
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:22,362
So it's--it's j.D.

379
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,164
Lucy.

380
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,733
Nice to meet you, lucy.

381
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,736
<i>(lucy) don't let him leave.
Say something, lucy.</i>

382
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,338
J.D.?

383
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,142
Can I help you
with something?

384
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,344
Dr. Cox is all over me.

385
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,346
I can't take it.

386
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,882
Come with me.

387
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,884
Come on.

388
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,123
Lucy, to win
at the game of perry cox,

389
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,160
Yohave to stand up to him.
He just wants to kw

390
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,162
That you're strong enough
to survive here.

391
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:58,332
So you need to
go ahead and show him.

392
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:02,903
Dr. Co--dr. Professor cox?

393
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,839
I actually knew the answers
to all your questions.

394
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,341
Check it out--

395
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,343
Pulmonary embolism,
pott's disease

396
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,412
And dikembe mutombo.

397
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,448
That's fabulous.
I dot care.

398
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,917
It's just that
you kept yelling,

399
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,652
And you had that vein thing

400
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,755
Popping out the side
of your head... There it is.

401
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:24,057
And sometimes I get nervous
under pressure,

402
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,293
And I forget basic...

403
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,729
You know,
the things that you speak.

404
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:29,963
Words?

405
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:32,199
Yes! Words.
People speak words.

406
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,701
Look, when you have a patient
coding on the table,

407
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:37,704
What, are you gonna tell
the whole room to stop screaming

408
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:41,174
So that you don't get nervous?
No.

409
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:43,176
Oh, I know that face.

410
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,178
You're a crier.

411
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,646
You cry.

412
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:49,649
I have not cried once
in my entire adult life,

413
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:53,120
And I am not gonna start now
because of you.

414
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,755
We'll see.

415
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:01,428
And, dr. Cox?

416
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:04,498
If you do make me cry,
it won't be a big deal,

417
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,100
Because I lied.

418
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:10,937
<i>I cry all the time.</i>

419
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,439
Oh, good god.

420
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:19,646
<i>(j.D.) little victories count
for a lot around here,</i>

421
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,716
<i>Even if you ner asked to win
in the first place.</i>

422
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,718
(whistles) congrats.

423
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,953
I am now going to expect
more from you

424
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,723
Than I've expected
from a med student ever.

425
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,427
Whore.

426
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:37,063
<i>And you have to enjoy those
nice moments while you can.</i>

427
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:41,668
This is your group's cadaver
for the semester.

428
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,036
<i>Because around here,</i>

429
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,238
<i>They never last very long.</i>

430
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,340
Treat him well.

431
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:50,076
I wonder
what this guy's deal was.

432
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:51,912
Ben.

433
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:54,748
His name was ben.

434
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,877
why are we whispering?

435
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,479
And I threw a blanket over
his head and then sat on him.

436
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,682
He doesn't know it's me.
What's your exit strategy?

437
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,917
I haven't really thought
that far ahead.

438
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,854
I got a plan. Todd, can you
come here and sit on this?

439
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:21,189
Okay. (grunts)

440
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,125
Get him.

441
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:27,562
Sodude or chick?

442
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,965
I'm good either way.
