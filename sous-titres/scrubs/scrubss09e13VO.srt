1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,542
<i>They say that by the end</i>
<i>of your first semester</i>

2
00:00:02,606 --> 00:00:05,174
<i>in med school, it's already</i>
<i>obvious what kind of doctor</i>

3
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,243
<i>you'll end up being.</i>
Him.

4
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:09,244
Who... Trang?
Yep.

5
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,779
Oh, man. Small hands,
great with the ladies... Ob-Gyn.

6
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:16,849
No, more like a shopping mall
pretzel vendor. Next.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,017
Maybe Emergency Medicine.

8
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:22,052
Nope! Pediatrics.

9
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,519
There it is.
What's up?

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,187
Hello.
Hey.

11
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:27,789
Man, you're so lucky to have
someone like drew.

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,824
I wish I could find
a stud-wannabe surgeon

13
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,827
to take under my wing.

14
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:35,396
I've been making a play
for this guy right here... Clint,

15
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:37,798
but he's too cool and aloof.
See you in class. Dr. Turk.

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,199
Not if I see you first! Ha!

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,867
We gonna kick it!

18
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,636
He's gonna think I'm lame.

19
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,937
You are lame.

20
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:50,238
All right, then.
Listen up, murderers.

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,507
As you know, we are approaching
the end of the semester.

22
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:55,474
The ceremony of thanks
is quickly approaching.

23
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,043
That's where you publicly thank
the friends and families

24
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:01,379
of the cadavers you've been
dissecting this semester.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,648
It's actually
a pretty sweet deal for em.

26
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,882
After their loved ones
are stripped for parts

27
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:07,717
like a 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage,

28
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:09,918
we treat 'em
to some free cold cuts

29
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,820
and a chance to listen to you
regurgitate some trite quotes

30
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,723
about their
family members' sacrifice

31
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:18,825
that you found on the Internet. Oh, yeah.
Uh, heads up to all you white people out there.

32
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:22,394
Reciting a Maya Angelou poem
in an old black lady's voi...

33
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,330
Not cool, okay?
Cole, I'm talkin' to you.

34
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,331
Talkin' to you.

35
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:30,634
What are you cooking?
I can smell it from next door.

36
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:33,135
It's a Wild Mushroom
and Shrimp Risotto

37
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:37,638
I learned to make while working at a hostel in Naples.
Risotto... that's gay for rice, right?

38
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,306
Yeah.
Shrimp's gay for chicken.

39
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,106
Hey, should we
get married today?

40
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:44,542
What?

41
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,577
We've been dating
for four months.

42
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:49,545
I mean, it's pretty good, right?
Let's stop screwing around

43
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:51,580
and just get it over with.
Who cares?

44
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,349
Okay, obviously your diet
of power bars and boxed wine

45
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,783
has scrambled your brain.

46
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,251
We got as great thing
going here, you know?

47
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,054
Why mess with it? Yeah, you're probably right.
It was just an idea.

48
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,223
Okay. Let's make a baby instead.

49
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,725
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

50
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:13,795
I'm on my birth control...
I think.

51
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,563
Yeah. Uh...

52
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:19,565
How great is this
cadaver ceremony gonna be?

53
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,901
We have to start planning
what we're gonna do for...

54
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,869
You know who. You know, he
can't actually hear you. He is a corpse.

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,438
I am just
excited to honor his memory.

56
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,372
I don't see
what the big deal is.

57
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:32,040
People die in third world
countries all the time,

58
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,275
and no one cares.
Since when did you become so political?

59
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,144
Since my boy Trent went on
a surf vacation to El Salvador

60
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:38,779
and got a tattoo infection.

61
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,682
He had to die with a partial
mermaid on his shoulder.

62
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,883
It just looked like
a regular stupid lady.

63
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,985
Where was his ceremony?
Am I the only one that cares

64
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:49,920
about doing something nice for Ben?
Lucy, it's not that we don't care.

65
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,156
I actually do not care.
It's just that with the semester ending,

66
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:55,290
we all have a lot on our plate,

67
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,091
and the cadaver ceremony
didn't make the top of the list.

68
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:00,561
Guys, just do me a favor, okay?
Come up with one thing

69
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:02,763
that's important to you
about Ben. That's it.

70
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:06,532
It could be a poem or a lightly
choreographed dance number.

71
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,501
Don't be afraid to go modern.
I think Ben would appreciate it.

72
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:12,069
Fine. Or you could
just bring some pretzels

73
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,904
or something.

74
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,105
Well, Cole, everything looks great

75
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,673
two weeks out,
the wound's healed.

76
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,742
Test results came back clean.
Your cancer's gone.

77
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,877
That is so crazy.

78
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,278
You know, I-I've always known
that a surgeon might hook me up

79
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,980
with some sweet calf
implants or a robot arm. Mm.

80
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:30,215
But I never thought one
would save my life.

81
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,383
I'm not gonna lie.
Surgeons are pretty awesome.

82
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:34,618
Hey, Dr. T.,
do you believe in fate?

83
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,619
You know, like,
the stuff they talk about

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,421
during the boring parts
of "Lost"?

85
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,256
Well, I was thinking that maybe
I got cancer for a reason.

86
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,624
Like... like somebody up there
is telling me

87
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,660
that I'm supposed to be a surgeon!
Oh, Cole, you don't want to be a surgeon.

88
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,395
Now just a second there, Gandhi.
You've been looking

89
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,696
for a protégé, and the good lord
answered your prayers.

90
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:54,398
Oh, Dr. t., I would kill
to be your protégé!

91
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,833
You don't want to be
a surgeon, Cole. Okay?

92
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,834
It's boring and it sucks.

93
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:02,503
It's the complete opposite of a waterslide!
Dr. Turk is right.

94
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:05,439
You'd... you'd hate it...
All the blood and guts.

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,539
It's like
an amazing horror movie.

96
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,374
I love horror movies!

97
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,042
Well, sure, but you'd have
to wear a mask like a ninja,

98
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,577
and who wants to do that?

99
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:16,912
Last Halloween
I was a slutty ninja.

100
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,747
Oh, this is gonna be awesome!

101
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:21,749
I'm more sure about
wanting to be a surgeon

102
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,284
than I've ever been
about anything ever.

103
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,552
Okay. I gotta go update
my facebook status.

104
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,553
But then I'm gonna come back,
and I'm gonna start

105
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:31,954
shadowing you, and I'm never
gonna leave your side.

106
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,122
You're happy, aren't you?

107
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,157
I don't know about happy,
but darn it all,

108
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:39,526
I feel alive
for the first time.

109
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:41,561
And that's nice.

110
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,763
So nice.

111
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:48,066
? I can't do this
all on my own ?

112
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,800
? no, I know ?

113
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,802
? I'm no Superman ?

114
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,804
sync dny238
www.Addict7ed.Com

115
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:58,606
? I'm no Superman ?

116
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,297
all right.

117
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:02,648
I am so excited to see what
we've all written about Ben.

118
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:05,724
Pass 'em up.
Really? Nothing?

119
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,737
Ah. Thank you, drew.

120
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:14,073
This is a
receipt for a pair of pants.

121
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:16,086
Yeah, well, I didn't want
to leave you hanging,

122
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:17,184
and I'm gonna need that back.

123
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,490
I'm probably gonna
return those pants.

124
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,109
They were skinny jeans,
and I couldn't pull 'em off.

125
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,218
Literally took me like
an hour to pull 'em off.

126
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:24,965
Guys, we've gotta come
up with something good.

127
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,472
The other groups
are way ahead of us.

128
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:33,208
?

129
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:38,555
they think they're so badass
just 'cause <i>Ron</i> had

130
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,660
a vestigial tail
and spinal meningitis.

131
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,103
Ben could have had that tail.

132
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,245
He's just not a show-off
like <i>ron.</i>

133
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,210
134
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,817
Cole, you're all up under me.
You need to back up, all right?

134
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,862
I mean, you smell great,
but I don't think

135
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:55,520
I should know that about you.
Yeah, no, I'm sorry, Dr. t.

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,827
It's just I-I'm so psyched
about this surgery thing.

137
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,309
I already know what I'm gonna
call my surgical practice...

138
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,457
"Cole cutz."

139
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,415
With a "z"?
That's right!

140
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:10,057
Man, you gotta knock
before you enter Cole's brain.

141
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:12,545
Okay. Well, why don't you go
upstairs and get me some stuff?

142
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,126
Yeah, yeah. What kind of stuff?
Everything that's up there.

143
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,394
Done!
All right.

144
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,067
Dude!

145
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,073
Don't worry about Cole,
all right?

146
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,385
He never sticks with anything.
He said he was gonna learn

147
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:25,279
a new bone in the body every day
until he figured out that

148
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,072
the penis wasn't actually
one of 'em and quit. Hmm.

149
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:32,017
Just be tough on him.
He'll bail.

150
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,620
So you want to be a surgeon,
huh?

151
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:36,698
Well, then you need
to understand

152
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,495
that it's not about glamour
or money

153
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,903
or even making a great mix cd
for the o.

154
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,760
Surgery is long,
tedious and boring.

155
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,557
Oh, I get it...
Like episodes of "Entourage"

156
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:47,498
that revolve around Turtle.

157
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,775
Sometimes you have
to stand totally still

158
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,849
and stay completely lasered in,

159
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,917
even if it means
just holding this clamp,

160
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,364
because this clamp
right here...

161
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,669
This clamp could
keep someone alive.

162
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,512
That's what you're gonna
practice right now. 164
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:03,428
You think you can handle it?
I'll stay here as long as it takes.

163
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:05,700
I'll even cancel my 5:30
at the tanning salon.

164
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,142
Cole, you had skin cancer,
like, yesterday!

165
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,344
Just hold the damn clamp.

166
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,108
What the...

167
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,691
Oh, there you are.
Can you believe this?

168
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,741
Apparently, there's water damage
in the wall or something.

169
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,823
Yeah, I heard about that.

170
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,655
Some guy upstairs cracks
his head open in the shower,

171
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,777
lies there for four hours,
and we gotta pay the price.

172
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,784
You think they'll be able
to fix it?

173
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,268
Could be kinda cool, right?

174
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,991
I mean,
instead of my crappy room

175
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:38,314
and your crappy room, we could
have one giant crappy suite.

176
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:40,536
I mean, it'd be kind of like
we're living together, yeah?

177
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,789
Yeah.

178
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:45,546
Yeah, that's exactly
what it'd be like.

179
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,199
Exactly.

180
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,194
Exactly like that.

181
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,578
Exactly.

182
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:58,577
<i>I was really excited, because</i>
<i>i'd done a bunch of research</i>

183
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,155
<i>about Ben's life,</i>
<i>and I couldn't wait</i>

184
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:03,725
<i>to share it with the group.
</i> Cole, did you know Ben was president

185
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:07,362
of the association
for independent dry cleaners

186
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:10,031
for the midatlantic region
from 1973 to 1976?

187
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,934
Woman, can't you see
I'm in surgery?

188
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,270
Uh, no.

189
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:18,193
Can other people see that? Look, I'm sorry.
I don't have time for this.

190
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:22,277
Go bother drew.

191
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,802
Okay, now I know
you're not excited about Ben,

192
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,759
but would it change things
at all if I told you

193
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,731
that he had a time-share
in myrtle beach? Wow!

194
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,736
So he got to spend
two weeks a year,

195
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,895
one of them off-peak,
in South Carolina's

196
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,776
third most popular
vacation destination?

197
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,467
Ho, ho! Game-changer.

198
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,026
Heads up.
Oh!

199
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:43,957
So you're bringing
some of your stuff in. Good.

200
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,765
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep this
on your bed for a while,

201
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,282
since we always sleep
in mine anyway.

202
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,296
And until they fix the hole,
I figured this area could

203
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,460
kind of be like
a den/hangout/place

204
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,426
where we have dirty sex on
top of my hockey equipment.

205
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,466
Oh, honey, Lucy's here.

206
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should clarify.

207
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,932
The sex is actually
pretty vanilla.

208
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,681
It's the hockey equipment
that's dirty.

209
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:07,631
God, I am liking this.
Yeah! Yeah, me, too.

210
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:08,847
I'll be back in a jiff.
Okay.

211
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:14,209
I don't like this at all.
I like things clean and simple.

212
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,641
Everything I own
is in that box.

213
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:18,373
A hat, some ramen
and a car battery?

214
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:21,732
Don't you have personal things?
I've had that car battery a long time.

215
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,432
218
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,396
Cole?
I totally forgot about you.

216
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,864
Have you been standing here
all day?

217
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,410
I don't know.
I can't read old people clocks.

218
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,378
And you haven't moved once,
not even to pee?

219
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,479
Nope. I learned
a trick at keggers.

220
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,731
When there's a long line
at the bathroom...

221
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:44,686
Let a little out, let it dry.
Little out, let it dry.

222
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:48,535
Didn't I say that he has what
it takes to be a surgeon?

223
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,475
Beyond the blind sense of
entitlement and complete lack

224
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:54,859
of human empathy, there's
the empty-headed concentration,

225
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,670
the unjustifiable arrogance

226
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,230
and the sheer willingness
to stand in one place

227
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,330
and wet yourself
like a zoo elephant.

228
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,386
That's awe-inspiring stuff.

229
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,544
Thank you, Dr. c.!

230
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:11,100
I've proved myself, right?
So let's go open a brother up!

231
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,561
First of all,
why it gotta be a brother?

232
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,289
And second of all,

233
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,300
a surgeon has to have a delicate
touch and steady hand.

234
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,151
Now I want you
to take these tweezers

235
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,094
and remove the fortune
from this cookie

236
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:26,637
without breaking it. I can do that.
Check out these brows.

237
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:29,493
I know my way around
a pair of twzies, mm!

238
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:35,090
Is that bright? Huh?
Is it bright? Is it too bright?

239
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,037
Lots of distractions
in surgery.

240
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,899
Blood everywhere... ooh!

241
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,475
And out of nowhere,
there could come a noise

242
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,150
to just break
your concentration!

243
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,318
?

244
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,147
a drum line in the O.R.!

245
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,954
<i>What?</i>

246
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:01,246
Done.
Mm?

247
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:02,986
Somebody snare me.

248
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,889
?

249
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:08,513
I want you to imagine

250
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,749
these bears were
in a horrible accident

251
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,216
like a bus crash,
and before you ask,

252
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,415
no, I don't know why
the bears were on a bus.

253
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,750
Maybe they're super smart
government bears

254
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,809
on their way to fight terrorism.
Anyway, all you need to do

255
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:23,752
is sew one of
these bad boys up before me,

256
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,536
and I'll know you have
the skills to be a surgeon.

257
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:28,295
Are we clear?
As a vodka tonic.

258
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:33,955
I'm really disappointed
in you guys.

259
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,660
All you had to do was write one
measly little line about Ben,

260
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:41,220
and you couldn't handle that.
What are we gonna do about this?

261
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:43,956
We're not gonna do anything.
We gotta bounce.

262
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,524
Maya's treating me to dinner. Yeah.
It's Vietnamese Valentine's day.

263
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,726
It's not real.

264
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,862
Yeah, I gotta go, too.

265
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,831
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do

266
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,468
about the giant hole
in my wall.

267
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:54,899
Sadly, that's not a metaphor.

268
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,020
Stop! You guys we have only
been here one semester,

269
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,890
and we're already
becoming jaded.

270
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,853
Before Ben was our homework,
he was a real human being

271
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:08,081
with a job and a wife
and a son Eric,

272
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:09,758
who's gonna be here tomorrow.

273
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:11,582
Fine.

274
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:13,113
I'll do it myself.

275
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,185
<i>Saying how you feel</i>
<i>can be tricky.</i>

276
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,956
<i>Some people will do anything</i>
<i>to hide their true emotions...</i>

277
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,540
What's the big surprise?

278
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,456
Oh.

279
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:26,747
Curtain.

280
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:31,717
Yeah. I put this in so we can
maintain our separate zones.

281
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,891
What if I want
to come see my stuff?

282
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:37,368
That's the best part.
It's all back in your closet.

283
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,109
So, cool.

284
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,236
We're good.

285
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:42,849
Um, what do you want
to do tonight?

286
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,564
Want to get married? Ha ha.
Remember that?

287
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,976
<i>While others have</i>
<i>no probl telling you</i>

288
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,444
<i>exactly what's on their mind.</i>

289
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:54,705
Done!

290
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,619
Wow. I'm not even close.

291
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,507
Oh, man.
That bear's in bad shape.

292
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,032
That's sad, Cole.

293
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:03,628
Looks like being
a surgeon's just not for you.

294
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,812
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>you're so excited</i>

295
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:14,425
<i>to tell someone</i> <i>your feelings...
</i> Excuse me.

296
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,878
Are you Ben Coleman's son?
Yeah.

297
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,969
Hi. I'm Lucy Bennett.

298
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,317
We worked with your father
in our Anatomy class,

299
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,233
and, um, I'm sort of in charge
of our group's tribute to him.

300
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,855
And I just want to know

301
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:27,112
if there's anything
you wanted us to include.

302
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,776
<i>That you never consider they</i>
<i>might not feel the same way.</i>

303
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,584
Well, how about that he was
a miserable, horrible dad

304
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,032
who pretty much ruined
my childhood,

305
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,070
and I'm only here to see him
put in the ground?

306
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,791
I guess I could work that in.

307
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,745
<i>Over the next 20 minutes,</i>
<i>Eric regaled me</i>

308
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,148
<i>with horrible stories</i>
<i>about Ben.</i>

309
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:50,283
He was never around
when I was a kid.

310
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:52,185
He cheated on my mom.

311
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,087
He didn't call me for 20 years.

312
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:58,925
Okay, <i>but</i> you gotta admit
he was an excellent bowler.

313
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,795
I found a photo from when
he rolled that perfect game

314
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,363
on June 16, 1976.

315
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:06,500
So that's where he was
on my 7th birthday.

316
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,769
<i>Oh, balls.</i>

317
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:12,572
Dr. Cox, I don't know what I'm
gonna do about this ceremony.

318
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:15,977
I had this whole... da-da-da-da-da-da.
No sitting.

319
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:19,947
Can't you see I'm reading
a very important chart here?

320
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,348
A british tabloid?

321
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:24,684
This <i>chart</i> functions
as my shield

322
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:27,321
to protect me from those
who would annoy me.

323
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,322
Hey, Dr. C.
Shield on.

324
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,858
Ohh. See what you've done?

325
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:34,495
You have destroyed
the shieldlike power

326
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,497
of my chart.
330
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:39,567
I, um, I guess starting tomorrow
I'll be shadowing you again.

327
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:42,704
I decided that surgery
is not really my thing.

328
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,942
No, no. You are suosed
to be with Dr. Turk.

329
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,377
Where is Dr. Turk?

330
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:50,512
Oh, <i>Gandhu,</i> step away
from the pizza pastry,

331
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,782
would you please?

332
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,818
Yeah, but the chemicals taste
better when it's hot, so...

333
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,821
Fair enough. I've come to
clear up a point of confusion.

334
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,791
<i>This</i> is what a protégé
<i>should</i> look like.

335
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:05,728
It is an empty vessel that
I'm filling with knowledge.

336
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,597
I also get to hold stuff.

337
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:09,499
Cole didn't have
what it takes, all right?

338
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,769
We surgeons are an elite crew.
Really? Say, Todd, do me a favor.

339
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:15,138
Would you tell me what that
wonderful new invention is

340
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,807
you've been working on?
It's a series of erotic novelty wines...

341
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:21,377
Chardonn-gay, sauvignon donk,
teeny-weeny peeny grigio.

342
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,413
Patent pending five.

343
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:24,914
Drink up, boys.

344
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,615
Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

345
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,685
You surgeons truly are
the chosen ones.

346
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,687
Come on. He wasn't
even serious about it.

347
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:36,191
I bet he's already moved on.
Actually, he hasn't. He's still practicing.

348
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,594
353
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:41,897
<i></i>

349
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,400
I can fix it.

350
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,201
And the worst part is,

351
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,372
I had to stay in that room
for 17 horse funerals.

352
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:54,877
Okay, so young Cole may
not be an <i>ideal</i> protégé.

353
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,445
He may not even be
an ideal human.

354
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,016
Nevertheless, you don't get to
pick who needs <i>you</i> as a mentor.

355
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,119
Do you realize,
for the last eight years

356
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:06,255
I've been saddled with
a whiny, clingy lady-man

357
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,792
whose very life force
was dependent on hugs?

358
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,127
Now, of course,
I have young drew,

359
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:15,397
and although he may be filled
with a bubbling rage

360
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,667
that I fear cannot be
contained very much longer,

361
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,236
at least he doesn't
need me to hold his hand

362
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,372
when he speaks of love
and his true feelings.

363
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,509
The point is, we don't always
get to choose who deserves

364
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,512
and who wants our help.
That's it.

365
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:32,248
Why you gotta always ruin
pastry time?

366
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,284
Perfectly good pastry.

367
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:43,026
Dr. Cox,
can I ask you something?

368
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:44,895
Yes?

369
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:47,864
When you're in love, h-how
do you set aside your fears

370
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,335
so that you can just dive in
and follow your heart?

371
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:55,139
Oh, dear God, drew.
Not you.

372
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,608
It's happening again.

373
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,343
It's happening again.

374
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,551
Ben?

375
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,987
I am very upset with you.
You tricked me...

376
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:11,757
All old and cute on the outside

377
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,760
and horrible and cruel
on the inside.

378
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:17,863
I was planning
an amazing tribute for you...

379
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:21,533
Stories and poems
and a dozen purple balloons

380
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,868
to signify a cluster of grapes.

381
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:26,037
Well, now I'm gonna pop them

382
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:29,373
so they look like raisins,
nature's saddest fruit...

383
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,843
All shriveled and dr

384
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,811
hey. Stop being weird.

385
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,381
I'm trying to eat my sandwich
around some corpses.

386
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,383
Why are you eating lunch
in here?

387
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,685
Why are you yelling
at a dead guy?

388
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:43,188
See? We all got
a lot of questions.

389
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,190
I'm yelling at Ben
because I made

390
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:47,592
this really beautiful tribute
for him,

391
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,328
and it turns out he was a jerk.
So? Did he have all his parts?

392
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,898
Yeah. Were you able to
slice through his tendons,

393
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,232
soft through
his lower intestines

394
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:57,135
and study the anatomy of his
right hepatic flexure? Yes.

395
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,205
Then he was exactly
who he was supposed to be.

396
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:03,441
Who cares if he was
a jerk in real life?

397
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,377
<i>You have to learn to adjust</i>

398
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,879
<i>when your expectations</i>
<i>don't match the reality.</i>

399
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:11,282
<i>Whether it's about the present</i>
<i>state of a relationship...</i>

400
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:12,717
What are you doing?

401
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:17,122
I'm taking down the curtain.
Sorry I was such a jerk.

402
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:20,058
It's just sometimes
the tiniest changes terrify me,

403
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:23,027
and I just need a little time
to process things.

404
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,062
But eventually, I come around.

405
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,066
? in the morning
and everything was gone ?

406
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,835
is this a, uh, sledgehammer?

407
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,205
Is what a sledgehammer?

408
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,674
? dead in the hallway ?

409
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,343
this sledgehammer.

410
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,313
? oh, come on, sun,
why must I burn? ?

411
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,650
you're the one who put
the hole in the wall.

412
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,519
I may have.

413
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:49,155
Look, I mean,
room and board is expensive.

414
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,991
I think that we should
live together next year.

415
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:55,394
So this was my way of
easing you into it, you know?

416
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:58,230
Getting you comfortable
with the idea.

417
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:03,002
I'm curious to see
whether it worked.

418
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,270
This is where you say...

419
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,173
I'm in love with a sociopath?

420
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:09,774
Wrong. Yes or no.

421
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,343
I mean, it's your life.
Sort of.

422
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:14,245
428
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,347
? but I lived and I learned ?

423
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,316
yes.

424
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,719
? yes, I lived and I learned ?

425
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:25,056
<i>or your expectations</i>
<i>about a person's future...</i>

426
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,992
Hey, Cole, you got a sec?

427
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:29,427
Listen, I've been thinking
about it,

428
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,862
and amazingly enough,

429
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:33,398
the same things that make you
a complete douche

430
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:36,667
also give you the potential
to be a good surgeon,

431
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:39,504
so, uh, it'd be an honor
to teach you,

432
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:42,674
<i>if</i> that's something
you really want.

433
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,778
It might be the first thing
I've ever really wanted.

434
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:49,748
Don't get all mushy, all right?
441
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:53,819
<i>Or even your expectations</i>
<i>about somebody's past.</i>

435
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,855
I met Ben
on my first day of med school

436
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,158
at a moment when I wasn't
really sure if I would make it.

437
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:03,996
But the truth is,
I didn't really know Ben.

438
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,432
In life,
I'm sure he had his faults,

439
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,969
but in death,
he did great things.

440
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:13,139
He brought us together
and helped us realize

441
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,975
that we couldn't do it all
on our own.

442
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:20,179
He gave us the confidence
to believe in ourselves...

443
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:24,684
And he gave his body
so that we could become doctors.

444
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,454
And for that, we thank him.

445
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:29,757
453
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,993
?

446
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,934
oh, come on!

447
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,274
Hey, Clint, so, uh...

448
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:48,208
What you got planned
this weekend?

449
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:51,211
Just going to see the eels. Oh, really?
You're a member of the aquarium, too?

450
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:53,713
Those annual fees
are so worth it.

451
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:56,215
My daughters and I...
We love the sea turtles.

452
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,786
They're slow in the body
but fast in the mind, right?

453
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:02,255
Lightning fast! Yeah, I was
actually talking about the band, the eels.

454
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,126
Oh. Rock music! Rock...
What am I doing?

455
