1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:02,541
<i>Now that Dr. Cox was
the Chief of Medicine,</i>

2
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:04,541
<i>I had become the guy
everyone counted on</i>

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:06,613
<i>to fight for the things
the hospital needed.</i>

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,776
<i>Yep, I was the one person
who would get him to say...</i>

5
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:10,586
No.

6
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,674
You need to hire
a few more nurses.

7
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:14,797
Look, Tammy.
We don't have the money.

8
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,796
If you want to go out and raise
the cash yourself, feel free.

9
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,366
Maybe you could sell
your eggs to a fertility clinic, or

10
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:22,933
sell that beard of yours
to the Ridiculous Museum.

11
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:26,220
Better yet, you could make a list
of all the people you drive insane

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,364
and tell them that for a nominal fee,
you'll never speak to them again.

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,859
You of course offer them
a monthly subscription

14
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,972
at a reduced rate,
just to reel them in.

15
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,252
And then after a while
of you not talking to them,

16
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,604
people will forget just
how annoying you are

17
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:43,084
and they'll let their
subscription run out.

18
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:45,800
And, bang! That's when
you show up at their house,

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,458
and you drive them
insane all over again,

20
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:51,469
by speaking to them.
And here's the kicker.

21
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,024
When everyone's trying
to re-subscribe,

22
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:57,504
you lay it on them that
the price is now quadruple.

23
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,108
And I'm predicting and
that's a low-end guesstimate,

24
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:04,715
You're looking at about
$100,000,000 a quarter, easy.

25
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,725
You give the hospital
a hundred thou,

26
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,390
we hire a few nurses.

27
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,240
But, until then,

28
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,200
you go tell Carla
it ain't happening.

29
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,451
- That was super fun.
- Get out!

30
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,429
Nice seeing you.

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,870
<i>Still, I knew Dr. Cox heard me.
Sometimes he came around.</i>

32
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,257
Nice job, J.D.
We're wearing him down.

33
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,003
<i>Plus, with my new role,</i>

34
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,729
<i>people were treating me
with a new found respect.</i>

35
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,544
I don't like how you're
trying to make people

36
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,624
treat you with a new
found sense of respect.

37
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:33,774
I'm not making people do anything.

38
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,167
How else do you explain it?
Did you hypnotize them?

39
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:38,559
Are you trying to hypnotize me?
'Cause that's not gonna work.

40
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,198
I'm already hypnotized.

41
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:43,437
15 years ago, I'm in Vegas,
I volunteer to be part of this guy's act.

42
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,539
Half way through the show,
fire alarm goes off

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,172
and I never get snapped out.

44
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,877
There's some word
out there floating around

45
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:51,241
like an on/off switch for me
that if I ever hear it,

46
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,717
I'll just go completely unconscious.

47
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:55,440
- Is it "sassafras"?
- It is "sassafras", you're right.

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,526
It's amazing, of all the words
in the English language...

49
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,225
Boondoggle.

50
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,851
Yes! That was it?

51
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,963
You're such an ass.
Here's your warning.

52
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,066
If you start walking around here
like you're the big cheese,

53
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:06,900
I'm gonna have to punish you.
Okay?

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,976
"Pernicious".

55
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:12,908
"Albatross".

56
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:14,839
Nice try.

57
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,011
Alright, guys. I'm gonna
introduce you to a new intern now,

58
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,979
- This is Derek Hill.
- "Welcome to the team" five.

59
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,321
Always use your non-cutting hand.

60
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,015
Told you.

61
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,708
Guys, if I could have a second to...

62
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,871
"Quiet down" five.

63
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,359
Thank you, Todd.

64
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,785
You're all dismissed.

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,694
Listen, if you need
anything, I'm here, okay?

66
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,218
- I think I'll be fine.
- I like you.

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,941
I am so mad at you.

68
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,068
<i>He must have found out I tracked
down the testicle he had removed</i>

69
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,200
<i>and turned it to
a tiny disco ball.</i>

70
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,288
<i>Wait a second.
You dreamed that, you're fine.</i>

71
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:00,512
Listen to me. You are
the man around here now

72
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:03,158
You gotta get your strut on.
You know what I'm saying?

73
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,239
Haven't you had this fantasy before?

74
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:13,761
Yeah. Except I've been working out.
So this time, I get to be shirtless.

75
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:15,775
- What's that?
- What's what?

76
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,085
Did you make a disco ball
out of my testicle?

77
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,722
Get out of the fantasy!
Get out of the fantasy!

78
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:22,247
Hell no!

79
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:25,496
<i>That was close.</i>

80
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:27,247
Get your strut on!

81
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:34,400
Behold King Cheese.
I warned you about this.

82
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,056
And now, my liege, I'm afraid
it's time for your punishment.

83
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,693
Let me just put down my popsicle.

84
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,657
Fifteen years and
no one said "popsicle"?

85
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:45,293
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Popsicle.

86
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:46,853
Popsicle.

87
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,328
- I had the craziest dream.
- Popsicle.

88
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,099
I can believe he's buying this.

89
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,859
It's gonna be a fun day.

90
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:10,706
Season 8 Episode 12
<i>Their Story II</i>

91
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:16,242
And lastly, let's not forget
to get a patient's full history, okay?

92
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,788
Especially medical allergies.

93
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,004
You can go.

94
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,037
<i>It's been so long
since I was an intern.</i>

95
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:23,622
<i>I wonder what they're thinking.</i>

96
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>Notice me.
Notice me...</i>

97
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,757
<i>'Cause I'm gonna hit that.</i>

98
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:36,172
<i>Time to start yet another day
in the suckhole of all suckholes.</i>

99
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,949
<i>I'm in such a good mood.
I think I'll do a little dance.</i>

100
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,595
What did you think
of your first...

101
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,003
John Dorian presentation
as it were?

102
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,050
I imagine it's what people
felt like the first time

103
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,935
they heard Dr. King speak.

104
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,313
<i>What are you doing?</i>

105
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,548
<i>That wise ass crap always
get you in trouble.</i>

106
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,900
<i>Just keep your mouth shut.</i>

107
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,446
For like a week now, I had
a really bad blurred vision

108
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,674
and a stiff jaw.

109
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,296
Sounds like my dad
after a couple martinis.

110
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,609
Looks like you may
have a case of "WASPiness".

111
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,064
<i>And you may have a touch
of the "self-laughies".</i>

112
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,305
Okay. I'm back.

113
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:14,022
Look, we are gonna
figure this out, I promise.

114
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,064
Thanks.

115
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,722
<i>Still, Dr. Reid
has been super-supportive.</i>

116
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,840
<i>Toss her a compliment
as a thank you.</i>

117
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,872
Even though that dress is
totally inappropriate for a doctor,

118
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,959
- You're so rocking it.
- That's awesome

119
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,060
because I actually have a policy
that if I don't get three compliments

120
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,876
the first time I wear it,
I have to return it.

121
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,210
Now, I've got you...

122
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,465
J.D. he said this morning
that I looked "scrumpdelicious".

123
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,758
Yeah, he actually
does talk like that.

124
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,311
The meth addict from this morning
said he want to eat my eyeballs,

125
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,561
which I'm counting because
the dress really make them pop.

126
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,429
So, I've been thinking
about her a lot.

127
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,336
And with the blurry vision
and the jaw thing,

128
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,539
I bet Paige has
temporal arteritis.

129
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,224
We should do a temporal
artery biopsy on her.

130
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,102
Yeah, I'm not doing that. At her age,
it's probably neurological.

131
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:54,458
<i>Crap.</i>

132
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:55,652
Now,

133
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,229
I just gotta remove the price tag,
because this little dressy is a keeper.

134
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:02,862
Frick!

135
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>Good.</i>

136
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:08,243
<i>Denise, Charlie, Derek, Elliot,</i>

137
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:11,734
<i>Walter, John, Birdy,
Katie and Howie. 31.</i>

138
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,213
I've made 31 new friends
since I started here.

139
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,190
Hey, Howie, there's mints.

140
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes please.

141
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,081
- Watch out!
- Move!

142
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:25,843
- Move! Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

143
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,469
Relax people.

144
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,056
Remote control.

145
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:32,680
A patient once complained
that his room wasn't clean,

146
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,978
so I stole the motor
from his wheelchair.

147
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,397
- What are you guys doing?
- I'm using a mint.

148
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,510
Those aren't mints. Those are highly
concentrated mini urinal cakes.

149
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,751
Patent pending.

150
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:42,819
They're good.

151
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,082
Not a huge selling point
for urinal cakes, but thank you.

152
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,079
Say, glasses. Who told you
you could touch my cart?

153
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,936
<i>You can fix this.</i>

154
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,500
Hi, I'm Sunny.

155
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,414
Don't want to shake?

156
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,497
That's okay. I'll just do a little
wave then. Hi, I'm Sonny.

157
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:00,920
Come on. You can't stay angry in
such a beautiful day.

158
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,829
Apology accepted.

159
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,695
<i>And that's 32 new friends.</i>

160
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,322
<i>Plus, he's not as weird as they say.</i>

161
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:09,467
Cart, come.

162
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,344
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

163
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:21,253
<i>Crap, it's his Camp Counselor face.
Please don't try to make me open up.</i>

164
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,913
Come on, Grumpy Bear. You see these
little things on the sides of my head?

165
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,277
They're not just for
holding up my shades.

166
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,277
Fine.

167
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:30,188
I wanted to do a
temporal artery biopsy

168
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:32,118
on a patient and
your girlfriend ignored me.

169
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,595
Classic Elliot.

170
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:35,557
She's totally
supportive and nurturing,

171
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,675
but she'll never take
an intern's medical opinion.

172
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,851
It's just not her way.
She's not proud of it.

173
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,258
Just like I'm not
proud of the fact that

174
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,047
just because I stand up to Dr. Cox,
oddly everyone thinks I'm so special.

175
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,932
- You've heard about that right?
- I have.

176
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,136
Sucks.

177
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,422
- Hey, friend.
- Best friend.

178
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,839
I'm so happy for him.
I'm so happy for him!

179
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,981
You know what's annoying?
We all started out at the same time

180
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,892
and now Dorian is
so far ahead of us, career-wise.

181
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,493
That doesn't bother me.

182
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,443
<i>Really?</i>

183
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,578
This guy wants his spleen removed?

184
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:09,994
I got his spleen now.

185
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,324
Incoming!

186
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,120
You know what?

187
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,072
Why don't we take everything out?
How about that?

188
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,245
I got a heart!

189
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:26,733
I got his heart!

190
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:30,476
I... got... his... heart!

191
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:33,685
<i>It bothers him a little.</i>

192
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,102
Hey, smiley intern.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

193
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,222
Sure.

194
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,101
- See you around.
- Wait.

195
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,435
I thought you wanted to talk.

196
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,786
No, I just wanted to punish
those two for touching my cart.

197
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:47,860
So I rigged the elevator to
give them a little bit of a scare.

198
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,536
It's all in good fun.

199
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,262
Get me out of here!

200
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,688
See and as long as
I wear my lab coat,

201
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,376
you can't even see
the duct tape at all.

202
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:04,412
The neck line is so cute.

203
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,430
<i>This girly talk
is driving me insane.</i>

204
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,108
And thanks so much. I love this
lip gloss, what flavor is it?

205
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:11,995
Apri-gotchee-gotcha.

206
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,613
Oh my go, we get it.
You have vaginas.

207
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,461
On that note, I guess we'll go.

208
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,782
A nurse is going to come by
and take some more blood work.

209
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,168
Denise, if you'd studied
her case history,

210
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:26,270
you'd know that Paige has
Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome.

211
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,752
She was born without a vagina.

212
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,377
Oh my god. Are you serious?

213
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:32,008
No, but if
you're gonna act weird

214
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,056
around my patients,
I'm gonna have to torture you.

215
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,360
I'm pissed right now,
but that was pretty awesome.

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,483
Thank you.

217
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,598
I'm just frustrated.

218
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:41,223
I really think we should do
the biopsy, it can't do any harm.

219
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,670
Oh please, not this again.

220
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,554
If Paige really does
have temporal arteritis

221
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,667
and we don't catch early,
she could go blind.

222
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,484
I'm not good at mustering up
this whole over-the-top

223
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,986
puppy dog sentiment thing
that you just eat up, but...

224
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:55,406
What if I started telling people that
I wished you were my older sister?

225
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,394
- Do you?
- No. Not really.

226
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,920
I still take it.

227
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,900
There he is.
You're ready to go?

228
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,009
I just gotta go check
my messages at the front desk.

229
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,712
I'd give up my cell phone number,
but it'd be ringing like crazy.

230
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:23,890
Everybody wants a piece
of the big dog.

231
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:27,300
I know what you're thinking.

232
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,474
You're thinking J.D.
is a ridiculous arrogant tool.

233
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,446
He didn't ask for this position.

234
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,159
So cut him some slack, okay?

235
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:38,512
- Did you guys see that?
- See what?

236
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,009
Good cart.

237
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,652
- Yeah?
- We did it.

238
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,319
Dr. Cox is hiring more nurses.

239
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,719
Forced overtime for the
nursing staff is now over.

240
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,559
And it's all thanks
to this guy right here!

241
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,090
Stop it everyone.

242
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:00,629
Okay, keep it going
a little bit longer.

243
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,374
And now you can stop it.
That was nice.

244
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,662
<i>Come on, man.
Hold it together.</i>

245
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,353
If we do hook up tonight,

246
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:11,592
for once, you won't be
the only one thinking about J.D.

247
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,208
<i>That did it.</i>

248
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:19,388
- You're bigger than I remember.
- Thanks.

249
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:20,690
I have to know.

250
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,876
Why did you keep me
from getting on the elevator?

251
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,569
I touched your cart too.

252
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,601
It's simple. I don't mess with you
because I don't think you can take it.

253
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,904
You're not strong enough.

254
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:39,937
He said we were gonna die.

255
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,442
We still might.

256
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,512
<i>What does he mean,
I'm not strong enough?</i>

257
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:47,305
<i>I hate this day!
This day stinks.</i>

258
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,355
<i>This day rules.</i>

259
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:52,254
Paige, I want to do
a temporal artery biopsy.

260
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,038
<i>Just stay quiet. Don't get
sucked into their petty mess.</i>

261
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:01,282
- Come on, buddy. Let's go get a beer.
- What? I thought we were going out.

262
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,441
Because ever since you lucked into
the hospital do-gooder role,

263
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:07,273
you've been acting like
a ridiculous arrogant tool.

264
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,146
- No, I haven't.
- I'm not the only one who thinks it.

265
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,072
<i>Please don't look at me.</i>

266
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,458
<i>I'm invisible, I'm invisible!</i>

267
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,149
<i>Perfect.</i>

268
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,413
<i>Yesterday wasn't great.
But stick with the plan,</i>

269
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,127
<i>and keep your mouth shut.</i>

270
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,691
What are you being so pissy?

271
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,671
Is that because Izzy pointed at the TV
at Al Roker and called him "daddy"?

272
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,424
I don't want to talk about it, baby.

273
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,537
<i>You do not want to get
mixed up in a lover's quarrel.</i>

274
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,726
So how was your night with Turk?

275
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,105
You know what?
I don't want to hear it.

276
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,502
I can't believe
you hooked up with Howie.

277
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:45,892
I just gave him the sideboob.
I give anybody the sideboob.

278
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,454
You want some sideboob?

279
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:49,295
I'm in a good mood.

280
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,231
My results are in from the biopsy.
Watch my food.

281
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,695
The hell are you doing?

282
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,995
He won't do anything to me.
He thinks I'm too weak.

283
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,086
You shouldn't throw produce,
it's very dangerous.

284
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:07,726
I had a cousin that was
killed by a head of lettuce.

285
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:10,288
It's a true story. Well, actually
not the head of lettuce so much

286
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:12,625
as the pack of sewer
rabbits that he stole it from.

287
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,838
Sewer rabbit!

288
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:18,051
I'd be impressed, young lady,
but I can do the same thing.

289
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:19,027
Observe.

290
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:27,431
Popsicle.

291
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:32,978
Popsicle.

292
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:40,387
As it turned out, the janitor lied
to me about being hypnotized.

293
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,738
<i>Paige's biopsy is negative.</i>

294
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:44,965
<i>Great.</i>

295
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,851
<i>You know what's gonna happen next.</i>

296
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,672
I told you so!

297
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,375
And now in French.

298
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:57,446
<i>Je te l'ai dit.
Oui c'est ça, je te l'ai dit.</i>

299
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,966
You want some German,
Denise, huh?

300
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:02,612
<i>Ich hab's gesagt, ja das
stimmt, ich hab's gesagt.</i>

301
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:05,111
I told you so.

302
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:09,601
<i>Maybe she won't rub it in my face.</i>

303
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:11,843
I told you so!

304
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,428
I'm not gonna do the splits here.

305
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:21,349
This floor's disgusting
and I'm wearing a thong,

306
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,476
But I can bring it home
with a little robot for you.

307
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,613
Robot.

308
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:27,091
Told... you... so.

309
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:29,818
Fine. You were right.

310
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,996
But at least we know now.
No harm done.

311
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,922
I have to have this scar
on my face for nothing.

312
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,524
I know that it seems big now,
but it will get smaller as it heals.

313
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,394
Paige, what are you doing?

314
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,772
I know it's silly, but I just...

315
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,216
I like my eyes.

316
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:56,906
It's not fair.

317
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,400
Can I just have a minute, please?

318
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:02,901
Of course.

319
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,459
Crap.

320
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,813
Please do not do the robot again.

321
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,327
Fine.

322
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,891
This is why I don't listen
to interns, okay?

323
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,922
It's not because you're young
or because I'm stubborn.

324
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,934
It's because you're not accountable.

325
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,803
If there's a mistake
or a misdiagnosis,

326
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:23,455
or even a tiny little scar
on someone's face,

327
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:24,667
it's on me.

328
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,315
And that's how it should be.

329
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,385
Interns need a little safety
net at first just to survive.

330
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,890
So don't feel guilty
about her, okay?

331
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,935
It was my decision.
I'm the one who has to feel guilty.

332
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,886
I can't believe you did this to me.

333
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:45,141
<i>Oh my god. Is anyone
in more hell than I am?</i>

334
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,118
It's Derek, right?

335
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:53,041
<i>Last time you talked to this guy,
you compared him to M.L. King,</i>

336
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,898
<i>so he hates you.
Unless...</i>

337
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,786
<i>his ego is so big
he thought you were serious.</i>

338
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,501
Derek, I too have a dream.

339
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:04,668
That one day, Turk will
be able to deal with my...

340
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,616
Well, let's just call it what it is,
meteoric rise to prominence.

341
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,308
It's hard for him, because
he's used to being the big shot.

342
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,227
Oh my god.

343
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,588
Is that why Turk is being such a pain?
He can be the biggest baby.

344
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,488
I'm Carla.
You're handsome.

345
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:22,612
Be careful, she likes
brown men. We both do.

346
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:23,921
<i>Kill me.</i>

347
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:26,490
What are you doing
sitting with them?

348
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,991
<i>And now it's worse.</i>

349
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,234
Hi. Eavesdropping.

350
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:32,193
Now, I'm not exactly clear
on the details,

351
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:33,785
but, from what I can gather,

352
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,670
my new promotion and
subsequent interaction with you

353
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,357
seems to have caused
a rift in your relationship.

354
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,840
Well quite frankly,
I think it's fantastic.

355
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,250
You're being an idiot.

356
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,400
And the wife is
upset too. Hot diggity.

357
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,071
You could try and empathize

358
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,579
instead of giving Derek
over here the googly eyes.

359
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,517
- Carla.
- What?

360
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,466
Give her a break, man!
He's like a male Halle Berry.

361
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,838
So what do you say, new guy?
What do you make of all this?

362
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,252
<i>God I want to answer that.</i>

363
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,284
<i>But don't. Don't.</i>

364
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:04,800
Scintillating. Get out!

365
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:08,985
<i>Free at last!</i>

366
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,593
<i>It still feels a
little crappy though.</i>

367
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:14,401
<i>You always prided yourself
on saying what you think.</i>

368
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,974
<i>But it's about the job, right?</i>

369
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:19,315
<i>Who is the janitor to judge me?</i>

370
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,896
<i>He doesn't know me.</i>

371
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,975
<i>Maybe I should just be happy
I'm the one person here</i>

372
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,690
<i>he isn't going to hassle.</i>

373
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,801
<i>I never asked Elliot
to take the blame.</i>

374
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,859
<i>Still, I'm glad
I didn't have to talk to Paige.</i>

375
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:30,606
<i>That would have sucked.</i>

376
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,142
<i>The hell with it.</i>

377
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,263
Hey, jackasses!

378
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:40,067
Hey, Mopingstein!

379
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:42,811
Hey, Paige.

380
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:46,068
I just wanted you
to know that

381
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,655
even though Dr. Reid
took the blame,

382
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,931
I was the one that really
pushed for that biopsy.

383
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,475
I was just trying
to look out for you.

384
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,339
Anyway...

385
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,827
I'm really sorry.

386
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:00,788
Thank you.

387
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,025
Listen, you know...

388
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:12,706
Little lemonade.

389
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:16,820
Too sweet.

390
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:20,891
Hey, you were saying?

391
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:25,064
You know how hard it is to
walk around this hospital like this

392
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,605
when sometimes inside
I feel like this?

393
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,944
- It didn't change.
- It did a little.

394
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,400
Bottom line,

395
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,259
I am a strong person.

396
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,850
I know, I sized you up right away.

397
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,959
Then why don't you get me back?

398
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,016
Have you been obsessing about this?

399
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:45,583
Maybe unable to sleep?

400
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:48,826
All you can think about is the fact
that I think you're a weak person?

401
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:49,639
Yeah.

402
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,699
Consider yourself gotten.

403
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:00,626
Much better. Thank you.

404
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,349
It's learning.

405
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,667
You guys really
want to know what I think?

406
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:08,321
Let me start with you,
Martin Luther King?

407
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,816
He changed the nation.
Dial it down a notch.

408
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:14,181
And you!
Way to have your husband's back.

409
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,287
Way to represent for your man.

410
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,467
The guy is obviously
going through something.

411
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:22,097
And what type of sick,
twisted, insecure person

412
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:25,430
do you have to be to get your
jollies off other people's misery?

413
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,585
And finally, my man.

414
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,582
You know how excited I was
when I found out that my new boss

415
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,029
was a black surgeon?

416
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:33,760
Finally a role model.

417
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,671
Right?

418
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:35,545
Wrong,

419
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:38,055
because I don't want to become
a giant bald seven year old

420
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,943
who's obsessed with his best friend.

421
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,583
So thanks everyone.

422
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,875
You guys have made
these first few days

423
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:45,514
very special.

424
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,702
<i>As we all sat there gathering the
nerve to apologize to each other...</i>

425
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,164
<i>Well most of us...</i>

426
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:56,116
<i>I couldn't help but
remember my own internship,</i>

427
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,726
<i>and all the different things you had
to do to be accepted here as a doctor.</i>

428
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,654
- <i>You have to be accountable.</i>
- Let me diagnose the next one.

429
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,535
If I'm wrong,
I'll just apologize again.

430
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:05,918
God you're so annoying.

431
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,462
- I am Dr. Reid.
- And I'm Dr. Mahoney and I'm sorry.

432
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,068
Just getting it out of the way.

433
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,483
<i>You have to prove your strength.</i>

434
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,834
Hey, giggle face.

435
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,407
Still owed you for the tomatoes.

436
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:19,527
Thank you.

437
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:25,318
<i>But in the end, all you can do is
be yourself and hope it works out.</i>

438
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,330
It's good, buddy.

439
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,228
New guy.

440
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:33,482
Hey, Derek.

441
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,311
Good cart.

442
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,411
Good cart.
Who is a good cart?

443
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:49,168
Fetch.

444
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,832
Good boy.

445
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:54,645
Who's a good boy?

446
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,131
It sucks.

447
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,174
Having everyone here look up to you.

448
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,670
- I don't think everyone.
- Of course not everyone.

449
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:08,077
Is there someone in particular
who is not looking to me? 'Cause...

450
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,009
Never mind.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
