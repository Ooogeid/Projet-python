1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,375
Turk, I totally ruined Izzy's life.

2
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:05,944
Already? It's only 8:30.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,244
I totally forgot there was a parent's
meeting for her play group this morning.

4
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,819
Now she's gonna get kicked out.
She won't have any friends.

5
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:15,121
She's gonna drop out of high school.
She's gonna start dating some gangbanger,

6
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:18,575
who you're gonna harass over and over and
over again, to get his life together,

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,670
until he snaps and shoots you in
the face... Oh my God!

8
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,481
Whoa! You're bringin' the crazy
extra hard today, huh?

9
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:26,951
Take a deep breath.

10
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,553
You're the most amazing mom I've ever seen.

11
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:34,813
One tiny mistake can't ruin
something that good.

12
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,927
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,371
It is?

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,638
This is gonna come back
to you in a good way.

15
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:45,210
What kind of a good way?
In the boudoir, right?

16
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:46,466
Up high!

17
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:49,470
We're getting a little old to be making
such a big deal out of having sex.

18
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:51,256
Yeah, you're right.

19
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:55,222
- I'm just playin', man!
- Thank goodness.

20
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,342
When you said that,
I died a little inside.

21
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,117
Give it up for me gettin' some!

22
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:00,696
Upstairs!

23
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,287
Downstairs!

24
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:07,176
- I don't really like... downstairs.
- Really? Well, I wanted to try it.

25
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,621
You ready to do this?

26
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,415
<i>As attending physicians, it was important</i>

27
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:14,285
<i>that Turk and I took an
interest to the interns.</i>

28
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:19,766
All right! You're space invaders!
Try and stay together, for goodness sake.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,442
Game on!

30
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,311
Yooo! Eat it!

31
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,819
All right, Boone! You're the mother ship.

32
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:39,978
Josephine, use your annoying voice
to make the mother ship sound.

33
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,936
Go!

34
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,261
Nee nee nee nee nee!

35
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,079
Wah!

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,055
Somebody get him some ice!

37
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,345
Does anyone know why we did that?

38
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,504
Because you're so mean and stupid?

39
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,976
No, we did it to teach you an
important lesson about medicine,

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,182
which we'll reveal to you once
you've changed into dry scrubs.

41
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:06,863
- What's the lesson?
- I don't know. We need to come up

42
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:10,125
with something quick, though, because Boone
has a concussion and his father's a lawyer.

43
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:11,554
What could we have been
teaching them?

44
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:14,249
All right, listen up.
I'll tell you one thing, people.

45
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:17,265
You've got to be ready for anything
this hospital trows at you.

46
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,920
- That's perfect.
- I'll go tell the interns.

47
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,772
Wait, wait! Let me write it down so
you don't forget it.

48
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:22,850
That's a good idea.

49
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:27,794
Continue.

50
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:32,903
I've got an overweight patient back there,
who has already had his stomach stapled,

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,032
And is now taking diet medication
that gives you painful diarrhea,

52
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,590
whenever you eat more than 15
grams of fat at one sitting.

53
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:42,929
Anyone want to guess what he's in the
hospital for? I'll give you a hint.

54
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:46,873
It is very painful, and it rhymes
with schmiorrhea.

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,273
You know what, here's an idea.
Patient should just...

56
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,348
pay me to take food right
out of their hands,

57
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,357
before they even have a chance
to cram it down those

58
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,603
disgusting donut mashers they call mouths.

59
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,449
- I mean, honestly...
- God,

60
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,396
Perry, how many times do I have to say it?

61
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,837
We're tired of your speeches.

62
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:06,531
If you can't stop, I'll have to hire an
orchestra to play that awards show music,

63
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:09,979
they use to hustle long-Winded
hollywood fruitcakes off the stage.

64
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:14,379
- I'm not just sick and tired of...
- La dee da da...

65
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:17,308
La dee da da...

66
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,409
Do you think I should try my new

67
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,934
"I'll take that food right out
of your hands" diet on him?

68
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,826
- Does it matter what I say?
- Does it ever?

69
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:26,472
No!

00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:15,234
So, Emery, your skin graft
is looking great.

86
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:18,489
It should only be a few more weeks,
and we'll have you in physical therapy.

87
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,443
No. I have to be out
of here by this Saturday.

88
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:21,771
Why, you got a ho...

89
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:24,306
<i>Careful. He's a burn victim.
Don't say "Hot date".</i>

90
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,495
Hot rendezvous?

91
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:26,617
<i>Damn it!</i>

92
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,523
No. It's my high school graduation.

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,401
Look, all my friends are going
off to different colleges.

94
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,399
This is the last time
that we'll be together.

95
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,516
Please, just don't make me miss this.

96
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,168
I'll see what I can do.

97
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,172
Turk, don't forget to get your
shift covered tonight.

98
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,125
It's the 6th year anniversary
of our first date.

99
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:49,496
I hope the present you got me is a good one,
because the one I got you is slammin'!

100
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,635
- I can't wait.
- Ok.

101
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:54,795
So what's the big gift there, Gordon?

102
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,306
- Who?
- Black guy from "Sesame Street".

103
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh, well. The past couple of months
I've secretly been taking classes,

104
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,464
and listening to tapes, and I have
learned Spanish for my baby.

105
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:10,510
That's fantastic. It only took you 6 years
to learn the language that your wife speaks.

106
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,068
Hey, I've been
eavesdropping.

107
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:16,294
I got a lady a real gift
for our 1-month anniversary.

108
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:18,841
I cured her fear
of the unknown.

109
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,383
Women are like crows.
They like shiny things.

110
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,562
Classy stuff they can wear in their ears,
around their necks, through their nipples.

111
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:28,070
Crows have nipples?

112
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,188
Don't listen to them C-bear,
it's an amazing gift.

113
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,516
Plus, you know how everyone's rude
to those day laborers across the street?

114
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,654

talk to them.

Excuse me!

00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:32,154
- What is it, bro
- Shouldn't I ride in back with my fingers?

147
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,195
Pretty much the same.

148
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,763
- Late.
- Late.

149
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,283
- Lloyd.
- Dude!

150
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,558
Elliot, can I get your
advice on something...

151
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,008
My burn patient really wants to go to his
high school graduation this weekend.

152
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:55,493
Why? Mine was awful.

153
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,084
I was the valedictorian, but instead of
bringing my speech,

154
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,226
I grabbed my mom's
love letter to her pool boy.

155
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,912
Well, I was so nervous,
I ended up reading that one anyways.

156
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,564
Apparently, I spoke a lot about

157
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,237
"my fondness for throbbing members".

158
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,843
Still, my closing words to my graduating
class were actually kind of appropriate.

159
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:13,841
Something about wanting to make sure
I chased all of my dreams,

160
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,531
before I was all old
and dried up down there.

161
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:21,745
Ok, but do you think that I should
tell Emory that he'll be able to go?

162
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,744
That's a tough call. I mean,
the skin grafts are improving, but

163
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,883
- he could take a bad turn.
- Dr. Reid,

164
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,713
could you sign off on these test results?

165
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:30,578
<i>The hell with it.</i>

166
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,014
Not at all, Boon.

167
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,424
Emery, I'm gonna get you
to that graduation.

168
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:35,954
Awesome!

169
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,096
You know what,
I wouldn't get his hopes up.

170
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,532
Oh, thank you for your
advice on that.

171
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,017
Yeah, it's tough.

172
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,991
So you guys doing something special
for your anniversary night?

173
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,947
- You know what would be great?
- Here we go.

174
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,359
- Brinner.
- What-er?

175
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,603
Breakfast for dinner.
He's obsessed with it.

176
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:58,215
I just don't see what's wrong with having
a nice glass of wine with a pancake.

177
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,740
- Bye, baby. Mwah!
- Bye, mommy.

178
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:06,191
Hey, thanks for watching Izzy
for us tonight.

179
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,285
Here's a list of things that I like to do
for her that Carla doesn't know about.

180
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,093
For example, I'm not allowed to bother
Izzy at night.

181
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,903
But if she starts to cry, you crawl
in her crib and sleep next to her.

182
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,410
Yeah, I'm gonna be doing that even
if she's not crying.

183
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,737
Ok, here's the other thing.

184
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,480
Carla doesn't want
her to have any juice.

185
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:27,097
But if you let her
sip from juice box,

186
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:30,184
she gets really, really happy
and start squeaking like R2D2.

187
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,418
Sugar juice equals
happy squeaking. Got it.

188
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:35,192
I love how Carla's rigid parenting rules
don't apply to us.

189
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,338
- I know!
- Great!

190
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,352
Bye, baby.

191
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:39,927
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, baby!

192
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,331
Come on, baby. I got the fever for
some french toasty toast!

193
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,950
- Turk, please! I'm on the phone.
- French toast!

194
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,467
w

195
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:56,163
w

196
00:09:58,157 --> 00:09:59,082
Si...

197
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,550
Whatever you're making for dinner
tonight, honey, is fine with me.

198
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,934
Hey, what do you say there, Barbie?
What are you doing here?

199
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,454
I just came to borrow the stroller,
take Izzy to the mall.

200
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,912
I see. You think Izzy might...

201
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,876
- like a muffin?
- She can't have processed food.

202
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,838
- Carla's not around.
- Give me that.

203
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:40,444
Emery's grafts are looking great.
Let's get that man a cap and gown.

204
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:44,169
Why would you bother asking my
advice, if you're just gonna ignore it?

205
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,998
Come on, Elliot. You know
people ask for advice

206
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:48,932
really just looking for someone to
backup the decision they already made.

207
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,335
It's like when I asked you if
I should buy those white cords.

208
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,837
You said no, but it didn't matter.

209
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,991
I was gonna buy them anyway, because
they match my whit cord jacket.

210
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:01,716
- Yeah, and that outfit's hideous...
- Now you're just embarassing yourself.

211
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,792
All right, who ever stole my muffin

212
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,288
is going to get to have this green
fuzz out of my teeth.

213
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,052
Baby, I know you'll never believe me

214
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,680
but bacon icecream is the
perfect after-brinner treat.

215
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,960
So, are you ready for presents?

216
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:24,129
baby, you already made me brinner.

217
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,334
Well, this is for you, too.

218
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,852
You look absolutely amazing.

219
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,573
But it's kinda hard to beat brinner.

220
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,025
Perfect.

221
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:42,590
Anything for me?

222
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,122
Yeah...

223
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,087
Uhm...

224
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:48,442
<i>They say it's better to give than to receive,</i>

225
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,133
<i>but sometimes holding on to the perfect gift</i>

226
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,439
<i>gets you more than you ever thought possible.</i>

227
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,293
Tomorrow

228
00:11:56,991 --> 00:12:00,950
I'm taking you to the jewelry store, where
you can purchase anything you want.

229
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,440
Yeah! Right.

230
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,053
You can have anything you want.

231
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:09,685
right there.

232
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:13,764
Of course, sometimes the gift you give
isn't as perfect as you thought.

233
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:15,206
Tough news there, noobie.

234
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,870
Patient's leg is infected. There's no way
he's going to graduation.

235
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:19,982
What?!

236
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,301
All best.

237
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,094
<i>Today was gonna suck.</i>

238
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,557
<i>I hadn't told Emery he couldn't
go to his graduation,</i>

239
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,960
<i>plus I had forgotten that
Turk still owed me one,</i>

240
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:44,630
<i>and that yesterday we made a water baloon
so big that we acually named it.</i>

241
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,126
Fat Daddy.

242
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,574
Yeah!

243
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,817
So Gandhi, how does your wife
like her terrible present?

244
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,820
Uhm, I haven't told her yet.
I mean, you know, I was going to,

245
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,888
but her not knowing I understand spanish
is like having a secret power.

246
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,514
It got me flapjacks for dinner.

247
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:13,214
You got brinner?

248
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,398
Daaaamn Turkelton!

249
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,237
So, I gotta tell her,

250
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:19,847
I feel like I'm spying on her.

251
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,479
Marriage is a lifelong battle,

252
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,713
except we men have been given no weapons.

253
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,669
That's why I break into Enid's email account.

254
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,466
Not telling Jordan that I've
been reading her journal

255
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,751
is one of the best decisions I've ever made.

256
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,740
Now I know of all her hopes and dreams,
which, of course, make them easier to crush.

257
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:38,104
You know,

258
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,903
this morning I heard her
tell her friend  "Quisiera

259
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,517
que el no oliera como los huevos
despues de hacer ejercicios".

260
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,284
which meant

261
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,327
I wish he didn't smell like eggs every
time he works out, so I put on deodorant.

262
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,078
You know, when you think about it,

263
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:58,493
Carla not knowing I understand her
really is the best thing for her.

264
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:03,805
Welcome to the club! Have some pizza!

265
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:05,376
Crap.

266
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,475
- Mm... Fat Daddy?
- It was beautiful.

267
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,253
What am I gonna tell to Emery?
Did you get the song we wrote?

268
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,901
Nurse, do you mind?

269
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,428
# Going to graduation #

270
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:22,516
# I'm going to graduation #

271
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:26,529
It's called " I'm going to graduation"
(The graduation song)

272
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,233
Look, you already pulled yourself
out, let's just follow through.

273
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:31,222
I checked his infection, it's not that bad.

274
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:34,832
We just need an ambulance and some other
volunteers, and we can still pull this off.

275
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:36,219
Janitor, will you help?

276
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:37,859
Uh, no, I can't.

277
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,890
Now that I've cured Lady of
her fear of the unknown,

278
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,575
I'm working on her irrational
fear of losing loved ones.

279
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,969
I arranged for a couple of friends
of mine to kidnap her parents.

280
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,375
Aaw!

281
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,847
Aww!

282
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:55,112
Triple chocolate hazelnut fudge with
a filling made out of tiny brownies.

283
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,040
The baker said it would feed 16,

284
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,101
but I am going to take this Mama
Jama down in one sitting!

285
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,603
- Well?
- Well, what?

286
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:08,461
Perry...

287
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,445
Since I won free muffins
for life, I know I have

288
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:13,929
packed on a few, but this system is working.

289
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:17,240
I am even using the real holes in my belt

290
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,001
and not the ones I stabbed with
the screwdriver. So, come on!

291
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,856
I'll pretend to talk to
this guy. You ditch the cake.

292
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:26,996
Hey, random employee! Blah, blah, blah.

293
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,672
Bob, I'm very busy.

294
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,540
Fine.

295
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:38,891
Can't you people see I'm trying
to get some work done here? Leave!

296
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,480
For funzies, I'm gonna say
two words I've always

297
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,715
wanted to say ever since
I started working here.

298
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,936
You ready?

299
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,357
Make me. Ha ha!

300
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,750
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

301
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,481
- You did? I like it.
- I did. Uh.

302
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,938
I'm gonna go ahead and play
it that way. Uhm. Say, Carla...

303
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,248
That's not even true!

304
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,585
How did you even understand that?

305
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:03,980
Yeah, milk dud...

306
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,191
Is it because you comprehend all
languages and you are a super genius?

307
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:12,325
- That ain't it.
- Or is it that you secretly learned spanish,

308
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,095
so that you could spy on our dear
Carla here right underneath her nose?

309
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,611
- I trusted you.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?

310
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,620
I hope you're happy.

311
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:33,945
Oh, Bob...

312
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,591
All right! Thank you
for your help, guys.

313
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:40,381
You too, Lloyd!

314
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,484
Later, dude!

315
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,652
- You understood me!
- I should have told you right away.

316
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:57,638
Brinner had a lot to do
with it. I love brinner.

317
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,775
- Hello?
- So I should have told you. I'm sorry.

318
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,034
I forgive you.

319
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:06,844
Excuse me?

320
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,727
The other day, when I missed
that stupid play group meeting and

321
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,410
decided I was a horrible
mother and you told me

322
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,737
not to let a little mistake
erase a good thing...

323
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:15,885
Remember what I said?

324
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,333
This is gonna come back
to you in a good way.

325
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,285
This is it coming back?

326
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:25,032
Besides, it must have been really
hard for you to learn spanish.

327
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:27,157
It was so hard.

328
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,183
And it can be really tough
for you to learn new things.

329
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:34,013
- I know. I'm so slow.
- Say it in spanish.

330
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,077
Yo soy muy lento.

331
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:40,493
- Say it again.
- Yo soy muy lento.

332
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:49,596
I'm going to graduation, to graduation.

333
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,273
- I'm a little nervous.
- I can tell.

334
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,850
You're a little bit off key, but don't worry.

335
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:55,363
- Everything is gonna be just fine.
- Where's Turk?

336
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,120
Huh? I don't know...

337
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:04,096
- Lloyd?
- Just goin' with the vibe, bro.

338
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,597
Okay, buddy. It's time.

339
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:08,437
I'm gonna take out your I.V.

340
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:09,923
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

341
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,064
Okay, now...

342
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:13,738
The morphine I gave you
is gonna kick in soon.

343
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,800
We'll get you across the stage,
then we're back in the hospital.

344
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,978
- He's up next, guys.
- All right, good luck.

345
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,064
- Ok!
- All right, enjoy it!

346
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:26,923
Even though we couldn't actually see
Emery walk across and receive his diploma,

347
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,771
I think we all felt like this
is one of our proudest moment.

348
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,545
Yeah, we probably shouldn't have done that.

349
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,496
At least Emery's mom got some good pictures.

350
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,816
She said she could always
photoshop out his anguish.

351
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:51,156
Hey, how come you helped me, even
though I totally ignored your advice?

352
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,129
I don't know. You were
in a crappy situation...

353
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,526
and we're friends.

354
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:59,288
And yet we only hang out when
we're torturing burn victims.

355
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,608
That's just because we're
both usually seeing someone.

356
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,881
You and I both disappear
when we're in relationships.

357
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,270
All right, you know
what, let's make a pact.

358
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:11,210
From now on, let promise each
other that we'll always hang out,

359
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:13,308
even if the other
person's dating someone.

360
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,165
Deal.

361
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,640
But, what if one of us started
dating someone that could be the one?

362
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,531
Oh, we could totally diss
each other if it's the one,

363
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,549
- or if it's someone like preposterously hot.
- Agreed.

364
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,179
If I met a hottie, you'd never see me.

365
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:28,032
Oh. What's the rule if
the person's really fugly,

366
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:29,960
but really, really easy?

367
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,175
- Ha ha ha!

368
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:41,746
Como ellos. que apuesto que en cinco
semanas estan juntos otra vez.

369
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:45,418
Tu crees? alguna gente
no le va a gustar esto.

370
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,318
Si'.

371
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,402
Hey, I gotta go pick up Sam.
You want to come?

372
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:53,965
Yeah.

373
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,290
As long as you know that if I don't get
to hold him the whole time I'll probably cry.

374
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:04,042
I think in the end life is about the
connections we make, and the way...

375
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,618
Oh, my God! What the hell is he doing?

376
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:11,935
Don't look at me!

377
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:17,395
