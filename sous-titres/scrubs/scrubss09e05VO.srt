1
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,969
But you'll always carry
a piece of me with you.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,438
I'll be here
and I'll be here.

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,440
My stomach?
Well, I would have
touched your heart,

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,409
But I did that
to another female student,

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,373
And it resulted in me
having to watch

6
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:24,114
A 4-hour video called
"boundaries."
so teacher evaluations are due,

7
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:27,859
And I am going to use gold stars
and pony stickers for yours.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,653
lucy, that's sweet,

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,182
But I don't care about
those silly evaluations.

10
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:34,210
<i> yes! Lucy's in the bag.</i>

11
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:37,170
<i>But while I went out of my way
to connect with these kids,</i>

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,663
<i>Dr. Cox had
a different approach.</i>

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,594
All right then,
you gaggle of mini murderers,

14
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:44,624
I am going to make these
evaluations very easy for you.

15
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,921
Here are some adjectives that
describe my teaching style--

16
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,053
"abusive," "humiliating,"
"tyrannical" and "buttery."

17
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,651
Why "buttery"?

18
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,783
Because I don't care
what you write. Moving on.

19
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:59,050
It is time for your final
practical exam of the quarter--

20
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,515
Learning how to draw blood
from an actual human being.

21
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:03,481
Sadly, most of you will pass,

22
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,979
But there are one or two of you
out there

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,978
Who will botch this miserably,

24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,944
Proving once and for all
that you don't belong here.

25
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,578
And oh, my god.

26
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,410
it's like
it's christmas eve,

27
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:18,476
And one of you is
just a big box of failure

28
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,976
Waiting to be unwrapped.

29
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:23,877
I want to open ya.
I want to open ya so bad,

30
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:26,744
But no, I'm gonna wait,

31
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:30,611
Because the waiting makes it
so much sweeter.

32
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,145
I'll see you tomorrow.

33
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:37,246
"your stupidity is
so intense,

34
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,246
It's burning me in the face."

35
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:41,413
Oh, dr. Cox is
on a tear today.

36
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:44,480
I bet you 5 bucks
this kid cries.
Nah, he's not a crier.

37
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:49,182
He's the kind of guy who eats
to make the sad go away.
Is it wrong that
so much of what bonds us

38
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,149
Is sex and other people's pain?

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,149
Don't forget
our hatred of art.

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,749
Oh, yeah, art's the worst.
Re he comes.

41
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,451
I win.

42
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,018
But I actually cheated.

43
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,519
I had inside info.

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,853
I slept with that dude
during my fatty phase.

45
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,494
Powerful stuff, huh?

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,197
Six weeks ago,

47
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:33,832
I wrote one word on the board--

48
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,199
"medicine."

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,366
So what's the definition?

50
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,301
Well, if you believe
the silly dictionary,

51
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,770
It says that "it's the science
of health maintenance

52
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,638
And the prevention of disease."

53
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,772
Snore.

54
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:48,607
I think we're all dictionaries.

55
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:53,844
We all edit the user-generated
encyclopedias...

56
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,579
Of our hearts.

57
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:09,121
Those balloons were supposed to
fall at the end of my speech.

58
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,324
Okay, in front of you are
teacher evaluations.

59
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,759
Be honest.
I'm trying to mold your minds,

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,761
Not win some sort of
popularity contest.

61
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:20,797
Sweet! A coupon
for $2 off fro-yo!

62
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,699
Yeah, and, uh, tell 'em
dr. D. Sent you.

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,668
You'll get a little extra whip.

64
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,504
Great last class, buddy.

65
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:32,638
It's your last day. What do you want to do?
I don't know, turk. I've left so many times.

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,636
I've come back so many times.
Even I'm confused.

67
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:38,332
I think we should just sit
this one out, old friend.

68
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,533
I'm-a need a minute.

69
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:43,298
Turk, no.

70
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,933
Oh, hey, luce,
guess what I see.

71
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,233
Don't say it.
I see dead people.

72
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,465
Yep, 15th time's the charm.

73
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:56,702
Hey, dr. Cox. I was
just practicing for your exam.

74
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,237
Taking blood is so easy.

75
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,371
Dynamite work. But here's
the thing there--

76
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,806
You're going to have to do this
on a person who still has blood

77
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,126
And can feel pain,
not like this lump of flesh.

78
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,450
did you just flick
that cadaver's ear?

79
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,003
Yes.
I come down here

80
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,476
To both increase
my hand strength and relax.

81
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:18,677
Some people go on retreats.
I flick the dead.

82
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,023
huh.

83
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:21,510
Huh. That is so awesome.

84
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,060
<i>The teacher evaluations
were in.</i>

85
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:26,289
Okay.

86
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:27,985
What's it say, turk?
I can't look.

87
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:31,301
Dude, you're number one.
Yes! That's the part I wanted!

88
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:34,254
This reminds me of when I was
In my theater camp's production of "oliver."

89
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:35,785
I still remember my one line.

90
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:39,514
no, thank you. I don't like soup.
Hmm.

91
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:43,114
Hey, perry, don't you want
to see where you're ranked?

92
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,355
I'm quite sure I'm last.
I could not care less.

93
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:48,162
Don't feel bad, perry.
Maybe you can go find some solace

94
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,292
In one of your gym workouts.
Maybe.

95
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,179
ow!

96
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,628
I don't know how, but that
knocked the wind out of me.

97
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,768
Sync by ReHelen

98
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:07,243
www.addic7ed.com

99
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,512
"mesmerizing." "hilarious."

100
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:17,921
"if you only take one class
this year, make it dr. D.'s.

101
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,292
It's the nonstop thrill ride
of the quarter."

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,297
You know, perry, you might want
To watch a video called "boundaries,"

103
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:28,847
Especially the section on roughhousing.
Suck it up, mary lou.

104
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,296
You cannot get under my skin
today,

105
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,337
Not with reviews like these.

106
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,757
Wow.

107
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,273
<i>Oh, wrong. Really wrong.</i>

108
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:41,168
And what is this?
What is what?

109
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:43,719
"needy," "desperate,"

110
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,193
"light on medical knowledge,
heavy on broadway trivia."

111
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,947
He wrote that I don't care
about teaching

112
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,092
And I just want people
to like me.

113
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,582
I'm a fool.

114
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,740
I know. It's beautiful.

115
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,687
God, I wish these things
weren't anonymous.

116
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,196
I'd like to take this student
out and buy him a steak.

117
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,516
He nailed it. All the best.

118
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,491
Turk, am I needy?

119
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,734
No.
Tell me a hundred times.

120
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,827
Thanks for letting me
practice on you, dr. D.

121
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:17,438
I don't know why I'm having such
a hard time with this procedure.

122
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:20,885
How could anybody hate me? I'm
literally bleeding for you guys.

123
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:24,084
Ow! That's a muscle.
Aim for the blue lines.

124
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,536
Sorry. I don't knowate me? I'm
why I can't get this.

125
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,355
I used to have a problem
with the same thing,

126
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,604
But then I realized

127
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,227
You just gotta pretend
the needle's your friend.

128
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:33,991
Be careful, though. I told
that to a med student once,

129
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,405
And he became a heroin addict.
But just pretend the needle's

130
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,618
Your buddy and you two are
doing something you love to do.

131
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,025
Like roller-skating?

132
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,425
I would have said ice dancing,
but to each their own.

133
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,027
<i> here goes nothin'.</i>

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,099
I did it!

135
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:52,224
Dr. D., thanks
for always helping me

136
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,976
Through the tough stuff.
That's okay. Maybe you should practice

137
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,747
On, like, a student partner
or something,

138
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:58,240
Preferably someone who can't feel pain.

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,770
Ooh, like the incredible hulk.

140
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,704
The hulk can feel pain, turk.
Also, lasers hurt him.

141
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:06,462
Dude, I hope you paged me
'cause you came to your senses

142
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,499
And realized that we need
to do one last eagle.

143
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,964
Eagles are played-out, turk.

144
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:13,793
How dare you. You and I are gonna
find the kid that torched me.

145
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,915
You said you wanted to do
something this last week.

146
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,461
This is gonna be fun.

147
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,760
<i>We'll be like
the interracial hardy boys.</i>

148
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:26,621
Look. A clue--

149
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,850
A piece
of old man peterson's overalls.

150
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,442
That means he's the phantom
of cat scan island.

151
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:37,981
Dad's gonna be so proud of us,
black adopted brother.

152
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:39,481
All right, I'm in.

153
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:42,384
But you're buying me
a magnifying glass.

154
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,286
I got you a present.
What is it?

155
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,322
I don't know. It came out
of the guy in room 12.

156
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:50,191
That's sweet.
Aw. It's still warm.

157
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,286
Oh, god. Here's sunny.
Who's sunny?

158
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,795
Sunny is a wicker basket
of adorable kittens

159
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,764
Sliding down a shimmering
rainbow. Head for the hills.

160
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,633
Oh, hi, guys!
It's too late. If she talks to me, shoot me.

161
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,935
Denise, is this drew?

162
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,179
you said he was
handsome, but wow!

163
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:08,661
What's happening?
I can't believe denise found
that special someone.

164
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,655
When I first met her,
I thought, this woman is

165
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,743
Probably going to die alone,
but here she is and here you are

166
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,390
And here I am to ask you guys
if you'd like to go

167
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,444
On a double date with me and keyshawn.
I guess.

168
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:21,030
yes!
We're not doing that.

169
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,918
Of course not.
I was gonna say yes,

170
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,046
Then call her at the last
minute, tell her I'm sick,

171
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,825
Then change my cell phone
number. Yeah, I owe her that.

172
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,937
She is my closest female friend.
Hmm.

173
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:34,901
Cole, will you please be my
blood buddy for dr. Cox's exam?

174
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:36,702
Mm, sorry, baby, no can do.

175
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:39,917
Doc says I got tiny
baby veins--something to do

176
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,586
With my moms eating blowfish
in the third tri-mo.

177
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,755
besides, I've
seen you take blood before,

178
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:47,857
And you suck at it.

179
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,292
Somebody help me!

180
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,895
I have a family!

181
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,428
He's dealt with worse.

182
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,832
He came to this country
on a boat made of tires.

183
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,967
okay.

184
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:03,805
I guess I am gonna have
to break out the big guns.

185
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,843
No blood, no sex.

186
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,115
<i> turk and I were
hard at work</i>

187
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,650
<i>Trying to solve the mystery
of the feelings hurter.</i>

188
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:17,318
Now do you see how the r's
in this evaluation form

189
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,288
Are the same as in this test
from three months ago?

190
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:22,256
Dude, I totally see it.

191
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,125
Hello, barry friedman.

192
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,628
Hacking into
the med school files right now.

193
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:30,097
You can hack?
No, I have a password.
It just sounded cooler.

194
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,566
We're in.

195
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,767
Tell me a story, turk.

196
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:35,369
Barry friedman--
lives in the east dorms.

197
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,272
Okay, buckle up, barr.
We're coming for you.

198
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,008
Which way is east?

199
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,745
Oh, hey!

200
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:50,450
So... What's the plan
for tonight?

201
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:54,122
Drew doesn't want to go.
Bummer. Rain check?

202
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:55,490
Yeah. Definitely.

203
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,392
Yes! Look forward to it.

204
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,127
No. Not happening.

205
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,562
Oh.

206
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:02,664
How beautifully ironic

207
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,733
That the queen
of sensible slacks

208
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,302
Is not even wearing the pants
in her very own relationship.

209
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:10,005
What are you talking about?
Now I saw how fast
drew put the kibosh

210
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,907
On that double-dating idea.

211
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,443
Missy, you realize
you're shoulder-deep

212
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:17,479
In that inevitable turf war
that defines modern coupledom.

213
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,114
And psst!

214
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,750
he... Is... Winning.

215
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,751
and make
no mistake about it.

216
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:26,487
Early victories
are ha--huge.

217
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:29,490
In our first month dating,
jordan made me give up tomatoes,

218
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,660
Speaking to my mother
and my ponytail.

219
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:35,763
Honest to god, I can
still feel it some mornings.

220
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,299
That's not the way it is
with drew and me.

221
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,902
I see your point. Because you
are so very different

222
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,404
From every other couple

223
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:45,273
In the history
of doomed relationships.

224
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:48,243
Note to self--
they're different.

225
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:53,214
I think this is
barry friedman's room.

226
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:56,217
23, right?
Turk, I can see
the number 23 from here.

227
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,086
We don't need that
stupid magnifying glass.

228
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,322
<i>Damn. Why didn't I get
one of those for me?</i>

229
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:04,125
<i>You've got to be careful when
you're working a mystery...</i>

230
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,299
Dr. Kelso!

231
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,001
Well, well.

232
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,670
Come in or shut the door.

233
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,972
You're lettin' all the funk out.

234
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,140
<i>Because you might not like
what you find...</i>

235
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,977
Hey, I know you were thinking
of chinese food tonight,

236
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:26,479
But I want to do italian.
Okay.

237
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,948
Great.

238
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,283
Perfect.

239
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,390
Oh. Mm.

240
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:45,064
<i>Especially if what you discover</i>

241
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,999
<i>Is that you're still
totally lost.</i>

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,968
Come on, girl, do it!

243
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,638
Make me bleed!

244
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,873
I can't do it.

245
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,643
I'm never gonna be able
to do it.

246
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,713
There's my big box
of failure.

247
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:04,651
Aw, santa, you got my letters,
you fat bastard.

248
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,324
oh, crap.

249
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,607
Dr. Kelso, why are you here?

250
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:20,107
This is my sex pad.

251
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,342
And what have you done
with barry friedman?

252
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:25,177
He dropped out of med school
two weeks after it started.

253
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,914
I've been using his dorm room
as my love nest.

254
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,483
I can't get with a gal

255
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,886
In the same bed
I shared with enid.

256
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,754
Gives me the softies.

257
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,742
Wow, that's disgusting.
Ugh. Threw up in my mouth a little.

258
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,659
Well, looks like
we hit a dead end.

259
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,327
Oh, dear god, newbie.

260
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,395
Don't tell me you're still
looking for the visionary

261
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,663
Who gave you the bad review.
Yes, I am.

262
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,764
I know you don't give a damn
about what students think,

263
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,921
But I want them to remember me
as someone who was nurturing.

264
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:51,963
So let me get this straight.

265
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:55,411
You're going to find this kid...
Then what?

266
00:12:55,411 --> 00:13:00,005
I'm gonna change his mind.
Excellent use of your time.

267
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,774
Forget him.

268
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,653
Turk, gather all the students
in the lecture hall.

269
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:05,610
All of 'em?

270
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,600
Just lure them there with
something young people like,

271
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
Like pizza or rob schneider.

272
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:11,824
So pizza?

273
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,857
Sure.
Okay.

274
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:14,795
Dr. D.,

275
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:18,489
I really need you to be
my blood buddy for the exam.

276
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,024
Lucy, I'm glad that I make you
feel comfortable, but--

277
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,326
If you could just help me
get through this one,

278
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,395
I know next time
I can do it on my own.
It's just that I'm working
a case right now.

279
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:31,165
<i>A-and I'm this close to crackin'
this mother wide open.</i>

280
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,200
<i> okay, I know dr. D.
Can't resist my puppy dog look.</i>

281
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:37,136
<i> oh, crap!
She's puppy dogging me.</i>

282
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:42,340
<i>Be strong.</i>

283
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,975
Thank you.

284
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,369
We're going to dinner
with sunny and keyshawn.

285
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,181
I thought you didn't want to go.
Well, now I do.

286
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:53,856
Wear your black shirt
and dial the hair gel back.

287
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:55,379
You're not doing the weather
on channel 7.

288
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:00,348
So who gave dr. Dorian

289
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,779
A negative review?

290
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,386
Many of you had motives.

291
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:09,025
Mary, there was
the unfortunate incident

292
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,134
Where I called you "mark" for
the first part of the quarter.

293
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:14,568
But now I'm a major supporter
of your softball team,

294
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,071
So we worked that out.

295
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,367
Jeremy,
of course I suspected you.

296
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,525
You take a little too long
to laugh at my jokes.

297
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:26,147
But I forgot to account
for your interpreter.

298
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,816
I apologize

299
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,785
<i>For not giving you
a proper hearing.</i>

300
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,888
Thank you, jeremy.

301
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,292
Dr. Turk and I are going to
keep you in here all day

302
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,323
Until whomever gave me
the negative review

303
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:41,546
Steps forward.

304
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:46,366
Who amongst you has the courage
to step forward and say,

305
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,804
"hey, I am the coward!"

306
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,439
Oh, dear lord, newbie.

307
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,341
It was me.

308
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,643
perry?

309
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,467
Hey, why would you
do that to me?

310
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:09,398
Because, as always,
pushing your buttons amuses me.

311
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:10,452
And I know you don't think

312
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,628
I have anything left
to teach you,

313
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:14,113
But maybe
I wanted you to see

314
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,924
Just how ridiculous
you truly are,

315
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,329
Constantly chasing
their approval.

316
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:20,575
Sorry to interrupt, dr. Dorian.
I just wanted to make sure

317
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,065
You were still gonna be my blood buddy.
I'll be there.

318
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:25,557
What?

319
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,603
You can't even help yourself,
can ya?

320
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,220
Dorian, in oer for these kids
to really learn,

321
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,689
Sooner or later you gotta
let go of their hands.

322
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:37,859
So I'm supposed to be like you
and just rule by fear?

323
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,627
Perry, they hate you.

324
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:43,263
Yes, they do, and sure, I could
be a little bit kinder.

325
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,766
But that's not going to happen,
and here's why--

326
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,869
We're creating doctors,
not kindergarteners.

327
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,737
Th need me.

328
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:52,005
Do they?

329
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,007
Because I don't ever remember

330
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,130
Holding your smooth little doll hand,

331
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,462
And you turned out to be
not too horrible a doctor.

332
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:04,577
So I'm here

333
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,087
For our ridiculous
couples date.

334
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:10,099
Where are they?
They're at the bar.

335
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,471
I told them they couldn't
sit with us.

336
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:16,454
Okay, let's sneak out the ba
and go play air hockey.

337
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,015
Why did you make me
come here?

338
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:22,156
So I could win, which I did.
Look, I had to do something.

339
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,641
You were trying to make
a power play.

340
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:26,884
No, I just didn't want to go
on some stupid double date.

341
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,982
So far, this has just been
a hookup thing.

342
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:32,291
Why are you acting like we're in
some big serious relationship?

343
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,909
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Not that I'm against it.

344
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,597
Normally by now I would've
sabotagethis by...

345
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,736
I don't know, getting hammered
at thanksgiving

346
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,734
And making out with one of your
aunts, and I haven't done that.

347
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:44,215
And I think that's good.
I feel like I'm growing.

348
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,626
You know what?

349
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,295
I'm into it if you are.

350
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,799
Do you wanna talk about
us being in a relationship?

351
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:57,055
I have news for you.
We're in a relationship.

352
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,917
What?
Yeah, I decided, like,
a month ago. I didn't tell you?

353
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:09,642
damn it.
I actually like you.

354
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,482
Y-you stole from me?

355
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,285
<i>Going to steal.
Big difference.</i>

356
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,055
<i> come on, dr. D.</i>

357
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,689
<i>Where are you?</i>

358
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:23,957
Done!

359
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:27,494
That vein didn't stand a chance.
I owned that bitch!

360
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,429
As much as it pains me
to admit it,

361
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:32,033
That bitch is indeed yours.
Well done.

362
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,436
jingle bells,
you're next.

363
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,471
Great. Yes.

364
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:40,641
Let me just pop up front,

365
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:44,644
And I will take some blood.

366
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,446
What are you doing?

367
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,082
Stalling until dr. Dorian
gets here.

368
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:50,751
He's on his way.

369
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,685
And when he gets here,

370
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,723
I am going to drain
his main vein.

371
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:00,727
You have five minutes.

372
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,964
<i>So we are in a relationship?
Yeah.</i>

373
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:07,033
Are there any other decisions
that you made

374
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,768
That I need to know about?

375
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:10,803
I mean, are we exclusive?
You are.

376
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:14,206
But don't worry. We'll go over
all the rules later.

377
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,474
Hey, guys.

378
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,243
This is keyshawn.
He's the bomb.

379
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:21,612
That's great. You order drinks.
I'm gonna go hit the head.

380
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,515
What should we order for her?

381
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,418
Yeah, she's not coming back.

382
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:32,154
No problem. Uh, it just means
more drew time.

383
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:35,226
<i> being there for someone
is never easy.</i>

384
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,434
<i>You don't want to let down
the people you care about.</i>

385
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:38,347
Time's up.

386
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,227
Do it now or fail.

387
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,439
But... I don't have
a partner.

388
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,714
Yeah, you do.

389
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,485
Just remember,
you're terrified of me.

390
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:50,210
I am.

391
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:51,514
Go ahead.

392
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:58,050
<i>But sometimes being there
for someone</i>

393
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,919
<i>Means not being there at all.</i>

394
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,855
the needle is my friend.

395
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:09,091
The needle is my friend.

396
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:25,174
I did it.
I actually did it.

397
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,643
You most certainly did.
And the good news is

398
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:30,145
That med school gets
a lot easier after this.

399
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,413
Really?
No.

400
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:33,256
No.

401
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,933
Oh, hey, thanks a lot
for not showing up.

402
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,935
By the way, I did it
all on my own,

403
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,361
And I didn't need you after all.
That's good, isn't it?

404
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:48,393
Lucy?

405
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,820
Good luck.

406
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:57,851
Well, this is it.
I can't believe you.

407
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,020
I can't believe you don't
want to do one last eagle.

408
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:02,722
This could be our last eagle
before our next last eagle.

409
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:04,488
Turk, gather the students.

410
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:06,732
All right, but they're not gonna
fall for rob schneider again.

411
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:08,106
Then pull out the big guns.

412
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,788
Tell them it's the cast of "twilight."

413
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,338
Kids love sexy vampires.
I'm on it.

414
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,167
The cast of "twilight's"
in the quad!

415
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,102
The cast of "twilight's"
in the quad!

416
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:19,926
J.D., are we really
doing this?

417
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:22,260
Yes, turk. It's time to finally
realize the dream.

418
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,880
Super eagle!

419
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,291
eagle!

420
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,563
Oh, look who it is!

421
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,465
Oh, dear god.

422
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,238
<i>God, that is ridiculous.</i>

423
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:38,294
What is it?

424
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:41,468
That is my prescription
fiber drink with rum.

425
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:42,896
I love that!

426
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:47,012
Ay, you got any
of those wiener pills?

427
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,712
Who do you think
you're talking to, son?

428
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,791
I'll give you one
for 10 bucks.

429
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:54,226
You got change for a 20?
Nope.

430
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,766
We'll drop a couple
of these bad boys

431
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,090
And go trolling for ladies
at the airport bar.

432
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,301
Will you be my grandpa?

433
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,817
Why, sure, little man.

434
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,436
Sure.

435
