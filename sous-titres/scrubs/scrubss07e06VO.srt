1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,583
Got somthing on your face...

2
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:05,683
oh oh what?
Me.

3
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:10,798
my god I feel like such a hoebag
but I'm still glad I did it

4
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:14,983
I do declare spending special
relationary time with my girlfriend...

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,683
makes me happier then a
bullfrog in a beetle bin

6
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:20,283
Why are you talking like that?

7
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:22,384
Cause I'm smitten with my
girlfriend lady...

8
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:24,484
and this is my smitten voice

9
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:26,584
Why? What voice do you use
when you're smitten

10
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,684
My normal voice

11
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:32,084
You know what? You hide it well
but you're a very strange person

12
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:34,184
M'aam

13
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:50,204
How'd I do...

14
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:52,304
17 that's impressive...

15
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:54,404
but I'm going to kick your arse...

16
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,504
and, time me

17
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,004
What's going on seabizzle?

18
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,104
We're seeing who can last the
longest in Mr Silar's room

19
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:04,204
He has a fungal infection under the
fat flaps in his stomash

20
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:08,104
It smells like the time I put Izzy's
doo-doo diaper in the microwave.

21
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:10,804
you guys are playing smelly-belly

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,904
Time?
16 seconds.

23
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,504
Come on - I win
See that's what I'm talking about...

24
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:18,404
that's how it goes when you fight me

25
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,004
Hold On Turk Let's
not declare victory...

26
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:23,004
until we give a shot
to Dr John Dorian...

27
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:25,229
and his nostrils of steel

28
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:27,628
Your nose can't handle smells
of that magnitude

29
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:29,728
Make some room...

30
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,343
uh-huh, on the clock uh-huh...

31
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:32,743
you have got to be kidding me...

32
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,843
that is the most disgusting thing
I have ever smelt...

33
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:38,943
and a sugar free latte for...
the winner

34
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,083
Victory tastes delicious

35
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,643
You guys aren't even friends...

36
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,243
why do you spend so much time
competing over every thing...

37
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:46,843
because we're men...

38
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,443
and that's what men do...

39
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:49,843
now a quick look to Turk...

40
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,948
to see if that is what men do

41
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:53,548
Huh whatta you know...

42
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,648
don't forget I crushed you in
find the vein in the junkie...

43
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,648
yeah but I beat you good at gossball

44
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:02,748
That's nothing yesterday
I won fee muffins for life...

45
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:04,148
by guessing how many coffee beans...

46
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,648
there were in that there jar

47
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,048
Actually they had a recount...

48
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,548
and you came in second

49
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:10,148
What?
Who came in first?

50
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:13,348
#You know the muffin man
the muffin man#

51
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,048
If anyone need me I'll
be in my office...

52
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,038
going to town on these bad boys...

53
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,848
why are you guys obsessed...

54
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,648
with reliving everything you've won

55
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:24,788
Because we're winners...

56
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,848
and that's what winners do...

57
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,548
back to Turk for confirmation...

58
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:30,648
damn it.

59
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,248
if you'd ever won anything...

60
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,948
you'd know what we're talking about

61
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,343
Oh I've won something Perry

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,060
We threw our nerd farther then yours

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Suck It Bitch

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Guys I think their
nerd is unconscious...

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
we should probably roll him over

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,335
That's the moment I realised
I wanted to be a doctor

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Scrubs - Season 7 Episode 6
My Number One Doctor

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Subtitles by STS

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Every doctor has their own way
of dealing with patients

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Turk was all about efficiency

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Why are you standing on a chair?

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Because from this spot I can see
into 4 rooms...

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
without actually going in...

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,100
check it

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,500
Patients of Doctor Turk...

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,900
how are we?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
OK...

78
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,900
all good

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,300
Fine...

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
muffled answer...

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
guy had some tongue surgery...

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
he's actually OK though

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Elliot referred a more
personal approach

84
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,760
Shannon what's happening girlfriend?

85
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,800
yeah I know I cant pull off
calling someone girlfriend...

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,400
but she likes it so

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I do can't help it

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Shannon's back...

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
it's been so great
getting to know her...

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
see that's the great thing
about being in private practice

91
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,700
You get to treat the same patients
all the time...

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
oh come on you guys...

93
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,470
[whispers] shhh
people are sleeping here...

94
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,500
[whispers] well I guess you
think it's so funny...

95
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,900
[speaks normally] Why am I whispering...

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,500
listen Barbie, I'd love to take
credit for this idea...

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,405
but it was all Big Bobby Kelso...

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ah come on heck

99
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Quick announcement
I have signed sacred heart...

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
up for website called
Rate your Doctor...

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
where patients can evaluate
and score their doctors

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,300
I think it's going to lead to a better
patient care...

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,900
and if along the way...

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
you all become paranoid
and overly competitive...

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
happy birthday to me

106
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
Dr Kelso I became a doctor
to save lives...

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
heal wounds...

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
and occasionally drop the M.D. Bomb...

109
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
to pull hot tail in bars...

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
you know what else works?

111
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Cosmonaut. Try it thank me later

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Noted

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Oh I reckon my lady is as purty...

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
as a porcupine on roller skates...

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
that doesn't even make sense

116
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
That's what we smitten folk
call a metaphor...

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
you young lady...

118
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
have a head that's as empty as...

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,700
a whipperwheel in a tub of moonshine...

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
there you go...

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
he's out of his freaking mind...

122
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
how does that woman go out with him?

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Well I would say that love is blind...

124
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
but we both know that isn't true...

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,500
my love for Enid falls
a percentage point...

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
with every pound she gains

127
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,100
Since our wedding day

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I am 136% less in love with her...

129
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
you really going to comment
on your wife's weight...

130
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
when you have muffins
stuffed down your pants

131
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I like them warm

132
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,100
So you're experiencing...

133
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,700
vomiting and shortness of breath...

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
neither of which are consistant
with your ALS...

135
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
[JD] It's hard to be comfortable...

136
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,600
around terminal patients...

137
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,100
but Shannon made it easy

138
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
So how's the ALS progressing

139
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh it's been a blast...

140
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
her legs are fully paralysed...

141
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
and her arms are on their way

142
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,400
That does sound fun...

143
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
yeah but you know what

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
I think I'm ready for all this...

145
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,900
said goodbye to all my friends...

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
hell I even had my funeral already...

147
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,245
she looked so beautiful in her casket

148
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm sure you did

149
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,200
I wasn't in a casket

150
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
I know that...

151
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,700
come on who would do that...

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
except for vampires

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I told you he was gullible

154
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
Shannon I hate to leave...

155
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
but I really want to get these down
the lab for testing

156
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
OK

157
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I can stay...

158
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
so you went to your own funeral huh...

159
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
people sad enough for you?

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,300
most of them...

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,700
and anyone that wasn't crying
got a talking to

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
You should have invited me

163
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I can cry on cue...

164
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
say dead puppies 'dead puppies'

165
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Connecting with patients...

166
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
always come easier to me
then it did to some others

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,500
Have a good day Mr Woolmer

168
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,900
Wow... you actually learned
your patients name

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
If you don't kill them
in the operating room...

170
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,300
you can take them out dancing

171
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,900
I doubt it

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm amputating his foot later...

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,100
but he's still going to give me
a good review...

174
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
you see we're D.B.F.Fs Huh?

175
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
Diabetic best friends forever...

176
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
you don't usually bond
with your patients

177
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,200
You're not going to change who
you are as a doctor...

178
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,000
to get good ratings are you?

179
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Hell to the no

180
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Are you?

181
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
{laughs] oh please.

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,300
So you're declining chemo...

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,600
because wikipedia says
the raw food diet...

184
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
reverses the effects of bone cancer

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well - Hey any info you have...

186
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
that I can pass on to
my other patients...

187
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,500
would just be super and by-the-by...

188
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
while you're on your computer...

189
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,255
perhaps you could jump over to a
site called rateyourdoc. org...

190
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
patients of Doctor Turk...

191
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
would you like any ono-on-one time...

192
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,400
with your surgeon

193
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Please. Sure.
Yeah. Love to.

194
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,100
A private consultation
with my surgeon...

195
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
would be very much appreciated
thank you

196
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,870
Damn someone's done
their healing too fast

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There, I gave you 5 stars

198
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Thank you and now I have
to take your laptop from you...

199
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
as I've deemed you just too
damn stupid to use it.

200
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
You see those bell peppers
that you're munching

201
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
They're going to do a
truckload of jack...

202
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
against the cancer raging
inside of your body...

203
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
of course I've only been a doctor
for some twenty years...

204
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,424
and the person who wrote...

205
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,508
that wikipedia entry also authored...

206
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:23,631
the Battlestar Galactica
episode guide...

207
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,731
so what the heck do I know...

208
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:29,831
but if you feel like living page me...

209
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,931
so 'Lady' is an unusual name

210
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,231
Oh tell me about it

211
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:38,731
I was conceived after my parents...

212
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,431
saw the movie 'Lady and the Tramp'

213
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:42,531
That's so sweet yeah

214
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:45,031
Oh gotta go and meet my guy out front

215
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,131
Nice meeting you Carla

216
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:51,051
Sir you'll never believe this...

217
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,431
'Lady' is normal

218
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,731
I'm sorry did you
also win free muffins for life

219
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,331
I didn't think so

220
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,731
Now let me read the final
Harry Potter novel in peace...

221
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,831
everyone's already read that...

222
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,931
yes but if anyone divulges
any details to me...

223
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:06,731
what happens Murphy?

224
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:08,831
You draw Harry Potter Glasses
on their face...

225
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,931
in permanent marker That's right

226
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:13,031
Now I don't give a hoot...

227
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:15,331
about the janitor and his gal pal OK...

228
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,931
so shove off

229
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,031
You wouldn't dare draw on me...

230
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:20,731
and I already know if Harry...

231
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,871
lives or dies at the end

232
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,451
So Lady's completely normal huh?

233
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:29,531
Can you believe that?

234
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,831
HI Elliot wassup?

235
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,131
Good News

236
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,731
Your symptoms aren't ALS related
you just took to many baclofens...

237
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,831
you probably just mixed up your meds...

238
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:40,931
[JD] In a hospital little mysteries...

239
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,831
get solved every day

240
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,931
You look nice

241
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:47,531
I'm just glad to get out of that uni
and into my regular clothes.

242
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,231
That's why she likes him...

243
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:50,831
he's pretending to be normal...

244
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,931
[shouts] NO WAY.

245
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,431
too much?
mmm-huh...

246
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,531
[JD] Sometimes the answers right
in front of your face...

247
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,631
you gotta be kidding me
there has to be an error...

248
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,715
are you guys still looking
at that stupid website?

249
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,798
I told you those ratings
are meaningle.......

250
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:05,398
I'm number 1

251
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,898
The number 1 doctor yes yes...

252
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,998
number 1 number 1

253
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,098
I gotta make a big phone call...

254
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,198
call mommy...

255
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,398
and sometime you never could
have seen it coming

256
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,198
You gotta be more careful with
your medications

257
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,998
I mean the Baclofens aren't so bad...

258
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,123
but if you took too
many benzodiazepines

259
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,223
You could have died...

260
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,298
then that's definately what I'll
do next time

261
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:29,398
Grape?

262
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,298
Why would you purposefully overdose?

263
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,398
You know the answer to that

264
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:40,998
I've said my goodbyes...

265
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,098
and soon I won't be able to
move my arms...

266
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:44,698
or even speak

267
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,798
I am literally going to die...

268
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,398
entombed in this body...

269
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,498
a lifeless burden to Gayle...

270
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:51,698
who's Gayle?

271
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,298
My home care nurse

272
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:58,073
I know she's sweet but
she's a little silly for my taste

273
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,098
Oh God she flying.

274
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,923
how is she getting her scarf
to blow like that

275
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,023
I get to go next

276
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:13,023
Elliot

277
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,923
I want things to end on my terms...

278
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,523
and in a few months

279
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,223
I won't even be able to do that

280
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:20,923
Why are you telling me all of this?

281
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,723
I mean this goes against
everything I stand for

282
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,823
Shannon I'm your doctor

283
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,223
I know...

284
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,623
but you're also my friend

285
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,163
One blueberry please...

286
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,563
because i can

287
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,363
So.. What do you want to do tonight?

288
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,463
Well it's Friday which is date night

289
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,563
So perhaps we should see a movie...

290
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:48,863
and then get some ice cream...

291
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:51,343
while we walk and hold hands

292
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:53,443
I vote Yes

293
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:57,543
What the hell are you doing?

294
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:58,743
Khaki?

295
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,243
You never wear khaki

296
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,643
My uniform is khaki

297
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,143
Your uniform is blue...

298
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:04,243
no yes...

299
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:05,643
leave me alone...

300
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:07,543
yeah right

301
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,643
Are you coming?

302
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,743
well I might as well

303
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:14,668
Miriam here has already ruined
the book for me

304
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:18,593
The rate your doc website...

305
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,788
also had a comments section

306
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,388
Oh come on
what's up with Dr Cox's hair?

307
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,988
One week he's bald The next week he...

308
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:27,573
looks like Shirley Temple
signed Michelle M.

309
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,648
Oh it's called rate your 'doc'. org

310
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,173
I'm on a completely different
more awesome site

311
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,073
See Woah.

312
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,873
Can I borrow your laptop

313
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,413
Just for a second please Thank you

314
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:40,713
Yep.

315
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,213
Still number one

316
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:43,913
Now to put the cursor back...

317
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,713
on Doctor Turk who's lower down...

318
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,813
on the ranking list scrolling down...

319
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,463
scrolling scrolling fake watch

320
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,478
Scrolling

321
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,578
There he is...

322
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:58,213
all the way at the bottom
right above Dr Murphy here

323
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:01,083
How can I be last?
All my patients are dead

324
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:04,198
Doug, do you remember that guy
you put in the morgue drawer?

325
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:05,898
Turns out he was just heavily sedated

326
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,998
Oh yeah you're right...

327
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,598
all the comments are from him

328
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,298
My ALS patient just told me...

329
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,923
she tried to kill herself

330
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,903
Shannon?
What are you going to do?

331
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,203
Well Barbie you have two choices...

332
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,303
you can either tell on her
or look the other way

333
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:20,898
Now me I'd go ahead and crank up
the Moody Blues...

334
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:23,863
and suffocate her with a pillow
cause I'm a helper...

335
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,463
as always thank you...

336
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,563
welcome.

337
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,463
Someone named Coco Blasco wrote...

338
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:29,863
that she's sick of me saying...

339
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,398
'That's what I'm talking about'

340
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:35,983
but sometimes it is
what I'm talking about

341
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,615
Tell me this...

342
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:40,715
do you like her?

343
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:44,345
Well I've never met
her before but nah...

344
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,445
in fact I may hate her

345
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,145
I'm talking about Lady...

346
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,545
if you like her...

347
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,685
you can't keep lying to her
about who you are

348
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,785
Hogwash Lie forever...

349
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,885
it's the natural form
of communication...

350
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,985
between men and women

351
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,402
Hell Enid still thinks it's
too snowy to go outside

352
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:05,502
I spray the windows
with shaving cream...

353
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:08,302
to keep her out of the yard
her wheelchair tears up the grass

354
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,502
Until you let Lady know the real you...

355
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,552
your relationship is not real
and it's going to end...

356
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,852
but I want it to end

357
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:18,652
That's his sad voice

358
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,492
I can't lose to JD
I don't care what it takes

359
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:25,692
I thought he was your best friend

360
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,392
Winning is way more
important then friendship...

361
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,492
my gran gran taught me that...

362
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,592
his patients love him
how do we undo that...

363
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,517
after you're done rating me
on rateyourdoc. org...

364
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:37,337
go to my website the toddtime. com...

365
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:40,262
be sure to check out the
'Tranny Todd' feature

366
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:45,292
It lets you see what the big dog
looks like with girl parts

367
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,492
M'aam the key to a speedy recovery...

368
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,569
is less moaning more boning...

369
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,744
as sure as my name is
Doctor John Dorian...

370
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,643
that's what I'm talking about

371
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:00,443
I said it again yeah

372
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,543
Ah damn

373
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,243
Hey

374
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,343
I've been looking for you...

375
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,443
you can't imagine what it's like
to know you're going to be...

376
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,543
trapped in your own body...

377
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,618
just waiting for your misery to end

378
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:15,573
Elliot you can't let this girl do
this again...

379
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,873
you gotta tell Gayle
so she can police it...

380
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:21,013
but may be dying is
the right choice for her...

381
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:25,023
but i don't think it's
the right choice for you...

382
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,438
you know as doctors
sometime we have to...

383
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,538
protect ourselves first

384
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,638
I know you better than anybody...

385
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:34,238
you believe in the sanctity of life...

386
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,338
if you let this girl kill herself...

387
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,073
it's going to haunt you forever

388
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,238
I can handle it...

389
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,503
you remember when you were
treating that teenager...

390
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:45,403
and you broke his i-pod...

391
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:48,303
you felt so guilty you let
him take you to prom...

392
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:51,888
yeah but I left early
and I barely put out

393
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:55,048
I just don't want you to get hurt...

394
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,889
you're right

395
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,989
I'll tell Gayle

396
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,689
Thanks...

397
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:07,009
do you know I'm the number one
doctor in the hospital...

398
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,109
yes JD I got all......

399
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,809
Oh hi are we going out?

400
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,909
what's with the jumpsuit?

401
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,609
Well first of all
if we're going to make it...

402
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,509
not a jumpsuit shirt, belt, pants...

403
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:19,809
oh O.K.

404
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:23,604
Secondly I think it's time you knew
the real me...

405
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,704
all right here we go

406
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,304
I'm not like normal people

407
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,414
I don't have super powers
but I'm working on it...

408
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:34,744
for instance watch me move this pen...

409
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:39,489
it worked at home I don't know why...

410
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,589
maybe my table is slanted...

411
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,689
anyway in my spare time

412
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,789
I also enjoy stuffing animals...

413
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,889
usually with other animals...

414
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:51,114
for instance a badger
will hold five squirrels...

415
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,714
a squirrel will hold most of a cat...

416
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,814
a mouse will hold a shrew and a vole...

417
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,914
you get the idea circle of life

418
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,014
I have broken the sound barrier...

419
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,114
but you must never ask me how

420
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,514
I don't believe in the moon
I think it's just the back of the sun

421
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:07,334
Huh I love a good train wreck...

422
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,514
furthermore, I think if you look
closely at...

423
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,599
stop it you
she doesn't know you're joking...

424
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,999
oh he's joking

425
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,499
Thank God...

426
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
and so the lying begins

427
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,699
You big joker...

428
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,029
go change and I'll meet you outside...

429
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,274
what just happened?

430
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,374
did I just blackout?
did the pen move?

431
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,474
you have to dole out your crazy
in little pieces...

432
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,574
you can't do it all at once...

433
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,674
oh, all right

434
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,174
Hey watta say 23?

435
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:38,474
Oh my God another new nickname...

436
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:39,974
but what does it mean?

437
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:43,374
play it cool 23
you'll find out eventually...

438
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,474
that's what they call me...

439
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:46,874
why do they call me that?

440
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,674
It's your new website rating

441
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:50,374
What?
How did I drop so low?

442
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,474
you know after I fix
that gall bladder...

443
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:57,419
you might want me to do something
about those flat boobies

444
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,234
All I wanted to do was
win at something...

445
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,834
for once and when I finally do...

446
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,234
you have to go and...

447
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,334
Excuse me
but do you really want me here...

448
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,434
for a lecture that I'm not going
to feel the least bit guilty about...

449
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,534
dismissed...

450
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:13,634
him I expect this from but you...

451
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,974
you're my closest friend

452
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,034
In college we shared a toothbrush

453
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,599
I was not aware of that we did...

454
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:25,219
look, is there anything I can do
to make it up to you

455
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,319
Here you go buddy...

456
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,459
your very own unicorn...

457
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,019
she's glorious

458
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,019
Turk My Bad...

459
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,290
is there anything I can do
to make it up to you

460
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,390
Here's your Unicorn

461
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,490
Turk, she's beautiful

462
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,590
Oh look at her mane

463
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,690
Turk

464
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,765
I gotta tell ya Unicorns aren't real...

465
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,160
stop it they're not real...

466
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:04,565
there's nothing you can do...

467
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,165
what if I let you beat
me in basketball...

468
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:07,465
while the nurses watch?

469
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,185
Can we yell white lightning
everytime I make a basket...

470
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:12,285
we always do

471
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:18,185
Gayle's bringing the cat around
so I guess this is......

472
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,005
Don't You know I hate the G word

473
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,770
Elliot thank you for everything...

474
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,845
you've been an amazing friend to me

475
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
White Lightning

476
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,655
Dude, enough practise lay-ups
I'm getting hoarse

477
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
White Lightning...

478
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
are you even listening to me?

479
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,890
[JD] when you have something you
have to get off your chest

480
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
There are a couple of things you can do

481
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,890
You can test the water...

482
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,175
check this out
I found it at a garage sale

483
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,655
Oh my God that is disgusting

484
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah I know I think so too

485
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:01,400
I just wanted to make sure
we were on the same page...

486
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,590
[JD] Or you can come completely clean

487
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,145
I talked to Kelso about the whole
Todd thing...

488
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,745
and you're back at number 1

489
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:12,845
That's what I'm talking about

490
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,820
I figure as you can't say it anymore
maybe I can have it

491
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
No...

492
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,045
[JD] of course if you're really
the number one doctor...

493
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:22,145
you might end up
keeping things to yourself

494
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,475
Is there anything else I need to know?

495
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,490
No Nothing else...

496
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,520
[JD} Even if it will haunt you forever

497
