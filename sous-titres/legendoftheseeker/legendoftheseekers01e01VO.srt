1
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,084
Take them down!

2
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:56,885
Kahlan!

3
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,576
Shoot her!

4
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:41,891
Hold on, Dennee!

5
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,600
Stay with me!

6
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:45,342
We're almost there!

7
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,307
Dennee!

8
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:19,412
Dennee.

9
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Take it.

10
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,151
Take the Book.

11
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,328
Find him.

12
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,062
This is more important than me.

13
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,350
You know that.

14
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,697
Please, Kahlan.

15
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:49,608
May the Spirits protect you,
little sister.

16
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:52,573
Kahlan.

17
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:58,074
Go.

18
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:44,012
You've reached the Boundary, Confessor.

19
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,230
There is nowhere else to run.

20
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,851
Steady, boy.

21
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:06,710
She's got magic!

22
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,594
Ride to the garrison at Kaldrith.

23
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,929
Send word to Lord Rahl:

24
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,647
the Confessor has broken
through the Boundary.

25
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,877
- Yes, sir.
- You three are coming with me.

26
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:29,498
But sir...

27
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:43,080
Sync: michvanilly & Kasius

28
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,350
Hi, Richard.

29
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:35,851
Jared.

30
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:38,344
- You're just in time.
- For what?

31
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,133
You can be the first to cross.

32
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:45,700
Or you can go all the way
to the North Bridge,

33
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,684
but this will save you two hours' walk.

34
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:51,938
Don't worry. It's safe.

35
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,884
It's not me that's scared.

36
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,192
It's Lanie.

37
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,208
Of course.

38
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:02,322
Smart cow.

39
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:05,223
Never cross a bridge
that hasn't been tested.

40
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,369
Come on, boy.

41
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,507
- Lanie has anything to worry about.
- Thanks, Richard.

42
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,751
My best to your father.

43
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,879
- Flynn, come.
- Hungry, boy?

44
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,740
Yeah, me too.
Come on.

45
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,392
- Stay back.
- Shoot her.

46
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,129
Leave her alone.

47
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,816
You're making a mistake, boy.

48
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,417
This girl is dangerous.

49
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:09,010
Four men against one woman?
I think she's the one in danger.

50
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,121
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

51
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,556
And this is not your fight.

52
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,417
So be smart

53
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,499
and go home.

54
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,509
I'm not going anywhere.

55
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:26,914
Easy.

56
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:28,844
Do not let her grasp you.

57
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:09,121
It's over for you,

58
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,566
Confessor.

59
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:49,931
These men,

60
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,655
why were they trying to kill you?

61
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,318
Your hand is bleeding.

62
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:08,693
Let me take you to my father's.
We can dress the wound.

63
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:17,016
Did I do something wrong?

64
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,226
I'm just...

65
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,211
not used to people touching me.

66
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,146
I'm sorry.

67
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,840
It's all right.

68
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,539
I have to go.

69
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,641
Where?

70
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,764
There's someone I need to find.

71
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,424
Who? Maybe I can help you.

72
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,699
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

73
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,011
Why were these men chasing you?

74
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,082
- You always ask this many questions?
- I just saved your life.

75
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:05,780
The least you could do is tell me
what happened.

76
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,620
Actually, I saved yours.

77
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,157
When you touched that man,

78
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,303
what did you do to him?

79
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,851
You want to know what I did to that man?

80
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,230
Try and follow me and you'll find out.

81
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,349
Drop the weapons.

82
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:24,755
I said drop them.

83
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,875
On whose authority?

84
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,984
The Councilor's Guards,
which would be me,

85
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,383
and them.

86
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,686
Now, tell me what happened here.

87
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:50,897
This Councilor you guard,

88
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:53,606
is he the ruler of this province?

89
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:54,527
He is.

90
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,671
Then I will tell my story

91
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:58,321
to him.

92
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,425
My name is Ranssyn Fane,

93
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,918
a commander of the D'Haran Forces.

94
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:06,373
D'Hara?

95
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,349
But that's...

96
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,800
I have come from the Midlands.

97
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:15,326
What other fairy-tales
do you have to tell us?

98
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,093
Forgive our skepticism,

99
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:21,167
but no one's crossed the Boundary
in hundreds of years.

100
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,837
Not since it went up.

101
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:24,887
It can't be done.

102
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,352
The woman I'm pursuing found a way.

103
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:28,914
I followed her.

104
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,479
She killed two of my men.

105
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,525
One woman.

106
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,136
How?

107
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:38,404
She is a witch.

108
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,439
Come on, Shar.

109
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,286
Come on.

110
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,328
There we go.

111
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,263
There.

112
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,810
You're finished, Richard.

113
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,063
I got you beat in two moves.

114
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,475
- Dad...
- Come on,

115
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,545
let's get the bloodbath over with,
so we can eat.

116
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,698
- Dad.
- Son.

117
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:22,656
What is it?

118
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,466
What's happened?

119
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,828
Her magic is more powerful
than you could possibly imagine.

120
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,497
She used it to cross
into your territory.

121
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:32,332
And she had help.

122
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,358
From someone
on this side of the Boundary.

123
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:38,254
He was wearing this.

124
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,055
You recognize it.

125
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,432
It belongs to my brother.

126
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:55,188
A poison vine I've never seen before,

127
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,646
that glowing thing in her hand,

128
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,289
what she did to that man
who attacked her,

129
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,072
it was magic, wasn't it?

130
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,104
How is that possible?

131
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,787
There's no magic
this side of the Boundary.

132
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:14,458
Because, son, she and these men,
they're from the Midlands.

133
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,214
- That can't be right.
- I was a fool

134
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,589
- to think this day would never come.
- What day?

135
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,840
Richard, you know that I love you.

136
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,718
Dad, of course.

137
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,184
That's him.
That's the guy who fell off the cliff.

138
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,736
You have to leave. Now.

139
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,746
- Out the back before they get here.
- Michael and Chase are with him.

140
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:46,934
They can help.

141
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,075
- Where?
- Blackthorn Hill. Find Zedd.

142
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,619
- That crazy old man?
- Zedd will explain everything.

143
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,094
- He talks to his chickens. Why?
- Tell him I sent you.

144
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:57,060
He'll know why. Just go.
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

145
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
Dad...

146
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:02,325
You have to go.

147
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,128
Now.

148
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,878
I haven't seen him since breakfast time.

149
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:27,398
You have any idea
where he might have gone?

150
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,629
This morning, he said
he was gonna work on the new bridge.

151
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,789
Are you sure he didn't come home
during the day,

152
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,120
maybe while you were out
gathering firewood?

153
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,046
I haven't left the house.

154
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:47,759
Take Commander Fane and find him.

155
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,137
If Richard's in trouble,
I want to help.

156
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,141
- If we all follow a different trail...
- Better if you stay here.

157
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:57,185
He could still come back

158
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,521
and he may be frightened.

159
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,190
- Or worse.
- What do you mean?

160
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:05,194
The witch has the power to put him
under her control,

161
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,021
and if she does,

162
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:11,158
he's gonna need his father here to try
and talk some sense to him.

163
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:16,171
You should leave some of your men,
in case it goes badly.

164
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,391
Chase, post two men outside.

165
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,961
Take the rest down to the South Bridge.

166
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,616
What is it?

167
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:34,139
Michael, why are you so quick to believe
a stranger from the Midlands?

168
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:35,985
Because...

169
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,641
Richard does things without thinking.

170
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:41,340
He always has,
since he was a little boy.

171
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,815
- And you've always protected him.
- He's my son.

172
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,817
He's your brother.

173
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,529
Please, Michael,

174
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:52,222
- make sure he doesn't get hurt.
- Of course I will.

175
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,286
But it's my responsibility
to protect the people of this town.

176
00:17:57,602 --> 00:17:58,788
Men have been killed,

177
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:01,342
and Richard was involved.

178
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,129
Stay here.
If he comes back, bring him to me.

179
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,725
We'll find out what really happened.

180
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,734
It's a bad omen, Clara.

181
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:19,430
A could in the shape of a horn
from the far east.

182
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,124
I'm betting a month of suppers

183
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:24,994
it'll bring no good
before the sun comes up.

184
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:30,416
Don't worry, Clara.
Supper will never be you.

185
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,993
I need your help, Wizard.

186
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:36,977
Sorry,

187
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:41,498
I'm as deaf as a peach
and as naked as a baby bird.

188
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,586
What did you say?

189
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,757
I asked the Great Wizard

190
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,045
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander
for his assistance.

191
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,681
I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

192
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,900
There's no confusion.

193
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,375
I had help finding you.

194
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:17,074
What did I tell you, Clara?

195
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,252
Before the sun comes up.

196
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,378
It was good while it lasted.

197
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,712
Nice

198
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:32,132
quiet couple of decades.

199
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:33,986
And now time is up.

200
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,004
Bring me to the Seeker.

201
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:56,847
You.

202
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,777
His fever's broken.

203
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,696
Now take me to the Seeker.

204
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,118
He's here.

205
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:43,662
Him?

206
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,373
- But he's...
- What?

207
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,543
Not good enough?
You wanted a Seeker, there he is.

208
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:53,104
If he's not up to your standards,
that's fine by me.

209
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,351
- Find yourself another.
- Seeker?

210
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,804
What are you talking about?

211
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,764
You never told him?

212
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:08,102
You were supposed to train him.

213
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,065
Prepare him.

214
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,566
What have you been doing
for the last 20 years?

215
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,345
Letting him catch worms.

216
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,171
Steal apples.
Skin his knees.

217
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:21,024
Find out what makes his heart
beat faster.

218
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:24,406
My sister gave her life
to make sure that I got here,

219
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,103
to make sure that I put the Book
in the Seeker's hands,

220
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:29,553
- and he's catching worms?
- Never knew a great man

221
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:33,085
- who didn't have dirt under his nails.
- While he's getting his nails dirty,

222
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,984
did it ever occur to you
to give him the slightest inkling

223
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:39,593
that he is the first true Seeker
in the last thousand years?

224
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,511
He has a destiny.

225
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:44,722
Who are you to decide a man's destiny?

226
00:21:45,162 --> 00:21:46,850
It's not me.
It's the Prophecy.

227
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,809
Prophecy be damned!

228
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,020
I averted the Prophecy
when I brought him here.

229
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,358
Until you opened up a nice little door
in the Boundary and said,

230
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,601
"Right this way to the Seeker,
ladies and gentlemen."

231
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,612
So it doesn't matter that Darken Rahl
is growing more powerful every day,

232
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,468
that people in the Midlands
are losing their freedom,

233
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,738
- dying by the thousands?
- Stop.

234
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,950
What are you talking about?

235
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:09,549
And what's a Seeker?

236
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:16,523
A Seeker is a hero

237
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,549
who arises in a time

238
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,270
of trouble and suffering,

239
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:26,309
and seeks out evil
and fights it wherever he can.

240
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:30,945
What does that have to do with me?

241
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:33,815
If you were so sure
you averted the Prophecy,

242
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,770
that he was gonna live a nice,
peaceful life,

243
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:39,653
why did you stay near him
all these years?

244
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,953
Tell him the truth.

245
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,205
Tell him who he is.

246
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,860
First you need to know
about a man named Darken Rahl,

247
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,410
if he is a man,
and not some twisted wraith of evil

248
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,762
brought forth from the underworld

249
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,174
to shatter the dreams of humankind.

250
00:23:11,512 --> 00:23:15,096
Twenty-three years ago,
a great prophet spoke on his deathbed

251
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:17,351
of the birth of a true Seeker.

252
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,208
A child whose destiny would be
to seek out

253
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,445
and kill the greatest evil of all:

254
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,214
Darken Rahl.

255
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,772
And with his last breath,

256
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:32,442
the prophet named the town
in which the child had been born.

257
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,335
Rahl sent his assassins.

258
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,529
And in one night,

259
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,728
they murdered every first-born son
in Brennidon...

260
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,069
save one.

261
00:23:58,297 --> 00:23:59,857
By the grace of the Spirits,

262
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,670
word of the Prophecy found
its way to me, along with something

263
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,481
Darken Rahl didn't have:

264
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,197
your name.

265
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,814
Your mother gave birth
in the madness of the massacre.

266
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,111
She was young.

267
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,714
She was weak.

268
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,628
Midwife didn't think
she'd last the night.

269
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:26,056
She was still alive
when I took you from her arms.

270
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,350
She kissed you, blessed you.

271
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,644
My mother died when I was 10.

272
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:38,821
Here.

273
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:39,991
In Hartland.

274
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,776
The woman you knew as your mother

275
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,904
raised you and loved you
as if you were her own,

276
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:49,199
but she did not give birth to you.

277
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:53,744
I crossed the Boundary

278
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:55,954
at night, unseen,

279
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,441
with you in my arms.

280
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,219
For weeks I watched,

281
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:06,886
listened, read the clouds,

282
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,134
and came to know that in all the world

283
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:12,138
there was no one kinder
than George and Mary Cypher.

284
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:14,533
I told them your story,

285
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,601
and they took you into their home,
and into their hearts.

286
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,513
If I live to be a thousand years old,

287
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:22,884
I'll never make a wiser choice
than picking them for the job.

288
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:28,752
So...

289
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:32,204
according to this fantasy,

290
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,743
who's my real father?

291
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,745
I don't know.

292
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:41,499
And if you knew my parents so well,

293
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:44,504
why didn't I ever see you with them?
Why haven't you talked to me?

294
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:46,088
I kept myself apart,

295
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,174
close enough to keep watch over you,

296
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:52,127
but far enough away so that
if Darken Rahl ever found his way to me,

297
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:55,055
I wouldn't be a blazing arrow
pointing the way to you.

298
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,510
Apparently,
that's what Confessors are for.

299
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,088
Confessors?

300
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:08,926
An ancient order of women

301
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:12,282
sworn to find the truth, no matter
how hard people may try to hide it.

302
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,698
And if a Seeker should arise,

303
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:19,831
to protect him with her life.

304
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,553
My name is Kahlan.

305
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:28,998
I'm sorry for threatening you today.

306
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,879
You did save my life.

307
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:38,042
I came here to bring you this.

308
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,021
A book?

309
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:44,973
Not just any book.

310
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,025
It's The Book of Counted Shadows.

311
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:51,861
It was written in a time
before remembering.

312
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,699
For a thousand years,
it's been kept safe

313
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,110
in the Wizard's Keep, in Aydindril.

314
00:26:57,456 --> 00:26:59,548
But a month ago,
the armies of Darken Rahl

315
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:03,118
broke through our last defenses
in an attempt to steal it.

316
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:04,436
Why?

317
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:08,534
Because the Book contains
the secrets of power.

318
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,800
And if Darken Rahl gets it,
he will use it

319
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,495
to control every corner of the world,

320
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,763
and we would all become his slaves.

321
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,561
The Prophecy says that the Seeker

322
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,731
will use the Book
in his quest to defeat Rahl.

323
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:32,089
Read it.

324
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,168
Maybe this Seeker you're looking for
knows this language, but...

325
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:50,255
I don't.

326
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:51,591
Try.

327
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,298
"The truth

328
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,959
"of the words

329
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,192
"of The Book of Counted Shadows

330
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,439
can only be ensured by a Confessor."

331
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,779
How...?

332
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:24,849
Because you are the true Seeker.

333
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,595
That's a good blade you've got there.

334
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:36,751
I could use a tool like that.
Where did you get it?

335
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,521
Trader from down south.

336
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:42,097
Led me to believe it was one of a kind,
but you know traders.

337
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,929
- What is it?
- Richard's trail ends here.

338
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,061
How is that possible?

339
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,274
He knows how to mask his trail.

340
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,335
We'll split up.

341
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,406
Cover more ground.

342
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,053
Give him the Sword.

343
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,679
Name him.

344
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:04,865
What sword?

345
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,095
This is the Sword of Truth.

346
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,081
In anyone else's hands,
this is just a piece of steel.

347
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,653
But in the Seeker's hands,

348
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,417
bestows the power to fight evil.

349
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:29,283
And with it, you will kill Darken Rahl.

350
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:35,522
I'm not killing anybody.
I don't even know either of you.

351
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,637
For all I know,
this is some kind of trick.

352
00:29:37,757 --> 00:29:40,407
I'm not a Seeker.
I don't want any book,

353
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,574
- or any sword.
- Calm down, my boy.

354
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,704
I'm not your boy.

355
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,914
My father is George Cypher,
and if any of this were true,

356
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,060
he'd have told me.
Now, get out of my way.

357
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,750
- Richard, wait.
- Let him go.

358
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,870
What?

359
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,630
He needs to find the truth for himself.

360
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,426
Until then, he cannot be named.

361
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,676
Your First Councilor needs more men
on the North Hill.

362
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:26,546
He said I was to tell you
to join him there.

363
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,180
Tell me where to find your son.

364
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:35,646
Don't

365
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,278
make

366
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,381
a sound.

367
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,663
What was that thing?

368
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:48,358
A Gar.

369
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,987
It uses the blood flies
to sniff out its prey.

370
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:53,905
Apparently, D'Haran soldiers weren't
the only thing that followed you

371
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:55,575
through the Boundary.

372
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,620
What did you do to it?

373
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,250
Wizard's fire.

374
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,050
Wasn't sure I had it in me
after all these years.

375
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:06,945
- What are you doing?
- Going to find my father

376
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:09,314
before something horrible
happens to him too.

377
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,367
- We'll go together.
- No.

378
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:13,535
Stay away from me, both of you.

379
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,623
He's got the Sword and the Book.

380
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:20,611
Well, isn't that exactly
what you wanted?

381
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:55,745
I'm gonna get you.

382
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:14,647
Who did this?

383
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,684
The D'Haran,

384
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:20,178
Ranssyn Fane.

385
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,225
- I'll take you to Zedd's.
- No.

386
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,016
- He has potions.
- No.

387
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:28,152
Fane is looking for you there.

388
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:31,910
You can't go back to Zedd's.

389
00:34:37,082 --> 00:34:38,332
Zedd told me...

390
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:42,791
He said you're not my father.

391
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,842
Of course I'm your father.

392
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:49,172
Then it was a lie.

393
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,242
Every word he told you is true.

394
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:03,104
But I will always be

395
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,939
your father.

396
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,085
Dad?

397
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,200
Richard.

398
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,737
We saw the smoke.

399
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:56,281
What happened?

400
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,401
He's dead.

401
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,993
Did the witch make you do this?

402
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:21,473
- Michael, you can't possibly believe...
- I don't know what to believe!

403
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:23,975
It was Ranssyn Fane.

404
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,979
- He's with Chase looking for you.
- Well, he came back!

405
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:31,275
That sword.
Where did you get it?

406
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,275
Richard, where have you been?

407
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:37,699
Michael, he murdered our father.

408
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:39,923
Not our father.

409
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:41,869
My father.

410
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,911
You knew.

411
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:51,892
Why didn't you tell me?

412
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,762
Because he made me swear
that I never would.

413
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,217
But now he's dead.

414
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,537
Did he tell you where I came from?

415
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,487
But I'm beginning to wonder.

416
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,018
And until I find out,
you're not going anywhere.

417
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:09,138
Take him.

418
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,270
Stay back!

419
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,201
Witchcraft.

420
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,782
Fane was right.

421
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:36,850
Where are you going
in such a hurry, boy?

422
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,469
I'm going back to your house
to find Fane.

423
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:42,612
He murdered my father.

424
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:48,686
I am so sorry.

425
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:51,196
Get out of my way.

426
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:54,317
I understand your pain.

427
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,900
Richard Cypher,

428
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:01,841
you were meant for more than revenge.

429
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:03,745
You think I care what you say, old man?

430
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,869
- I'm going to kill him!
- And if you fail,

431
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:07,914
and he kills you?

432
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:11,080
You said this Sword would give me
the power to fight evil.

433
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,098
In the service of freedom and justice,
not your own rage.

434
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:17,423
- You're not ready to use the Sword.
- I said get out of my way!

435
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:18,804
Come on!

436
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,145
Tell me where the witch is
or I'll run you through.

437
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,514
I'll never help you.

438
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,459
I don't know what lies
that witch has put into your head,

439
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:09,016
but ask yourself:

440
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:12,246
Are you really prepared to die
for someone you don't even know?

441
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,970
She didn't kill my father.

442
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,410
You did.

443
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,293
Beg for your life, boy!

444
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:10,888
Do it!

445
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,382
Just like your father did.

446
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:27,370
The Book.

447
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:29,992
You brought me the Book.

448
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,100
Fane!

449
00:41:57,636 --> 00:41:58,971
I'm gonna kill you!

450
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,335
You're gonna die!

451
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,334
The Book.

452
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,042
Fane has it.

453
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:31,834
Then we failed.

454
00:42:32,223 --> 00:42:33,303
No, I failed.

455
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:36,844
Not yet.

456
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:40,487
Fane still has to cross the Boundary
to get the Book to Rahl.

457
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:42,980
- We can still stop him.
- Don't you get it?

458
00:42:43,653 --> 00:42:45,608
I'm not what you want me to be.

459
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,789
Maybe all those years ago,

460
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,012
you saved

461
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,239
the wrong child.

462
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:07,629
You are the true Seeker.

463
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:12,342
If anybody failed, it was me,
telling myself

464
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:14,536
this storm will never come.

465
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:16,388
Kahlan was right.

466
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,858
I should have prepared you.

467
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:24,188
What happened to your father
is only the beginning of Rahl's evil.

468
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:26,893
But you can stop him.

469
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,768
You and only you.

470
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,614
How?

471
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,915
In this life, we cannot go back.

472
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,160
Only forward.

473
00:43:40,124 --> 00:43:43,150
You have a great destiny ahead of you,
Richard Cypher,

474
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:46,825
if you're willing to accept it.

475
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:52,362
I've lost everything.

476
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:53,701
Not everything.

477
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,011
You have me.

478
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:57,252
And Kahlan.

479
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,140
And most importantly,
you have yourself.

480
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:03,298
Everything your father
brought you up to be.

481
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:06,115
And if you stop Rahl,

482
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:10,191
then your father and Kahlan's sister

483
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,620
won't have died for nothing.

484
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:26,641
Teach me.

485
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,323
Richard Cypher,

486
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,967
though your road will be long
and the outcome unknown,

487
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,199
will you undertake this journey?

488
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:53,736
I will.

489
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:57,281
Will you leave behind your friends
and all that you have known?

490
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:01,309
I will.

491
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,992
Though the forces of evil have sworn
to bring about your death,

492
00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:06,790
still will you go on?

493
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:13,556
I will.

494
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:27,773
Then will you accept

495
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:30,481
a name of the Seeker?

496
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:38,848
I will.

497
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,552
Then I, First Wizard

498
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:59,927
Zeddicus
Zu'l Zorander so name you.

499
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:32,810
Lord Rahl?

500
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:35,712
What is it?
What's wrong?

501
00:46:37,782 --> 00:46:38,757
The Seeker.

502
00:46:40,729 --> 00:46:41,729
He lives.

503
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:50,292
Here's the river.

504
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,718
Fane went east
towards the Boundary, here.

505
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,858
How will we catch up
without a bridge to cross?

506
00:46:56,018 --> 00:46:59,153
There used to be another bridge
south of here, but it washed away.

507
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,696
I rebuilt it.

508
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,739
So we'll cross here,

509
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,533
and we'll double back
and pick up his trail, there.

510
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:08,579
- Fane is on a fast horse.
- He doesn't know these woods like I do.

511
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:11,089
And he can't travel fast,
especially at night.

512
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:13,968
You could know every tree by name
and he's still have a long lead.

513
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,005
On his way to a boundary
that he has no way of crossing.

514
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:21,884
Then he must believe he can find a way.

515
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:27,694
Then why are we still
standing here talking?

516
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:36,774
- Put your sword down{\, Richard}.
- I don't want to fight you, {\Chase, }but I will.

517
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:40,492
I've known you since
you were crawling on all fours.

518
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,240
Whose side do you think I'm on?
I want to help you,

519
00:47:46,382 --> 00:47:50,621
but first, you need to tell me what
in the name of the Spirits is going on?

520
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,568
I've been so grateful
to you all these years, Fraden.

521
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,401
I believed you had done
more for me than anyone,

522
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:01,760
and I rewarded you accordingly.

523
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:04,344
You've been very generous, Lord Rahl.

524
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,830
But now I find that you have failed me.

525
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,890
No, My Lord,
I did exactly as you commanded.

526
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,684
My men and I killed every
first-born son in Brennidon.

527
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:15,229
Except the one that mattered.

528
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:19,775
You let him slip through your fingers.

529
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:24,072
Is it possible My Lord is mistaken?

530
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,831
For 23 years I have slept in peace,

531
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,826
certain that I'd averted the Prophecy.

532
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:32,496
But then, tonight,

533
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,888
it came to me in a terrible dream.

534
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:39,148
I saw him take the Sword.

535
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:41,880
There's no mistake.

536
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,216
The Seeker has been named.

537
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,852
Then let me assemble my men.

538
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:51,209
- I'll find him and complete the task.
- And how will you do that?

539
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,657
The Seeker is a thousand leagues

540
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:56,282
from here, on the other side
of the Boundary.

541
00:48:56,402 --> 00:48:59,064
Will your weary old bones
carry you that far?

542
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:02,184
Do you have a way across?

543
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:05,112
If this Confessor
found a way, so can we.

544
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:10,450
I appreciate the sentiment, old friend,

545
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,454
but it's time to let younger men
take up the cause.

546
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,168
As My Lord wishes.

547
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:20,168
Give me your hand.

548
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:29,386
Thank you
for your many years of service.

549
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,910
Bring me my Journey Book.

550
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,334
Orders from Lord Rahl:

551
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:03,837
"Assemble our most powerful sorcerers.

552
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:09,026
"Deploy them with artillery batteries
at intervals along the border.

553
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:13,930
"They will use their magic
to penetrate the Boundary.

554
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:15,906
"Once through,

555
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,516
"our soldiers are to find the Seeker

556
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,243
"and kill him."

557
00:50:22,456 --> 00:50:25,739
So you are supposed
to kill this Darken Rahl.

558
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,819
They say it's my destiny.

559
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:31,942
But to fulfill that destiny,
he needs The Book of Counted Shadows.

560
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:36,006
The secrets of power
are written in its pages.

561
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:39,456
If Darken Rahl learns them, then
we won't be able to defeat him.

562
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,460
That's why we have to find Fane
before he gets the Book to Rahl.

563
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:47,466
I know. It sounds crazy.

564
00:50:54,002 --> 00:50:56,515
I always knew you were meant
for more than just clearing trails.

565
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,310
You believe us?
You'll help us find Fane?

566
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:04,231
Well, how can I say no to...
What do you call it? The Seeker?

567
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:07,993
An inexperienced, untrained Seeker.

568
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:10,162
- We need to go now.
- You need to rest.

569
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:13,404
Food. Fresh horses.
It's a day's ride to the Boundary.

570
00:51:13,524 --> 00:51:15,742
Plenty of time to catch up.
We'll leave again first light.

571
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,121
No, that's three hours away.
Kahlan's right. We have to go now.

572
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:21,116
Listen to your friend, Richard.

573
00:51:21,236 --> 00:51:24,835
Your trouble started when you rushed
in to help Kahlan without thinking.

574
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:27,181
Lesson Number One, Seeker:

575
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:30,215
Sometimes to gain ground
you need to slow down.

576
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,179
- That doesn't make sense.
- Never expect sense from a Wizard.

577
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,080
Especially a hungry one.

578
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:41,855
- I'm not good on an empty stomach.
- Well, you're in luck.

579
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,771
My wife makes
the best spice soup in Hartland.

580
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:51,153
Delicious.

581
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:53,488
I'm so glad you like it.

582
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:57,159
So, what do you think? It was a little
loose around the shoulders,

583
00:51:57,665 --> 00:51:59,074
but I fixed it.

584
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:02,281
A needle and thread big enough,
she could mend the world.

585
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:06,290
Mom, are they married?

586
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:11,131
She wants to know
if you two are married.

587
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,015
- No. We're just...
- Traveling together.

588
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:17,688
Children.

589
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,771
You have a lovely family.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

590
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,584
Would you excuse me?

591
00:52:47,026 --> 00:52:48,412
Are you all right?

592
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:50,837
I miss my family.

593
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,428
With any luck, you'll see 'em soon.

594
00:52:56,856 --> 00:52:58,701
My parents are both gone.

595
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:00,383
My sister was the last.

596
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,221
Just me now.

597
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:05,185
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

598
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:11,858
It's not easy losing
the people you love.

599
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:25,650
That's the magic you used to find Zedd.

600
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,721
And get through the Boundary.

601
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,711
What is it?

602
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:33,160
Not what.

603
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:35,224
Who.

604
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:39,480
Shar is a Night Wisp.

605
00:53:40,255 --> 00:53:43,181
She got me through the Boundary
and led me to Zedd.

606
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:47,811
Her people live in the forests
of the Midlands.

607
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:51,398
She's talking to you.

608
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,244
What's she saying?

609
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:57,269
She's thanking you.

610
00:53:58,795 --> 00:53:59,799
For what?

611
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,554
I let Fane get away with the Book.

612
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,457
But you also accepted the name Seeker,

613
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,510
and took the Sword.

614
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:21,488
Shar says,
for the first time she can remember,

615
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,735
her people have a reason to hope.

616
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:31,340
I'll try not to let her down.

617
00:54:42,162 --> 00:54:43,845
What was that?

618
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:47,154
Ready.

619
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:48,447
Fire!

620
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,562
There were strange lights in the sky,

621
00:54:57,682 --> 00:55:01,176
and then the beasts came through,
and killed them all.

622
00:55:02,784 --> 00:55:06,848
- Please, everyone stay calm.
- How can you tell us to say calm?

623
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:10,203
What if it's my son next time
and not an animal?

624
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:18,068
You have a problem.

625
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,571
And a few dead cattle
are only the beginning.

626
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:29,264
- What do you want?
- Those flashes in the sky,

627
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:33,337
the creatures eating your livestock,
they all indicate one thing:

628
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:37,212
The man I serve, Lord Darken Rahl,
is trying to bring down the Boundary.

629
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:43,468
- And how will he do that?
- He has legions at his command,

630
00:55:43,785 --> 00:55:46,554
powerful magic at his disposal.

631
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:49,695
The treaty has stood
for hundreds of years.

632
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,102
- Why?
- Because

633
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:53,905
he wants this.

634
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:57,137
- A book?
- The witch stole it from Lord Rahl

635
00:55:57,257 --> 00:55:59,067
and he will stop at nothing
to get it back.

636
00:55:59,692 --> 00:56:01,375
When he comes through the Boundary,

637
00:56:01,578 --> 00:56:04,155
he will deal harshly with anyone
who has come between him

638
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:06,366
and what is rightfully his.

639
00:56:08,428 --> 00:56:11,955
I've done nothing to offend this man.
Why are you telling me this?

640
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:19,087
Lord Rahl
is a great leader.

641
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,809
He will richly reward
any ruler wise enough

642
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:23,846
to ally himself with the House of Rahl.

643
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,278
- What are you asking me to do?
- I cannot wait for Lord Rahl

644
00:56:31,398 --> 00:56:33,821
to bring down the Boundary.
I need to get through now.

645
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:36,896
- I have no way to help you do that.
- The people that are pursuing me

646
00:56:37,016 --> 00:56:39,993
- would kill me to get this book.
- Powerful adversaries.

647
00:56:42,324 --> 00:56:43,324
My brother.

648
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:49,617
He ceased to be your brother the moment
the witch put him under her spell.

649
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:53,623
The same witch who is responsible
for your father's death.

650
00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:00,770
I need an armed escort,
and I need my pursuers stopped.

651
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:06,274
The world is changing, Councilor.

652
00:57:06,692 --> 00:57:10,638
And one way or another, Lord Rahl will
have the Westlands under his dominion,

653
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,037
as he has the provinces
of the Midlands and D'Hara beyond.

654
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,617
What you need to ask yourself

655
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:22,144
is will you be on
the side of righteousness,

656
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:24,861
or will you be against it?

657
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:45,965
None of that, boy.

658
00:57:48,387 --> 00:57:50,929
- What?
- I see the way you're lookin' at her.

659
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:54,796
- What you're talking about?
- You think because I'm old

660
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:57,114
I don't remember
what it's like to get my britches

661
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:58,901
in a bunch over a beautiful woman?

662
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,399
- My britches are not in a bunch.
- Bunched britches, lurching loins,

663
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,318
hot haunches, call it what you want.
It can never be.

664
00:58:05,946 --> 00:58:07,004
Not with her.

665
00:58:11,093 --> 00:58:13,543
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because you need to concentrate

666
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:16,973
on finding Fane.
Keep your eyes on the trail up ahead,

667
00:58:17,879 --> 00:58:19,541
not on her posterior.

668
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:22,826
Lesson Number Two, Seeker:

669
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:26,172
Clear your mind of what was and will be.
See only the task that is.

670
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:28,424
Let's ride.

671
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,966
Surrender your weapons
and come with us, or we kill the witch.

672
00:59:16,327 --> 00:59:17,803
Richard, no.

673
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:23,716
What are you doing, Michael?

674
00:59:24,183 --> 00:59:26,900
Protecting the people
of this town from magic.

675
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:30,737
- Get the witch!
- She's not a witch.

676
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,990
Until she came,
this was a peaceful place to live.

677
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:37,327
Now she's turned my brother against me.

678
00:59:37,573 --> 00:59:40,142
My father has been murdered.

679
00:59:40,262 --> 00:59:42,290
She's brought death to our homes!

680
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:47,481
People, please,
put down your weapons and listen!

681
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,048
Patrick, you've known
me my whole life.

682
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:52,550
I helped your son get
your cow home just yesterday.

683
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,956
That herd is gone, because of her!

684
00:59:57,575 --> 00:59:58,389
Kill her!

685
00:59:58,672 --> 00:59:59,672
Yes!

686
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:07,398
No!

687
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:13,947
Back off!

688
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:50,191
Are you okay?

689
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,530
Has everyone in Hartland
lost their minds?

690
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,033
People are afraid.

691
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:01,196
- They're looking for someone to blame.
- Wizard's First Rule:

692
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:04,469
People will believe a lie
because they want it to be true,

693
01:01:05,043 --> 01:01:07,875
or because they're afraid
it might be true.

694
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:11,037
Chase,

695
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:15,937
if my own brother can turn against me,
and people know you're with me...

696
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:18,052
Go home.

697
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:20,596
Make sure your family is safe.

698
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,388
Go.
I'll catch up when I can.

699
01:01:24,658 --> 01:01:25,642
Okay.

700
01:01:31,642 --> 01:01:32,663
What is it?

701
01:01:33,686 --> 01:01:35,028
It's Shar.

702
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,323
Destroying that arrow
drained her of her light.

703
01:01:38,977 --> 01:01:41,701
- We have to help her.
- It's too late.

704
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:44,120
She's dying.

705
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:57,836
May the Spirits light your way
through the land of the shadow

706
01:01:57,956 --> 01:02:00,180
to the halls of eternal peace.

707
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,436
She died saving me from that arrow.

708
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:18,654
And she was your way home.

709
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:23,117
I'm so sorry.

710
01:02:23,277 --> 01:02:26,162
She sacrificed herself
to protect the Seeker.

711
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,373
We would both do the same.

712
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:33,578
Shar didn't even know me,
and neither do you.

713
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:36,881
But we know how important
your mission is.

714
01:02:42,254 --> 01:02:45,681
Then I will try and make sure
Shar didn't die for nothing.

715
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,963
Let's start with finding Fane.

716
01:02:49,147 --> 01:02:51,604
He knows he can't get through
the Boundary without magic either,

717
01:02:51,764 --> 01:02:53,800
but he didn't try to take Shar from us.

718
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:56,329
What does that tell you, Seeker?

719
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,112
He must have another way to get across.

720
01:03:11,072 --> 01:03:14,210
Tell me what you're doing at my house,
gentlemen, and I may let you live.

721
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,710
You're wanted inside.

722
01:03:17,915 --> 01:03:18,797
Emma?

723
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:27,557
Let her go.

724
01:03:29,188 --> 01:03:31,894
Drop your weapons
or I will cut her throat.

725
01:03:43,638 --> 01:03:45,116
Tell me what you want.

726
01:03:46,211 --> 01:03:47,618
That's a D'Haran battle weapon,

727
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,493
standard issue as of last year,

728
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:54,072
which means it did not
come to the Westlands

729
01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:56,309
before the Boundary went up.
You...

730
01:03:57,215 --> 01:03:58,584
know a way through.

731
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:02,216
I told you, I bought it from a trader.
I have no idea where she got it.

732
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:05,386
You think I'd lie to you
when you've got my daughter?

733
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:10,725
Let her go, Fane, and I will tell you
where to find the trader.

734
01:04:11,153 --> 01:04:14,862
And what if you send me
into the clutches of the witch instead?

735
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:18,814
Let Laura go

736
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,986
and I will take you there myself.

737
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:23,756
I think

738
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,119
- I'll take Laura here.
- No, you don't have to do this.

739
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,383
I said I will tell you
where the trader is.

740
01:04:29,503 --> 01:04:34,165
Yes. And if your information is correct,
I will send her back to you.

741
01:04:35,254 --> 01:04:36,751
If it is not...

742
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,042
The woman you are looking for
is called the Bone Lady.

743
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,466
Fane's horse?

744
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,227
Deer tracks.

745
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:22,070
The Boundary goes north and south
as far as anyone has ever traveled.

746
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,563
Who knows where he'll try to cross?

747
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:29,234
Just like last night.

748
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,379
- What do you think it is?
- It's Darken Rahl,

749
01:05:33,582 --> 01:05:36,319
looking for a way to get through
the Boundary, maybe even bring it down.

750
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:39,230
- Well, that's good news.
- Good news?

751
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,914
An impatient Rahl is just what we need.

752
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:44,549
It means Fane hasn't gotten
across with the Book yet.

753
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:46,809
There's still time to stop him.

754
01:05:46,929 --> 01:05:49,699
The Boundary's been up for centuries.
How could Rahl just bring it down?

755
01:05:49,955 --> 01:05:53,051
I don't know, exactly.
But he has more than just his own magic.

756
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:56,038
He has sorcerers and wizards
that are loyal to him.

757
01:05:57,467 --> 01:05:59,059
We're not all on the side of good.

758
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:02,748
And more than magic, he has thousands
of soldiers under his command.

759
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,480
And I'm supposed to kill him?

760
01:06:04,722 --> 01:06:05,423
Alone?

761
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,941
What do we look like, boy,
grilled sardines?

762
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:09,816
Besides, you have the Sword.

763
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:12,992
One sword against an army?

764
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,938
Not just any sword.

765
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:19,047
It holds the strength of all the ancient
Seekers who wielded it before you.

766
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:23,100
People will rise up and follow you
when they know the Seeker has returned.

767
01:06:24,185 --> 01:06:25,762
Lesson Number Three:

768
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:30,873
Though the Seeker may battle alone,
he fights with the strength of many.

769
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,701
Two against one.

770
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:36,744
- The odds aren't fair.
- We're not gonna fight you, Brandstone.

771
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:39,826
- Taking you to see the First Councilor.
- And so what is he paying you

772
01:06:39,946 --> 01:06:42,525
- to betray a fellow Westlander?
- We're just following orders.

773
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:45,291
Those orders included letting
a killer abduct my daughter?

774
01:06:47,276 --> 01:06:51,033
Those odds I was talking about,
there weren't fair... to you!

775
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:11,043
What news from the border?

776
01:07:11,163 --> 01:07:14,867
The assault continues, My Lord.
The Boundary appears to be weakening.

777
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:16,118
Ready.

778
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:17,411
Fire!

779
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:25,625
I'm okay.

780
01:07:26,901 --> 01:07:30,549
Whatever Rahl is doing is working.
The Boundary is getting weaker.

781
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:34,095
Did you hear that?
Who's there?

782
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,888
Don't listen to them, boy.

783
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,477
- Who are they?
- Shadow People.

784
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:43,479
It's the souls of the dead.

785
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:46,341
It's said they can travel into
the Boundary from the underworld.

786
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:54,077
- They're talking to me.
- Come back. Come home to us.

787
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:58,788
I miss you.
I want to see you again.

788
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:03,072
- Mom?
- I'm here, Richard.

789
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:07,086
They're not real, son. It's a trick!
They'll drag you into the underworld!

790
01:08:07,246 --> 01:08:08,169
{\Richard, }Don't!

791
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,550
- Mom, I'm here.
- Stop!

792
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:36,991
- How is he?
- His breathing is getting weaker.

793
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:42,309
- We have to take him to a healer.
- We have to find Fane and get the Book.

794
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:45,570
Yeah, {\well, }we're not gonna
catch up dragging Zedd behind us.

795
01:08:47,314 --> 01:08:48,335
Then we won't.

796
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:53,714
- We can't just leave him here.
- You heard what he said.

797
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,301
He's willing to die for you.

798
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,862
And how many more people
are gonna die because of me?

799
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:01,474
I don't know.

800
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:03,392
Maybe many.

801
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,256
But you'll save many more.

802
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:09,583
Free them from Rahl.

803
01:09:10,524 --> 01:09:12,542
If I just hadn't listened
to these voices...

804
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,480
When I went through the Boundary,

805
01:09:17,176 --> 01:09:19,117
I heard my mother calling to me.

806
01:09:19,237 --> 01:09:21,250
I wanted so badly to go with her.

807
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:23,960
But I didn't.

808
01:09:24,612 --> 01:09:25,830
What stopped you?

809
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:28,209
I knew I had to find you

810
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,052
Darken Rahl has the power
to speak to the dead.

811
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:36,096
Maybe he was using
the Spirits to trap us,

812
01:09:36,507 --> 01:09:38,344
to stop us from doing what we have to.

813
01:09:38,504 --> 01:09:39,762
We can't let him.

814
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:44,234
You stay with Zedd.

815
01:09:46,197 --> 01:09:49,893
I'll find Fane and the Book,
and I'll come back for you.

816
01:09:50,013 --> 01:09:52,579
You can't go alone. It's too dangerous.

817
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,610
My destiny.
My decision.

818
01:09:58,587 --> 01:10:00,524
- What happened?
- Fane has my daughter.

819
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:04,106
He's taken her to the Bone
Lady in South Haven. We have to go now.

820
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:06,202
You do with him.
I'll follow with Zedd.

821
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:15,432
Where are you hiding the Night Wisp?

822
01:10:17,777 --> 01:10:20,386
- Adie don't have no Night Wisp.
- Don't lie to me.

823
01:10:20,726 --> 01:10:24,154
I've seen the scythe you traded
with Brandstone, the Councilor's Guard.

824
01:10:24,274 --> 01:10:27,848
- Adie don't know this man.
- Let me introduce you

825
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,317
to his daughter.

826
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:33,366
Now, I want you to feel that nice

827
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,417
warm skin.

828
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:39,196
Well, in a minute,
it's going to be cold and dead

829
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,682
if you don't give me what I want!

830
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:44,535
Please, Miss Adie,

831
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:47,437
do what he says.

832
01:11:00,377 --> 01:11:03,134
- A rock?
- Not a rock.

833
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:07,474
It be a Nightstone.
It hold powerful magic.

834
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:11,687
You take it up the South Trail
to the Boundary, it gets you through.

835
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,874
Now you leave the girl with Adie and go.

836
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,780
The girl is coming with me.

837
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:01,147
Run!

838
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:04,567
Father!

839
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:39,435
Are you hurt?

840
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:41,817
Are you all right?

841
01:12:49,548 --> 01:12:51,086
If I believed in fairy-tales,

842
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:57,334
I'd say I just saw my friend,
Richard Cypher, slay a dragon.

843
01:13:00,971 --> 01:13:01,985
Thank you.

844
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,436
Laura. Thank the Spirits,
you're all right.

845
01:13:16,026 --> 01:13:17,604
Your Seeker here saved her life.

846
01:13:22,517 --> 01:13:23,571
How is he?

847
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:25,353
He's the same.

848
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,331
His skin be burning hot.

849
01:13:35,686 --> 01:13:37,624
This be Shadow poison at work.

850
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,502
- Can you help him?
- Adie has her ways.

851
01:13:41,022 --> 01:13:42,772
She will do what she can.

852
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,374
We'll leave him with you,
and we'll come back

853
01:13:45,494 --> 01:13:47,384
- after we get the Book.
- We should go.

854
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:51,412
From here, Fane has less than an hour
before he gets back to the Boundary.

855
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:54,391
And with Adie's Nightstone,
he be able to walk through it.

856
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:57,281
- We should hurry.
- No. Chase, you've done enough.

857
01:13:57,401 --> 01:14:00,105
You get Laura home, you make sure
the rest of your family is safe.

858
01:14:00,265 --> 01:14:01,357
You need help.

859
01:14:02,224 --> 01:14:04,174
That's what I have Kahlan for.

860
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,945
And like she said when we first met,

861
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:09,147
she can take care of herself.

862
01:14:11,575 --> 01:14:12,825
If you need me, my friend,

863
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:15,829
you send word, and I'll be there
as fast as a horse can take me.

864
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:20,236
- It could be a long ride, Chase.
- There's no ride too long.

865
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:33,320
Let's find Fane.

866
01:15:29,378 --> 01:15:31,182
There!
To the south.

867
01:15:31,675 --> 01:15:33,575
Realign the weapon
and aim for the lights.

868
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:34,695
Yes, sir!

869
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:36,933
Fane!

870
01:15:40,005 --> 01:15:41,248
Give me the Book.

871
01:15:44,662 --> 01:15:45,585
Kill them.

872
01:15:47,469 --> 01:15:49,996
I said give me the Book.

873
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:53,968
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet, boy?

874
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,012
As a matter of fact, I have.

875
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:39,792
You did it.

876
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,159
You are the Seeker.

877
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:26,084
The Boundary is open!

878
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:27,727
Into the breach!

879
01:18:27,847 --> 01:18:29,413
Find the Seeker!

880
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:30,701
Kill them!

881
01:18:50,523 --> 01:18:51,563
What do we do?

882
01:18:52,747 --> 01:18:54,066
We stand and fight.

883
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,325
The Book of Counted Shadows.

884
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:07,122
- We can't let them get the Book.
- Stay back!

885
01:19:10,063 --> 01:19:11,313
Give me the Book

886
01:19:11,676 --> 01:19:13,733
and I'll give you a merciful death.

887
01:19:14,738 --> 01:19:17,565
<i>The Book contains the secrets of power.</i>

888
01:19:18,173 --> 01:19:19,640
<i>And if Darken Rahl gets it,</i>

889
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,969
<i>he will use it to control
every corner of the world.</i>

890
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:34,272
Get the Book!

891
01:19:43,977 --> 01:19:44,980
Take them!

892
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:49,765
<i>Clear your mind
of what was and will be.</i>

893
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,635
<i>See only the task that is.</i>

894
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:58,421
<i>Though the Seeker may battle alone,</i>

895
01:19:58,914 --> 01:20:00,590
<i>he fights with the strength of many.</i>

896
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:42,090
Kill them!

897
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:45,218
Easy, old man.

898
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:49,139
- Who are you?
- Your friends left me to heal you.

899
01:20:49,585 --> 01:20:51,475
- Where are they?
- On the Boundary.

900
01:20:51,838 --> 01:20:53,059
I have to go.

901
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:10,329
Kahlan!

902
01:23:32,305 --> 01:23:34,855
That's the second time
you saved my life.

903
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:04,084
- Looks like I missed the excitement.
- Zedd.

904
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,088
You're alive.

905
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,462
Takes more than a little
Shadow poison to kill me, boy.

906
01:24:10,468 --> 01:24:11,757
He burned the Book.

907
01:24:12,755 --> 01:24:13,760
I had to.

908
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:18,160
It was the only way I could see
to keep it from the D'Harans.

909
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,643
How will he fulfill the Prophecy now?

910
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,459
Sounds to me
like he's already started.

911
01:24:26,402 --> 01:24:27,565
I don't understand.

912
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:31,138
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but doesn't the Prophecy say

913
01:24:31,258 --> 01:24:34,619
the Seeker will use the Book
in his quest to defeat Darken Rahl?

914
01:24:36,452 --> 01:24:37,852
He did use the Book,

915
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:40,555
just not in the way we expected.

916
01:24:41,996 --> 01:24:45,691
More important he kept the Book
from getting into Rahl's hands.

917
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:49,004
Being the Seeker means
making difficult choices.

918
01:24:50,308 --> 01:24:52,858
And Richard made the first
of many today.

919
01:24:53,084 --> 01:24:55,742
What about all the secrets
the Book was said to contain?

920
01:24:55,862 --> 01:24:58,612
How will he defeat Rahl
without knowing them?

921
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,299
Well, it appears the Seeker's quest
isn't going to come

922
01:25:02,419 --> 01:25:04,018
with an instruction manual.

923
01:25:08,947 --> 01:25:10,154
Where to now?

924
01:25:11,772 --> 01:25:13,152
The Boundary is open.

925
01:25:13,594 --> 01:25:15,144
We can go either way.

926
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:27,399
Well, like a wise man
once told me,

927
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:30,207
"In this life, you can't go back.

928
01:25:31,314 --> 01:25:32,379
"Only forward."

929
01:25:33,604 --> 01:25:35,699
Spoken like the true Seeker.

930
01:25:54,128 --> 01:25:55,128
My Lord,

931
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:58,529
one of our sorcerers from the Boundary
has sent news from Kaldrith.

932
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:00,825
He was the only survivor
of his artillery battery.

933
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,205
The only survivor?

934
01:26:05,636 --> 01:26:06,786
Yes, My Lord.

935
01:26:07,493 --> 01:26:09,793
They succeeded in
penetrating the Boundary,

936
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:12,464
but the Seeker killed them all.

937
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:14,109
The Book?

938
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:16,542
Destroyed, My Lord.

939
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:25,417
It seems the Seeker and I
are on an even footing.

940
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:27,461
My Lord,

941
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,855
the Seeker travels only
with a Wizard and a Confessor.

942
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:34,167
You have tens of thousands
of subjects and soldiers

943
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:36,437
who will obey your every command.

944
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:43,104
Then let it be known
throughout the three territories,

945
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,157
that whoever brings me the Seeker

946
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:49,722
will be rewarded
beyond imagining.

947
01:26:55,865 --> 01:26:57,778
So where are we going, exactly?

948
01:26:57,898 --> 01:26:59,505
To find Rahl, of course.

949
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:00,634
Won't be easy.

950
01:27:00,904 --> 01:27:02,914
He moves from palace to palace,

951
01:27:03,202 --> 01:27:05,729
temple to temple.
His spies are everywhere.

952
01:27:06,484 --> 01:27:09,158
And it's said he has magic
to cloak his movements

953
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:11,228
and disguise his appearances.

954
01:27:12,014 --> 01:27:13,664
So how will we find him?

955
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:16,734
One step at a time, my boy.
One step at a time.

956
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:21,397
Because where we don't find Rahl,
we'll find his emissaries,

957
01:27:21,517 --> 01:27:25,060
and innocent people who need
protection from his dark magic.

958
01:27:25,474 --> 01:27:28,700
Mark my words, you'll get plenty
of use out of that Sword.

959
01:27:29,551 --> 01:27:30,701
I'll be ready.

960
01:27:32,136 --> 01:27:33,386
I have no doubt.
