1
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:04,972
- Admit it. We're lost.
- No, we're not.

2
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:07,725
The Naveer Pass
is just beyond that ridge.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,535
You know what power I wish you had?
The power to admit when you're wrong.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,410
Right now,
I'd settle for a silencing spell.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,683
At the next tavern,
we're asking for directions.

6
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:20,214
Wait.

7
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,700
Kahlan Amnell?

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,705
Who's there?

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,231
Mother Confessor.

10
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,385
My dear Kahlan,

11
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,346
I knew Mira would lead us to you.

12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,477
- Serena?
- Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

13
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,505
- My old friend.
- Mother Confessor?

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,500
This is Richard Cypher.

15
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,641
The Seeker of Truth.

16
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,030
This is truly an honor.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,891
Erin. Tara.

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,010
Alana.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,310
- I thought you were all in hiding.
- We were.

20
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:28,379
But Darken Rahl's spies
were more insidious than we thought.

21
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,487
They uncovered our houses of refuge.

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,636
There's no safety for Confessors
in the Midlands anymore.

23
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:39,640
- That's why we searched for you.
- We must leave until Rahl's defeated.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,518
We have no choice
but to seek sanctuary in Valeria.

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,186
Valeria?

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,090
It's an island, hidden by magic.
Far off the coast.

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,985
- So you're fleeing?
- Only temporarily.

28
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,321
When Rahl is vanquished,
we will return.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
But, Mother Confessor,

30
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,355
we're the source of justice
in the Midlands.

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,328
The people need us
now more than ever.

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,998
Rahl wants a world without justice.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,417
And by killing us, he'll get it.

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,087
We wanted to give you
the opportunity to join us.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,540
You know I can't abandon my mission.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,098
I expected so.

37
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,811
- But the decision needed to be yours.
- We need to keep moving.

38
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,782
Rahl's quads are tracking us.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,933
We've managed to stay ahead of them,
but we can't let our guard down.

40
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:37,058
- We'll escort you to the coast.
- Will the other Confessors meet us?

41
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,430
There are no other Confessors.

42
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,580
We are all that's left.

43
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,672
1x10 - <i>Sacrifice</i>

44
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:55,428
Sync: Kasius

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,682
Are you sure leaving the Midlands
is right thing to do?

46
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,936
Isn't it time for Confessors
to stand and fight?

47
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,260
We did.

48
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,017
We made our stand
at the Temple of Rondaxe.

49
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:19,242
The quads blocked all the doors.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,580
There was no way out.

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,264
We fought well, but there were...

52
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,373
too many.

53
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,211
Demmin Nass has begun
taking trophies.

54
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,850
I farebetter than most.

56
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:46,903
Before they could take
my other hand, or worse,

57
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,310
Mother Confessor saved me.

58
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,309
What is it?

59
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,658
Someone's coming.

60
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:07,660
I guess those quads weren't
as far away as we'd hoped.

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,270
Stay where you are!

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,560
Wait.

63
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,966
- Please, I'm not here to harm you.
- Who are you?

64
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,930
My name is Finn.

65
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,123
I'm looking for Dennee.

66
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,170
My sister?

67
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,813
- What do you want with her?
- I've been searching for months.

68
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,526
A few weeks ago I heard Confessors
were nearby. Please, I have to find her.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,490
She's dead.

70
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,030
My mistress is dead.

71
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,788
Your mistress?

72
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,625
If she's dead,

73
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,835
how will I know what to do?

74
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,173
This man is still under confession.

75
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,560
How is that possible?
I thought the only way

76
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:04,985
- the spell is broken is...
- Is when a Confessor dies.

77
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,980
That means Dennee is still alive.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
But when I left her...

79
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,230
Dennee.

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,172
Take it.

81
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,236
Take the Book.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,350
Find him.

83
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,407
I'm not leaving you.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,618
This is more important than me.

85
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,242
You know that.

86
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:31,840
Please, Kahlan.

87
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,430
May the Spirits protect you,

88
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,030
little sister.

89
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,504
Go.

90
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,528
She must have survived somehow.

91
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,000
Rahl must have her.

92
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,910
We know what he does to Confessors.

93
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,330
Which is
why we can't risk going after her.

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,000
- What?
- Mother Confessor is right.

95
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,129
I loved your sister as if she were
my own, but it could be a trap.

96
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,924
Why would Rahl keep her alive
when he's killed so many others?

97
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,070
I've already left her behind once.

98
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:28,997
I won't do it again.

99
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,347
I know it's hard,

100
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:34,601
but my duty is to ensure the survival
of the remaining Confessors.

101
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:36,437
Just as your duty

102
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,662
is to protect the Seeker
on his mission.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,580
Right now...

104
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,410
my mission Kahlan's sister.

105
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,245
- But Dennee could be anywhere.
- Mira could find her.

106
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,990
Dennee was willing
to sacrifice her life for me.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,205
No doubt she'd do the same
for any of you.

108
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,380
How can we not even try to save her?

109
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,702
We should make camp here.

110
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,286
Kahlan tells me you fought bravely
at the battle of Rondaxe.

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,502
Perhaps I can give you back
a little of what you've lost.

112
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,370
I don't believe it.

113
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:35,472
Thank you.

114
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,490
Still as powerful as I remember.

115
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,766
I'm just sorry
I wasn't powerful enough

116
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,364
to stop Darken Rahl
before he decimated your order.

117
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,851
When I was just an acolyte,

118
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,127
and you took me under your wing...

119
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:07,379
Do you remember what you told me?

120
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:08,881
You said

121
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:12,623
that real power was not just
in the magic that we wield.

122
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,055
It was in our ability
to make difficult choices.

123
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,028
And leaving behind
everything and everyone

124
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:24,604
couldn't have been easy for you,
Zeddicus.

125
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,057
But if you hadn't,

126
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,081
the Seeker would not have been made

127
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,304
and there would be
no hope for the Midlands.

128
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,331
I don't understand
why Dennee never told me about you.

129
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:46,752
- How did you come to know my sister?
- I tried to kill her.

130
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,924
Was an assassin from the Order of Blood,
sent by Darken Rahl to murder her.

131
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:56,195
During the battle,
I was confessed by her.

132
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,422
I haven't seen her in months.

133
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,970
Dennee told me she had
to undertake a delicate mission.

134
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,979
She promised she'd return to me
when it was done.

135
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:11,443
She would've kept that promise
if I hadn't left her for dead.

136
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:19,511
We're going to find her. Okay?

137
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,834
- What's she saying?
- It's Dennee. She's close.

138
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:34,758
A fortress.

139
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,890
It's not a fortress. It's a prison.

140
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,350
And Dennee's inside.

141
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,180
We can't just charge
into a D'Haran prison.

142
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,693
But a Mord-Sith could.

143
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:53,696
Can you do a little magic tailoring?

144
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,970
A Mord-Sith approaches.

145
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,920
Tell your warden I have
a very special prisoner for him.

146
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,950
The Seeker?

147
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,565
You captured him single-handed?

148
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,236
You dare question a Mord-Sith?

149
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,949
Take me to the warden.

150
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,648
I have urgent intelligence
from Lord Rahl.

151
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,884
Intelligence that must be discussed
in private.

152
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,740
Leave us.

153
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,101
So what is this intelligence?

154
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,737
Command me, Confessor.

155
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,742
You have a prisoner I want to see.

156
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:47,007
It's me, little sister.

157
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,511
You came for me.

158
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,681
I should have never left you.

159
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,757
This is the Seeker.

160
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,279
Then you completed the mission.

161
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:08,804
- I feared you were dead.
- Thank the Spirits you're not.

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,560
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

163
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,737
But they're going to take my baby.

164
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,475
You're with child.

165
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:32,771
They mean to take my sister's child.
What do you know about this?

166
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,605
Darken Rahl wants to raise
a Confessor as his own.

167
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:40,036
To twist the child into a monster
that would do his bidding.

168
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:42,922
Can you walk?

169
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,407
- I think so.
- You should hurry.

170
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,742
Nass rides for the prison
as we speak.

171
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,805
- What's going on?
- Prisoner transfer.

172
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,878
My orders are to hold the Confessor here
until General Nass arrives.

173
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,753
Your orders have changed.

174
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,765
Our Dennee is safe.

175
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,734
By the Spirits, you're with child.

176
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,360
Is our baby all right?

177
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,502
Finn is the father?

178
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,522
Our numbers were dwindling.

179
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,287
And Finn was already confessed.
So I took him as a mate.

180
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:33,867
Finn is strong.

181
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:37,667
With Rahl hunting us, I could think
of no one better to protect the child.

182
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:42,213
Joyous news.
Another Confessor will be born

183
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,033
just when we needed her most.

184
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,932
You must've known you were carrying her
when we set off for the Boundary.

185
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:54,396
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,550
If you knew,

187
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,606
would you have let me join you
on such a perilous journey?

188
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:03,610
I wouldn't.

189
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,509
And I couldn't let you go alone.

190
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
We need to get moving.

191
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,079
The D'Harans
will be coming after us.

192
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,396
General Nass, we received orders
not to expect you.

193
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,500
What orders?

194
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,111
I have the orders right here.

195
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,729
Where is the prisoner?

196
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,717
Being delivered to Rahl.

197
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,071
By whom?

198
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:10,093
By the Mord-Sith.
She had also captured the Seeker.

199
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:15,374
That was no Mord-Sith.

200
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,270
It was a Confessor.

201
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,034
Ready your men.

202
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:31,476
If you can deliver the Confessor-child
and the Seeker to Lord Rahl,

203
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,675
he may forgive your failure.

204
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,534
Isn't there a shorter route
to the west?

205
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,909
You smell that?

206
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:50,596
Thelusian pines.They'll cover any scent
from us the D'Harans might pick up.

207
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:53,306
We'll be harder to track that way.

208
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:54,360
Good.

209
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,217
Because we may need to stop.

210
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:02,187
You're doing great!
I just need you to try again.

211
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,255
Come on.

212
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:05,844
Keep breathing.

213
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,656
The baby's in the wrong position.

214
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,499
What?

215
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,651
We need to turn the baby around.

216
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,248
- I don't wanna lose my baby.
- She's going to be fine. Let me try.

217
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:25,752
- Have you done this before?
- I grew up on a farm, remember?

218
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,174
I don't wanna lose her.

219
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,507
Try now, push.

220
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,270
It's a boy.

221
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,555
What's wrong?

222
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,309
The child must die.

223
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:32,152
It's not your fault, Dennee.
It's no one's fault.

224
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,169
There's nothing you could've done
to prevent this.

225
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,241
Kahlan, what's going on?

226
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:43,508
We're going to need Kreeg root
for the ritual.

227
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:47,482
Will someone tell me
what's happening here?

228
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:52,005
Male Confessors
can't be allowed to live.

229
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:55,209
Their souls must be purified
by the Ritual of the Waters

230
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,093
before they pass to the underworld.

231
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,887
Ritual?What are you talking about?

232
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,890
We have to drown the child.

233
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,259
That's insane.

234
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:08,665
A Confessor giving birth to a male child
is extraordinarily rare.

235
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,734
But if one is born, he cannot be allowed
to grow into adulthood.

236
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,780
Male Confessors are unable
to control their power.

237
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,191
Once they reach manhood,

238
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:21,988
they can't resist using it
for wicked ends.

239
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,013
So they are killed at birth.

240
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:30,210
Your numbers are dwindling

241
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:34,130
and now you want to kill one of your own
just because you think it might be evil?

242
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,210
Mothers of male Confessors
have often thought as you do.

243
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,938
One foolish young Confessor

244
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:45,683
couldn't bear
to have her son killed,

245
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:49,473
so she raised him in secrecy.

246
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:53,706
She thought

247
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:57,226
that the love in her heart
would be powerful enough

248
00:19:57,351 --> 00:20:00,151
to prevent him
from turning to the dark ways.

249
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,785
But when the boy came of age,

250
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,710
his bloodlust was insatiable.

251
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:11,659
My child

252
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,232
was only 11 years old

253
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,842
when I had to kill him.

254
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,941
Just because it happened
with your son doesn't mean

255
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,343
it's going to happen with Dennee's.
He's just a baby.

256
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,868
There's still time
to watch him grow.

257
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,273
To know
if he's gonna be evil or not.

258
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,320
You can't go along with this.

259
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
You think this is easy for me?

260
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:46,301
This is my nephew.

261
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:52,673
I know that's it's hard for you
to understand,

262
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,719
but ancient ways must be honored,

263
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:58,344
the longer we allow
this child to live,

264
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,360
the harder it's going to be

265
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,051
to do what must be done.

266
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,177
Doing it now

267
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,646
is a less cruel fate
for both the family and the child.

268
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:12,520
Finn will take the child
and perform the Ritual of the Waters.

269
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,440
Is there no other way?

270
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,001
You know there is not.

271
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,349
Get away from him.

272
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,618
You cannot wish evil away.

273
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,870
You cannot love evil away.

274
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:33,062
- You can only destroy it.
- You're not going to hurt this baby.

275
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,213
D'Harans. They're close.

276
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,717
We need to move now.

277
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,561
I can get the D'Harans off our trail.
But you have to promise me

278
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:48,973
nobody will harm this baby
while I'm gone.

279
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,228
Dala oil and Kreeg root.

280
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,370
The Ritual of the Waters.

281
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:14,165
The Confessor gave birth to a boy.

282
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,669
A female Confessor-child
was quite a prize,

283
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:21,807
but what Lord Rahl wouldn't give
for a male Confessor.

284
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:25,924
And if they are running from us,

285
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:29,165
they haven't had time yet
to perform the ritual.

286
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,351
- Their tracks lead this way.
- Follow them.

287
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,895
We must save that child.

288
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,114
- Did you lose them?
- They found the tracks I left.

289
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,688
They're heading
in the wrong direction.

290
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:50,655
But they're not gonna give up
so easily.

291
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,330
They know it's a boy.

292
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,365
And it seems Rahl really wants
to get his hands on a male Confessor.

293
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,709
It's the darkness
reaching for the darkness.

294
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,889
But he will not have it.

295
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,967
- Where's the baby?
- Finn's taken him.

296
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,408
You were supposed to keep him safe.

297
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:11,713
I'm sorry you don't understand.

298
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,836
You're right. I don't.
You promised me.

299
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,615
Cause I knew you'd do anything
to protect the child.

300
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,140
And so should you.

301
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:25,901
Richard, letting him live would be
a violation of everything we're taught.

302
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,073
You can't ask me
to go against my beliefs.

303
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,900
And you can't ask me
to go against mine.

304
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:44,713
Don't.

305
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,240
I can't disobey my mistress.

306
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,608
You have to do
what your mistress wants, right?

307
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,541
She wants me to drown our son.

308
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,866
Are you sure

309
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:18,956
that's what Dennee wants?

310
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,511
The Mother Confessor
ordered her to do it.

311
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:27,799
Doesn't your mistress
also command you with her heart?

312
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:30,941
You heard her

313
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,396
when she gave birth.

314
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,625
She didn't want her baby to die.

315
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,105
You know her heart
better than anyone, Finn.

316
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,646
You know what she wants.

317
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,190
She wants her baby...

318
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:50,528
to live.

319
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,534
I will protect him

320
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,095
with my life.

321
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,736
You gave the child to the Seeker?

322
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,865
I thought that's what you'd want.

323
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,002
No, the child is evil and must die.

324
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:44,083
Then I have failed you.

325
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:51,791
- Which way did the Seeker go?
- To the north. I can get him back.

326
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:55,511
You'll go with Alana.
Take Dennee and the others to the shore.

327
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:59,390
The Wizard, Kahlan and I
will continue after the child.

328
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,731
Take Mira as your guide.

329
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,156
We will rejoin you at the shore
once we have the child.

330
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,231
Then we can complete the ritual

331
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,984
and sail to the island.

332
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,157
Mother Confessor,
let me go on to track Richard.

333
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,980
I'll move faster on my own.

334
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:40,423
- We've lost their trail.
- They can't have gotten far.

335
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:43,486
And for your sake

336
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:46,611
that child had better be alive
when we find them.

337
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,030
It's okay.

338
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:55,997
We're safe now.

339
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,766
Everything's gonna be all right.

340
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,295
Stay away, Kahlan.

341
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,898
Richard, wait.

342
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,160
What are you planning on doing?
Just keep running with the child?

343
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,089
What your people
want to do is barbaric.

344
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,335
I know it must seem that way,

345
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,367
but you have to understand

346
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:20,956
that boy is a threat to everything
that we're fighting for.

347
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:23,224
How do you know that
if none of them havelived?

348
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,559
It's too dangerous to rely on hope.

349
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:26,752
Hope?

350
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:28,854
Isn't that what we're fighting for?

351
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,533
I was a child that was hunted.

352
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,078
Darken Rahl tried to kill me
because of his blind faith in prophecy.

353
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,748
Are you asking me
not to believe in prophecy?

354
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,901
I'm asking you to believe in me.

355
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,650
He's hungry.

356
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,404
We need to find some food.

357
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:22,658
My father used to give this to me
when I was a baby.

358
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,549
There you go.

359
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:35,867
I thought you might like that.

360
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,710
What are we gonna do with him?

361
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,900
Well, I was thinking.

362
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,522
We can take him
to the Valley of Thandor.

363
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,805
The duty of the Sisters of the Light
is to protect the children at Thandor.

364
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,380
They'd never take in
a male Confessor.

365
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:04,851
No one will.

366
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:10,831
We're on our own.

367
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,210
You're never on your own.

368
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,046
Richard, wait.

369
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,340
We don't need to fight
amongst ourselves.

370
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,928
- We have enough enemies already.
- This baby isn't one of them.

371
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,262
But he could be.

372
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,287
Darken Rahl was once a child.

373
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:32,775
Think of all the death
and suffering he's caused.

374
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,730
If you had a chance to prevent that,

375
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:37,002
wouldn't you?

376
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,600
Inevitably, evil is in its nature.

377
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,364
Well, it's not in mine.

378
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,783
No one is going to hurt this baby.

379
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:47,810
Enough debate, Zeddicus.

380
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:50,626
If you can't control the Seeker,
I will.

381
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,426
Is your devotion so great that
you'd threaten to confess the Seeker?

382
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,260
I have no intention
of confessing him.

383
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,234
Command me, Mother Confessor.

384
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:25,837
Zedd?

385
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,330
What have you done?

386
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,028
You have betrayed your order.

387
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,206
Who are you to question my judgment,

388
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:38,669
when yours is so obviously impaired
by your feelings for the Seeker?

389
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,797
You would forsake
everything you believe.

390
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:44,425
Everything you've lived for,

391
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,080
for a man who can never love you.

392
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,264
Zeddicus, get the boy.

393
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:08,824
Zedd, you can't do this!
You don't want to hurt us.

394
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,160
It's no use, Richard.
He's been confessed.

395
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,037
He's not Zedd anymore.

396
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:19,376
- I don't wanna fight you, Zedd.
- And he doesn't want to fight you.

397
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:22,463
Give me the child

398
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:24,795
and you can continue
with your mission.

399
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,966
The mission?

400
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:30,054
You jeopardized that when you confessed
a Wizard of the First Order.

401
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,919
As soon as I have the child,

402
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:37,048
I will command Zeddicus to continue
on as the Seeker's Wizard.

403
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,161
All will be as it was.

404
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:46,791
Very well.

405
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,823
Make him leave.

406
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:04,626
Mother Confessor,

407
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:06,924
you're going to kill him!

408
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,313
This has gone on long enough.

409
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,535
Your mission
is to protect the Seeker.

410
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:37,043
You know as well as I his life
is more important than the child's.

411
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:41,982
So give him to me.

412
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:48,299
It shouldn't be
a difficult decision.

413
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,871
Saving the man you love.

414
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,723
Don't do it, Kahlan.

415
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,516
It's okay, little one.

416
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:42,149
It'll all be over soon.

417
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:06,210
I'm sorry I went against your will
by trying to save our child.

418
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:08,712
- I failed you.
- No, you didn't fail me.

419
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,283
- You were doing my will.
- You can't put such ideas in his head.

420
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:13,360
Why not?

421
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,527
Mother Confessor knows
what must be done.

422
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:18,102
We cannot defy her.

423
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:21,214
Would you feel the same
if it were your child?

424
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,728
It has been done this way
for thousands of years.

425
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,147
There are only six of us left.

426
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,483
Do the ancient ways
still make sense?

427
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,208
I'm so sorry.

428
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,028
But I couldn't let them hurt you.

429
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,496
It's not your fault.

430
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:44,675
With Zedd confessed

431
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:47,028
and the Sword of Truth gone...

432
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:49,993
It's hopeless.

433
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:54,738
There's always hope.

434
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,271
We're too late, aren't we?

435
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,618
Mother Confessor
has taken the child to the shore

436
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:05,936
- to drown him.
- Can we catch her in time?

437
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,604
She's confessed Zedd.

438
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,641
And taken the Sword of Truth.

439
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,610
What are we gonna do?

440
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:17,573
We're going to get some help.

441
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,352
The tracks end here.

442
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,920
Where did he go?

443
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:22,944
I'm right here.

444
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:25,164
I'm unarmed.

445
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:28,016
Then you are a fool.

446
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,067
Kahlan, now!

447
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,785
Command me, Confessor.

448
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:33,705
- What is it, Mother Confessor?
- The others.

449
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,730
They should already be here.

450
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:37,991
Someone's coming.

451
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:43,634
Stop them.

452
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,090
You'll never know

453
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,818
how greatly you've disappointed me,
Kahlan.

454
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,364
I always thought that one day,
you would be Mother Confessor.

455
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,179
How wrong I was.

456
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,870
You were taught all your life

457
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:56,348
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

458
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,179
This child...

459
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,361
could destroy everything
we've been fighting for.

460
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:07,721
We're fighting for a world
with less brutality.

461
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,296
Would killing that child
give us that?

462
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,685
I'm just glad I didn't hurt you.

463
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,214
She dedicated her life

464
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,226
to keeping the Midlands free
from the tyranny of Darken Rahl.

465
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,842
For that she will be remembered.

466
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,530
Spirits,

467
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:04,860
watch over her
as she has watched over so many.

468
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,957
We need to choose
a Mother Confessor.

469
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,529
We already have.

470
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:27,883
It's you, Kahlan.

471
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:35,912
I'm honored but...

472
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:38,894
I must continue
to protect the Seeker.

473
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,158
Just as we must stay here

474
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,648
to protect the people
from Rahl's injustice.

475
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,156
Take Mira.

476
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,364
She will keep you safe.

477
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:18,516
Thank you for coming back for me.

478
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,260
I asked the Spirits to protect you,

479
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:25,144
and they did.

480
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,939
They'll be fine.

481
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,850
You said it yourself.

482
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,339
Dennee and Finn can't be confessed,

483
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:14,064
so their son's touch
will have no effect.

484
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:18,110
He can't be seduced by his own power
if he's unable to use it.

485
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,580
Once they reach Valeria,
there won't be anyone to corrupt.

486
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:25,220
With no one to corrupt him,

487
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:27,377
they can raise him
to be a force for good.

488
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,616
But what if we're wrong?

489
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,880
What if we've unleashed
a horrible evil into the world?

490
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:39,272
What then?
