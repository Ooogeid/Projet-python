00:00:02,571 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>Richard Cypher,</i>

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,630
If the compass continues
pointing us south,

5
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,298
we'll go right past
the Falls of Aldermont.

6
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,434
Is that someplace important?

7
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:30,203
It's considered
the most romantic spot

8
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:31,768
in all the Midlands.

9
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,597
Many a child was conceived
beneath those cascading waters.

10
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,463
I was there once.
It's beautiful.

11
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:39,125
Oh, really?
And who were you with?

12
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,921
My sister.

13
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:44,255
At sunset,
when the light hits the falls,

14
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:46,558
the water glistens red.

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,226
They say it's the reflection
of all the lovers' hearts

16
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,291
who've kissed there.

17
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,358
That or a reflection
of the blood spilled

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,625
at the Battle of Aldermont.

19
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:58,191
Two hundred men were
killed in that spot.

20
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,890
The rest threw their bodies
into the rapids

21
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:01,123
rather than surrender.

22
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,623
Well, that does sound romantic.

23
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,059
If we move fast,

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,593
we can get there
in time to see the sunset.

25
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:21,366
These men were tortured.

26
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,500
Not very inspired work.

27
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,401
Looks like they died
before they hung.

28
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,702
Then why hang them?

29
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,869
Whoever did this wanted
to put them on display

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,238
to send a message.

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,906
"Whoever attempts
to subvert justice

32
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:37,241
shall meet the same fate."

33
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:38,609
Kahlan, take a look at this.

34
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,145
It's the seal of Aydindril.

35
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,914
"By order
of the High Lord Regent."

36
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:49,581
Who's that?

37
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:50,715
There's no such title.

38
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:52,082
The only person
with the authority

39
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,051
to confer this seal
is the Mother Confessor.

40
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,619
Then who ordered
these men killed?

41
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,791
I can pay you
15 gold pieces now.

42
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,659
I'll have the rest soon,
I promise.

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,461
Please, Lord Regent,

44
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,995
give me a little more time.

45
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:14,263
You've had more than a month.

46
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,964
It's been difficult
for me to find work

47
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:16,964
since you cut off my hand.

48
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:18,165
Your hand was removed

49
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,966
as punishment
for stealing grain.

50
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,200
Times were hard after the war.

51
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,334
My family needed food.

52
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:24,235
You were tried fairly
and found guilty.

53
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:26,070
In accordance with the law,
you lost your hand.

54
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,137
Wasn't that punishment enough?

55
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,472
For theft?

56
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:31,772
But to steal that grain,

57
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:35,008
you also trespassed
on Olrich Larson's land.

58
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,742
Should that crime
simply go unpunished?

59
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:38,710
If the Council and the Mother
Confessor were here,

60
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:39,710
they would never allow--

61
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,178
But they aren't here, are they?

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,813
Please.

63
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:46,581
Have mercy...

64
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,249
I'm showing you mercy, Shaun.

65
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,018
Fifty gold pieces
and you can go home.

66
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,519
I don't have it.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,255
Please don't take my other hand.

68
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,323
Oh, I'm not going
to take your other hand.

69
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:05,360
Tomorrow at dawn,
cut off his head.

70
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:08,429
No! No!

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,130
No, please don't kill me! No!

72
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:12,198
No!

73
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,799
My family will starve!
Don't do this!

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,434
You see why I asked you to come.

75
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,669
I only wish I could
have gotten here sooner.

76
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,471
Fyren's army
is occupying the city.

77
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:24,039
The people are afraid
to oppose him.

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,408
Even a Wizard of the Second
Order might find himself

79
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,642
swinging from a noose

80
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,944
if he tried to use
magic to stop him.

81
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,011
I need your help.

82
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,880
What about Oloron's Amulet?

83
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,481
Fyren has it locked
in the treasury

84
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,016
with a dozen men guarding it.

85
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:40,984
I'll get it.
The next prisoner.

86
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,620
There are not many Wizards
left in this world, Silas.

87
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,955
Going in there would--
Would be tantamount

88
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,522
to signing your own
death warrant.

89
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,424
And how many more
death warrants will be signed

90
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:54,926
if we don't bring the Mother
Confessor back to Aydindril?

91
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,834
Halt, Wizard.

92
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:06,968
Halt or I'll shoot.

93
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:29,515
Richard, those bodies we found
were at least two days old.

94
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:33,385
Whoever killed those
men is long gone.

95
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,700
Silas.
You know him?

96
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,837
He's a Wizard of the Second
Order from Aydindril.

97
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:54,305
Cara.

98
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,211
He's already cold.

99
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,779
The Breath of Life
won't work.

100
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,181
You can put your weapons down.

101
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:06,848
Whoever shot him
couldn't follow him here.

102
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,750
He used this.

103
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,685
Oloron's Amulet.

104
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,053
What is it?

105
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:14,721
A magical device
that's kept in Aydindril.

106
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:18,892
It was devised hundreds
of years ago as a safeguard.

107
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:22,027
If the Mother Confessor
were urgently needed,

108
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,528
a skilled Wizard
could use the amulet

109
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,263
to find her anywhere
in the world

110
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:27,899
and carry them both home.

111
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,835
He must have been
shot in Aydindril.

112
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:33,003
It seems he managed
to recite the incantation

113
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,571
just before he died.

114
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:36,872
He came here
to tell you something.

115
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:39,074
It must have been important.

116
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:42,076
My guess is
it has something to do

117
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,712
with this "High Lord Regent"
who ordered those men killed.

118
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,913
I have to get to Aydindril.

119
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,749
That's hundreds
of leagues from here.

120
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,485
Zedd, can you use that amulet
to get us there?

121
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,653
Its magic is only strong enough

122
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,821
to transport a Wizard
and a Confessor.

123
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,025
Then we'll meet
up with you there.

124
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,393
That could take weeks.

125
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,562
Every day the quest is delayed,
the Keeper grows stronger.

126
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:10,932
You and Cara continue the search
for the Stone of Tears

127
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,834
while Kahlan
and I go to Aydindril.

128
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:16,970
The Seeker needs his Wizard
and his Confessor by his side.

129
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,605
If we leave him again--

130
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,307
After we killed Darken Rahl,

131
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,909
you should have gone
back to Aydindril then,

132
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,510
but instead,
you came with me.

133
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,679
The quest was more important.

134
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,581
The quest is my burden.

135
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:31,917
I've kept you away from
your home long enough.

136
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,288
My home is with you.

137
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,923
We've been apart before.

138
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,559
We always find our way
back to each other.

139
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,904
I wish I didn't have to go.

140
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,049
Kahlan?

141
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,720
What--? What happened?

142
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,054
Why am I still here?

143
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:18,390
And where's Zedd?

144
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,465
How do you feel?

145
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,233
All in one piece.

146
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,736
I wish I could say
the same for the amulet.

147
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:35,471
At least it got
us here safely.

148
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,910
It's good to be home.

149
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:47,724
If Zedd got to Aydindril

150
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:49,325
and realized I wasn't with him,

151
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,361
he'd come back for me.
Maybe he can't.

152
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,395
I have a feeling
Zedd got to Aydindril

153
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,563
with the other half of this.

154
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,698
Even if he did get there,
look at what happened to Silas.

155
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,901
Zedd could be walking
into a trap.

156
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,802
The Wizard isn't
exactly defenseless.

157
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:07,274
If I can get a horse I can
be there in less than a week.

158
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:08,709
You can't go alone.

159
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,776
It's too dangerous.

160
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,877
Cara and I will go with you.

161
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:14,011
But the compass is pointing
in the opposite direction.

162
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:18,081
And we'll follow it that way
once we know Zedd is safe.

163
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,449
Let's go.

164
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,688
Silas knew that
stealing the amulet

165
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,256
could cost him his life.

166
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,925
It's a rare man willing
to make such a sacrifice.

167
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,796
Who are those guards?

168
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,130
Prince Fyren's men.

169
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,465
Prince Fyren?

170
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:40,466
Of Kelton?

171
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,801
When Rahl fell,

172
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:44,903
Fyren threw the D'Harans
out of Kelton and Aydindril.

173
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,538
Then he jailed
the Council members

174
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,540
and proclaimed himself
"High Lord Regent."

175
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,042
In a forest near Gallimar,

176
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,144
we found two bodies
hanging from a tree

177
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,079
bearing the seal of Aydindril
round their necks.

178
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,581
Fyren's work.

179
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,115
He's given bands of hoodlums

180
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:03,116
the authority
to enforce his laws,

181
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,886
mostly archaic or invented,
demanding fines.

182
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:11,256
When people can't pay, or won't,
he makes examples out of them.

183
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:13,258
I've heard enough.

184
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,793
Where can I find Prince Fyren?

185
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,467
Well.

186
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:28,136
What crime could
this lovely young lady

187
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:29,970
possibly have committed?

188
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,407
It's a private matter.

189
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:36,677
Come closer.

190
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,816
Tell me what I can
do for you.

191
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,987
You can get out of my chair.

192
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,798
Command me, Confessor.

193
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,165
Order your men to stand down.

194
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,067
Death to anyone who harms her!

195
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,341
The Mother Confessor
has returned to Aydindril.

196
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:18,777
Everyone answers to me

197
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,380
or you will meet the same
fate as Prince Fyren.

198
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:28,517
All of his edicts will
be subject to my review.

199
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:33,555
There will be no more unjust
fines or executions.

200
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:37,358
The rule of law will be restored
to the Midlands.

201
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,133
What are you smiling about?

202
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:49,703
Nothing. I was just thinking.
About what?

203
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:53,372
Even though I'm worried
about Zedd, I have to admit,

204
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:57,009
part of me is glad
the amulet didn't work.

205
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,644
I always dreamed we'd
go to Aydindril together.

206
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,582
Please, we won't do it again.

207
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,350
You've violated
the code of Aydindril.

208
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,985
If you don't pay your fine,
you'll be put to death.

209
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,986
For kissing her?

210
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,421
Let them go.

211
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,223
This is none of your concern,
Seeker.

212
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,858
We're here under the authority

213
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,092
of the High Lord Regent
of Aydindril.

214
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,161
Release them. Now.

215
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,096
Or what?

216
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,268
Get out of here!

217
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,767
You're no Confessor.

218
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,742
What happened?
Why didn't you confess him?

219
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:23,310
I couldn't.

220
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,545
What?

221
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:27,512
My power...

222
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,681
it's gone.

223
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,200
I knew I wasn't feeling right.

224
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,535
Now I know why.

225
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,838
It must have been the accident
with the amulet.

226
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,508
Richard, this has never
happened before.

227
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,843
To any Confessor. Ever.

228
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,145
There has to be a way
to fix it.

229
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:59,814
Confessor magic isn't something
you can just "fix."

230
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,883
Without it I'm--
I'm not a Confessor at all.

231
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,217
Hey.

232
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:07,620
We'll get to Aydindril,
we'll find Zedd--

233
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,222
We don't even know
if Zedd's alive.

234
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,858
It takes more magic than
a broken amulet to kill Zedd.

235
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,393
Trust me.

236
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,895
I asked our friends if we
could borrow their horses.

237
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,900
They didn't object.

238
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:28,803
The faster we move, the sooner
we can get back to Zedd.

239
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:31,038
Come on.

240
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,177
Hyah!

241
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,285
The sentence issued
by Prince Fyren

242
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,520
was unduly harsh.

243
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,655
His order for your beheading
is hereby overturned.

244
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:50,724
Bless you, Mother Confessor.

245
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,861
Kahlan, I believe
we can do more

246
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:56,296
to mitigate this man's loss.

247
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,098
Just a moment, Zedd.

248
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:03,667
His hand was removed
because he stole grain.

249
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:06,169
I had to.
To feed my family.

250
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,105
But you stole that grain
from another family.

251
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,908
Yes, Mother Confessor.

252
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,976
Then according
to the code of Aydindril,

253
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,944
cutting off your hand
was the fitting punishment.

254
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:19,311
I'm afraid I can't let
the Wizard restore it.

255
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,514
Kahlan, are you sure?

256
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,949
I've made my decision.

257
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,957
She's changed since
I last saw her.

258
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,165
She's changed
since this morning.

259
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:43,806
My men have returned nearly
all the fines I collected.

260
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,441
They have orders not to stop

261
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,975
until they've
paid everyone back.

262
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,777
Have I pleased you, mistress?

263
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:50,545
For now.

264
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:53,115
See to it that all the released
prisoners get home safely.

265
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,283
Yes, mistress.

266
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,120
Zedd.

267
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:59,155
I thought you'd be
feasting on lamb

268
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:00,823
at Ambrosio's Tavern by now.

269
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,525
And miss watching
the Mother Confessor

270
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,660
bring justice
back to Aydindril?

271
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:07,296
Not even for Ambrosio's.

272
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:11,000
There's still so much
to set right.

273
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,667
Why didn't you allow me

274
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:13,999
to restore that
young man's hand?

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,734
He stole grain
from another family.

276
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,003
With his hand he could
have worked to repay them.

277
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,505
According to the code
of Aydindril--

278
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,674
You know better than I do
that those barbaric codes

279
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,509
haven't been enforced
for hundreds of years.

280
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,147
Yes, and look
at the Midlands now.

281
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:33,551
Zedd, I did not come here
to grant amnesty

282
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:35,720
to thieves and petty criminals.

283
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,423
I came here to abolish
a corrupt system.

284
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:41,026
To bring back the rule of law.
If I start making exceptions

285
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,628
the rules will lose
their meaning.

286
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:46,997
In the past, you've always been
one to err on the side of mercy.

287
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,932
What you call "mercy"
is a stone's throw from chaos.

288
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,870
Do you think
I'm being unreasonable?

289
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,607
Not unreasonable,

290
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,375
just very different

291
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,343
from the Kahlan Amnell I know.

292
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:05,079
Before, my duty
was to protect Richard.

293
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,380
Here, I'm the leader.

294
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,315
I have to have
the people's respect.

295
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,383
I hope I have yours.

296
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,886
Always, Kahlan.

297
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,222
Thank you.

298
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,335
Richard, Richard.

299
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:39,004
What's wrong?
You all right?

300
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:41,473
Oh, yeah, I'm fine,
everything's fine.

301
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,574
I just--

302
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:46,744
I need to talk to you.

303
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,313
Alone.

304
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:57,252
We're going to take a walk.

305
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,993
I couldn't sleep.

306
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,862
I kept thinking:
I don't have my powers--

307
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,198
I know, but--
No, no.

308
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,734
No, Richard,
it's not that, I--

309
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,943
I don't know if I'm going to get
them back tomorrow or ever.

310
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,278
But right now...

311
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,849
This--

312
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,785
This could
be our only chance.

313
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,754
Are you saying--?

314
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,288
Yes.

315
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,761
If you want to.

316
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,848
You asked to see me, mistress?

317
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,255
Before you were confessed,

318
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:16,825
your motives were greedy
and selfish,

319
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,260
and your methods unlawful.

320
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:20,128
Forgive me, mistress.

321
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:26,901
However, you also showed great
strength and leadership.

322
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,470
You took the D'Harans
out of Aydindril.

323
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:33,940
You easily unseated
the Council.

324
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:38,077
You come from a line of kings
and great warriors.

325
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:42,180
You meet the qualifications
to sire the next Confessor.

326
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:46,183
Mistress, I'm honored.

327
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:50,087
I'll please you in ways
you can't imagine.

328
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,455
Hm. I doubt that.

329
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:53,156
But you can try.

330
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,758
Oh, that won't be necessary.

331
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,925
Just take off your clothes.

332
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:11,031
The sun's coming up.

333
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,165
Are you sure?

334
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,867
I think that's the moon.

335
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,668
Cara's going to be wondering
where we are.

336
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,270
I think Cara
can figure it out.

337
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,846
Can you imagine what it would
be like to be ordinary people?

338
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,086
You mean the kind that sleep
in beds in houses?

339
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:37,554
Yes, yes.

340
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,723
And who make each other
breakfast in the morning

341
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,657
and kiss their
children goodnight.

342
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,492
The kind that have time

343
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,863
to go see the Falls of Aldermont
at sunset.

344
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:51,170
Do you ever think about that?

345
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,639
Every day.

346
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,813
I wish we didn't
have to go.

347
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:05,483
Me too.

348
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:14,324
I'll meet you back
at the campsite.

349
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,536
This is Aydindril.

350
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,239
If we go through
the Rang'Shada mountains

351
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,873
we won't have to cross
the Kael river.

352
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,008
There's a bridge
after the river forks.

353
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,576
It might be faster.

354
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:33,177
We'll go that way, then.

355
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,485
That was a long walk
you took.

356
00:21:43,922 --> 00:21:46,191
What are you two doing?

357
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,328
We're just discussing whether
to go through the mountains

358
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:50,396
or across the river.

359
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,598
You had your hands all over him.

360
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,936
I was taking a leaf
out of his hair.

361
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:59,473
I may not have my powers,
but I have eyes, Cara.

362
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:00,941
I know what I saw.

363
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:03,978
You can't stand that Richard
and I were together last night.

364
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,380
Why would I care?

365
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:07,015
Do you think I don't see
how you look at him?

366
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,783
"I'd die for you, Richard."

367
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:11,919
"How can I serve you,
Richard?"

368
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,889
You want him for yourself.
You always have, just admit it.

369
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,425
Kahlan, you are seeing things
that aren't there.

370
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:20,061
Richard,

371
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:23,230
she has been trying
to get her claws into you

372
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,401
ever since you rescued her
from the Mord-Sith.

373
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:28,005
No one rescued me.

374
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:29,540
Cara--

375
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,641
You think if it weren't for me,
you'd have him already?

376
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,374
Well, you will never
have him.

377
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,472
If I wanted him,
I would have had him already.

378
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:37,837
Kahlan.

379
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:40,339
You're not thinking.

380
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,473
Cara hasn't done anything--

381
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:43,241
Why do you always
defend her?

382
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,242
Just calm down.

383
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,011
You love her, don't you?

384
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:51,647
Kahlan--
All right. Fine.

385
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,415
If you want her,
you can have her.

386
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:57,152
I hope you two
are very happy together.

387
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,961
Kahlan, stop.

388
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,229
Kahlan.

389
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,330
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:13,699
I don't know
what I was thinking.

391
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,801
I don't know why I said
those things to Cara.

392
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:17,302
Cara's fine.

393
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,270
Look, what is this about?

394
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,138
I just...

395
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:25,409
I saw her with you
and I was afraid that--

396
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,877
That last night meant nothing
to you.

397
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:30,246
It meant everything to me.

398
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,147
But you want to go
to Aydindril.

399
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:34,482
You want me to get
my powers back.

400
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,283
Then we'll never
be able to--

401
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,185
I want you to get
your powers back

402
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,623
because they're a part of you.

403
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:42,858
I thought that's what
you wanted too.

404
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:47,329
But whatever happens,
you are the one I love.

405
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,298
When the rift is sealed
and the world is safe again,

406
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,201
I want nothing more
than just to be with you.

407
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,838
We could be together now.

408
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,506
What are you talking about?

409
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,374
Richard, the Prophecy says

410
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,543
that as long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

411
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,479
the Keeper will never win.

412
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,514
All I have to do
is stay alive.

413
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,984
We could go into hiding
somewhere where I'd be safe

414
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,853
and we can give
the Sword to Cara,

415
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:14,722
and she could go to Aydindril
and give it to Zedd.

416
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,523
And they can name
a new Seeker.

417
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,992
And we can live
like ordinary people.

418
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,194
We could-- We could
have children.

419
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:25,465
Kahlan, I can't abandon
my quest.

420
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:32,472
Does that always
have to come first?

421
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:35,374
Before our happiness?

422
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,945
The Kahlan I know cares more
about the fate of the world

423
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,246
than her own happiness.

424
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:43,716
Well, maybe it's our turn.

425
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:46,386
We can both have
what we want.

426
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:47,987
Listen to me.

427
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,789
Something is wrong with you.

428
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,392
You didn't just lose
your powers, you lost...

429
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:53,594
something else.

430
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,929
No, Richard, I'm fine.
You're not fine.

431
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,729
You're making accusations
that don't make sense.

432
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,497
You're talking about
abandoning our quest.

433
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:04,134
Richard, I just--
I love you so much.

434
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,402
I can't lose you.
I can't. I can't.

435
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:10,139
You're not
going to lose me.

436
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,741
And if you love me,
you need to trust me.

437
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:15,243
I don't know what's happened
to you, but we need to find out.

438
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,311
Do you trust me?

439
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,448
Then we need to get to Aydindril
and get there fast.

440
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:29,756
Havre the Council brought to me
when they arrive.

441
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,224
Kahlan.

442
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:34,657
May I have a word?

443
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,393
Leave us, Fyren.

444
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:38,961
I take it you finally
made it

445
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,563
to Ambrosio's last night?

446
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:44,332
Yes, and I heard
a rather disturbing rumor

447
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,901
that the Mother Confessor had
taken Prince Fyren as her mate.

448
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,736
I assured those gossiping fools
that there was no truth to it,

449
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:53,571
but his appearance
by your side

450
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,905
might give some
the impression--

451
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:56,239
It's no rumor, Zedd.

452
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,809
Kahlan,
you couldn't have.

453
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,245
He's been confessed.

454
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,080
He meets the requirements.

455
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,615
But what about Richard?

456
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,783
You know I can't mate
with Richard.

457
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:11,251
My powers
would destroy him.

458
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:13,520
Of course, but you've always
resisted taking a mate

459
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,354
because of your love
for him.

460
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,157
I don't have the luxury
of love.

461
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:24,193
I have a duty to continue
the line of Confessors.

462
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:26,528
Richard understands that.

463
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,996
So should you.

464
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:30,165
I understand that,

465
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,035
but to do it
so rashly,

466
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:34,206
and with him...

467
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,179
The Council is here to see you,
mistress.

468
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,414
Show them in.

469
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,319
Zedd,

470
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,854
this really isn't
your concern.

471
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,657
Mother Confessor.

472
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:51,160
The Council of the Midlands
has returned to be seated.

473
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,861
That won't be necessary.

474
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,831
Under the Council's watch,

475
00:26:56,832 --> 00:27:00,334
Prince Fyren was able
to usurp my authority

476
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:04,837
and unleash a reign of terror
all over the Midlands.

477
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,640
The Council has proven itself

478
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:10,275
utterly ineffective,

479
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,809
and is hereby disbanded.

480
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,547
Justice in the Midlands
requires only one voice:

481
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:17,815
mine.

482
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:28,923
I don't know
what happened to you

483
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:30,325
when we used that amulet
to get here,

484
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,527
but something
has happened to you, Kahlan.

485
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,161
You are not yourself.

486
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:37,864
Zedd, you came with me
to ensure that I arrived safely.

487
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,065
I'm safe.

488
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,800
Now, you're free to go back
to Cara and Richard

489
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:43,268
and help them find
the Stone of Tears.

490
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,670
But if you choose to stay
in Aydindril,

491
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:48,606
you will not question
my authority again.

492
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,718
I've held my tongue
for days now.

493
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,087
I can no longer
remain silent.

494
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:08,057
I know Kahlan Amnell very well,
and this is not Kahlan.

495
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:11,260
You think the Mother Confessor
is an imposter?

496
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:12,894
She can't be.

497
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:14,529
I traveled here
with her myself.

498
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,767
Something happened to her
when the amulet was broken.

499
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:20,969
I've been searching the scrolls
at the Wizard's Keep

500
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,571
for answers,
but I've found nothing.

501
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:24,773
What do you suggest we do?

502
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:28,410
We can't let her
remain in power.

503
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,646
A Wizard's web will keep
her contained, but unharmed.

504
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:35,550
Putting the Mother Confessor
in a Wizard's web is treason.

505
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,921
I wish there was another way.

506
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,824
So do I.

507
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:46,261
I may only be a Wizard
of the Second Order,

508
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,595
but I believe it was you

509
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,763
who taught me the element
of surprise is everything.

510
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:50,798
Guards!

511
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,344
Alferon, why?

512
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,513
You were plotting
against my mistress.

513
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:07,649
She confessed me
just yesterday.

514
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,526
This man
has committed treason.

515
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,327
As Mother Confessor,

516
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:24,829
I am sworn to uphold the highest
standards of justice.

517
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,665
The crime of treason
threatens justice itself.

518
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,267
And when justice
is threatened,

519
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,771
it is all of society
that suffers.

520
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,540
Though I have known this man
for a long time,

521
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,909
I do not make exceptions.

522
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,279
Everyone is to be treated
fairly.

523
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,347
No one,

524
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,249
not even a Wizard
of the First Order...

525
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,717
Who is that?

526
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,351
...is above the law.
It's you.

527
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:52,155
For conspiring to overthrow
the Mother Confessor,

528
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,389
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

529
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,225
I sentence you to death
by hanging at first light.

530
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:06,310
We have to do something.

531
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:08,645
Wait.

532
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,113
Don't let her see you.

533
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,615
But that imposter
just sentenced Zedd to death.

534
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,283
She has guards everywhere.

535
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:15,984
If she's powerful enough
to capture Zedd,

536
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,619
there's no telling
what she's capable of.

537
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,254
I have to tell them
that she's not me.

538
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:22,723
I'm not so sure about that.
What do you mean?

539
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:25,725
I don't think the amulet was the
only thing that split in two.

540
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,595
Don't ask me to explain it.
We need to get to Zedd.

541
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,330
Not like that.

542
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:33,165
Then how do you propose
we get to him?

543
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,100
<i>Seven years' hard labor.</i>

544
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,203
Bring the next supplicant.

545
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,646
Mother Confessor.

546
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,348
Richard.

547
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,383
I'm surprised to see you
in Aydindril.

548
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,851
Why are you here?

549
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,755
I was concerned about you
and my grandfather.

550
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,591
I'm sorry, Richard.

551
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,992
But Zedd has become a threat.

552
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,693
He tried to depose me.

553
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:06,797
I had no choice but to find him
guilty of treason.

554
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,832
That doesn't sound like Zedd.

555
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,500
How can you be sure?

556
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,569
I'm always sure.

557
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,803
It's part of my gift.

558
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:16,339
He dies in the morning.

559
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,841
Now, you should get back
to your quest.

560
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,076
We're all depending on you.

561
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:22,678
Yes, Mother Confessor.

562
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,681
But before my grandfather dies,

563
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,549
I'd like to see him.

564
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,217
I believe it's my right.

565
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,524
Guards, please escort the Seeker
to the dungeon.

566
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,663
Of course.
It all makes sense now.

567
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,998
If only I had
realized it sooner.

568
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,166
Realized what?

569
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,701
The amulet
is very powerful.

570
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,204
It's magically linked to the
heart of the Mother Confessor.

571
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:52,005
It can find her anywhere
in the world.

572
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:55,142
When we used it to come here,

573
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:57,577
in her heart,
Kahlan was torn.

574
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:59,212
Part of her wanted
to stay with you,

575
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:01,080
and that part stayed.

576
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:04,251
So which one is really Kahlan?

577
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,586
Neither.

578
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:07,021
I don't understand.

579
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:11,793
We're all a delicate combination
of duty and desire.

580
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,495
The heart and the head.

581
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,129
Constantly keeping each other
in balance.

582
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,397
It takes both to make us whole.

583
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:20,565
How did this happen?

584
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,768
Kahlan's innermost desire
was to stay,

585
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,771
but her duty was to go.

586
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:27,272
So when the amulet broke,

587
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,307
the woman in love
stayed with you,

588
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:33,510
and the Confessor sworn
to serve the Midlands came here.

589
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:37,714
There has to be a way to put
both halves back together.

590
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:41,451
With both pieces of the amulet,
I think I could.

591
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:45,221
Of course, that's assuming
I have the use of my hands.

592
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,623
I'm going to get you
out of here.

593
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:48,625
How?

594
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:52,561
You said the Mother Confessor
is guided by reason alone?

595
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:55,765
<i>I'd like to speak</i>
<i>on Zedd's behalf</i>

596
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,367
before his sentence
is carried out.

597
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,439
It's your right to speak.

598
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,307
In sentencing Zedd for treason,

599
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:03,008
you failed to take
into consideration

600
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,977
his exceptional
life and deeds.

601
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:07,779
Should I list them?

602
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,115
I'm well aware
of Zedd's accomplishments.

603
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:12,050
But it doesn't change the fact

604
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:14,987
that he conspired
to overthrow me.

605
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:16,422
He broke the law.

606
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:19,391
As the Mother Confessor,
the law is what you say it is.

607
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:22,228
And I say the Code of Aydindril
is the law.

608
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:24,831
I've read the Code of Aydindril.

609
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,933
It was written
by the first Mother Confessor.

610
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:31,503
She said there is no justice
be it not tempered by mercy.

611
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:34,038
Magda Searus,
the first Mother Confessor,

612
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,574
she was not without her enemies.

613
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,009
She killed when
it was necessary.

614
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,743
She did kill.

615
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:43,313
In fact, she insisted that all
male Confessor babies be killed

616
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,248
because they lacked
the compassion necessary

617
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:46,783
to control their powers.

618
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:48,351
Is my sex in question,
Richard?

619
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:50,553
No.

620
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:53,089
But your compassion is.

621
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,924
You have none.

622
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:58,260
Because you are, in fact,
not the Mother Confessor.

623
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,665
You know who I am, Richard.

624
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,899
I know your kindness,

625
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,800
your wisdom,

626
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,536
and yes, your compassion.

627
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:10,271
But I don't see these things
in you.

628
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:16,477
Because they're in her.

629
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:30,389
This is a trick.

630
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,958
This is no trick.

631
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:36,196
She's been with me
since the moment you left.

632
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:39,000
When you used the amulet,
you were split in two.

633
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:41,903
You may have your powers
and your sharp mind,

634
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:44,139
but the rest of you is in her.

635
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,376
Your heart.
Your compassion.

636
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,643
Your mercy.

637
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:53,775
Mother Confessor
needs all of it.

638
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,377
Zedd can fix this.

639
00:34:57,378 --> 00:34:58,909
He can put you back together.

640
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,242
He can make you
a whole person again.

641
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,710
But until he does,

642
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,545
you don't have the right
to decide his fate,

643
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:06,913
or anyone else's.

644
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,249
Let's assume you're correct,

645
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,252
and I no longer have the part
of me that cares for you

646
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:14,820
or for Zedd.

647
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,656
That compassion,
as you call it,

648
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,758
kept me from my duties here.

649
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,695
Without it,
I'm a better leader.

650
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,196
A better judge.

651
00:35:27,197 --> 00:35:28,998
A better Confessor.

652
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,602
Whatever she is, I don't need
her getting in the way of that.

653
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:37,171
If you refuse to allow Zedd
to put you back together,

654
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:40,274
you will leave this woman
without her reason, her power.

655
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:42,242
Is that just?

656
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:45,812
She has no powers?

657
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,916
Then you and Richard
can be together.

658
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,653
Do you feel incomplete?

659
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,491
You can't lie
to a Confessor.

660
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,092
I think you know that.

661
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,793
No.

662
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:08,362
I don't feel incomplete.

663
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:13,032
If you're part of me,
then I don't want you back.

664
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,768
Not if it means
I'd put duty above love.

665
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,637
Not if it means I can never
be Richard's wife.

666
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:21,641
I'm never going
to be your husband.

667
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:23,042
No, you'll change your mind.

668
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:25,277
I can be everything
that you want.

669
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:26,912
I won't ask you
to give up your quest.

670
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:29,347
I'll-- I'll love Cara
like a sister, and--

671
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:31,215
And you can have her too,
if that's what you want.

672
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:33,417
And you'll love me,
just like you did before.

673
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:34,984
Would you look at her?

674
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,719
She's not in her right mind.

675
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,388
And neither are you.

676
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,123
Richard.

677
00:36:43,124 --> 00:36:47,092
I understand that you missed
some idealized version

678
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:49,794
of the Kahlan you loved.

679
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:52,830
But you do not have the right to
murder two distinct individuals

680
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:55,098
simply to get the one
that you want.

681
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,632
I've made my decision.

682
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,167
Go back to your quest.
Take her with you.

683
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,602
I'm not going anywhere
until you let Zedd go.

684
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:05,107
Then you will be arrested for
defying the Mother Confessor.

685
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:06,241
Seize them.

686
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:40,405
Richard!

687
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,174
Stop them.
They'll kill him.

688
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:46,543
Richard!

689
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:52,348
It seems my emotions
are still getting in my way.

690
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,715
Kahlan, no!

691
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,861
Command me, mistress.

692
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,062
Help me fight him.

693
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,914
Yes, mistress.

694
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:23,354
That was foolish, Cara. One
touch from me could kill you.

695
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,322
Ah!

696
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,557
Mistress!

697
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,593
I told you I'd die
to protect Richard.

698
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:31,961
Fortunately, I won't have to.

699
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,901
Drop your weapons or I kill her.

700
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,402
Mistress, please,
they'll kill you.

701
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,939
Richard won't let her
kill me.

702
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,778
I never said both of you had
to be alive for Zedd to fix you.

703
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:48,279
You're bluffing.

704
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,514
Am I?

705
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:51,616
How can you be sure of that?

706
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:54,686
Don't kill her! Mistress,
please, do as they say.

707
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:08,699
Drop your weapons.

708
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:21,310
Release Zedd.

709
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:23,479
Right now.

710
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:27,483
I will.

711
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,584
But before you do anything
to harm me,

712
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:33,789
you should know
I may be with child.

713
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,226
Mistress, I could also
be with child.

714
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,030
Your child.

715
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:59,014
Neither of you
is with child.

716
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,251
But Fyren and I were intimate
many times.

717
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:05,354
Both of you are nothing more
than magical fragments.

718
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:06,989
Conception under such
circumstances

719
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,924
would be impossible.

720
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:10,592
You know I'm telling you
the truth.

721
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:15,297
Richard,
please don't kill her.

722
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:16,331
If you still love me--

723
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,933
If you care about
the Midlands--

724
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:22,370
Do it.

725
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:41,089
Kahlan.

726
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,592
Are we in Aydindril?

727
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:47,195
Yes. Yes, we're in Aydindril.

728
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,299
Are you all right?

729
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm fine.

730
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:56,004
I'm so sorry, old friend.

731
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,539
There's no need.

732
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,374
If he's released
from confession,

733
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,810
then we really did kill
two women.

734
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:06,680
Two women who should never have
existed in the first place.

735
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,250
What are you two
talking about?

736
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,684
You really don't remember?

737
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,052
Remember what?

738
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,128
Richard, there are some things
that you told me

739
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,830
that I'm glad
I don't remember.

740
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:26,267
And some that I wish
I did.

741
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:29,470
I have enough memories
for the both of us.

742
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,739
When Zedd
put me back together,

743
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,207
you gave up something too.

744
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,308
Kahlan.

745
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:40,447
If I'd known what happened
to you, I never would've--

746
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,349
I know.

747
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,752
But we did.

748
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,086
And you said it was--

749
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,521
Yes, it was.

750
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,492
But I'd rather have you,
all of you, just the way we are,

751
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,295
than everything else
with someone who's not you.

752
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,632
Richard,
if you hadn't stopped me,

753
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:01,267
I would have executed Zedd.

754
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,435
That wasn't you.

755
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:07,939
Well, at least I get the chance
to make things right here.

756
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,909
You're going to stay?

757
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,745
No.

758
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:15,913
I'm going to reinstate the
Council and send for my sister

759
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:19,317
so Aydindril doesn't have to be
without a Confessor.

760
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:22,652
And if I'm needed,
Alferon has the amulet.

761
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:25,989
You know I'd understand
if you did want to stay.

762
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,795
I'll always be torn.

763
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:35,265
But I can only be in one place
at a time.

764
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:38,135
Right now,
that place is with you.
