00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,670
Richard Cypher,
you are the true seeker.

4
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:58,673
People have tried for years
to find the Forest of the Night Wisp's.

5
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:00,474
Had you come here on your own,

6
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:02,175
they'd have never shown themselves.

7
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,876
They only come out
for those they trust.

8
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,477
I come to ask you for your help.

9
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,578
A dreamcaster sent me a message

10
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,579
that said I'd be the last Confessor.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,080
I need to know

12
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:20,481
if there are any Confessors still alive.

13
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:24,482
Will you help me find them?

14
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:31,883
May the spirits protect you.

15
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,284
You're beautiful.

16
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,585
Are you trying to tell me something?

17
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,288
Who were you talking to?

18
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,889
Myself.

19
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,790
Who else do I have to talk to?

20
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,691
It is late, get some sleep.

21
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:18,892
Father, I'm almost a grown woman.

22
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,893
I can't stay here forever.

23
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,594
I want to travel to distant lands,

24
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,195
and fall in love, and get married.

25
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,496
That will never happen, Annabelle.

26
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:33,898
You're safe here.

27
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,199
That is all that matters.

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
What is it?

29
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,201
The Night Wisp searched everywhere

30
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,902
in the Midlands and beyond
looking for another Confessor.

31
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,703
But they only found one.

32
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:19,904
Only one.

33
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,405
Then who is this other Confessor.

34
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,506
It's strange.

35
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,107
The Night Wisp
didn't know who she was.

36
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:27,508
At least she's still alive.

37
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:28,709
But for how long?

38
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,610
She's in a tower.

39
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,611
in Lonville Castle, in Ausridge.

40
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,912
Sounds like she's a prisoner.

41
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:37,513
We can be there and back
in three days.

42
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:39,614
Ausridge?

43
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,015
I've traveled across the Midlands

44
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,416
with you people for weeks now

45
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,117
because you said you had to get me

46
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,918
and this thing on my hand

47
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,419
to Bemoord to find your
precious Stone of Tears.

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,820
But instead, we're going to Ausridge?

49
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,121
Perhaps before we see
about this Confessor

50
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:56,922
we should get the Stone and
rid ourselves of extraneous cargo.

51
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,923
I'll go and meet with you in Pamorah.

52
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:01,124
You're not going alone.

53
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,025
Zedd

54
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,626
You and Cara can go to Pamorah

55
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,327
Owen, you can come with us.

56
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:06,428
What!

57
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,829
Why?

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
I've been thinking...

59
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,731
we know this Roan has a key

60
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:10,732
but we don't know what it opens

61
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,733
or who or what might try to stop
us from getting it.

62
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,134
You and Cara should find out

63
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:18,135
before we put the rune or Flynn
in harm's way.

64
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,436
We'll meet back here in three days.

65
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:38,637
Thank you, Tharla.

66
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,682
Father.

67
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,285
- Help him.
- It's just a sleeping potion.

68
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,687
I had to set you free,
Annabelle.

69
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:02,688
But...

70
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:04,623
He'll keep you locked
up forever.

71
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,659
We must hurry.
Before his men catch us.

72
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:13,632
You're too late.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,635
The servant Tharla
poisoned his Lordship.

74
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,304
He's dead. She took Annabelle.

75
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:20,639
Took her where?

76
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,340
I don't know.
They rode away,

77
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,976
taking the fastest horses.

78
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,244
Annabelle?
She's a Confessor?

79
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,080
How did you know?

80
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,448
Was she a prisoner here?

81
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,017
She was Lord Callum's daughter.

82
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:34,686
Years ago, Lord Callum

83
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,989
was a powerful
D'Haran commander.

84
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,458
He attacked
a neighboring village.

85
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,195
But the villagers
had the Confessor Josephine

86
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:44,630
on their side.

87
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:47,400
She confessed
Lord Callum in battle.

88
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,273
He was betrothed
to a beautiful duchess,

89
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,942
a woman he'd loved
since childhood.

90
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,177
But once Callum was confessed,

91
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,947
he thought of no one
but Josephine.

92
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:04,083
She took him as her mate.

93
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,318
Soon she was with child.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,922
But the birth was not an easy one.

95
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:16,295
And when she died,

96
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,831
he was released.

97
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:27,239
He suddenly realized
everything he had lost

98
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,207
when he became confessed.

99
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,214
Feed her to the crows.

100
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:37,983
I feared he might
kill the child too,

101
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,885
he was in such rage.

102
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,921
But Lord Callum could not
bring himself to slay

103
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:44,890
his own flesh and blood.

104
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:50,229
He swore that no one would ever
suffer at his daughter's hands

105
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:52,865
as he did at her mother's.

106
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,401
He hid her away
for her whole life

107
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:59,872
in the tallest tower
of the castle.

108
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,042
He never told her
of her powers.

109
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,044
Her curse, as he called it.

110
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,280
We have to find her.

111
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:10,983
They can't have gotten far.

112
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,157
Where are we going?

113
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,159
Someplace safe.

114
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:32,170
Why are we here?

115
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,977
I see you've brought the girl.

116
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:41,346
A hundred gold pieces
was our agreement.

117
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,115
What agreement?

118
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:45,683
What are you doing?

119
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,986
I need proof that she is
what you say she is.

120
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,454
She doesn't know what she is.

121
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:50,989
She's never used her powers.

122
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:52,057
What powers?

123
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:54,360
A demonstration
won't be necessary.

124
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:56,395
I don't have any powers.

125
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:14,111
What are you doing to me?

126
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:26,492
All right, that's enough.

127
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,560
No more until you pay.

128
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,763
Or he kills the girl.

129
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,266
No, no.

130
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,269
I have enough
to see if it's genuine.

131
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:25,283
Master, how can I serve you?

132
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,857
Kill...her.

133
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:33,992
No.

134
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,473
You're going
to be very useful to me.

135
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,975
Let her go!

136
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:52,177
The Seeker.

137
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,545
And the Mother Confessor.

138
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:55,647
Kill him and take her.

139
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:05,556
Hide her.

140
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:10,795
Run!

141
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:16,433
- Run, Annabelle!
- Get her!

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,356
Are you all right?

143
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,058
Where did you come from?

144
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:44,095
Oh, I just wait around in trees
hoping to rescue pretty girls.

145
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:46,464
Think you can stand?

146
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,316
Richard!

147
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:13,224
Are you a prince?

148
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,993
Is it that obvious?

149
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:21,365
Are you all right?

150
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,537
Let them go.
We have to get Annabelle.

151
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,560
Annabelle, no!

152
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,761
Flynn.

153
00:11:57,436 --> 00:12:00,103
Command me, Confessor.

154
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,907
- What's wrong with him?
- He's been confessed.

155
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,243
Not your fault. You don't have
control over your powers yet.

156
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,312
What powers?
You're a Confessor.

157
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,780
Just like I am.

158
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:15,682
Confessor?

159
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,283
When you touch someone
with your powers,

160
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,618
they become enslaved to you.

161
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,687
They lose their free will.

162
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,155
I did that?

163
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:23,523
I enslaved him?

164
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,126
I'm glad you did.

165
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,461
I want to serve you.

166
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,331
How do I take it away?
You can't.

167
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,567
He'll be confessed to you
for the rest of your life.

168
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,804
I didn't know.

169
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:38,972
Your father didn't tell you

170
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,640
because he was afraid
of your powers.

171
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,242
That's why he kept you
locked in a tower.

172
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:43,610
You talked to my father?

173
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,015
I'm so sorry, Annabelle.

174
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,352
Your father is dead.

175
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,554
Dead?

176
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,222
He was poisoned.

177
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,928
Tharla killed him.

178
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:03,963
So she could sell me
to that sorcerer.

179
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,498
He wanted to take your magic.

180
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:06,866
But don't worry.

181
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,301
He won't come near you again.

182
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,437
We're gonna take you to a place
where you can be trained.

183
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,571
- Trained?
- So they can teach you

184
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,872
how to control your magic,

185
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,008
so nothing like this
will ever happen again.

186
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,543
Stop. You're scaring her.

187
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,912
She just found
out her father died.

188
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:21,614
She needs to know
everything's all right.

189
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:26,119
I won't let anything
bad happen to you. Ever.

190
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:32,025
Annabelle, you have a
very rare and special gift.

191
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:36,763
If I can teach you about it,
if you'll come with us...

192
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:40,366
It's all right.

193
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,202
They're good people.

194
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:47,974
I'll go wherever he goes.

195
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,744
Come on.

196
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,920
Excuse me, sir.

197
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,422
Pardon me, madam.

198
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,390
You and your Agiels

199
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,459
don't exactly inspire
a warm welcome.

200
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,661
I've learned it's more useful
to be feared than liked.

201
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:09,829
Excuse me, sir.

202
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,498
- What do you want?
- Could you tell us

203
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,566
where we could find
the Cloister of Pamorah?

204
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,269
In the Sentinel Hills,
east of the city.

205
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:17,670
But I wouldn't go now.

206
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,606
You don't wanna be
on the road after nightfall.

207
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,408
W-Wait, sir, w-why?

208
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:28,281
Thank you for seeing me,
Miss Prioress.

209
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:31,518
Have you seen
this symbol before?

210
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,686
The parchment will
do you no good.

211
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,955
The tomb must
be opened by the one

212
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,557
who bears the rune
on his hand.

213
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,992
What tomb?

214
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:40,493
In times past,

215
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,129
the tomb was the site
of many a pilgrimage.

216
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:46,165
Legend has it the Stone of Tears
was buried there.

217
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,303
Darken Rahl sent his men
to Pamorah to open the tomb.

218
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,505
They tried everything,

219
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,908
but no one
could get inside it.

220
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,843
Without the rune.

221
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:58,244
Rahl believed
the bearer of the rune

222
00:14:58,312 --> 00:14:59,712
would arrive one day,

223
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,551
so he stationed an elite guard
around the tomb.

224
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:08,154
After Rahl fell, the villagers
rose up, and killed them.

225
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:11,124
Every last D'Haran.

226
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:14,260
But they came back
from the dead.

227
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:17,530
Banelings.

228
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,066
That's what everyone around
here is so afraid of.

229
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:23,369
They accepted the Keeper's
twisted bargain.

230
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,605
Killing to stay alive.

231
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,006
They're still waiting

232
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:29,375
for the bearer
of the rune to arrive.

233
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,312
To make sure no one
gets the stone.

234
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,247
Where is this tomb?

235
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,183
In a cemetery, to the south.

236
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,352
But going anywhere
near it means certain death.

237
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:50,029
I wonder where
Flynn's family is?

238
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,231
I never asked him.

239
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,069
It's not your fault
this happened.

240
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,573
We took him with us
because we needed him.

241
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,242
Now he'll spend the rest
of his life desperately longing

242
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,079
for someone he'll
never see again.

243
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:08,982
Well, maybe after Pamorah...

244
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,250
No.

245
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,586
No.

246
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,922
Flynn will be a distraction.

247
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,695
My whole life
I wanted to see the world.

248
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,398
And now that I'm out here,

249
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,934
I don't understand any of it.

250
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:30,336
I'll teach you.

251
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,579
Kahlan says I have
to go to a place

252
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,114
called Aydindril to be trained.

253
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,516
- I'll come with you.
- She says you can't.

254
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,284
That you have something
more important to do

255
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,887
in Pamorah with Richard.

256
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,689
I don't want to go
anywhere without you.

257
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,592
Then you'll get your wish.

258
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,528
How?

259
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:59,098
It's late.

260
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,001
We all need some sleep.

261
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,736
My mistress is cold.

262
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,872
I'm gonna get some more wood
for the fire.

263
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,811
Maybe Flynn and I can get married.

264
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:15,248
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

265
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:18,151
That isn't going to happen.

266
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,086
But he loves me.

267
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:21,654
And I love him.

268
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:22,955
And in the books I've read...

269
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:26,192
It isn't the same with Confessors.

270
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,194
We serve a higher purpose.

271
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:32,799
But our gift makes the kind
of romance you've read about...

272
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,901
...impossible.

273
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,769
So you can't get married?

274
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,471
A Confessor takes a mate,

275
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:41,674
but not for love.

276
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:43,876
To continue our line.

277
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:48,281
And there aren't
very many of us left.

278
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,917
I think you and I may be
the only ones.

279
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:54,921
So one day, when you're ready,
you'll take a suitable mate.

280
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:57,056
What makes a mate suitable?

281
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:01,527
Well, uh, he should be

282
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:05,398
strong, noble and brave.

283
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,102
A leader.

284
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:11,337
So Richard's your mate, then?

285
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,407
No.

286
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:17,343
I love Richard,
but if he and I

287
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,712
were to be together
in that way,

288
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,514
he would become confessed.

289
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,449
But he already loves you.

290
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:26,986
Richard has an important mission
only he can carry out.

291
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,857
If he were confessed,

292
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:35,361
his love for me would be
all-consuming.

293
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,364
It would distract him so much
he would go mad.

294
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:40,867
And he couldn't
complete his quest.

295
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,369
So you can never
be with someone you love?

296
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,574
Once you start your training

297
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,376
and see how
important our work is,

298
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,844
you'll understand
that it makes up

299
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:53,780
for the things we can't have.

300
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:56,616
The sorcerer's men!

301
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:57,884
They're coming!

302
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:00,186
Keep her safe!

303
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,790
Come on.

304
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:05,124
What are you doing?

305
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,893
Granting your wish.

306
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:13,766
There's no one here.

307
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,635
Flynn.

308
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:22,742
They're gone.

309
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,210
And so are the horses.

310
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:34,954
You're bleeding.

311
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,722
I had to make it look real.

312
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,558
I fooled them
so that we could get away.

313
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,959
Isn't that what you wanted?

314
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,364
Does it hurt?

315
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:48,334
For you, nothing hurts.

316
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,367
When I was in the tower,

317
00:19:57,435 --> 00:20:00,670
the servants used to secretly
bring me books to read.

318
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:03,673
Have you ever heard the story
of Rosalind and Palomar?

319
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,842
Yeah, everybody knows that story.

320
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,511
She saved him from the dragon.

321
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,980
And then they sail away
on the ocean together.

322
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:14,617
You remind me of Palomar.

323
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,586
At least the way I imagined him.

324
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:18,288
I'd save you from a dragon.

325
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,324
Would you take me
to see the ocean?

326
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,662
I'd take you anywhere.

327
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:30,900
What?

328
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,439
This rune is the key
to finding the Stone of Tears.

329
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,274
Unless Richard has it,

330
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,343
the Keeper will destroy all life.

331
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,778
Including yours.

332
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,646
Maybe we should go back.

333
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:46,416
How do you know
what they told you is true?

334
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,285
My father told me there
was nothing but war

335
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:50,653
and wickedness in this world.

336
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:53,490
That was a lie.

337
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:55,859
You're proof of that.

338
00:20:57,895 --> 00:21:00,196
And even if what
they're saying is true,

339
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,365
I'd rather die with you

340
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:07,036
than be locked
in another tower without you.

341
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,446
I should've separated
them right away.

342
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,715
He was comforting a scared girl.
It would have been cruel.

343
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,283
She would have been safe.

344
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:21,885
We'll find them.

345
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,854
Look.
The tracks split.

346
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,323
One horse went north.
The other east.

347
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,392
He was trying to make it harder
for us to follow him.

348
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,528
- Clever.
- Not clever enough.

349
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:33,496
These tracks are deeper.

350
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,498
The horse that went that way
wasn't carrying any weight.

351
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,871
Hungry?

352
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,540
Wait here.

353
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:58,822
You know what we do
with thieves around here?

354
00:21:58,889 --> 00:21:59,956
Show them mercy?

355
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,260
Flynn!

356
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:10,033
Well. Two thieves.

357
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,368
Maybe you've got something
to bargain with.

358
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,737
Stay away from her.

359
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,454
Command me, Confessor.

360
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,922
Hey!

361
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,292
Stop them.

362
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:05,188
The only way to kill banelings
is to burn them.

363
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,623
We'll need oil and torches.

364
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,692
Why not just use Wizard's Fire?

365
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,494
I don't think
that would be wise.

366
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:16,032
It's because I'm a Mord-Sith,
isn't it?

367
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,635
You think if you
use your magic,

368
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,136
I'll turn it against you.

369
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:23,206
I've had chances before.

370
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,642
With the Seeker
and Confessor nearby.

371
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:27,810
And now you know
where the tomb is.

372
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:30,280
Do you honestly think that's why

373
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:32,682
I've followed Richard
all this way?

374
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,918
In the hopes
that he'd send me here

375
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:37,887
with you alone
so that I could find a way

376
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:40,590
to steal the stone for myself?

377
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,225
Probably not.

378
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,294
But what's at stake
is far too important

379
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:46,696
to rely on probability.

380
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:49,499
I don't believe you have
the luxury of caution.

381
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,409
Get them!

382
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,102
I think that's all of them.

383
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:30,473
For now.
But this is a place of death.

384
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:34,177
Others may crawl out
of the earth to replace them.

385
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,749
We should get
Flynn back here

386
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:41,851
with the rune
as quickly as we can.

387
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,419
We?

388
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,754
Are you sure
you can trust me?

389
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:47,390
No. But I don't have
the luxury of caution.

390
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,070
Flynn. Annabelle.

391
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,906
I know this is hard for you,
but we have to get moving.

392
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,308
We've lost enough time as it is.

393
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,712
If you don't leave,

394
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,147
my friends
will make you leave.

395
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,324
Richard, they're all confessed.

396
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:22,959
Let's go.

397
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:38,775
What's wrong?

398
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:41,177
I know Richard and Kahlan.

399
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:44,781
Sooner or later, they'll catch us.

400
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,594
Kahlan!

401
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:15,478
No!

402
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,789
Richard!

403
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,461
Richard?

404
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:34,697
Richard.

405
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,678
Mistress...

406
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:52,982
...how can I serve you?

407
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,701
Are you hurt?

408
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,837
I'm fine. Let's go.

409
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,039
I'll come with you, Mistress.

410
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:08,309
Everything he does
is to save lives.

411
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,578
He saved yours.

412
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,714
And you've destroyed him.

413
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,583
I'm sorry, Kahlan.

414
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,118
But you didn't leave me a choice.

415
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,588
And you leave me no choice.

416
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,494
- I won't let you kill her.
- Kill me?

417
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,529
It's the only way to release me
from Confession.

418
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:30,030
But don't worry Mistress.
I'll protect you.

419
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,465
Richard, I don't want
to fight you.

420
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,501
Then put down your weapon.

421
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,377
I'll get the horse.

422
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,848
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

423
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,949
Let him go.

424
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,384
You will order
both of these men

425
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:52,386
to come with me
to Pamorah right now,

426
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:53,854
or I will kill him.

427
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,690
You wouldn't hurt him. You need
the rune on his hand.

428
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,958
I need him in Pamorah.

429
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,194
If he doesn't go,
he's of no use to me.

430
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:06,200
If we go with you
and Flynn gets you your stone,

431
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,769
will you let us be together?

432
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,304
You have my word.

433
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,906
It's a trap.

434
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,908
She'll try to kill you
the first chance she gets.

435
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,811
Richard, I know you're confessed
to her, but you know me.

436
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,847
I'm not a liar.

437
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,552
No, she isn't.

438
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,690
Put your sword down.

439
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,425
We're going with her.

440
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,470
She said she'd order Flynn

441
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,206
to go to Pamorah with us
if I let them live.

442
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,473
And you agreed to that?

443
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,576
I had to.

444
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,878
Either Richard
was going to kill me,

445
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,379
or I was gonna kill him.

446
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,350
I needed Zedd.

447
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,593
No!

448
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,728
Flynn!

449
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,530
You promised!
You lied to me!

450
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:10,931
I had to!

451
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,634
If the Keeper wins,
everyone will die!

452
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:16,203
I need the Seeker to fight him

453
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,771
and seal the rift
in the Underworld.

454
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,609
I need you to be you, Richard!

455
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:27,047
- Annabelle!
- No! Don't kill her. I love her!

456
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,454
I love her as much
as I ever loved you.

457
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,226
I know you, Kahlan.

458
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:42,263
You don't want to murder
the last Confessor.

459
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,566
I never asked to be a Confessor.

460
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,501
I never asked
to be locked in a tower.

461
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,105
I just want to be
like everyone else.

462
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,108
If there was any other way...

463
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,276
Maybe there is.

464
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,512
The sorcerer's quillion.

465
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:03,017
If we can get it we can use it
to drain Annabelle's powers.

466
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,985
Would Richard and Flynn
be released?

467
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,720
I doubt it's ever been tried.

468
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,323
But in theory,
they shouldn't be bound by magic

469
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,226
she herself no longer possesses.

470
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,961
Kahlan, if you love me you'll
give it a try.

471
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,697
He's only saying that
because he's been confessed.

472
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:22,937
Confessed or not,

473
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,239
Richard would do anything
to save a life.

474
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:27,741
We have to get the stone first.

475
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,643
And then we'll go
to the sorcerer's cave

476
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,613
and get his quillion.

477
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,715
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

478
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:38,252
You want us to risk everything...

479
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,055
Our lives, Richard's life.
...to save her?

480
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:44,024
If you don't have the stomach
to kill her, I will.

481
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,796
I seem to remember Richard
going to great lengths

482
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:50,698
to save your life.

483
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,771
And if it doesn't release him?

484
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,307
Then I'll do what needs
to be done.

485
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,591
It's another locket.

486
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,027
Maybe there'
another rune inside it.

487
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,530
Or maybe it holds
the Stone of Tears.

488
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,198
The Seeker should be
the one to open it.

489
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,267
When he's released
from confession.

490
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,669
Not when he's
this unpredictable.

491
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:04,671
You got what you came for.

492
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:05,939
We need to go after
the quillion.

493
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:09,443
He can still fight.

494
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,278
He'd do anything
to save her life.

495
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,948
We both know Richard
can't be relied upon right now.

496
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,656
Then Cara and I will
just have to take care

497
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:24,024
of the sorcerer ourselves.

498
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,805
Are you sure?

499
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,240
Any sorcerer as powerful as Lorcus

500
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,109
is going to be able
to see right through us

501
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,477
if we aren't convincing.

502
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,678
If you insist.

503
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:48,916
This will hurt.

504
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,617
Just do it.

505
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,307
I have something the sorcerer

506
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,576
would be very interested in.

507
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,249
Surrender your weapon.

508
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:17,484
Go ahead. Take it.

509
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:18,752
I know the power of the Agiel.

510
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,255
Lay it down yourself.

511
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,259
And the other one.

512
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:31,932
Now summon your sorcerer,

513
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,868
or I take
my merchandise elsewhere.

514
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,237
And what would
a Mord-Sith expect in return

515
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,339
for her "merchandise?"

516
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:42,242
A thousand gold pieces.

517
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,912
Why would I pay such a price?

518
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:48,215
Rumor has it you're in
the market for Confessor power.

519
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:51,151
This is the Mother Confessor.

520
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,620
I sincerely doubt you'd
be made a better offer.

521
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,689
She's no use to me dead.

522
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,324
She's not dead.

523
00:33:57,392 --> 00:34:00,894
Just compliant.

524
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,434
How do I know that?

525
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:09,169
Examine her yourself.

526
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,754
Command me, Confessor.

527
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:31,758
Call off your guards.

528
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:33,560
Stop!

529
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:34,795
Don't harm them.

530
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:39,366
Give me the quillion.

531
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,801
You spared my life

532
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:44,238
even when your friends
told you not to.

533
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,807
You can thank me if this works.

534
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:49,276
If it does,
you'll be the last Confessor.

535
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:53,480
You'll have to take a mate.

536
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,816
Yes.

537
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:57,284
Someday I will.

538
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,152
Richard would make a good father

539
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,221
for a Confessor, wouldn't he?

540
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,489
Annabelle...

541
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,458
If he's confessed to me,

542
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:06,760
you can't hurt him.

543
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:09,496
And he could give you a child.

544
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:13,066
And then when you take my magic
he'll be released, won't he?

545
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:16,837
Yes, but,
that isn't the way that...

546
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:18,605
Kahlan.

547
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:23,310
Maybe you should consider
what she is suggesting.

548
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,245
If something were
to happen to you,

549
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:29,449
then the race of Confessors
would be no longer.

550
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:32,986
I want to do something for you

551
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:35,989
while I'm still a Confessor.

552
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:37,524
Please.

553
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:44,731
But I don't love her.
I love you.

554
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:47,134
This will make me very happy.

555
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:49,569
Go to her.

556
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:52,239
And love her
as you would love me.

557
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:36,083
Kahlan.

558
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,018
It's all right.

559
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:40,620
It's all right.

560
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,149
Richard. Richard.

561
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,317
What are you thinking about?

562
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,321
Pleasing you.

563
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,527
Because your mistress
ordered you to?

564
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,564
Yes.

565
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,106
You really love her, don't you?

566
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,977
With all my heart.

567
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,258
Did I do something wrong?

568
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,960
No.

569
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,194
You didn't do anything wrong.

570
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:19,930
But my mistress
commanded me to...

571
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,498
I know.

572
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,746
I guess I wouldn't want to give
myself to Flynn like that

573
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,948
if he was thinking
about somebody else.

574
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,785
It isn't just that.

575
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,587
Richard would never use magic

576
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,990
to force someone
to act against their will.

577
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,926
But it's not really
against his will.

578
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,195
If he wasn't confessed,
he would want to.

579
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:55,165
But he is confessed.

580
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,669
And I'm not prepared
to make that decision for him.

581
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,704
Or to make him a father
without his blessing.

582
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,441
But for Confessors...

583
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,644
Isn't it always like that?

584
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,347
That's why we don't take men
we love as mates.

585
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,588
It's kind of like being locked
in a tower, isn't it?

586
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,361
We should get started.

587
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,065
If this works,

588
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,768
I can get married one day.

589
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,369
I hope you will.

590
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,573
But Flynn won't love me anymore.

591
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:40,110
He's just the first one you met.
There will be other men.

592
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,845
But what if he's the only one
that I'll ever love?

593
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,858
Annabelle, are you all right?

594
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,994
It didn't work.

595
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,096
I'm not confessed anymore.

596
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,564
I was just making sure
she was all right.

597
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,032
Richard?

598
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,254
We'll see you safely hom

599
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,524
Your father's castle
is rightfully yours now.

600
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,026
Thank you, but, uh,

601
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,594
I think I've spent enough
of my life there.

602
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,363
I want to see the world.

603
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,698
Where we're going won't be safe.

604
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,166
I'll go myself.

605
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,035
I've always wanted
to see the ocean.

606
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,170
I don't think it's safe for you
to travel alone.

607
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,140
I'll take her.

608
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,777
I mean, um, I'm headed
toward Wynnmore anyway.

609
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,946
I... I have
a cousin there.

610
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,547
It's near the ocean.

611
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,051
What?
You don't need me anymore.

612
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,620
So you can come along,
if you want to.

613
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,226
Well, I can't say
it's been fun,

614
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,262
but it's been interesting.

615
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,682
It's only me now.

616
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,351
No.

617
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,986
You got us.

618
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,591
Kahlan,

619
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,894
I can understand why you
couldn't go through with it.

620
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,598
But part of me wishes you had.

621
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,269
Me too.

622
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,641
And now that
we have our Seeker back...

623
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,045
It's time to open this.

624
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,758
Is it the Stone of Tears?

625
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,726
No. I think it's a compass.

626
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,601
"This orb will guide
the Seeker's way."

627
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,369
To what?

628
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,675
Hopefully the Stone of Tears.

629
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,377
Let's not waste time, then.

630
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,747
We head north.

631
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:40,584
