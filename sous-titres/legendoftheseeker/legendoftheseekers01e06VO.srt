1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,386
How was that?

2
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,915
Let's try something
a bit more challenging, shall we?

3
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:25,949
Try now.

4
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,023
You told me I have this destiny
to save the world from Darken Rahl,

5
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:36,588
and that his soldiers are out there,
trying to kill me.

6
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:40,711
But instead of looking for him,
I'm slicing fruit for your breakfast.

7
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,136
Rahl and his minions
live in the shadows.

8
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,544
Some even oak themselves
in black magic.

9
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,464
By the time you lay eyes on them.

10
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:52,802
Begin.

11
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,399
- What are you doing?
- Following my instincts?

12
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,234
You're guessing.

13
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,071
Lesson number four, Seeker.

14
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:15,908
"To see that which is not there,
gaze upon what is."

15
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:19,532
You must learn to perceive the world
as no one else can.

16
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:20,846
Again.

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,772
It worked.

18
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,256
Don't be too impressed
with yourself.

19
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:02,892
Your enemies will be
far more devious than a melon.

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,976
- I'm sorry.
- What are you...?

21
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:40,821
I didn't know you were there.

22
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,496
- Someone's stealing our horses!
- What?

23
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:44,967
The horses!

24
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,767
Sync: dmbmh & Kasius

25
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,681
1x06 - <i>Elixir</i>

26
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,098
A highwayman makes off
with our horses,

27
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:52,922
- right under the nose of the Seeker!
- I was distracted.

28
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:56,663
What on the Prophet's good earth
could have distracted you?

29
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,781
He was just a boy.
Couldn't have been any older than 16.

30
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,426
- Was I supposed to kill him?
- "Where there is no way,

31
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:07,412
"the Seeker will find a path."
Lesson number four.

32
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:11,292
- You said the last one was number four.
- Number five, then!

33
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,610
- Are you making these up?
- Which way did he go?

34
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,030
Southeast.

35
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,092
He's riding for Drundril.

36
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,182
Perhaps someone there
will be kind enough

37
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,668
to sell us back our horses.

38
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,794
Kahlan, about back at the river.

39
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,904
I didn't see anything.

40
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,291
You should never lie to a Confessor.

41
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Back so soon?

42
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,118
How much for the horses?

43
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,211
One vial.

44
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,472
- That's all?
- You want it or not?

45
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:21,593
A pleasure doing business.

46
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,066
Miranda.

47
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:31,716
Hi.

48
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,593
Stay away from me.

49
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,081
- So any idea? Any idea at all?
- Take a look around.

50
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,870
This town is filled
with thieves and cheats.

51
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,712
There are dozens of boys
who could've stolen your horses.

52
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,432
My compliments.

53
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,843
Looks like you could use it.

54
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,387
Thanks.

55
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,536
- I hope you had better luck than I did.
- No one admits to knowing anything.

56
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,931
Maybe you should just confess them all
to find out if anyone's lying.

57
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,929
You can do that?

58
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,812
I think I know
where to find our horse thief.

59
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:10,086
- How do you know where we're going?
- Don't know. Just got this feeling.

60
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,387
It's this way.

61
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:15,179
- Something you've been teaching him?
- No, I can't take credit for this.

62
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,349
There hasn't been a true Seeker
in a thousand years.

63
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,980
We may not know
what Richard's full potential is.

64
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:24,928
That's him.

65
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:29,572
Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick
to dismiss your instincts.

66
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:38,039
Tell us where the horses are.

67
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,005
I don't have them anymore.
But I can tell you who does for 10...

68
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,049
No, 20 pieces of gold.

69
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,887
All I have is one piece of steel.

70
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:54,301
Now tell me where they are.

71
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,307
I can't. The peddlers will kill me.

72
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:57,804
What peddlers?

73
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,779
Perhaps the gentle touch
of a Confessor will

74
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,732
- convince you to be more cooperative.
- All right.

75
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,917
I'll take you to them.

76
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:12,161
I need something
to give me luck at the table.

77
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,294
I can't make you lucky,

78
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,442
but I can give you this.

79
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:21,238
You'll be able to see
right through your opponents' cards.

80
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:22,772
Sir.

81
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:25,835
I believe you have some horses

82
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,391
that were stolen from us.
We want them back.

83
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,310
You mean the horses he traded me?

84
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,559
We didn't come here to fight.
We just want what belongs to us.

85
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:40,990
Get rid of them.

86
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:55,615
You!

87
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,091
You brought these people here!

88
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,201
Stop.

89
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:40,302
I'm warning you.

90
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:48,961
He's a wizard!

91
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,067
Are you all right?

92
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,302
Hello again.

93
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:08,898
I see you found the boy
you were looking for.

94
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,865
- Glad I could be of service.
- What?

95
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,142
- What do you mean?
- The pint you drank.

96
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,657
I mixed in something magical.

97
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:18,426
An elixir.

98
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,410
Helps you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

99
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,615
You put something in my drink?

100
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,684
You didn't really think you had
some kind of special power, did you?

101
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:30,545
I have more of that potion.

102
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,864
Others too.

103
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,005
If you're interested,

104
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,570
you know where to find me.

105
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,684
- Something wrong?
- I'm fine.

106
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:45,614
Gentlemen.

107
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,102
Vhis is my store.
If you need supplies...

108
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,050
We have to be on our way.

109
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,276
I saw your blade.

110
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:59,214
The markings.

111
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,984
It's the Sword of Truth, isn't it?

112
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:07,675
It is.

113
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,901
You're the Seeker.

114
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:15,631
You can save this town from the men
who are trying to destroy it.

115
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,233
There's another wizard
in the village.

116
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,293
Another wizard.

117
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,685
It'll be good to have some company.

118
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,125
Bring him to me.

119
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:59,198
The Prophecy said that the Seeker
would one day return,

120
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,465
and lift the shroud of darkness
from our lives...

121
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,352
But most people thought
it was just legend.

122
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:07,557
But here you are,

123
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,246
ready to...

124
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,906
To save our village
from these magic peddlers.

125
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,824
They sell magic?

126
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,164
They're on every street corner,

127
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,295
in the tavern...
Seems like

128
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:22,740
everybody in the village
is buying their potions.

129
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:26,762
I've lost most of my customers.

130
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:30,373
Farmers are not sowing their fields,

131
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:33,915
children are
being left to go hungry.

132
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,121
- That boy I saw you with, Jack...
- What about him?

133
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:42,032
He was a fine young man

134
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:45,133
until his parents traded
everything they had for magic.

135
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,724
Even their home.

136
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,401
He was left to fend for himself.

137
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,937
What kind of potions
are these peddlers selling?

138
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:55,036
The kind

139
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:58,289
that give ordinary folk powers
they shouldn't have.

140
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,030
Curses, hexes,

141
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,391
spells of every kind.

142
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:05,951
These peddlers,

143
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,882
they're not wizards or sorcerers.

144
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:12,206
Where does the magic
they sell come from?

145
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,546
Couldn't say.

146
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,587
One day, they were just here.

147
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:23,760
Drundril was a good place to live
before they came.

148
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,580
And now that the Seeker is here,

149
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,060
it can be good again.

150
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,519
I want to help these people,

151
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,825
but my mission
is to fight Darken Rahl.

152
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,575
Rahl isn't the only evil
in the Midlands.

153
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,267
He has his sympathizers
and collaborators.

154
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:55,449
It's the Seeker's duty
to fight them wherever he can.

155
00:13:55,574 --> 00:13:56,574
Remember:

156
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,336
"Before chopping off the head,
make certain the body is dead,

157
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,179
- "lest the head grow back."
- What lesson is that?

158
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,727
No lesson. Just something
I learned in a cookbook.

159
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,014
My Lady.

160
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,389
It's all right.

161
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,477
Theodoro Rymus,

162
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:13,643
at your service.

163
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,176
I've chased away the men
who were threatening you.

164
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,163
Is there anything more
I can do to please you?

165
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,327
There is.
The potions you sell.

166
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,159
- Where do they come from?
- The old prophets' temple.

167
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,205
- Two leagues north of here.
- We'll need our horses back.

168
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:38,279
- I sold them to a trader.
- You what?

170
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,420
He left town this morning.

171
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,528
- But I can take you to the temple.
- That's not necessary.

172
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,301
You can draw us a map.
Then, Theodoro,

173
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,722
- I want you to leave this village.
- Leave?

174
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,307
We can't just let him go.

175
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,561
Leave this village
and take up honest work.

176
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,325
Do you understand me?

177
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,752
As you wish.

178
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,498
That magic peddler, Rymus.
What did Kahlan do to him?

179
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,776
Now you know
why she's called a "Confessor".

180
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,739
With a single touch,
Kahlan can bend anyone to her will.

181
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,797
She can make a person tell the truth,
that's the "confessor" part.

182
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,300
Or she can compel him
to do unimaginable things.

183
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:32,755
I saw her do it{\* back} in Hartland. She made
a D'Haran soldier kill his comrades.

184
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:36,475
I didn't understand what was happening.
But why did Rymus come back?

185
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,187
And the way he was looking at her...

186
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,814
It one of the repercussions
of Kahlan's powers.

187
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,528
The confessed

188
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,007
falls in love with the woman
who confessed him.

189
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,277
In love?

190
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:52,836
- I don't understand.
- It's complicated.

191
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,403
I'd like to know.

192
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,330
It's something
that's not easy for Kahlan.

193
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:00,641
It's a heavy burden she carries.
It's not for me to talk about.

194
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,546
Maybe she'll tell you...
I didn't mean now!

195
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,489
- What if he wakes up?
- As long as he's wearing this,

196
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:54,219
he won't be able to use his magic.

197
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,713
He's gone.

198
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:30,975
We have to find him.

199
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,275
Peddlers.

200
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:40,062
We know where their temple is.

201
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,811
Maybe this is the wrong place.

202
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:59,661
- Maybe Rymus lied to you.
- That's not possible.

203
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:04,588
Well, what?

204
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:05,963
They've moved?

205
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,712
But where?

206
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,774
Jeziah?

207
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,099
Zeddicus, old friend.

208
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,645
Forgive me.
I hope my men didn't hurt you.

209
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,223
My companions.

210
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,349
They weren't harmed.

211
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,323
If this is
how you greet an old friend,

212
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,015
I'm glad we didn't part
on worse terms.

213
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:41,133
When I heard there was a wizard{\* in the village},
I assumed he was working for Rahl.

214
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,601
If I'd known it was you, I would've
invited you for roasted partridge

215
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,307
instead of having you abducted.

216
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:48,947
Why would you assume
I worked for that tyrant?

217
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,705
The Midlands have changed
since you disappeared, Zeddicus.

218
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:55,576
Sorcers and dark wizards
are everywhere,

219
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,254
ready to do the biding
of whoever pays the most.

220
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:01,702
I have so much to tell you.

221
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:03,834
But first...

222
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,901
Where have you been all these years?

223
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:11,872
No tracks.

224
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:13,164
Anywhere.

225
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:16,196
They must've used a spell
to cloak their trail.

226
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:20,139
You shouldn't have let Rymus go.
He could've helped us find Zedd.

227
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:23,514
What?

228
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:29,946
When I confess someone,

229
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,921
they lose their free will.

230
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:35,324
They become...

231
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,762
like a slave.

232
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,732
I{\ don't believe i}t's not right
to continue forcing them

233
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,848
to do my bidding
any longer than I have to.

234
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,766
- Even someone like Rymus?
- People deserve a chance to change.

235
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,230
To become better
than what the world made them.

236
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,973
Your instinct as a Seeker.
It led you to the boy.

237
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,595
You could use it to find Zedd.

238
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:04,159
It wasn't any "Seeker instinct".

239
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,781
But you found Jack.

240
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:11,338
The barmaid at the tavern
slipped something in my drink.

241
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,461
- One of those potions.
- What?

242
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,380
That's how I found Jack.
It had nothing to do with me.

243
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,261
But it did work.

244
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,347
I could go back and get more.

245
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,952
Magic is not meant
to be used in that way.

246
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,810
You use magic.
You confessed Rymus.

247
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,299
I was born with this power.

248
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:35,691
- I didn't buy it in a tavern.
- What's the difference?

249
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,424
You've seen
what these potions can do.

250
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,956
- What happened to the village, to Jack.
- I know you wanna protect me

251
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:44,821
- cause I'm the Seeker, but...
- It's not just because {\you're the Seeker}of that.

252
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,010
Richard, I...

253
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,789
Seeker!

254
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,261
You gotta come right away!

255
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,021
Jack's in trouble!

256
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:03,125
We crossed the Boundary
two months ago,

257
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,066
and we've been on the road
since then.

258
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:08,348
And this young man
you're traveling with,

259
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,660
you really believe
he's the true Seeker?

260
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,061
He has a lot to learn, but...

261
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,150
He is the genuine article.

262
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:21,864
And take it from one who knows,

263
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,365
he could have no better teacher
than you, Zeddicus.

264
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:28,172
The people of the Midlands
have new reason to hope.

265
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,680
Dare I ask, what you were
planning to do with me

266
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:34,117
in the event
that I wasn't your old friend?

267
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,136
Let me show you.

268
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,572
A quillion?

269
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,512
- Where did you...?
- It wasn't easy to come by.

270
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:04,429
If you had been one of Rahl's wizards,
I would've used it to absorb your magic,

271
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,918
and distill it

272
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:08,552
into this.

273
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:15,681
You're making the magic that's being
peddled on the streets of Drundril.

274
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,628
Why?

275
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,228
The sale of these potions
will allow me to raise a militia.

276
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,976
An army of the Midlands.

277
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,450
A force powerful enough
to fight Rahl and his followers.

278
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:29,513
Jeziah.

279
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:33,142
I want to defeat Darken Rahl too.

280
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:37,146
But selling magic? It goes
against everything we believe in.

281
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,204
Everything I taught you.

282
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:41,855
Those teachings are
from another era, old friend.

283
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,377
Rahl isn't playing by any rules.

284
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:49,134
And that justifies
exploiting these villagers?

285
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,506
Their lives are dreary.

286
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,881
They're suffocating
under Rahl's edicts.

287
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:55,873
The magic gives them an escape.

288
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:57,819
Magic is...

289
00:22:58,496 --> 00:22:59,496
rare.

290
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:00,962
It's special.

291
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,049
You can't just sell it on the streets
to anyone for a few copper coins.

292
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:09,012
In the wrong hands, it ruins lives.
It kills!

293
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,212
One village is a small price to pay
if we can save the rest of the Midlands.

294
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:18,771
You've forgotten more
about magic than I'll ever know.

295
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:20,578
If we work together,

296
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:24,060
we can find other wizards
and sorcerers working for Rahl.

297
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:27,322
Drain them of their magic.
Create a me powerful army!

298
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:31,576
- You expect me to help you?
- Hear me out.

299
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,836
I've heard more than enough!

300
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:39,922
Tell them to move.

301
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:49,504
What are you doing?

302
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,526
I'm sorry, old friend.
My work is too important.

303
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:03,176
I paid Rymus before you
and your mates drove him off.

304
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,900
Now, I want my money,

305
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,249
or the potion I paid for.

306
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:10,792
I don't have either!

307
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,620
I'm gonna have
to take it out on your hide.

308
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,914
Leave the boy alone.

309
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,640
This ain't your village.

310
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:25,505
Who are you to interfere?

311
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,051
Get out of here, now!

312
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,645
- Take care of him. I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

313
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:43,334
This is getting worse.

314
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,942
And we need to find Zedd.
Who knows what's happening to him?

315
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,165
This is not the way.
You can't keep using these potions.

316
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:51,726
I don't want to do it, either.

317
00:24:52,414 --> 00:24:55,076
But I don't have any other idea.
Do you?

318
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:04,003
I knew you'd be back.

319
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,452
It's that pretty girl
you were with, isn't it?

320
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:09,754
I saw the way
you were looking at her.

321
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:13,830
I have something that will make you
irresistible to her.

322
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,814
No, I want what you gave me before.

323
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,642
How much can you pay?

324
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,266
I don't have any money.

325
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,410
Then I'm sorry, I can't help you.

326
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,273
My friend is in a lot trouble.

327
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:28,643
There must be something I can trade.

328
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,483
That's an interesting pendant.

329
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,447
This? My father gave this to me.

330
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:37,880
- It's all I have left of him.
- Must be valuable.

331
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,622
Only to me. There must be
something else I can give, please!

332
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,788
You have nothing else I want.

333
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:51,988
Fine.

334
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:16,317
What did you see?

335
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,680
My friend... he's hurt.

336
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:21,395
He was underground,
are there caves near here?

337
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,544
Dozens of them, south of the gully.

338
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:26,417
- How do I know which one?
- The potion will lead you.

339
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:28,793
But it won't last,
you'd better hurry.

340
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,567
This is your fault,
you and your friends.

341
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:41,306
I guess you should've stolen
someone else's horses.

342
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,231
I needed them.

343
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,961
To buy magic.

344
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,806
What did you use it for?

345
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:49,298
A girl.

346
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,983
- A girl?
- Yeah.

347
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,689
Tell me about her.

348
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,575
Her name's Miranda.

349
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,423
She works at the flower stand.

350
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:01,092
Prettiest in the whole town.

351
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,604
But she won't even look at me,
unless I use the potion.

352
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:09,551
- Have you tried talking to her?
- I don't know what to say.

353
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:11,712
I can't even think
when I'm around her.

354
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,765
Of course.

355
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,010
You could confess Miranda.
Make her like me.

356
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:21,419
Not just for a few minutes,
but all the time.

357
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:23,765
I could never use
my power in that way, Jack.

358
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,004
Love is a choice we make.

359
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,978
If you take away that choice,

360
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,842
it's not really love, is it?

361
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,767
Someone loving you,

362
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:38,216
wanting to be with you,
because you forced them?

363
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:41,595
Trust me,

364
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,422
it won't make you happy.

365
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,835
I can find Zedd,
but we have to go now.

366
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,638
One word from me and my little friend
will make a meal out of you.

367
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,974
Cut me loose and I'll tell him
to let you go.

368
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,735
The quillion will absorb
all of your power in a matter of hours.

369
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,826
Then not even the rats
will follow you.

370
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,822
But it doesn't have to be this way.

371
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,687
Where is your militia, Jeziah?

372
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,291
All I see are thugs and thieves.

373
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,645
Are they going to be the generals

374
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,842
in your army of the Midlands?

375
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,232
If you want to fight Rahl,
you could be out there doing it now,

376
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:25,763
but you're not, are you?

377
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,072
I need time and money
to build an army.

378
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,410
How much more do you need?

379
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,895
The villagers have given you
everything they own.

380
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:38,149
Are you sure you're not
just making yourself rich?

381
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,362
Using magic to acquire
power over others?

382
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:44,110
Do not judge me, Zeddicus.

383
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:47,175
You of all people have no right.
You ran away at the moment

384
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,286
- you were needed most.
- I left to protect the Seeker!

385
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,957
Are you sure you weren't really
protecting yourself?

386
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:57,552
Using magic for your own gain.

387
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,607
You say you want to destroy Rahl?

388
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,758
You're just like him.

389
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,501
And you're just an old fool.

390
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Here.

391
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:26,896
- Are you angry with me?
- I'm not angry.

392
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,115
Your forehead wrinkles
when you're upset.

393
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:32,598
I'm not upset.

394
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:34,534
I'm...

395
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,117
You all right?

396
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:51,515
Maybe I shouldn't gone for the potion.
But you have to admit, it's working.

397
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,497
When you've a problem that can't solve
with magic, what will you do then?

398
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,398
Richard!

399
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,388
- I will protect you
- I told you to leave.

400
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:05,944
You told me to leave the village.
And I did.

401
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:08,561
But I love you too much
to be out of your sight.

402
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,536
I won't leave you again, my lady.

403
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,060
Richard.

404
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:34,349
Richard, don't hurt him.

405
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:37,930
- He tried to kill me.
- He thought he was protecting me.

406
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,189
I'm prepared to die for her.
Are you?

407
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:42,525
He can't help it.

408
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,819
He's not in control of his feelings.

409
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,972
We have to find Zedd.

410
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,006
Which way?

411
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:57,268
I don't know.

412
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:01,766
The potion,

413
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:05,086
I think it's wearing off.

414
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:08,068
Pack everything.

415
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:11,104
We're leaving as soon as the quillion
has done its work.

416
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,843
Why? No one can find us here.

417
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,376
He's traveling with the Seeker.

418
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:20,376
Do you want me to kill him?

419
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,713
I don't know which is more merciful.

420
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,150
To kill him,

421
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:29,800
or force him to live
without his powers.

422
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,453
This is his fault.
If he hadn't delayed us.

423
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,908
You worked for them,
you know where their cave is?

424
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,860
I only knew about the temple.

425
00:32:43,358 --> 00:32:45,459
- Where are you going?
- Back to the tavern.

426
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,545
You can do it without the potion.
You're the Seeker.

427
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,771
The Seeker of truth, not of wizards.

428
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:53,664
The potion's gotten us this far,
It can help us the rest of the way.

429
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,735
What would Zedd say if he were here?

430
00:32:56,997 --> 00:33:00,135
If he saw you relying
on magic instead of your wits,

431
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,538
and your senses?

432
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,374
You can do this without magic.

433
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:09,523
I believe in you.

434
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,655
I don't know where to start.

435
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:16,754
The vision you had of Zedd,
what do you remember?

436
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:21,831
It was dark,

437
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:26,062
There was green on the wall.

438
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,838
Glittermoss.

439
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,353
Does that help us?

440
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:33,809
It only grows where there's
fresh water nearby,

441
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,106
Like a river or lake.

442
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,484
- Echo lake isn't far.
- That must be it.

443
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,504
There are a lot of caves.
It could take us days to search them.

444
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:44,075
The moss was being fed by water
dripping downwards.

445
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,023
It's below the waterline.

446
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:49,733
The Lowlands, south of the lake.
There are only a few caves there.

447
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,761
- Take us!
- I only follow her orders.

448
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:54,336
Take us there.

449
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,100
Glittermoss.

450
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:13,622
Zedd?

451
00:34:19,174 --> 00:34:20,207
Zedd.

452
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,629
My boy...

453
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,619
They've taken my powers.

454
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:43,847
- They aren't masking their trail.
- They're moving fast.

455
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:45,495
They mustn't have time.

456
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:47,709
There they are.

457
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,888
Stop the cart!

458
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,824
- There's only two of them.
- You forget who's after us.

459
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:03,975
Stop them!

460
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:08,771
That's the wizard
who stole my powers.

461
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,315
My lady!

462
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:17,334
I'll save you!

463
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,760
Strike me down if you can, Seeker.

464
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,185
<i>To see that which is not there,</i>

465
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,277
<i>gaze upon what is.</i>

466
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:30,959
Kahlan!

467
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,730
Richard, the wizard!

468
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
No!

469
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
No!

470
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:26,075
- Oh, my lady.
- Try not to move.

471
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:27,752
All my life...

472
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,867
I've been a thief

473
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,330
... a liar.

474
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,916
Thank you...

475
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,471
for letting me die...

476
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,122
with honor.

477
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:46,804
You should kill me.

478
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,269
We're taking you to a healer.

479
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:53,112
You'll wear the Rada'han
for the rest of your life.

480
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:57,511
You'll never have the powers
of a wizard again, old friend.

481
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,800
You know him?

482
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,528
I thought I did.

483
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:11,930
You all right?

484
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:15,758
I've absorbed most of my powers.

485
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,875
Not quite back to my old self.
Maybe in a couple of days.

486
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Maybe?

487
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:25,302
One thing I've learned about magic,
it's that nothing is guaranteed.

488
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:28,964
Magic tore this town apart.

489
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,110
I used it twice.

490
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,999
I was going back a 3rd time
If Kahlan hadn't stopped me.

491
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:36,356
According to her,
it was your tracking skills

492
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,635
that found me in the end.

493
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,817
It was our training
that helped you defeat Jeziah.

494
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,782
But...

495
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:46,072
if I hadn't used the potion,

496
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,372
I wouldn't have known
you were in a cave.

497
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,161
You could have died.

498
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:55,081
So then, magic is a good thing?

499
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,465
Rymus wouldn't have helped us if kahlan
hadn't used magic to confess him.

500
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,296
True enough.

501
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:04,967
But on the other hand,
he'd still be alive.

502
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,032
I can see why
it's such a burden for her.

503
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,005
So, what lessons do you draw
from all this, Seeker?

504
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,735
There aren't any easy answers.

505
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,278
Magic isn't good or bad, it's...

506
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:21,108
complicated.

507
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,684
That's lesson number six.

508
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,775
You are making these up, aren't you?

509
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:39,135
Richard.

510
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,045
I found something
that belongs to you.

511
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,505
How did you?

512
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,634
Confessors can be quite persuasive.

513
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,274
I can't thank you enough.

514
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,005
Everyone in this village
is in your debt.

515
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,699
Even if they're not
gonna be happy about it.

516
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:12,130
Your neighbours have to learn
to fix their problems without magic.

517
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,060
- Maybe you can show them how.
- Me?

518
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,858
Excuse me.

519
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,506
One rose, please. A white one.

520
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,841
Five pence.

521
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:35,498
Is it for her?

522
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,058
No, it's for you.

523
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,673
I never see anyone buy flowers
for the flower girl.

524
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,364
I know this doesn't make up
for what I did.

525
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,551
But I hope someday
we can be friends.

526
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,549
Maybe there's hope for them.

527
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,055
Maybe for them,

528
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,060
but not for the two of you.

529
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:10,801
What are you talking about?

530
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:13,512
Richard has feelings for you.

531
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:18,005
You're imagining things.

532
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,893
To see that which is not there,

533
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:22,853
gaze upon what is.

534
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,957
I see the way he looks at you,

535
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,733
and how you're starting
to notice him.

536
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:33,323
But you know neither of you
can ever act on these feelings.

537
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:36,222
So the question is...

538
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,619
are you going to tell him,

539
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,321
or shall I?
