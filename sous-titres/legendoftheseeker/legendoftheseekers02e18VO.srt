<i>Richard Cypher,</i>

4
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:32,353
Lord Rahl.

5
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,122
Have you brought
what I asked for?

6
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:38,325
The Scroll of Valdaire.

7
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,929
Did the Seeker read it?

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,565
I took it from him
before he could break the seal.

9
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,834
Then he still has no idea
what to do

10
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,869
with the Stone of Tears
when he finds it.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,405
And he never will.

12
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:53,140
No!

13
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,142
Do not destroy it.

14
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:57,711
It is the Keeper's will
that you take the scroll

15
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,880
to the Mord-Sith temple
at Jandralyn,

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,717
without breaking the seal.

17
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:07,655
They will deliver it into
my hands, and my hands only.

18
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:11,125
In the World of the Living, you
are nothing more than a spirit.

19
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,427
Into what hands
am I to deliver it?

20
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,296
If I were you, Marianna,
I would worry more

21
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,565
about making sure that
the Seeker does not kill you

22
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,533
and take the scroll
bere you reach Jandralyn.

23
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:23,971
Because I am quite certain
that my intrepid brother Richard

24
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:26,640
is already on your trail.

25
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,477
Her tracks lead that way,

26
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,046
but they're at least
a half a day old.

27
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,514
We have to pick up our pace.

28
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:35,783
Fortune has smiled upon us.

29
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:38,385
A Sister of the Dark
has escaped with the scroll,

30
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:41,222
she's hours ahead,
and you call that fortunate?

31
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:42,623
Can't you smell that?

32
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:44,825
Smell what? Pine trees?

33
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,127
Lamb, butter, a touch of fennel.

34
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,597
And there it is, on the wind,
the sound of distant laughter.

35
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,665
Leads me to conclude
we're fast approaching

36
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,835
a roadside tavern, and the balm
of all weary travelers.

37
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,470
We don't have time
to feed your belly.

38
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,938
None of us have eaten in days.

39
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,241
We'll all move a lot faster
once we're fortified,

40
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:01,742
and I'm certain
the good tavern keeper

41
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:04,712
will be more than happy to pack
up our victuals for the road.

42
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:06,380
<i>Compliments of the house.</i>

43
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,915
Oh, no, please,
let us pay you.

44
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,150
After all you and your friends
have done for the Midlands?

45
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:12,419
Let me express my gratitude
in what little way I can.

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,422
Thank you, sir.
May the Spirits watch over you.

47
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:19,426
To the Seeker!

48
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,562
To the Seeker!

49
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:24,531
Yes, to the Seeker.

50
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,802
May he burn brightly
in the fires of the Underworld.

51
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:32,106
I don't think
I heard you right, sir.

52
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:34,241
No, you heard me.
Damn the Seeker,

53
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,543
and all the fools who helped him
bring down Darken Rahl.

54
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,712
Darken Rahl
was a wicked tyrant.

55
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:40,681
Oh, I'll grant you that.

56
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,517
He'd conscript your sons,
violate your daughters,

57
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:45,286
lock you up
for looking at him funny.

58
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,955
But at least when he was around
we had order.

59
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:49,757
Nowadays, if the highwaymen
don't get you,

60
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:51,125
the banelings will.

61
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:54,361
May the Creator forgive me,
I miss the good old days.

62
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,530
To the good old days!

63
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:03,070
Well, there's at least one other
sensible man in this province.

64
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,408
I once came damnably close

65
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,009
to bringing back
those good old days.

66
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,380
To returning Darken Rahl to his
rightful place among the living.

67
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,882
Sounds like quite a story.

68
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:16,617
Oh, Oh, that it is, my friend.

69
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,052
And I'd be happy to tell it,

70
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:21,488
if, uh, ahem, my damn throat
weren't so dry.

71
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:26,660
Two tankards of your best,
barkeep.

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,733
You promised me a tale.

73
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,968
That I did.

74
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:36,503
But I assure you,
it is no tale, my friend.

75
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:39,173
It is the Creator's
honest truth.

76
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:43,978
It all started
in a flea-bitten backwater

77
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,746
by the name of Sheephaven,

78
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:49,116
back when Darken Rahl
was still in power.

79
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:54,321
<i>One of the locals</i>
<i>had found a way</i>

80
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,457
<i>to profit from</i>
<i>the general hatred for Rahl.</i>

81
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,026
Step right up,
ladies and gentleman.

82
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:02,496
Give the villain who is
the cause of all your suffering

83
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,531
the tribute he deserves!

84
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,668
Three tries
for a farthing.

85
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,503
Mm-hm.

86
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,309
D'Harans! Real ones!

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,147
Aah!

88
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:29,289
No! Please don't kill me!

89
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,291
I'm just some poor sod
trying to make a living,

90
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,526
I didn't mean any offense.

91
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,696
You're quite famous.
Do you know that?

92
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:38,766
Word of your unique talent
has reached the ears

93
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,368
of the true Lord Rahl.

94
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:44,071
He'd like to meet you
personally.

95
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,742
Think of it, Lord Rahl.

96
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:52,346
He could appear in your stead
at ceremonial obligations

97
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,015
that interfere with more
pressing affairs of state.

98
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,352
He could serve as a convincing
decoy to would-be assassins.

99
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,686
Hm.

100
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,924
Very impressive,
Captain Malray.

101
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,826
Thank you, Lord Rahl.

102
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:08,162
Very impressive indeed.

103
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:11,098
He is the very image of me.

104
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,300
Were I to have a belly
the size of West Granthia,

105
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,601
a nose trampled by a horse,

106
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:18,372
and hair the color
of mouse droppings.

107
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,909
Perhaps a year spent
breaking stones

108
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,677
in the quarries of Groth

109
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,579
will improve your powers
of perception.

110
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,947
As for him,

111
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:28,949
feed him to dogs, before my
enemies find use for him.

112
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,585
Lord Rahl--
We are finished here, captain.

113
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,920
Humbly,
respectfully, sir,

114
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,855
I brought this man here

115
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,390
not as the finished
work of art,

116
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:39,093
but as the raw clay
from which it would be sculpted.

117
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:42,663
If you would only let me show
you the wonders I can work,

118
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,098
you will not be disappointed.

119
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:47,835
What do you think, Egremont?

120
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,637
I !gree withou of course,
My Lord.

121
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,372
This rogue doesn't have
the slightest trace

122
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,775
of your natural radiance
or nobility.

123
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:58,345
But if he could be improved
upon, as Captain Malray claims,

124
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,147
he may be of some use.

125
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:03,350
One day, you may have the need
to convince an adversary

126
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,985
that you were dead.

127
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:07,654
He would at least make
a convincing enough corpse.

128
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,692
The man is the height
of a toadstool.

129
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,027
What do you intend to do,
put him on stilts?

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,534
Please!

131
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:24,738
I'm tall enough now.
I swear I am.

132
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:30,544
Thank the Spirits.

133
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,880
Hm.

134
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,715
Two finger-lengths more.

135
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:35,716
What?

136
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,551
Just close your eyes, Walter,

137
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:39,620
and imagine yourself
by the sea.

138
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,121
No.

139
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:46,593
<i>And in time, we solved the</i>
<i>problem of Walter's stature</i>

140
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,929
<i>and colored that hideous hair.</i>

141
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,399
<i>But there was still a great</i>
<i>deal of work to be done.</i>

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,935
Coming along. Hm?

143
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,571
Though I still don't see
a way around that nose.

144
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:01,175
Oh. It happened the first time
I was mistaken for Rahl.

145
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,244
This drunk took a swing at me
and knocked it out of joint.

146
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:05,879
When I'm entertaining,

147
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,714
I just shade it with
a little bit of charcoal

148
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,016
and the crowd
is none the wiser.

149
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,818
Well, that might fool
some provincial bumpkins.

150
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,054
But if you're going to be
of any use to Lord Rahl,

151
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:17,124
you will need to convince even
those who know him personally.

152
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,092
Oh, no,
I have seen wonders done

153
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,994
with a little plaster
of gypsum and honey

154
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:23,964
in the concealment
of unsightly features.

155
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,934
Mm.
There's no need for that.

156
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,476
Perfect.

157
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:39,213
"P-People of D'Hara,

158
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:43,984
"a-as we march proudly
into the dawn of a new era,

159
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,253
united by faith in our cause--"

160
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,188
Stop,
before my ears bleed.

161
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,824
If people hear that, they'll
know they're being deceived.

162
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:54,061
And if that happens, Lord Rahl
will order all of our heads

163
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,897
to grace the pikes
at the palace gates!

164
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,465
General.

165
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,667
Walter doesn't need to say
anything at all.

166
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:03,737
All he needs to do is stand
on the balcony, act the part,

167
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:06,139
and give the crowd
the renowned Lord Rahl wave.

168
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,208
Go on, Walter,
show the General how beautifully

169
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,576
you've mastered the wave.

170
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:20,320
Now if you really want to be
the one to interrupt

171
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,824
Lord Rahl's revelry to inform
him that he needs to come here

172
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:27,995
to lead those dreary devotions,
go right ahead.

173
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,232
Very well.

174
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,967
Make your appearance.

175
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,603
And may the Spirits
be with us all.

176
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:22,516
<i>And in time, under my tutelage,</i>

177
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,952
<i>Walter eventually mastered</i>
<i>the accent as well.</i>

178
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:28,388
We became great friends,
Walter and I.

179
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,590
And the gold we were paid
for our service,

180
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:33,994
well, that financed
many a debauch. Yes.

181
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,730
We'd come a long way
from the day I found him

182
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,499
on the filthy streets
of Sheephaven. Heh.

183
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,704
But alas, those good old days
were few in number.

184
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:47,140
And when the cursed Seeker
put an end to our patron, well,

185
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:50,277
the palace fell into ruin,

186
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,580
<i>and was soon overrun</i>
<i>by an angry mob</i>

187
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,249
<i>hungry for loot and revenge.</i>

188
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:01,421
Take that down.

189
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:05,692
Look! It's the tyrant,
Darken Rahl!

190
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,094
He's not dead after all!

191
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,862
Darken Rahl is dead.

192
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,997
And the Seeker killed him,
I'm just his double.

193
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:13,500
How do we know the one who died
wasn't a double,

194
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,869
and you're not the real
Darken Rahl?

195
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,704
Yeah!

196
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,681
Malray!

197
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:29,449
Bless you, old friend!

198
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,917
Get him!

199
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:36,123
<i>And then the mob</i>
<i>swept him away.</i>

200
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,125
And you never saw him again?

201
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,727
Oh, no, no, no.
I saw him again.

202
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,063
I've only told you
the beginning of the story.

203
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:47,100
Still ahead of us
lay the treasure, the blood,

204
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:51,204
the betrayals,
and most of all the women.

205
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:53,373
Well don't stop there, man.
Go on!

206
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:57,010
Ah, that, my friend, would
require another tankard of ale.

207
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,072
After the fall of Darken Rahl,

208
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:06,074
it was hard
for a D'Haran officer.

209
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:09,177
No more wages,
no more plunder.

210
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,613
No more pillage.

211
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:14,916
But I had a plan
to restore my fortunes.

212
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,486
But to do that required finding
my old friend Walter again.

213
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,788
How did you manage it?

214
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,290
Well, I knew he had a taste
for stout ale,

215
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,860
so I searched
all the taverns in D'Hara.

216
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:27,262
It seemed hopeless,
until one night,

217
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:30,765
<i>I walked into the very</i>
<i>watering hole</i>

218
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:35,737
<i>where we are sitting</i>
<i>at this very moment.</i>

219
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,473
Thought you could slip me
a lead farthing, did you?

220
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:40,876
No, I thought they
were copper, I swear to you.

221
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,410
I'm the one
who's been cheated here.

222
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,946
You rotten,
lying scoundrel!

223
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:50,085
The tyrant lives!

224
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,253
Walter.

225
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:59,928
Anyone who wants a taste of him
gets a taste of me too.

226
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,329
Go on.

227
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:17,679
Malray. Old friend.

228
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,781
It's good to see you again,
Walter.

229
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:24,019
This is the second time
you've saved my skin.

230
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,621
I just wish you could help me
wriggle out of it.

231
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:29,891
I wish I looked
like someone else.

232
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:32,594
Walter, it's how you look that's
going to be our salvation.

233
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,363
All you have to do
is convince a few Mord-Sith

234
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:36,698
that you're the true
Darken Rahl.

235
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,533
Mord-Sith?
Are you out of your mind?

236
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,368
The good sisters
at the temple of Jandralyn

237
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,736
are protecting
a hoard of treasure

238
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,038
stashed there by Darken Rahl.

239
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,240
Now, when their true lord
and master

240
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,641
orders them to return it,

241
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,178
we will have enough gold to last
us the rest of our lives.

242
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,680
Do you have any idea

243
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:55,717
what those women can do
to men with the--

244
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,485
The torture sticks
they carry?

245
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,021
They would never dream
of using those torture sticks

246
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:01,556
against their one true lord
and master.

247
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:02,657
Which I am not.

248
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,327
And we would have to get
close to them,

249
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,562
and then they would know.
Walter.

250
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:10,065
Just close your eyes

251
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,802
and imagine yourself
by the sea.

252
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,837
The last time you told me
to do that,

253
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,606
my shoulders were nearly
pulled from their sockets.

254
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,308
Yeah, but this time I mean it,
Walter.

255
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,412
We'll get the treasure, and
then we'll sail to Merilandria,

256
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:27,482
and we'll ljve
a life of ease

257
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:29,217
by the shimmering ocean,

258
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:32,420
strolling on
the golden sands,

259
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:36,424
a different woman every night.

260
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,595
I'd be happy with just one.

261
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:41,696
If she were the right girl.

262
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,765
Then we'll find you
the right girl.

263
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:47,736
But first,
we need the treasure.

264
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,604
What do you say?

265
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:53,908
Lord Rahl, it's true...

266
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,612
you are still alive.

267
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:03,918
Arise,
Sisters of the Agiel.

268
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,557
How may we serve you, My Lord?

269
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,960
I've come for my treasure.

270
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:14,162
At once, My Lord.

271
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:18,299
But first, Lord Rahl and I
would require a meal,

272
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,236
and a hot bath.

273
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,338
Lord Rahl is weary
from his travels,

274
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,708
and wishes to indulge
in those particular pleasures

275
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:31,246
which only the skills
of his Mord-Sith can provide.

276
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,648
Of course, Captain Malray.

277
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,317
Immediately.

278
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:38,319
Why are you standing there?

279
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,289
Are you as deaf
as you are stupid?

280
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,492
No, mistress.
I'll see to the bath at once.

281
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,361
And supper. Now.

282
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,229
Yes, mistress.

283
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:05,246
I don't think we should delay
our departure much longer,

284
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,748
Captain Malray.

285
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:10,452
After all, the future
of D'Hara is at stake.

286
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:14,255
Your devotion to duty is
admirable as always, Lord Rahl.

287
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:18,460
But I beg you for once
to think of yourself.

288
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:21,029
After the hardships
of the past months,

289
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,598
you deserve one night
of pleasure.

290
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:33,108
How dare a lowly slave

291
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:35,076
look directly into the eyes
of Lord Rahl.

292
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,178
Don't!

293
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,317
My Lord?

294
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,421
You will treat
the slave gently,

295
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:49,390
or you will feel the sting
of my wrath.

296
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,360
Yes, My Lord.

297
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,408
Are you trying
to get us killed?

298
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,512
The real Lord Rahl would never
show kindness to a slave.

299
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,147
They were being so cruel.

300
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:14,716
And how cruel are they going
to be to us if we're discovered,

301
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,351
you idiot?

302
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,753
I am the one who said
we should get out of here.

303
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,221
If we try and leave now,

304
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:23,491
before Lord Rahl indulges
in his famous appetites,

305
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:26,161
they'll get suspicious.

306
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,499
Lord Rahl,
your bedchamber is in readiness.

307
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,468
May I show you there personally?

308
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,237
Um...

309
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:42,010
I have affairs of state
to attend to.

310
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:44,312
But I command you to show
Captain Malray here

311
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,882
to his bedchamber.

312
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,119
And do not fail to extend to him
every courtesy

313
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,488
you would extend to me.

314
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:56,291
As you command, My Lord.

315
00:16:56,292 --> 00:17:00,061
I will fetch you a robe,
captain.

316
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,898
Walter.
Hm?

317
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,069
You are the best friend
a man has ever had.

318
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,873
The night that Walter and I
spent in that temple

319
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:15,009
was nearly worth all the trouble
that came after.

320
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,378
Nearly.

321
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:22,884
I assure you, My Lord,
the treasure has gone untouched

322
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,552
since you entrusted it
to our care.

323
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:25,553
Good.

324
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,200
Load it onto the wagon.
At once.

325
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,036
Must you leave us so soon,
My Lord?

326
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,871
I have many enemies
in the Midlands.

327
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,307
More than we can fight
at present.

328
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,476
So I will sail
to the Lands of the South

329
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:50,712
where I will use the treasure
to raise a mercenary army

330
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:53,915
with which to return
to re-conquer D'Hara.

331
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,417
A wise plan, My Lord.

332
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,087
You and your sisters
will provide us with an escort

333
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:01,022
to see us safely to the port.

334
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,735
<i>Our real plan was to catch</i>
<i>a boat to Merilandria,</i>

335
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,169
<i>but I knew we needed protection</i>

336
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,904
<i>to get us past</i>
<i>the marauders and the bandits</i>

337
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,306
<i>of the Iron Mountains.</i>

338
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,575
<i>And we almost made it...</i>
Halt!

339
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,043
<i>...if it hadn't been</i>
<i>for the meddling</i>

340
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:23,945
<i>of those Mord-Sith wenches.</i>

341
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:27,782
Lord Rahl, it is your most
trusted officer,

342
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:30,051
General Egremont.

343
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,455
<i>It was the one man</i>
<i>in the entire world</i>

344
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:37,959
<i>we knew</i>
<i>we couldn't possibly deceive.</i>

345
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:45,970
What is he doing here?

346
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:47,772
We sent word to him,
My Lord.

347
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,440
You will need all the swords
you can get

348
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,442
if you are to restore
the glory of D'Hara.

349
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,244
Are you a fool?

350
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,313
Do you not know
that Lord Egremont is a traitor?

351
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,849
He tried to usurp the throne.
Yes.

352
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,685
I had no idea.
Please, Lord Rahl, forgive me.

353
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,453
Your only hope of forgiveness
from Lord Rahl

354
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:05,923
is the death of Egremont and all
his nefarious followers.

355
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:08,693
Order yours sisters to attack,

356
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,394
before he slaughters us all.

357
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,063
You heard Lord Rahl!

358
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:15,433
Destroy them!

359
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,815
<i>When the life went out</i>
<i>of that first Mord-Sith...</i>

360
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:36,287
<i>I knew our troubles</i>
<i>had only begun.</i>

361
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,022
What do you mean?

362
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,457
Well, she was dead, man.

363
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,526
Her soul was travelling down
to the Underworld.

364
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,896
Imagine her surprise
when she finds herself

365
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:48,833
in that fiery pit of anguish,
facing the real Lord Rahl.

366
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,269
And imagine his displeasure

367
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,372
when he's told
by his faithful Mord-Sith

368
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,541
that some impostor is making off
with his gold.

369
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,687
<i>I fought bravely</i>
<i>at Walter's side,</i>

370
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,456
<i>but we were overcome.</i>

371
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,427
Why did you attack us?

372
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,397
Lord Rahl commanded me.

373
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,866
Lord Rahl is dead!

374
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:28,472
So I can only conclude
that man's an imposter,

375
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:32,043
a double
once in Lord Rahl's employ.

376
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,250
You will beg my forgiveness for
your impertinence, Egremont.

377
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,820
Or you and all your men will pay
for it with your sorry lives.

378
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,856
Gladly.

379
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:49,226
If you can prove that you are
indeed the true Lord Rahl.

380
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,761
Which you can do
by telling me

381
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,597
what was the chief entertainment
at the fateful birthday party

382
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:56,300
of Princess Violet
of Tamarang?

383
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,739
A clown.

384
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,042
No, Walter.

385
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,411
It was a puppeteer.

386
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:09,747
You have been deceived.

387
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:13,050
Um... No. No, no.

388
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,352
You know-- Oh! Aah!

389
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,690
No.

390
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,959
Do not kill him.

391
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:26,063
My Lord,
he was impersonating you,

392
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:27,231
and stealing your gold.

393
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:29,867
Yes, so I've just been informed

394
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:33,604
by a recently dead
Sister of the Agiel.

395
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:36,040
But this charlatan
was useful to me in life,

396
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,844
and may one day
be useful to me in death.

397
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,979
Throw him
in your dungeon,

398
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,948
but maintain his appearance

399
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:48,019
in case I have need of his
services in the future.

400
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,087
Stay at the temple
with your men.

401
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:53,724
Guard him with your life,
until I appear to you again.

402
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,828
No, please-- Aah!

403
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,334
<i>That was nearly</i>
<i>half a year ago.</i>

404
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:09,774
I haven't seen
poor Walter since.

405
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:14,178
No doubt rotting in that
Mord-Sith dungeon as we speak.

406
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:18,182
<i>Here's to you, Walter.</i>

407
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,465
I don't understand it.

408
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,634
We should have
caught up to her by now.

409
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:38,602
Maybe we have.

410
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:28,819
Zedd.

411
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:41,398
Command me, Confessor.

412
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,500
Remove the dacra.

413
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,909
Oh. Oh, thank you, Kahlan.

414
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,513
The Scroll of Valdaire.
Do you know where it is?

415
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:56,847
Answer him.

416
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:58,015
Forgive me, Confessor.

417
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,351
I don't know anything
about a scroll.

418
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,988
A Sister of the Dark took
something very valuable

419
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,757
from the Seeker and ran off.
Where is she?

420
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,592
That must be Sister Marianna.

421
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:12,029
She ordered us to stay here
and attack you and the Seeker,

422
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,366
and at least slow you down
if we couldn't kill you.

423
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,034
Please, forgive me, mistress.

424
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,269
Which way did she go?

425
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,804
West.
Let's move.

426
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:26,744
General.

427
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:30,247
This woman claims Lord Rahl
ordered her to meet him here.

428
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:34,285
Sister Marianna, faithful
servant of the Keeper.

429
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:39,423
The day we have been
waiting for has finally come.

430
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,824
But Lord Rahl is not here.

431
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:43,227
I have the power to summon him.

432
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:01,111
Do you still have the scroll?

433
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:04,415
I wouldn't have dared to appear
before you without it.

434
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,819
My Lord,
I have done asou've commanded

435
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,755
and personally supervised the
incarceration of the prisoner.

436
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:15,359
I'm so pleased to hear that.

437
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,930
Because now it is time
for our old friend Walter

438
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,298
to die.

439
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,370
It's so cold down here.

440
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:38,005
Please don't tell anyone,

441
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,173
but I managed to steal
a few tots of rum.

442
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:43,110
It should
warm you up a bit.

443
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:01,461
Put these on. Hurry!
What's going on?

444
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:04,798
I'll explain once
we're outside. Quick.

445
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,975
There's nobody coming.

446
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,778
There will be.

447
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,680
Why are you helping me?

448
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,415
You were kind to me.

449
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:27,387
Nobody's ever been
kind to me before.

450
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:30,824
We have to keep going.

451
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,194
He's gone!

452
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,629
My sisters will get him back.

453
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,664
My riders will catch him faster.

454
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,900
Go!

455
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:51,411
Rahl?

456
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,116
No, no, I'm not him!
I swear I'm not.

457
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,918
I'm just this sod
who looks like him.

458
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,219
It's true.

459
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,288
I saw a Sister of the Dark
summon the spirit

460
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,756
of the real Lord Rahl.

461
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:05,525
I can't be him. See?
I'm not a spirit.

462
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:08,428
Go ahead. Touch me.

463
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:09,963
Uh, but not with that.

464
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,965
Nobody needs to touch you.

465
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:14,568
It's obvious you're not Rahl.

466
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,036
This Sister of the Dark.

467
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:17,904
Did she have a scroll with her?

468
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:19,473
Yes.

469
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:23,410
Please, help us.

470
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,345
They're planning
to kill Walter.

471
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,286
Thank you for saving us.

472
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:07,654
We'll just be
on our way now.

473
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,589
We don't want to be
any more trouble. Okay.

474
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,024
You're not going anywhere.

475
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,426
Oh.

476
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:18,098
The Sister of the Dark is
in that temple with the scroll.

477
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,332
We need to go in and get it.

478
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,935
We don't need extra cargo.

479
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,804
Think about it.

480
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:26,139
Darken Rahl keeps a look-alike
alive in his castle,

481
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,741
where he has summoned
a Sister of the Dark

482
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,143
to assist the Mord-Sith.

483
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,212
He has all the magical
ingredients he needs

484
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:35,015
to return to the Land
of the Living

485
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,551
in this man's body.

486
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:38,718
What?

487
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,853
We can't let him run off

488
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,822
and risk Rahl
recapturing him somehow.

489
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:45,192
We'll storm the temple,
get the scroll,

490
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:46,993
and then we'll decide
what to do with them.

491
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,695
You'd better
burn these bodies

492
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:51,498
before Rahl sends them back
as banelings.

493
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,384
What an unexpected pleasure

494
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:15,288
to see so many old friends
in one place.

495
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,658
Though I must say, Walter,
I have seen you looking better.

496
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,962
We know what you're planning
to do to him.

497
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:23,997
And we're not going to let
it happen.

498
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:28,068
No, something tells me you'll
do more than let it happen.

499
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:30,604
You are going to kill him
for me too.

500
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:33,974
And then your new
Sister of the Dark friend here

501
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:35,876
will summon my soul
into his body,

502
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:40,080
and Cara's lovely lips
will blow the Breath of Life

503
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,549
into my new lungs.

504
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,884
You're out of your mind.

505
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:47,721
On the contrary.
I'm thinking quite clearly.

506
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,222
Are you, brother?

507
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:53,860
Or do I need to remind you that
without the Scroll of Valdaire,

508
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,396
you will never repair the veil?

509
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:57,998
The Keeper will win,

510
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:02,369
and every living person
in this world will die.

511
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,339
But if you do as I ask,

512
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,542
I will hand you
the scroll personally.

513
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:11,611
Suddenly you want
to defeat the Keeper?

514
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:14,114
I want to live again.

515
00:30:14,115 --> 00:30:18,318
You of all people must
understand that, brother.

516
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,023
I miss the taste
of a crisp apple.

517
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:26,426
The warm press of a woman's
flesh against my own.

518
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,030
But I must admit,

519
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:33,466
being a spirit
does have its advantages.

520
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:37,304
For instance,
I can appear to Sister Marianna

521
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:40,040
much faster than you
can get to the temple.

522
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,176
I have but to command her
to burn the scroll

523
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,879
and your failure is assured.

524
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,849
So do we have an agreement,

525
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,718
or don't we?

526
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,918
If we turn down Rahl's proposal,

527
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,388
the scroll will be ashes before
we get to the temple.

528
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,024
I never thought I'd say this,
but that devious bastard

529
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,625
has us firmly by our nethers.

530
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:10,095
We can't just kill Walter.

531
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:12,131
Maybe we don't have to.

532
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:15,601
How attached are you to the body
you were born with?

533
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:18,837
I'd do anything
to have a different face.

534
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:20,472
I think that can be arranged.

535
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:22,441
How?

536
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,476
We have the magical means
to put your spirit

537
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:28,280
into one of these bodies,
and bring you back to life.

538
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:31,316
And put Rahl's spirit
into Walter's body.

539
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:33,852
Exactly.

540
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:36,588
Take your pick,
any one you fancy. But quickly.

541
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:40,325
Uh...

542
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,027
You choose.

543
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,228
Me?

544
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:46,632
Yeah. If I'm going to have
a new body,

545
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:49,668
I want one
that pleases you.

546
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,637
Come.

547
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:54,506
Zedd, once we give Rahl
his new body,

548
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:58,043
we can't just trust him
to bring us the scroll back.

549
00:31:58,044 --> 00:32:00,379
You could confess him.

550
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,949
Rahl's soul
is immune to confession.

551
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,986
But there is another way.

552
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:10,055
You sure this is gonna work?

553
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:13,325
Don't worry, I went through
it myself, and it worked fine.

554
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:14,660
Okay.

555
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:16,795
Oh. Is--?
Is this going to hurt?

556
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,297
I'll try to make it quick.
Okay.

557
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:24,536
Um! Does it really
have to be a knife?

558
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,672
Just sit back, okay,
and try and relax.

559
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:28,173
Take a deep breath.

560
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:34,913
That wasn't so bad,
now, was it?

561
00:32:38,218 --> 00:32:39,918
Don't be afraid, Walter.

562
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,521
I'm right here.

563
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:01,073
Now.

564
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,689
Mika, it's me.

565
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,924
I'm back!

566
00:33:57,697 --> 00:34:01,166
Ah, it's good to be back.

567
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:11,844
I knew you'd do
the right thing, brother.

568
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,487
Sister Tyra is going with you
to the temple.

569
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:25,924
You're going to get the scroll
and bring it straight back.

570
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:29,595
Otherwise, she'll release
the magic of the dacra,

571
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:32,064
and you'll be dead again
in a heartbeat.

572
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:33,832
This really wasn't necessary.

573
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:37,936
I would have done
exactly as I promised.

574
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:40,873
Well, I won't have to take
that on good faith now, will I?

575
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,678
My Lord.

576
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,280
How is it possible
you've returned

577
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:50,048
without the help
of Sister Marianna?

578
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:52,184
And how did you get
the prisoner's body

579
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:54,186
when my men have
yet to return with him?

580
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,554
I don't know
what rabbit trail

581
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:57,556
your men are following,
Egremont.

582
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:59,791
Fortunately,
their ineptitude was redeemed

583
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,060
by Sister Tyra here.

584
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,662
You flatter me, My Lord.

585
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:05,530
Not only did she recapture
and kill Walter,

586
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,500
she performed the ritual
of resurrection.

587
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:12,371
What Mord-Sith did you find to
administer the Breath of Life?

588
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:14,973
I was revived by Tyra,

589
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,142
who had the foresight

590
00:35:17,143 --> 00:35:19,344
to kill a Mord-Sith
and take her han.

591
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,313
It appears you
and your sisters

592
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:23,815
are not as indispensable
as you think.

593
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:26,752
Now give me the scroll.

594
00:35:26,753 --> 00:35:30,722
My Lord, you do seem
very much yourself,

595
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,091
but in light of recent
misunderstandings,

596
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:35,227
I believe you would want me
to verify the identity

597
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,029
of anyone who claimed to be you.

598
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,363
Of course.

599
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:40,532
I'm sure you could tell me,
for example,

600
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,869
what was the gift you gave
your sister Jennsen last year

601
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,370
when you were trying
to earn her trust?

602
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:47,272
A kitten.
And unless you want to share

603
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:48,941
that poor creature's
unfortunate fate,

604
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:51,310
you will hand me
the scroll right now.

605
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,228
Hm.

606
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:12,197
How very interesting.

607
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,800
You may be on your way now,
Sister.

608
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,704
Sisters!

609
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:25,577
You will of course want
refreshment, My Lord.

610
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:27,579
And company.

611
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,248
Yes, I would.

612
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:38,724
But unfortunately,
I have time for neither.

613
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,559
I must be on my way.

614
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,828
Prepare a wagon
for my treasure.

615
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,963
At once, My Lord.

616
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:50,902
The Mother Confessor said
nothing about treasure.

617
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:54,072
Now that I'm alive again, I have
no intention of being penniless.

618
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,274
I won't allow you
to displease my mistress.

619
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:59,077
Well, imagine her displeasure if
the Seeker never has a chance

620
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:00,545
to read this scroll.

621
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:03,782
Oh, you may command the magic
of the dacra to kill me,

622
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:07,886
but by then this parchment
will be nothing but cinders.

623
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,288
My Lord.
Your wagon is being prepared.

624
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,891
Shall I assume we're returning
to the People's Palace

625
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:14,226
to reclaim your throne?

626
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,894
You are to remain here,
Egremont.

627
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:18,830
My Lord, I am most eager to
help you resecure your domain.

628
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,700
The time
is not yet right.

629
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,068
Before I return
to the palace,

630
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:25,771
I must pay a visit
to Ravensberg.

631
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:28,106
When I'm ready, I will send
for you. Is that clear?

632
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:29,775
Yes, My Lord.

633
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,986
I need your best archers,
at once.

634
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:42,254
Why?

635
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:44,189
Lord Rahl was sending me
a message.

636
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,893
He was once ambushed at
Ravensberg and almost killed.

637
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:51,630
He's telling me
he's in danger again now.

638
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,633
And we're going
to get him out of it.

639
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,669
<i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

640
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,568
Do you have the scroll?

641
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:13,709
I think you'll find it
interesting reading.

642
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,143
I know I did.

643
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,879
Hand it over.

644
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,215
Of course, brother.

645
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,684
But in case your plan

646
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,486
is to have your pet
Sister of the Dark here

647
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:25,787
kill me once I relinquish it,

648
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:28,490
you should know that I would
then be forced

649
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:31,360
to tell the Keeper
what is written on the scroll.

650
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:34,763
And then he will know exactly
where you'll be going next.

651
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:39,067
I imagine he would send an army
of banelings to greet you.

652
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,903
You win.

653
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,472
She won't release the magic.

654
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:45,307
Now give me the scroll.

655
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:53,982
Now get this thing
out of me.

656
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,751
I'm thinking maybe we should
leave it in.

657
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,819
You're much more
cooperative this way.

658
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:01,690
Lord Rahl is under
the Seeker's control.

659
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,893
And will be as long as
the Sister of the Dark lives.

660
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,628
Kill her.

661
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,176
Let's go. I know
a place we can be safe.

662
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:56,645
And happy.

663
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,183
Hyah!

664
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:04,086
For D'Hara and Lord Rahl!

665
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,075
Hyah!

666
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:28,810
Walter's getting away
with the treasure.

667
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:30,812
We have no use for it.
Let them go.

668
00:40:30,813 --> 00:40:32,280
They're not the only ones
that got away.

669
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,617
Rahl's gone too.

670
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:37,185
We can track him.

671
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,121
Maybe.
We didn't come for Rahl.

672
00:40:39,122 --> 00:40:41,356
We came to find out
what we're supposed to do

673
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:42,924
with the Stone of Tears.

674
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:44,459
What does it say?

675
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,396
"The instructions
inscribed upon this scroll

676
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:50,565
"will only appear in the glow

677
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:52,100
cast by a Night Wisp."

678
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:56,638
All this trouble and the
instructions are invisible?

679
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,243
Only until we find
one of Kahlan's tiny friends.

680
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:03,311
Well, I guess we know
which where we're headed.

681
00:41:03,312 --> 00:41:05,647
So does Rahl.

682
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:11,753
A tankard of stout ale, barkeep.

683
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:15,857
Aha, a brother in arms!

684
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:18,426
Brings to mind
the good old days.

685
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:21,930
You know, I once came damnably
close to bringing back

686
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,398
those good old days.

687
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:27,135
It's quite a story,
and I'd be happy to tell it

688
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:31,339
if my, um, ahem--
If throat weren't so damn dry.

689
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,807
I already know that story.

690
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:36,678
In fact,
I know a part of it you don't.

691
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,414
The happy ending.

692
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,782
Oh, what's the matter, Malray?

693
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,851
Don't you recognize
your old friend?

694
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:47,923
Walter? How?

695
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:49,124
That's quite a story too.

696
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,525
Which I'll tell you
on the road.

697
00:41:50,526 --> 00:41:52,327
That is of course
if you're still interested

698
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:53,795
in going to Merilandria.

699
00:41:53,796 --> 00:41:55,931
Oh, I-I'm a little short
of funds, I'm afraid.

700
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:57,999
I've recently come into
a small fortune myself.

701
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,467
Found a girl too.

702
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:00,602
The right one.

703
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,637
She's outside
in a coach right now.

704
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:04,172
And I've bought passage
for three

705
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,174
on the next ship
out of Wynnmore.

706
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,976
Is-- Is this really possible?

707
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:10,412
Walter!

708
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:14,349
Just close your eyes, Malray...

709
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,551
And imagine yourself
by the sea.

710
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:22,457
Cheers.
