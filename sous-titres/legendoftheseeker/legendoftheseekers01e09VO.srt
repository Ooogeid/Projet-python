1
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:04,503
Joyous news, Lord Rahl.

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,526
The forces you sent to Kelabra

3
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:09,151
have delivered
the second Box of Orden.

4
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,824
Send word to Queen Milena, tell her
that I accept all her demands,

5
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,972
in return for the third box.

6
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,598
Forgive me, Lord Rahl,

7
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,714
but why would we pay
such a generous price

8
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:44,639
when one division of our forces
could crush Queen Milena to dust?

9
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:46,739
Once I have all three boxes,

10
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:50,925
the magic of Orden will give me
unchallenged power over everything,

11
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,065
and Milena's demands

12
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,888
will be meaningless.

13
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:03,405
There lives Queen Milena.

14
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:06,754
Not the most beloved monarch
in the Midlands.

15
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:10,111
When she was still Princess Milena

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,042
she took command
of her father's armies

17
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,281
and attacked
the Kingdom of Tramontana.

18
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:16,935
Thousands were slaughtered,

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,420
because she wanted a pink sapphire
the size of a large pumpkin seed.

20
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,651
And she got it.

21
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:28,043
How many people did she kill
for the third Box of Orden?

22
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,296
She inherited it.

23
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,881
It's been in the treasure room
for a thousand years.

24
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,183
We're almost too late! The talk
in the village is that Queen Milena

25
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:39,473
has been whipping her servants,
quite literally, unfortunately,

26
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:43,144
into a frenzy over the arrival
of an emissary from Darken Rahl.

27
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:46,814
This emissary must be coming
for the third box.

28
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:49,900
- When does this emissary get here?
- Tomorrow.

29
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,584
Then we've got one day

30
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,068
to sneak into a locked room

31
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:57,658
somewhere inside
a heavily fortified castle,

32
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:02,121
steal the most valuable object
in the world, and sneak out again.

33
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:06,064
Or Darken Rahl gets the box
and rules us all.

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,488
If the roast looks too big to eat,

35
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:09,913
chop it in half.

36
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,056
You two delay the emissary,

37
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:15,718
- and I'll get into the castle.
- How?

38
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,766
"Hear ye, hear ye,

39
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,518
"Ten gold pieces to the entertainer

40
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,937
"who proves himself worthy
of performing

41
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,260
"at the birthday party
of Her Celestial Highness

42
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:32,247
Princess Violet of Tamarang."

43
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:34,528
Entertainer? What does
that have to do with you?

44
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:38,159
Do you know anyone more
entertaining than me?

45
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,548
Go on.
Swallow the hilt.

46
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:57,412
Next.

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,707
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:17,357
Hello, Princess Violet.

49
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:19,251
I'm Mr. Stocking.

50
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,060
Happy birthday.

51
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,397
Guards!

52
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,099
Throw this idiot off the grounds
before I chop off his head.

53
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:31,585
Forgive me, Your Magnificence,
for disappointing you.

54
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,713
Where are you going?

55
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:37,842
What do you mean?

56
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,136
I lost the job because of you,
you worthless, stinking rag.

57
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,347
First you blame me
for losing the job,

58
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,890
now for being stinky.

59
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,768
Something sure smells around here

60
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:49,353
but it isn't me.

61
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,315
You're hired.

62
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,556
Ruben Rybnik,

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,799
grand puppeteer,

64
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:02,935
at Her Majesty's service.

65
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:09,793
Sync: Kasius

66
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,739
1x09 - <i>Puppeteer</i>

67
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,656
For the party,
I want a puppet of me.

68
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,843
But better than a stocking puppet.
More lifelike. Can you do that?

69
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:24,471
The question, dear princess,
is not what can I do,

70
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,098
but what can't I do.

71
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:30,660
See this? Solid gold.

72
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,039
I got it for my fifth birthday.

73
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,380
Eighth birthday.

74
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:38,193
The rope is made out
of the finest silk in all the Midlands.

75
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,594
It took some old lady
a year to make it.

76
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:44,408
It's probably worth more than someone
like you can even imagine.

77
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,663
I got her last year so that
I could practice my leadership on her.

78
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,414
He's the puppeteer for my party.

79
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,239
If you don't make me too angry,
you will get to watch the show.

80
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,135
Excellent demonstration
of leadership, princess.

81
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:08,495
- I'm teaching her etiquette.
- But as Your Celestial Highness knows,

82
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,789
the threat of a blow
is often more effective

83
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,730
- than the blow itself.
- Maybe where you come from.

84
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,614
Now, show the puppeteer
what I taught you

85
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,389
before I hit you again.

86
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,363
How do you do, kind sir?

87
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,720
Very well, thank you.

88
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,762
And it is indeed a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

89
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:34,708
May I ask your name?

90
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:36,955
Rachel.

91
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,297
Here's my dress.

92
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:44,176
Your Highness, you are the very soul

93
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,928
of understated elegance.

94
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,841
Now, what would truly set off
Your Majesty's beauty would be...

95
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,477
Your mother
would never let you wear that.

96
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,833
- Would never let me wear what?
- The Tramontana's famous Pink Sapphire.

97
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,614
I'm sure when you're a little older,
you'll be allowed to.

98
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,987
I'm allowed to wear any jewel
in the castle.

99
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,490
But surely the Pink Sapphire
of Tramontana is locked in a vault.

100
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,119
My mother lets me go anywhere
in the castle, even the Treasure Room.

101
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,663
I think I could go get it right now.

102
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:17,088
Is that really the key
to the Treasure Room of Tamarang?

103
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,411
I've dreamt all my life
of seeing those wonders.

104
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,206
Keep on dreaming. I'm the only one
allowed in the Treasure Room.

105
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,508
Wait right here.

106
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,419
If I were Rahl,

107
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:40,643
I'd send more than three soldiers
for the third Box of Orden.

108
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:44,068
If you were Rahl,
you'd send a small party

109
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:46,363
of troops ahead
to make sure the roads were safe.

110
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,626
You know,

111
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,223
if we grabbed one of the scouts,

112
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,748
and you confessed him,

113
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,335
you could ask him nicely
to send a message back,

114
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,265
couldn't you?

115
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,832
Telling Darken Rahl
that Queen Milena won't be ready

116
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:08,218
to deliver the box
for at least a week.

117
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,558
What did you do that for?
I had him.

118
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,972
It looked to me like he had you.

119
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:06,485
- This is what I was afraid of.
- That I'd save your life?

120
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,365
That you'd let your feelings for me
get in the way of the mission.

121
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,641
He was about to kill you,
and I stopped him.

122
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,639
We had a rare opportunity,

123
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,149
and we missed it because
you were being overprotective.

124
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,414
What's that?

125
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,383
A Journey Book.

126
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,180
It's how Darken Rahl communicates
with his commanders from far away.

127
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:39,635
He writes in his book,
and the words appear in this one.

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,216
This might tell us exactly

129
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,438
when the emissary is coming,
and by what route.

130
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,006
Rachel.

131
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,675
How did you come by
such a beautiful name?

132
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,269
I was named after my grandmother.

133
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:59,413
Where is your grandmother now?

134
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,957
The queen's soldiers killed her.

135
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,252
She didn't fall to her knees
fast enough

136
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,656
when the queen came
riding by in her carriage.

137
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,640
They killed my mother and my father

138
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,302
and my brother too.

139
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,281
You took the sting away.

140
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:40,078
I need your help
with something very important.

141
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,231
Have you ever been
in the Treasure Room?

142
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,822
And have you seen the Box of Orden?

143
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,556
Princess Violet hates it,

144
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,803
because it's the only thing
in the castle

145
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,778
she's not allowed to touch.

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,346
And does Violet ever take
the key off her neck?

147
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,544
She even sleeps with it.

148
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,978
- Do you sleep in the room with her?
- She makes me sleep in that box.

149
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,628
But sometimes
when she thinks I'm being bad,

150
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,722
she makes me sleep outside.

151
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,862
Sometimes I'm bad on purpose

152
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,616
because I like sleeping
outside better.

153
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,877
I like hearing the crickets.

154
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:22,079
I have something special
I'd like to give you.

155
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:26,833
It's called a Trouble Doll.

156
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,253
You tell her your troubles,

157
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,547
and she takes them away for you.

158
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:34,401
I can't.

159
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,928
Princess Violet says I'm not
allowed to have my own toys.

160
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,333
If I keep it,

161
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:41,544
she'll throw it in the fire.

162
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:45,686
In all my travels

163
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,738
I have never met
a ghastlier little monster

164
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:51,013
than Princess Violet of Tamarang.

165
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:55,112
If the princess knows you said
that she'll have you killed.

166
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,281
I trust you not to tell.

167
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:01,122
You remind me very much
of my own daughter.

168
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:03,287
She was brave and strong,
just like you.

169
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,039
Dear one,

170
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,531
why don't you take
the doll and hide it?

171
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:11,003
The princess doesn't need
to know. It'll be...

172
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,967
- I didn't say you could talk to him.
- You're sleeping outside tonight.

173
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,445
But first, go to the kitchen
and tell the cooks

174
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,638
that my roast at lunch
was dry and stringy.

175
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:25,767
Tell them that if that happens again,
they'll have to pay for it.

176
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:27,394
Go!

177
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,649
Your Magnificence,
if you would excuse me,

178
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,874
I need to make my preparations
for the festivities.

179
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,737
Not one lump in that icing,
or we'll both have hell to pay.

180
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,624
Put some more salt in that.

181
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,710
- Hello, sweetheart!
- Hello, Martha.

182
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,603
Just in time to lick the spoon.

183
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,247
Only lick fast,
before you-know-who gets here.

184
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,766
You-know-who says
I'm supposed to tell you

185
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:01,678
that if the roast is
stringy again, she'll flog you.

186
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,093
You tell that spoiled brat
that all the crops in Tamarang

187
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,222
go to feed the queen
and her rich friends.

188
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:10,139
There's not a crust of bread left
for me to feed my children with,

189
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,914
and if anyone
deserves flogging, it's her.

190
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,868
This servant has proven herself
unfit for the job

191
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,879
and disloyal to the crown.

192
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:29,355
Take her to the block.

193
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:33,404
And who are you?

194
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:34,920
Your Majesty,

195
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:37,839
it is the highest honor of my life

196
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,092
to present to you
your humble servant,

197
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,969
Ruben Rybnik, grand puppeteer,

198
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:45,477
graciously chosen by your daughter

199
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,702
for the amusement of her guests.

200
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,645
I applaud your alacrity
in stamping out insolence,

201
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:55,608
but if Your Majesty disposes
of such a talented cook

202
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,900
before the banquet,

203
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,113
I do hope the princess doesn't
miss her favorite dessert.

204
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,568
Release her.

205
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:12,290
She shall be granted a stay
of execution until the party's over.

206
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,256
And as for you,

207
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,800
your access to the castle
shall be strictly limited

208
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:20,424
to the servant's quarters
and the banquet room.

209
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,843
As Your Majesty wishes.

210
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,542
I didn't mean to get
Martha in trouble.

211
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,450
Why do I always make things worse?

212
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,240
I wish I could run away from here.

213
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:03,514
With you.

214
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:07,462
We'd go so far away
that nobody would ever find us.

215
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,225
Don't be sad, Rachel.

216
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:17,107
Ruben is going to take you
away with him.

217
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:21,067
But first he needs to get hold
of the Box of Orden

218
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:25,672
so that Queen Milena can never
hurt anyone ever again.

219
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,784
And for that, he needs your help.

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,746
And he needs you to be very, very

221
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:33,824
brave.

222
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,775
Well done, Rachel.

223
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,989
Sara told me you needed help.

224
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,885
You gave her a name.
I'm sure that made her very happy.

225
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,087
Now wait here with Sara,
and when I come back with the box,

226
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,598
we'll leave together,

227
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,990
and you'll never see
this castle again.

228
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,200
Where will we go?

229
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,375
I don't know just yet,

230
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,706
but I promise
I'll find you a safe place,

231
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,208
with people who will be overjoyed

232
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,276
to have a girl as wonderful
as you to care for.

233
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,047
Darken Rahl is coming.

234
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,207
- What?
- Look. Right here.

235
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,885
According to yesterday's orders,
Rahl is coming for the box himself.

236
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,266
For the first time, ever,
we know exactly

237
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,191
where Rahl is going to be.

238
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,140
I can kill him.

239
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,989
But he'll be surrounded
by soldiers, bodyguards...

240
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,859
I can drop a running deer
at 200 paces with one of these.

241
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:37,326
And Kahlan, we get to choose exactly

242
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,205
the spot we shoot from.

243
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,510
All we need to do
is send a message back,

244
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,885
directing Lord Rahl
to the perfect spot for an attack.

245
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:52,441
- What are you doing?
- The magic of the Journey Book

246
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,069
only works when the words
are written in blood.

247
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,389
We'll use mine.

248
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:59,807
I thought you weren't
being overprotective.

249
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:00,869
I was...

250
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:10,153
We've received word from our scouts.

251
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,861
The bridge on the main road
to Tamarang

252
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,036
has been washed out by a storm.

253
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:19,063
We're being advised to take
the road through the Iron Hills.

254
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:23,513
Through the narrow canyons
and dark woods of the Iron Hills?

255
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,788
Yes, My Lord.

256
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:26,955
It will delay you by a day,

257
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,930
but it could take weeks
to rebuild the bridge.

258
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:41,810
My key!

259
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:26,255
What are you doing in here?

260
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,007
Forgive me, Princess.

261
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,421
My curiosity overcame me.

262
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,406
How stupid do you think I am?

263
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,660
You have two seconds
to tell me what's going on

264
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:43,312
before I scream my head off
and wake up the whole castle.

265
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:50,003
You may want to look in the mirror
before you make good on that threat.

266
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,510
My face! My beautiful face!
What have you done to me?

267
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,680
Change me back right now
or I'll chop your head off!

268
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:04,434
How will you get rid of the warts
if you chop my head off?

269
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:08,813
It's called a Tattletale Curse,

270
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,815
Your Celestial Highness.

271
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:12,475
I can take it away.

272
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,754
But if you ever even
think of telling on me,

273
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,697
the warts will reappear.
Forever.

274
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,234
Whether I'm there or not.

275
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:30,115
I got the box,
and I fixed Violet for good.

276
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,837
By sunrise,
we'll be six leagues away.

277
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,362
- What about Martha?
- Who?

278
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,553
The one whose head the queen
is gonna chop off after the party.

279
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:42,555
We can't leave without her.

280
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,976
We don't have time to go
to the servant's quarters.

281
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,479
If Rahl gets his hands on this box,

282
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:53,108
he'll chop off more heads than there are
in the entire Kingdom of Tamarang.

283
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,878
I'm so sorry, but there are
too many lives at stake.

284
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,365
But Martha has three children.

285
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,408
If the queen kills her,

286
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,327
they'll starve.

287
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,800
Post 16 extra men
on the south battlements,

288
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,768
and 30 on the north.
Leave nothing to chance.

289
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,087
What, may I ask,
is my daughter's puppeteer doing

290
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:28,977
lurking about the castle
at this hour?

291
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:32,272
I awoke with a growling stomach,

292
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,482
went to the kitchen
for a late night snack,

293
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,246
and was just on my way back
to the servant's quarters.

294
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,411
Guards,

295
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:48,371
see to it that the puppeteer
finds his way back.

296
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:51,952
And remain stationed
outside his room,

297
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:55,553
in case he decides he needs
anything else.

298
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:16,475
- Where's Violet?
- In the banquet room

299
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,043
- inspecting the party decorations.
- We don't have much time.

300
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:22,230
The queen's guards
are following me everywhere,

301
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:25,382
- they're right outside the door.
- If they're following you everywhere,

302
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,619
how are you gonna get
the box out of the castle?

303
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,416
It's up to you now.

304
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:35,307
Me?

305
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,952
I'd give all the riches
of all kingdoms in the world

306
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,590
not to have to place
such a terrible burden on you.

307
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,343
- If there was any other way...
- Don't be sad, Ruben.

308
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,061
I can do it.

309
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,819
I want to do it.

310
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:55,063
Listen very carefully.

311
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:59,023
Go to the kitchen
and ask Martha for a loaf of bread.

312
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:01,325
Cut the loaf in half
and hollow it out.

313
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,144
Hide the box inside.

314
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,720
Tell the guards at the gate

315
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,284
that the princess has sent you
to sleep outside.

316
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,163
Go straight through the woods,

317
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,907
turn right at the stream
and follow it to the hill

318
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,832
that overlooks the castle.

319
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,925
You'll find friends there.

320
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,546
Their names are Richard and Kahlan.

321
00:22:21,661 --> 00:22:23,211
What about you and...

322
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,617
And Martha?

323
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:28,792
The queen isn't going to let me leave
until I finish the puppet show.

324
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,117
When I'm done,

325
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,308
I promise I'll do
what I can for Martha.

326
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:42,694
You are now the most
important person in the world.

327
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,935
Don't worry.
It'll be easy to get out.

328
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,659
Everyone treats me
like I'm invisible anyway.

329
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:56,904
You have to go now.

330
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:58,167
Good luck.

331
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,847
Martha, may I please
have a loaf of bread?

332
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,401
I'm sorry little one.

333
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,714
All of the bread is already
in the banquet room.

334
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,686
I wanna lick the bowl!
Where is it?

335
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:21,285
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.

336
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,468
Do you have something
behind your back?

337
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,531
Show me your hands then.

338
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:42,170
It's a present.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

339
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,422
Happy birthday, Princess Violet.

340
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:47,740
You call this a present?

341
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,229
Where'd you get it?
The trash?

342
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:04,022
Why isn't my cake in the oven yet?

343
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,023
I...

344
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,840
- just need to add the cardamom.
- I hate cardamom.

345
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:11,282
It makes me sneeze.
Just put it in already.

346
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,029
Are you deaf?

347
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,826
Richard, what if this is it?

348
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,301
What do you mean?

349
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:44,765
I mean, what if you kill Rahl?

350
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:48,981
It would all be over.

351
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:54,067
The magic hold he has
over his forces would be gone.

352
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:58,292
Some people might fight for a while,
but most would wake up,

353
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,067
go back to their lives,

354
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:02,375
to their families.

355
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,630
So could you.

356
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,802
I have no family left.

357
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,306
You could find somebody
to start one with.

358
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:49,788
That's not him.

359
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,010
His hands aren't holding the reins,
they're tied to them.

360
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,681
Then he must know the message 
didn't come from one of his own people.

361
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:01,142
So he sent a double.

362
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,102
If that's not him, then where is he?

363
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,429
So sorry to interrupt the party.

364
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,833
What a welcome and unexpected honor.

365
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:21,187
The honor is all mine.

366
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,667
How lovely you look today,
Queen Milena.

367
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,479
And Princess Violet, so beautiful.

368
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:32,423
The image of her mother.

369
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,346
If I cut between the two roses,

370
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:40,022
we can get the box out

371
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:42,225
and I can fix the damage
so nobody will notice.

372
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:45,111
Now, quickly.

373
00:26:48,904 --> 00:26:50,525
What are you doing?

374
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:55,101
The queen wants the cake
in the banquet hall now.

375
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,044
Before we adjourn
to the Treasure Room,

376
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:13,130
won't you consider doing us
the honor of cutting the cake?

377
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,847
It would be my great pleasure.

378
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:30,761
Wait!

379
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,322
- Who is this man?
- My apologies.

380
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,201
He's nothing but a common entertainer
who doesn't know his place.

381
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,212
I'm so sorry, Your Supreme
and Magnanimous Lordship.

382
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,791
I only meant to say
that the princess

383
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,502
specifically requested
that we have the puppet show

384
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,289
- before the cake.
- What are you...?

385
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,175
Yes, I want the puppet show first.

386
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,263
May I present myself?

387
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,914
Ruben Rybnik,

388
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:07,483
grand puppeteer.

389
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:14,191
If you would grant this indulgence,
it would mean so much to my daughter.

390
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,528
We can discuss our business
after the party.

391
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,781
Unless of course the box
is of no importance to you.

392
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:26,329
Of course, Queen Milena.

393
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:30,541
Anything for the birthday girl.

394
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:34,170
Thank you, Your Lordship.

395
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:41,312
So then my pony pranced with joy

396
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:45,509
because it knew it belonged to
the prettiest princess in all the land.

397
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:50,189
When I was 3,
and too small to ride a real pony...

398
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,125
As charming as this is,

399
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,893
we do have more important
matters to attend to.

400
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,468
Of course, My Lord.

401
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,702
Finish quickly, puppeteer.

402
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:04,893
Lord Rahl has more important things
to do than watch your marionettes.

403
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,494
Yes, Your Majesty.

404
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:13,705
Beware, Darken Rahl,

405
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,450
I am the Seeker.

406
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,680
The time has finally come
for me to kill you

407
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,468
and fulfill the Prophecy.

408
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,346
What is the meaning of this?
Stop this at once.

409
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,340
No, please, continue with the show.

410
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:35,773
I'd like to see
how this little fairy-tale ends.

411
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,237
Come and fight me, you coward!

412
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,138
I came here to enjoy myself

413
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:47,076
and celebrate
the princess' birthday.

414
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:49,547
And here you are, as always,

415
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:52,498
trying to spoil the fun
for everybody.

416
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,573
You know, you really are
the worst Seeker ever.

417
00:29:58,115 --> 00:29:59,870
I'm going to have to kill you now

418
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:02,261
and end your silly quest.

419
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:13,532
Now,

420
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,809
shall we cut the cake?

421
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,615
Wait!

422
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,410
The show isn't over.

423
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:31,151
Why,

424
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:32,965
it's just begun.

425
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,589
Still here, Rahl?

426
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,924
Is that the best you can do, Seeker?

427
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,213
Fighting with you is so dull
I'm afraid I might fall asleep.

428
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,586
I beg you, stay awake.

429
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,715
A hero as great and noble as myself
would never kill a man in his sleep.

430
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:51,223
Your vanity is even greater
than the size of your sword.

431
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,236
Enough talk.
It's time for you to die.

432
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,653
Somebody's going to die,
that's for certain.

433
00:30:56,778 --> 00:31:00,024
But I rather suspect
it isn't going to be me!

434
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,173
Well done, puppeteer.

435
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:08,616
Forgive me, princess,

436
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:11,999
but the dull
business of state is calling.

437
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,580
As it is to your mother.

438
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:16,916
- Highness?
- Certainly, My Lord.

439
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,509
Hurry, Rachel.

440
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:31,284
They're on their way
to the Treasure Room.

441
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:55,603
Are you trying to trick me?

442
00:31:57,544 --> 00:31:58,544
I'm sorry?

443
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:00,965
This box is a counterfeit.

444
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,837
- That's not possible.
- Isn't it?

445
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,632
Someone has used magic

446
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,699
to turn an ordinary spice box

447
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:20,104
into a look-alike Box of Orden.

448
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:25,943
But there is nobody
with magic powers in my castle.

449
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,613
Your stupidity is stunning!

450
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:32,866
Seal the castle.
No one gets in or out.

451
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:34,806
And...

452
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:37,225
bring me

453
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,075
the puppeteer.

454
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,118
Queen Milena tells me

455
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,804
that you arrived in Tamarang
two days ago.

456
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:56,100
Yes, Lord Rahl.

457
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:59,518
I heard the princess
was looking for entertainers

458
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,749
and this opportunity to perform
for you and for Her Majesty

459
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,124
has been the pinnacle of my career.

460
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,866
Perhaps Your Lordship
has called me here

461
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:09,528
to see more of my artistry?

462
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,689
That's quite all right.

463
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,314
I already know what a master you are

464
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,330
at the art of pulling
people's strings.

465
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,916
Bind his hands.

466
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:25,711
What's this?

467
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:29,332
A cautionary measure
meant to insure my safety

468
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:32,931
against an untimely blast
of wizard's fire.

469
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:35,053
Wizard's fire?

470
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,348
Puppets dancing all by themselves.

471
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:41,143
It certainly looked like
Wizard's work to me.

472
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,896
 Lord Rahl, you flatter me too much.

473
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,857
I'll show you how the illusion works

474
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,240
if you promise not to tell a soul.

475
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,743
Why don't you show me

476
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,450
how this illusion works instead?

477
00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:00,033
Only a Wizard of the First Order

478
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:02,665
could conjure a false Box of Orden.

479
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,668
This looks like
an ordinary spice box to me.

480
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,795
Don't play games with me.

481
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:13,105
Only three Wizards of the First Order
have been born in a hundred years.

482
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,202
One died.

483
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:16,781
One works for me.
And the third...

484
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:18,704
What was his name?

485
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,970
Now I remember.

486
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:27,898
His name was Zeddicus

487
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:29,875
Zu'l

488
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:31,296
Zorander.

489
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:36,861
He disappeared right around the time
I cleansed the town of Brennidon

490
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:39,910
in an attempt to save the Midlands
from the false promises of the Seeker.

491
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,128
But now, the Seeker is back.

492
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,056
And here you are.

493
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:48,966
And here I am.

494
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:53,804
But where is the box?

495
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,121
Halt.

496
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,531
No one goes in or out.

497
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,150
But I go in and out all the time.

498
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:12,860
Sorry, little one.

499
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,530
The orders came
from Lord Rahl himself.

500
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,492
Can I have your name?

501
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,574
So I can tell the princess
I tried to follow her orders

502
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,180
but you wouldn't let me.

503
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:29,293
She likes to chop people's heads
off who don't obey her.

504
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,312
Especially on her birthday.

505
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:38,594
Tell me where the box is.

506
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,658
Now.

507
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:41,485
I've hidden it.

508
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:43,613
Magically.

509
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:46,433
Kill me and you'll never find it.

510
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,430
I have no intention
of killing you, Zeddicus.

511
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,371
I'm sure you'll keep your secret
till your dying breath,

512
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:54,401
but I do enjoy a challenge.

513
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,996
I've received a report
that one of Milena's guards

514
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:01,758
has allowed someone to pass
through the south gate.

515
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,703
- Who?
- A little girl. The princess' playmate.

516
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,544
Find her.

517
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,977
- I think I went the wrong way.
- Sara, which way should I go?

518
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:40,697
Please help me.

519
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,809
There she is!

520
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,380
Over there!

521
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:37,634
We have to run. Come on.

522
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,975
Are you Richard and Kahlan?

523
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:54,409
- Yes, we are.
- Ruben told me to find you.

524
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:03,655
Is this Ruben a tall man with long
white hair? Thinks he's really funny?

525
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:25,177
He did it.

526
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,077
Where's Zedd?

527
00:38:32,202 --> 00:38:33,610
I mean Ruben?

528
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:36,548
I think the bad man got him.

529
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:46,234
The great Darken Rahl,
master of D'Hara,

530
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:50,300
was defeated not by the Seeker
nor by the First Wizard,

531
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:53,915
but by a 10-year-old girl.

532
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:26,822
It's a puppet.

533
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:32,377
I told you I was
the grand puppeteer.

534
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:49,239
Sara, you can talk!

535
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,129
Where's Ruben?

536
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,839
Right here,

537
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,694
- hoping there's a bite of cake left.
- Ruben! Martha!

538
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,317
Martha, I was so worried about you.

539
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:05,496
I know you were, sweetheart.

540
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,612
You wouldn't leave the castle
without me.

541
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,783
I've told my boys so much about you.

542
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:13,827
They've always wanted
a little sister.

543
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,079
Would you like to live with us?

544
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,205
But Martha, what about
your own children?

545
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,752
How will you feed all of us?

546
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:24,838
Now, that reminds me,

547
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:26,840
where was it?

548
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,489
It's the Pink Sapphire
of Tramontana.

549
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:35,640
Think of it as a parting gift
from Princess Violet.

550
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,353
I'm sure she would want you
to have it.

551
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:56,296
How can I ever begin to apologize?

552
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:59,367
Be assured I will not rest

553
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:02,751
until the rats in my dungeon
are devouring the remains

554
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,297
of that thieving, lying Wizard.

555
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,590
Queen Milena, it's quite all right.

556
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,029
You couldn't have known
that we were all being deceived.

557
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:26,079
Thank you for your hospitality.

558
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:37,824
Have no fear for your daughter,
Your Highness.

559
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:41,364
She will grow up surrounded
by the most precious jewels.

560
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:43,999
As a slave in the deepest caverns

561
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,924
of the Mines of Athanasia.

562
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:54,779
Bring me my Journey Book.

563
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:58,818
Fascinating reading.

564
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:03,433
Lord Rahl leaves no detail
unattended to in his orders.

565
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,438
You were so close to him.

566
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,559
No matter how close I get,

567
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:13,234
only the Seeker can deal
the final blow.

568
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,033
No going home yet.

569
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:25,792
Lord Rahl is sending a message.

570
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,733
What's he saying?

571
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:38,782
Four words.

572
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,142
"I will find you."
