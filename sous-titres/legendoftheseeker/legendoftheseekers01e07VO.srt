1
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,842
This is terrible.

2
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,210
What do you see, Shota?

3
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:54,975
The future.

4
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:57,367
In three days' time,

5
00:00:58,152 --> 00:00:59,496
the Seeker will die.

6
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,041
Sync: dmbmh & Kasius

7
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,145
1x07 - <i>Identity</i>

8
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,339
The saddles would be arriving
in the next shipment.

9
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,805
But I've made special arrangements
to have the boots delivered tomorrow.

10
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:18,618
Anything to help the D'Haran cause.

11
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:20,495
Excellent service,

12
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,356
- as always.
- Well, you know

13
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:25,208
how much I appreciate all the business
you send my way, Commander.

14
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:28,783
Ready the horses.

15
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,128
Just a little something
to say thanks.

16
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,771
You're too kind.

17
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:52,959
We'll drink it in celebration
of your son's wedding.

18
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:24,923
Thank the Spirits.
I thought you were dead.

19
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:26,586
I almost was.

20
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:28,655
A few times.

21
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,232
Looks like business has been good.

22
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,281
A little too good, I'm afraid.

23
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,235
I have more customers now than ever.

24
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:44,079
- Unfortunately, they're all D'Harans.
- Imagine their surprise

25
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,021
if they found out all the money
they {\were giving}gave you was being funneled

26
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:50,178
- right back into the resistance.
- Well, some of it finds its way back

27
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,797
- into Commander Morcant's pockets.
- You pay him for information?

28
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,091
The bribes simply ensure
repeat business.

29
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,312
- His big mouth does the rest.
- Hopefully

30
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,679
your investment will pay off.
We need some of that information.

31
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,642
We've learned from an informant

32
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,915
that Darken Rahl is massing troops
at a place not far from here.

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
It's called Kelabra.

34
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,932
Most only speak that name
in a whisper,

35
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,327
if they speak it at all.

36
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,976
It was once the most opulent city
in the Midlands.

37
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,535
Until an invading army
lay siege to it.

38
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:23,323
Rather than surrender,
the Kelabran people killed themselves.

39
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:24,878
Their last dying act

40
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,186
was to curse anyone
that entered the city walls.

41
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,631
One year to the day,
Mount Mariah erupted,

42
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:33,326
burying the invaders
beneath in a rain of molten rock,

43
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:37,214
and destroyed all trace
of that once glorious city.

44
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,899
- What would the D'Harans want with it?
- I dunno. It's a forsaken wasteland.

45
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,405
Tomorrow I'll pay
Commander Morcant a visit.

46
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:50,060
If I know the commander, he won't be
able to keep his mouth shut about it.

47
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:54,405
Gryff, thiis Kahlan
and her friends Zedd and Richard.

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,196
The first true Seeker
in a thousand years.

49
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,311
It's an honor.

50
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,501
The Sword of Truth.

51
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,369
So it is true
about the nick on the hilt.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,082
The last true Seeker, Kieran,

53
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,251
got it
in the Battle of Barrier Peaks.

54
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:14,346
I always wondered
where it came from.

55
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,548
Since Gryff{\'s been able to} can read, he's been
quite the student of Seeker lore.

56
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:22,594
So, what brings you to town? I can't
imagine you're here for the wedding.

57
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,430
Yes, indeed.
My son's getting married.

58
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:27,572
Congratulations, Gryff.

59
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:31,311
Of all the magic in the world,
none is more powerful than love.

60
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,219
Dont tell me you learn to fight
like this from your Seeker books.

61
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:49,236
My father had me trained
by the best swordsmen in the area.

62
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,498
Maybe I could come with you.
Help you fight the D'Harans.

63
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:55,117
What would your bride
think about that?

64
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:56,526
Bronwyn?

65
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,323
Couldn't really tell you.

66
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,881
I barely know her.

67
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:06,304
- How's that?
- It's an arranged marriage.

68
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,347
Bronwyn's family has their name,

69
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:19,648
but not much else. The union
will restore her family's wealth

70
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:24,243
and my father will have
her family's influence

71
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,121
to strengthen the resistance.

72
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,113
But I'd rather be fighting Darken Rahl
than marrying a girl I hardly know.

73
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:45,453
You know, part of me envies you.

74
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,162
You get to settle down,
get married, raise a family.

75
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,600
That's something
I may never get to do.

76
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,216
But you have Kahlan, don't you?

77
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:57,542
But...

78
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,942
- we're not...
- I thought maybe you were.

79
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,335
Don't you need to be getting ready
for your wedding?

80
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,451
Bronwyn's a lucky girl.
And you'll make a fine husband.

81
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,386
You must not go to Kelabra.

82
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,771
- How did you know...?
- In two days' time,

83
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,059
the Seeker will die at Kelabra.

84
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,805
This I have seen in a vision.

85
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,392
- A vision?
- Of one possible future.

86
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:46,679
One you can change if you stay away
from that dreaded place.

87
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,027
Who are you?

88
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,450
That matters not.

89
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,650
You will know what I say is true

90
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,759
when you set eyes upon the eagle.

91
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,860
Whatever they have planned
at Kelabra, it's big.

92
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,935
They've been shipping in
barrels of Dragon's Breath,

93
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,563
a highly explosive ore.

94
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,237
- They must be arming for an attack.
- But on what?

95
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:36,035
- They already control the region.
- I couldn't find out exactly

96
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,791
what they've been planning,
but Darken Rahl's appointed someone

97
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,376
to oversee the operation.

98
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,210
A man called Nass.

99
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,381
Demmin Nass?

100
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,449
- You know him?
- Only by reputation.

101
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:53,596
Nass is Darken Rahl's
most trusted commander.

102
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,839
He's a butcher.

103
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,465
A ruthless enforcer.

104
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,190
If he's dispatching
his right-hand man to Kelabra,

105
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,563
I hate to think
what Rahl is plotting.

106
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,278
Maybe this is the chance
we've been waiting for.

107
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,411
I mean, we can
never find Darken Rahl because...

108
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,661
he's always changing his location.

109
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:20,246
But if this Demmin Nass
is his most trusted commander,

110
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,044
wouldn't he know where he is?

111
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,832
If we can infiltrate
the encampment at Kelabra

112
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,593
and get close to Demmin Nass...

113
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,703
I could confess him.

114
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:39,083
And we'd have one of Rahl's
inner circle as our ally.

115
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,811
And if we can find Rahl,
we can kill him.

116
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,357
My men are to deliver provisions
to the D'Harans.

117
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,020
But if you take my supply wagon
and make the delivery,

118
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,778
you can get inside the encampment.
This is a map of the encampment{\ up at Kelabra}.

119
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:54,228
I managed to steal it
while Morcant wasn't looking.

120
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,776
<i>When you set eyes upon the eagle...</i>

121
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,234
The eagle.

122
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,631
This woman told you
the Seeker will die at Kelabra?

123
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,188
This mission is already risky enough
without a vision of the Seeker's death.

124
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,373
We need to find out
how she knows we're going to Kelabra,

125
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,424
otherwise we could be
walking into a trap.

126
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:23,480
You better hurry.
According to Morcant,

127
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,924
Nass will be at the encampment
for only one day.

128
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,945
If we try to find this woman,
we could miss our only chance at Nass.

129
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,519
We don't even know if there's any truth
to this woman's warning.

130
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,226
We can't lose this opportunity.

131
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,124
Fool!

132
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,504
What troubles you, Shota?

133
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,841
My warning has gone unheed.

134
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:10,926
Who are you?

135
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:14,696
Someone who can give you
what you truly want.

136
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:19,068
- What are you talking about?
- You want a life of adventure.

137
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,952
You don't wanna be married.

138
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,373
There's nothing anyone
can do to change that.

139
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,071
Change?

140
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:30,879
There is much I can change.

141
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,259
I can change you into the Seeker.

142
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,286
When others look on you,
they'll see Richard Cypher.

143
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,720
And when they look on Cypher,

144
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,411
they will see you.

145
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,187
How can you do that?

146
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,564
It's already done.

147
00:10:58,485 --> 00:10:59,831
What are you doing?

148
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,865
Put down Richard's sword, Gryff.

149
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,559
The Sword of Truth is not a toy.

150
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,584
What's going on?

151
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,159
How did Gryff get his hands
on your sword, Richard?

152
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,298
No harm done,

153
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,972
but the Sword of Truth belongs
in the hands of the Seeker.

154
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,261
This is insane.
It's me, Richard.

155
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:24,015
Bronwyn is a very lucky girl.
And you'll make a fine husband.

156
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,196
I think we should get moving.

157
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:36,607
- Time to get married, son.
- What? I'm not your son. I'm not Gryff.

158
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:52,586
I need {\*to borrow }a horse. I need to get to Zedd
and Kahlan now, do you understand?

159
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:54,912
I understand perfectly.

160
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,255
I felt the same way on the day
I married your mother.

161
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,713
It's natural to feel nervous
on your wedding day.

162
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,971
- There is nothing natural...
- That's enough!

163
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,789
You are getting married,

164
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,742
so get your saddle on straight.
Your new in-laws are here.

165
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,401
- A fine day for a wedding.
- Yes, indeed.

166
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,861
And no one's more excited
than Gryff.

167
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:20,885
Where is he?

168
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:41,592
You would dishonor my sister
by leaving her at the wedding altar?

169
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:45,128
- There's been a mistake.
- The mistake is yours.

170
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:48,658
You have insulted Bronwyn
and you have insulted our family name.

171
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,362
I'm not who...

172
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,187
The only thing I wanna hear
out of your mouth are wedding vows.

173
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,363
This marriage will go ahead.

174
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,949
My family has too much
at stake for you ruin it.

175
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,619
I know your father's little secret.

176
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,916
So either you come back with us now

177
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,747
and marry our sister,
or I'll tell the D'Harans

178
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,075
your father's been helping
the resistance.

179
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,843
So, what's it going to be?

180
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,301
Above you are the stars.

181
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:30,622
Below you are the stones.

182
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,519
As time shall pass, remember,

183
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,758
like a stone should
your love be strong,

184
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,337
like a star should
your love be constant.

185
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:42,309
Bronwyn...

186
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,363
do you bind

187
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,180
your soul, your mind

188
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:52,144
and your body with this man?

189
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:58,902
And Gryff,

190
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,881
do you bind your soul,

191
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,673
your mind and your body

192
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,363
with this woman?

193
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,199
Then as the Spirits' witness,

194
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,108
you are bonded in blood.

195
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,582
For eternity,

196
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,407
you are now one.

197
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,669
Now the Seeker is trapped.

198
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,950
You've done it, Shota.

199
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,359
You've changed the future.

200
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:03,971
Assemble your men.

201
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:07,580
We must make sure that the Seeker
does not try to rejoin his friends

202
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,022
on their doomed mission.

203
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,780
I'll drive the supply wagon
up to the encampment.

204
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,337
The D'Harans will take the crates
to the command tent.

205
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,706
Only there won't be provisions
inside the crates,

206
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,965
there'll be you two.

207
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:32,054
I'll need to get Nass alone
if I'm going to confess him.

208
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,416
It won't be easy
with all those soldiers.

209
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,601
Any ideas, Seeker?

210
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:42,984
We should...

211
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:47,204
never do that which your enemy
will do for you.

212
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,187
What did you say?

213
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:53,951
It's just something the Seeker
of the Third Era used to say.

214
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,763
He was a shrewd tactician.

215
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,290
I know, I'm just surprised you did.

216
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:01,063
I read about it

217
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,659
in the book

218
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,214
Gryff gave me.
It has all the history of Seekers past.

219
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:13,387
I'm glad to see you're learning
from those who came before you.

220
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,476
What would the Seeker
of the Third Era suggest?

221
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,147
A diversion?

222
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,773
Good idea.

223
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:28,222
We could ignite
their stockpile of Dragon's Breath.

224
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,452
That would distract the soldiers,

225
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,570
and following D'Haran
military protocol,

226
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,703
they would take Demmin Nass
to the safety of the command tent...

227
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,164
Where Richard and I
would be waiting to confess him.

228
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,170
Let the D'Harans do our work for us.

229
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:48,632
Perhaps one day future Seekers
will be quoting you.

230
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:51,717
To my son Gryff,

231
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,429
and his lovely bride, Bronwyn.

232
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:56,360
To Gryff and Bronwyn.

233
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:06,459
If these things aren't comfortable,
we can take them off.

234
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,375
What's wrong with you?

235
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,320
You know tradition doesn't allow it.
It stays on until morning.

236
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:16,033
After we've spent our first night
together as man and wife?

237
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:21,120
I too would like
to offer my congratulations

238
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,291
to the bride and groom.

239
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,134
It is so wonderful

240
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,629
to see a union

241
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:30,883
of two souls.

242
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,770
A union that, I have no doubt,

243
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:36,024
will honor Darken Rahl

244
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,918
and all he so nobly fights for.

245
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:42,818
Join me in raising
a glass in tribute.

246
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,540
To Lord Rahl.

247
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:10,997
I'm afraid there's some pressing
business that I must attend to.

248
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,061
There are a lot of things
I want to say,

249
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,482
but first let me start
by wishing my little sister

250
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,113
and her new husband many,
many children.

251
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,118
We should get started
on that right away.

252
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,037
- I didn't realize you were so eager.
- I am. Believe me.

253
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Shall we?

254
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,905
I know this is gonna be
really hard for you to believe,

255
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,443
but I'm not who you think I am.

256
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,711
My name is Richard Cypher.

257
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,989
I'm the Seeker.

258
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,909
- Right, I'm the Confessor.
- I'm telling you the truth.

259
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,316
I don't know if it's a spell
or some enchantment,

260
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,706
but {\whatever it is, }when people look at me,
they think I'm Gryff.

261
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,999
Maybe that's because you are Gryff.

262
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:33,584
No, I'm the Seeker.

263
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,947
Now, it seems that
you don't have a love for Darken Rahl,

264
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:40,056
so will you please help me get out
of here so I can get to Kelabra

265
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,727
- and help fight the D'Harans?
- I can't believe this.

266
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:45,502
Do you actually think
I wanted to marry you?

267
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:49,485
Then why did you?

268
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:55,527
This was all my brothers' idea.

269
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:58,798
After our parents died,

270
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,526
they expect this marriage
to save the family's future,

271
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:05,787
even if it means ruing mine.

272
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,446
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

273
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,472
You're sorry?

274
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,963
I thought getting married would at least
mean I'd get out of my brother's house.

275
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,497
That was before I knew
I'd be locked to an insane person.

276
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:28,523
God...

277
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:43,069
Can't sleep?

278
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,619
I'm worrying about tomorrow.

279
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,405
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

280
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,181
How can anything happen to me?

281
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,278
I have the Sword of Truth.

282
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:58,714
And I have you.

283
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,432
I'm afraid that might not be enough.

284
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,943
What is it?

285
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,914
To commemorate the victory at Illya,

286
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:15,572
the Seeker of the Third Era
commissioned a magnificent dome

287
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,238
to be built at Aydindril.

288
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,194
After 40 years of carefully
placing the stones,

289
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:25,298
all that remained
was moving the last wouldn't support.

290
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,246
Would all their work crumble
to the ground,

291
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:30,847
or...

292
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,457
would it float among the clouds?

293
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,681
The dome at Aydindril has stood
for thousands of years.

294
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,689
I think the lesson is:
if you want something to stand,

295
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,482
you have to risk

296
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,269
letting it fall.

297
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:56,466
What would the Seeker
of the Third Era

298
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,124
say about Confessors
that worry too much?

299
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,435
I'm not too sure what he'd say.

300
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,543
But this Seeker...

301
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,736
would tell you
that he'd die for you.

302
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:12,326
Richard, no.

303
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:15,064
- You shouldn't say that.
- I can't help it.

304
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:17,141
It's how I feel.

305
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,441
I can't.

306
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,328
We can't.

307
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:38,875
- Kahlan, wait.
- This can never happen.

308
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,692
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,903
Bronwyn, you were right.

310
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:47,824
I shouldn't have pretended
to be somebody else.

311
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,201
But neither of us wants this.

312
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,292
What choice do we have now?
We're stuck with each other.

313
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:56,874
Maybe not.

314
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,371
You said you wanted
to see the world, right?

315
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:04,673
Then, let's go. Right now.

316
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:07,656
When we're far enough
away from here,

317
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:10,430
we'll get this thing off
and we can go our separate ways.

318
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:12,931
This is solid gold.

319
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,733
You can take it and sell it
for enough money

320
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,945
to start whatever life you want.

321
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,521
How?

322
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,008
Out that window.

323
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:32,660
How long it'll take them
to realize we're not there?

324
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:35,363
I'm not sure.
But we'll be long gone by then.

325
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:37,368
You're not going anywhere.

326
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,060
It's okay.

327
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,423
Just...

328
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,536
don't hurt the girl.

329
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:57,894
Drop it, Seeker.

330
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,481
Or the girl dies.

331
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:31,956
Are you all right?

332
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,222
That man, he called you "Seeker."

333
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:38,820
You were telling the truth before.

334
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:43,793
You really are him!

335
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:57,235
Take this.

336
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,915
Now, will you be all right
to get through the forest on your own?

337
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,251
I'm coming with you.

338
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,171
It's too dangerous. My friends are about
to attack the D'haran camp

339
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,132
with someone who's not the Seeker.

340
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,676
- I have to move quickly.
- Then you need me.

341
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,847
I know a shortcut to Kelabra.
Through the caves.

342
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,899
If your friends really are in danger,
then the fastest way to reach them

343
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,351
is for me to take you.

344
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:28,161
These caves lead to
the catacombs at Kelabra.

345
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,287
Never thought this is where
I'd spend my honeymoon.

346
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:41,435
Well, you and I
aren't exactly married.

347
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,762
I know, but this is
the first time in my life

348
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:46,002
I feel like
I'm doing something important,

349
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,129
which is a lot better than being
the wife of a merchant's son.

350
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,669
Well, you don't know the real Gryff.

351
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:54,370
You should give him a chance.
He's more than you think.

352
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,393
I would rather go fight the D'Harans

353
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,639
than marry someone
I have nothing in common with.

354
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:02,379
Funny, Gryff said
the same thing about you.

355
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,854
What is it?

356
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:17,754
Nothing.

357
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:21,150
I don't have to be a Confessor
to know you're not telling the truth.

358
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,771
Richard almost kissed me last night.

359
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,367
This is exactly what I feared
would happen.

360
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:40,007
You cannot put off telling
Richard the truth any longer.

361
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,103
I know.

362
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:47,417
I'm just worried about the mission.

363
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,357
I don't want this
to be a distraction.

364
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:52,093
Clearly it's already a distraction.

365
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:16,722
Kahlan,

366
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:21,638
I want to apologize for last night.

367
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:25,674
I should be the one apologizing.

368
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,642
It's okay if you don't feel
the same way about me.

369
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:30,939
No, that's not it.

370
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,894
There's something I should have
told you a long time ago.

371
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,242
A Confessor's power is...

372
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:48,806
always present.

373
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:52,719
We have to hold it in

374
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:54,838
at all times.

375
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:58,189
Is that difficult?

376
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,509
Especially, if I were
with someone I love.

377
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,083
Then the power
couldn't be controlled.

378
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:19,869
In a moment of...

379
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:22,450
ecstasy,

380
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,756
it would be unleashed.

381
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,153
My lover's soul would be taken.

382
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:33,309
Then he would become a slave.

383
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:38,963
That's why we can never be together.

384
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,411
You wouldn't be yourself anymore.

385
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,560
And you couldn't fulfill
your destiny.

386
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,392
I'm sorry, Richard.

387
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,157
General Nass, it's a pleasure
to have you with us.

388
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,696
Pleasure isn't why I'm here.

389
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:29,922
Of course.

390
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:33,353
You'll be happy to know
our plans are ahead of schedule.

391
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,570
Good.

392
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:37,419
Then Lord Rahl will have his victory
sooner than expected.

393
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:41,757
The excavations are
progressing well, commander.

394
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:44,842
We believe the royal vault
is just beyond the wall.

395
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,657
What was that?

396
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:22,365
We need to get out of here
before the cave collapses!

397
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,544
Come on!

398
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:51,890
Jump!

399
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,610
You know these people?

400
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,991
He's the son of a local merchant.

401
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:12,657
Very loyal to the D'Haran cause.

402
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:14,666
Or they're spies.

403
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:16,405
Lock them up!

404
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,094
I'll find out who they really are.

405
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:33,224
You're supposed to be
on your honeymoon, Gryff.

406
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:36,257
What could possibly have made
you want to come here?

407
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,441
I'd think you should be more
concerned with how my father

408
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,567
will react to you
treating me this way.

409
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,697
He's always been loyal to you.

410
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,819
Nass is determined to question you.

411
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:51,185
There's nothing I can do.

412
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,631
Then I guess there's nothing
I can do, either.

413
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,390
When Nass questions me,
I'm going to tell him

414
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,952
all about the bribes
my father has been paying you.

415
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:01,607
Keep your voice down.

416
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:04,482
There is nothing I can do.

417
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,520
You can help me escape.

418
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:11,282
I think we'd agree,
it'd be best if I wasn't here.

419
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,092
Infantry, halt!

420
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:42,458
Special provisions
for Commander Morcant.

421
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:45,079
That had to be delievered
to the commander tent.

422
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,731
- What are you looking for?
- There has to be something here

423
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:17,283
that will tell us
what Nass is doing at Kelabra.

424
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,863
What does it say?

425
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I...

426
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,770
- I can't read this.
- Of course you can.

427
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:48,108
I don't even know
what language this is.

428
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,062
You've read it before. It's the same
as the <i>Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

429
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:03,271
Who are you?

430
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,679
- The fuse is lit.
- We can't go through with this.

431
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,516
- What are you talking about?
- He's not the Seeker. He's Gryff.

432
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,186
I think that old woman
have done it to try to save Richard,

433
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,188
to prevent her vision
of the Seeker's death from coming true.

434
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,646
The Seeker's death?

435
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,472
That's why the old woman did this?

436
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:33,445
I'm supposed to die in his place?

437
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,423
We've to abandon the mission.

438
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,785
We're under attack!

439
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,185
It's a little late for that.

440
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:53,339
Get General Nass
to the command tent. Now!

441
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,630
- I've to get out of here.
- You can't!

442
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,814
- Nass is on his way.
- But I'm not the Seeker!

443
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,555
That won't matter to Demmin Nass.

444
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,036
The Seeker.

445
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:14,278
No, I'm not him.

446
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,244
Get up!

447
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,108
You okay?

448
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:29,561
The mines are collapsing!
Where's the commander?

449
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,120
Commander!
The tunnels are collapsing.

450
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:52,376
We have to move now.

451
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,371
Come on.

452
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:06,974
It appears the old woman's spell
lasted just long enough

453
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,498
to revert her vision of your death.

454
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:13,928
It's been a long time since
I've seen magic that powerful.

455
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,073
Listen,

456
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:20,862
what you told me last night,
I know it was meant for Richard, but...

457
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,366
After worrying all this time,
I told the wrong person.

458
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:27,472
You should tell Richard.

459
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,067
This is for you.

460
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:38,171
It tells the history
of Seekers past.

461
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,529
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry for...

462
00:37:40,915 --> 00:37:42,759
going along with
the old woman's plans.

463
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,877
I know there's more to being the Seeker
than wielding a magic sword.

464
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,231
I guess I just wanted
to make a difference.

465
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,379
You don't have to be the Seeker
to do that.

466
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,255
I heard you got married.

467
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:12,442
It was a lovely ceremony.

468
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:18,503
I just had to do what I had
to get back to you and Zedd.

469
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:20,897
I'm glad you did.

470
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,345
Are you all right?

471
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:27,636
I'm fine.

472
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:31,154
It appears the resistance
has grown by two.

473
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,640
Would've been three if we were able
to confess Demmin Nass.

474
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:39,107
The important thing is
we kept Gryff from harm, and...

475
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,958
and averted the vision
of the Seeker's death.

476
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,040
We did more than that.

477
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:46,825
We found this.

478
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,488
Maybe it can tell us
what he wanted at Kelabra.

479
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:59,303
It's a record
of the day Kelabra fell.

480
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:03,048
"With the walls crumbling,

481
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,397
"the Kelabrans killed themselves

482
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,703
to protect the city's
greatest secret."

483
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,595
And what is the secret?

484
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:16,145
The final resting place

485
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,438
of their greatest treasure.

486
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,857
"A Box of Orden."

487
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,453
What is it?

488
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,888
There are three boxes of orden.

489
00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:41,986
Each one contains
unimaginably powerful magic.

490
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:47,009
Whoever gains possession

491
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:49,144
of all three boxes...

492
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,025
would be unstoppable.

493
00:39:53,397 --> 00:39:56,944
Darken Rahl would enslave
the entire world.

494
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:01,354
He would be invincible.

495
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,111
General Nass.

496
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:11,011
The Seeker and the others
have escaped into the forest.

497
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,921
We have what we came for.

498
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:20,414
We must bring Lord Rahl his prize.

499
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:24,140
Prepare your men. We leave for
the People's Palace immediately.

500
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:31,359
Soon Lord Rahl will have
all three boxes,

501
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,122
and the Seeker will be finished.

502
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:43,774
It's good to see you alive, Seeker.

503
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,318
You have my vision
to thank for that.

504
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,030
Your vision is the reason Demmin Nass
got away with the Box of Orden.

505
00:40:50,937 --> 00:40:51,823
Shota!

506
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,827
I feared it was you behind
such diabolical magic.

507
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,705
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

508
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:02,750
The years have not been kind.

509
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:11,764
Zedd, you know her?

510
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,893
Once, when I was
a foolish young Wizard

511
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,136
and ventured into
that seductress' lair.

512
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,392
- Few have ever complained.
- Few have ever lived long enough to.

513
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,964
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

514
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:25,510
- Who is she?
- A powerful sorceress

515
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:27,439
who rules Agaden Reach,

516
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:30,528
using her twisted magic
to shape events in her favor.

517
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,571
And she's no friend of the Seeker!

518
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,366
Nor am I a friend of Darken Rahl.

519
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:37,536
If he gains dominion
over this world,

520
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,402
I'll be enslaved by his magic.

521
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:42,744
I must help the Seeker,

522
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:46,460
for the Prophecy says only
he can defeat Darken Rahl.

523
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:50,006
- Then why play these games?
- Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander

524
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,675
would accept no help from me.

525
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,177
With good reason.

526
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:57,967
I suggest we get as far away
from this witch as we possibly can.

527
00:41:58,242 --> 00:41:59,974
You can run from me,

528
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,352
but you cannot run away
from the prophecy.

529
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:05,976
What are you talking about?

530
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,256
I lived.

531
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,499
We averted your prophecy.

532
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,489
That was a vision.

533
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,483
A momentary glimpse
of a possible future.

534
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,487
Something written
in the halls of prophecy

535
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,369
cannot be changed.

536
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,576
And what is this prophecy?

537
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,769
It is written that the Seeker

538
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,596
will be betrayed
by the one closest to him.

539
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:30,827
You will be betrayed...

540
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:33,579
by the one in white.
