1
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,376
Richard, he's fine.

2
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:39,485
Who?

3
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,678
- What are you talking about?
- You can't hide anything from me.

4
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,853
There's nothing to worry about.

5
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,175
Trust me.

6
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,514
Do you know where Zedd went?

7
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:56,055
He told you where he's hiding
the Box of Orden, didn't he?

8
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,225
I can't believe he would trust you
and not me.

9
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,878
I have no idea where Zedd is.

10
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,966
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

11
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:13,428
Come on.

12
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:24,332
Stop!

13
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:27,878
Who are you
and why are you following us?

14
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:33,843
Chase.

15
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,716
- What are you doing here?
- I'll explain everything,

16
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,562
but there's a D'Haran quad
on my tail.

17
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:47,982
I have a feeling they consider
the Seeker a bigger prize than me.

18
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:54,447
1x14 - <i>Hartland</i>

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,736
He's dead.

20
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,048
Chase, stop!

21
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:58,896
It's okay.

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Better?

23
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,837
Now maybe you can tell us

24
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,106
what you're doing

25
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,960
in the Midlands?

26
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:24,912
I've been in a D'Haran labor camp.

27
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,250
You remember that dragon?

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,085
 The one that tried
to kill my daughter?

29
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,299
Laura!

30
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:39,301
The Gar.

31
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,010
After the Boundary was opened,

32
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,642
dozens of those beasts
swarmed into Hartland.

33
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,648
They slaughtered livestock...

34
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:56,610
... children.

35
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,782
I had to do something,

36
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:04,159
so I went to see your brother.

37
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,208
What are you doing here, Chase?

38
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:13,723
If I'm to save this village,

39
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:16,321
I need every able-bodied man
back under my command.

40
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,484
You're not the captain of the Guard
anymore.

41
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,843
You lost that honor
when you sided with my brother.

42
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,220
There are monsters out there,
killing our people.

43
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,000
Citizens that you as First Councilor
are sworn to protect.

44
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,723
Now let me do my job.

45
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:36,025
This time,
your brother did the right thing.

46
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,761
But when we reached the Boundary,

47
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:41,947
it wasn't just Gars
we had to deal with.

48
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,624
A battalion of D'Harans
was coming in.

49
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,185
We tried to fight but they...

50
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,541
They killed most of my men
and clapped me in irons.

51
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,202
Those D'Harans...

52
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:06,073
they know
how to break a man's spirit.

53
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,975
I almost gave up but,

54
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,150
a few days ago

55
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,290
they brought in another prisoner,
telling tales of the Seeker.

56
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,567
He had heard you were nearby.

57
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,696
That my friend Richard Cypher
had the D'Harans on the run.

58
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,636
You don't know the strength
that gave me.

59
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:27,797
The hope.

60
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,810
Next chance I got,
I made a run for it.

61
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,605
But I knew
they'd send a quad after me

62
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,230
and I was in no shape
to stay ahead of them for long, so...

63
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,051
I came looking for you.

64
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,313
I can't thank you enough.

65
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,313
Now

66
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:59,438
if you can spare a horse
and some food...

67
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,700
Chase, what are you talking about?
You're with us now.

68
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,239
I gotta get back to Hartland.

69
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,135
I gotta find my family.

70
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,957
Then we're coming with you.

71
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,307
But Darken Rahl
is in the opposite direction.

72
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,375
Kahlan's right.

73
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,086
You have a bigger fight, my friend.

74
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,714
I've seen what Rahl's forces
can do to people.

75
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,050
If I can't protect my own village,
what kind of a Seeker am I?

76
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,601
Both of you are wanted men.

77
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,914
If we're going to do this...

78
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,191
you should dress appropriately.

79
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,397
So how do we get past them?

80
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,984
We have these uniforms.
Maybe we can just walk through.

81
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,779
If they start asking questions?

82
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,370
I know how we can get across.

83
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,165
Your orders, sir.

84
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,833
Do you recognize this?

85
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,294
Dragon Corps.

86
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,794
No member of the Corps
answers to a foot soldier.

87
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:45,919
Now move.

88
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,967
I'm sorry, sir. No one may pass
without proper documents.

89
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,621
By order of the viceroy.

90
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,724
Funny you should mention
the viceroy.

91
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,295
Guess who we're delivering
this little lovely to?

92
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,729
If you turn us away,

93
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:04,942
he's gonna demand to know
who disrupted his entertainment plans.

94
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,244
Let them pass!

95
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,027
Emma?

96
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:27,922
Emma! Laura!

97
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,304
No one's been here in a while.

98
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,768
If those bastards have done anything
to my family...

99
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,354
We'll go into town. We'll find someone
who knows where they are.

100
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,960
They are D'Harans everywhere.

101
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:12,871
They've taken over.

102
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:19,795
Anna?

103
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,156
Who is she?

104
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,975
Just someone I used to know.

105
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,720
I'd say she was
a little more than that.

106
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,812
It's Michael.

107
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:11,547
People of Hartland,

108
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:13,781
let us pray.

109
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:19,638
Master Rahl, guide us.

110
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,640
Master Rahl, teach us.

111
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,724
Master Rahl, protect us.

112
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,809
In your light we thrive.

113
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,906
In your mercy we are sheltered.

114
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,176
In your wisdom we are humbled.

115
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:44,226
Seek cover! Protect yourselves!

116
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,038
Brave soldiers,

117
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,583
all of Hartland thanks you
and honors you for your courage!

118
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,179
All hail the savior of Hartland:

119
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,730
Lord Rahl!

120
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,681
Things have really changed
around here.

121
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:48,790
It's almost as if
everyone's under the D'Harans' spell.

122
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,711
If there's magic at work,
we can't trust anyone.

123
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,069
So how do we find my family?

124
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,191
Hello, Michael.

125
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,684
Surprised to see me?

126
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,270
- How did you get past my...
- Quiet.

127
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,118
Now, we're walking out of here
together.

128
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:30,298
If you try to call for help, you be dead
before  the words get out of your mouth.

129
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,142
You wouldn't kill your own brother.

130
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:37,413
I seem to remember you telling me
we weren't brothers,

131
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,241
right after you accused me
of killing Dad.

132
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,396
Now move.

133
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:47,148
- Where is my family?
- The D'Harans moved them.

134
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,373
- Moved them where?
- I don't know. Someplace safe.

135
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,191
Gars were attacking people.

136
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:55,440
You expect me to believe those butchers
are interested in my family?

137
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,509
I don't know where they are.

138
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,944
I swear it.

139
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,008
Look at me.

140
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,578
He's telling the truth.

141
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:18,130
Of course I am.
The D'Harans saved Hartland.

142
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,086
Saved? How?

143
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,536
Lord Rahl sent his sorcerers
to seal the Boundary,

144
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,951
to protect us from the Gars

145
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,072
and the other magic
that was coming through.

146
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,308
But they couldn't close it again.
Lord Rahl sent soldiers to protect us.

147
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,444
The D'Harans are liars and murders.

148
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,771
You really believe they're here
for the good of Hartland?

149
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,731
The Gars
are no longer killing our people.

150
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:39,331
Our village is safe, prosperous.

151
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,404
And we have Lord Rahl
to thank for that.

152
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,407
I imagine you have a lot
to thank Lord Rahl for.

153
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,326
So who do you take orders from

154
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:51,492
in exchange for all this safety
and prosperity?

155
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:56,874
The viceroy.

156
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:04,741
Viceroy.

157
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,929
The Gar attack
has alarmed the villagers.

158
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,795
More are asking to be moved away
from the Boundary.

159
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:13,935
Do as they ask.

160
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,897
Sir, why do we coddle these people?

161
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,983
Hearts and minds, lieutenant.

162
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,647
Our army is stretched thin.

163
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:26,333
We can't subjugate every village
in the three territories by force.

164
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,462
So if Lord Rahl's empire is to expand,
he must be a friend to the people.

165
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,905
Now if that's all,
I have a personal matter to attend to.

166
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,383
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,619
- I brought you a little something.
- Anna.

168
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,271
Thank you.

169
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,683
I guess things around here have changed
more than we thought.

170
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,482
I invited you here for a meal,
some conversation.

171
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,575
I think maybe
you have the wrong impression of me.

172
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:53,743
I can't help myself
when I'm around you.

173
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,771
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you had put me under an enchantment.

174
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:01,513
Do clever words like those
make other girls swoon?

175
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:04,879
There are no others.

176
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:07,419
You expect me
to believe that a dashing,

177
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:10,500
brilliant man like you
has no prospects

178
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,458
other than a simple girl
from Hartland?

179
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,933
Simple is not a word
I would use to describe you.

180
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,957
Are we just gonna wait out here
all night?

181
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,610
Look, this can't be easy for you,
knowing what's probably happening.

182
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,654
But if we force our way in,
Anna could get hurt.

183
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:36,036
Is there any news of my brother?

184
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:39,152
I've got every available man
searching for him.

185
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:41,082
I'll find him. I promise.

186
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:45,962
I'm going to take care of you.

187
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,573
This isn't your home.

188
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,637
Someday you'll have to leave.

189
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,388
Is that what's bothering you?

190
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,770
I've requested permanent assignment
as Lord Rahl's envoy in Hartland.

191
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,231
I've fallen in love
with this charming village.

192
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,027
Just as I'm falling in love
with you.

193
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,327
Are you all right?

194
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,206
- Too much wine.
- Sit down.

195
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,248
We can't just stand here.

196
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,098
Chase? I don't believe it.

197
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,392
What are you doing here?
I heard...

198
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:26,901
Are you...?

199
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,816
We're just trying
not to be recognized.

200
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:32,612
I don't understand.

201
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:36,614
We don't have a lot of time.
We know the viceroy's in there.

202
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,878
Have you been spying on me?

203
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:44,921
- Richard, it's not what you think.
- You don't owe me an explanation.

204
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,351
But these D'Harans are dangerous.

205
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,559
- You can't trust that man.
- I know.

206
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,588
That's why
I've been trying to get close to him.

207
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:56,760
My brother's missing.
He hasn't been seen in months.

208
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,679
Rumors are the D'Harans
are kidnapping people,

209
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,015
forcing them to serve
in Darken Rahl's army.

210
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:05,351
Chase's family is missing too.

211
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:07,687
I'm sorry.

212
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,565
What would their army want
with my wife and children?

213
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,174
Anna, you should probably go.

214
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:18,556
We're going to speak to the viceroy
and it's better if you're not around.

215
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,789
You can't.

216
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:22,764
I sprinkled Rama leaf into his wine.

217
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,537
He'll be out for at least two hours.

218
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,738
But I do have this.

219
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,179
A key?

220
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,637
To the safe
in the viceroy's chambers.

221
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:37,891
If the D'Harans did have something
to do with all this,

222
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,511
the answers may be in there.

223
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:48,181
Chase will warn us if anyone comes along
but we'd better hurry.

224
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,900
When I came back to Hartland,
I looked for you.

225
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:57,022
They told me
you'd fallen under the spell of a witch,

226
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,678
killed your father,
and gone to the Midlands.

227
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:01,403
Anna, that's not true.

228
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:06,897
Do you remember when we were little
and you thought you saw

229
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,290
a tree goblin behind your house?

230
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,292
I told the constable we both saw it.

231
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:14,792
Do you know why?

232
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,840
Because I believed you.

233
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,303
Just like I'll believe you now
if you tell me what really happened.

234
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:29,114
I went to the Midlands
because of a thousand-year-old prophecy.

235
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,063
It says I'm destined to kill Darken Rahl
and free the world from his tyranny.

236
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,360
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

237
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:44,701
I always had a feeling
you were meant for bigger things.

238
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,670
Maybe that's why I moved away.

239
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:51,793
Something told me
you were gonna leave Hartland,

240
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,445
so I left
before I got my heart broken.

241
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:01,092
Over here.

242
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,706
It's a record book.

243
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,655
Troop deployments, supply requests.

244
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,492
Transport orders.
There's a list of names.

245
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,750
There's your brother.

246
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:35,001
So the D'Harans did take him.
Does it say where?

247
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,963
Northwood Grove.
It's only a few leagues from Hartland.

248
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,507
He was taken there two months ago.

249
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:46,562
All of these people were sent there.
That doesn't make any sense.

250
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,143
There's nothing in that grove.

251
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,940
- What about Chase's family?
- They're not here.

252
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:54,479
Why would the D'Harans send my brother
to a grove in the middle of nowhere?

253
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,962
We're too late.
He's gone.

254
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:07,342
They're feeding people to the Gars.

255
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:21,877
You know, my brother was a good man

256
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,610
until you put him under your spell.

257
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,806
You may have grown up with Richard,

258
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,203
but you don't know
the first thing about him.

259
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,065
He's not under anyone's spell.

260
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,584
And to the people of the Midlands,

261
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,600
he's a hero.

262
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:43,796
Richard Cypher, a hero.

263
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,429
This is what your D'Haran friends
are doing to your people.

264
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,892
- I don't understand...
- Don't play stupid, bastard.

265
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,228
- Did you feed my family to the Gars?
- What are you talking about?

266
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,230
The D'Harans
protect us from the Gars.

267
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,233
That's what they want you to think.

268
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,028
The Gar attack in the square
when the soldiers shot it out of the sky

269
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,655
- I think it was staged.
- Staged?

270
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,567
They have Gars chained outside town.

271
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:15,036
When anyone questions
why the D'Harans are here,

272
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,435
they release one of the Gars.

273
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,707
Their soldiers kill it
in front of witnesses.

274
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,575
Michael declares the D'Harans
heroes,

275
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,671
and everyone
pledges their allegiance to Rahl.

276
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,766
This is your seal, isn't it?

277
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,805
"Office of the First Council."

278
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,096
You gave the D'Harans these names.

279
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:35,216
Why?

280
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:39,310
They wanted volunteers,
men to enlist in their army.

281
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,315
The viceroy asked me for the names
of those who didn't wanna join.

282
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,090
People like my brother?

283
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:48,361
So they sent him to the Grove to be fed
to the Gars along with all the others.

284
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:03,668
The viceroy told me that they would find
other ways for the people to be useful.

285
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,154
They found another way.

286
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:20,184
They told me Hartland had to do its part
for the D'Haran cause.

287
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:24,188
I thought I was keeping
the town safe.

288
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:27,525
I didn't know.

289
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,570
Didn't know, or didn't want to know?

290
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:46,294
I wanna help you stop them.

291
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:53,687
How?

292
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:56,603
Every evening,
I lead the town in prayer.

293
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:59,265
Instead,
I could tell people the truth.

294
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,768
I'm still First Councilor,
they will listen to me.

295
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:04,520
And they'll rise up.

296
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:08,232
There's one problem. The viceroy
stands with me during the prayer.

297
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,321
Once he realizes what you're doing,
he'll have you killed.

298
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,771
Not if I distract him.

299
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,327
Distract him how?

300
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:22,496
I could visit the viceroy
in his chambers,

301
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,166
keep him there
while Michael makes his speech.

302
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:28,461
How many more people are gonna die
if we don't stop them?

303
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,395
There are soldiers in the square.

304
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,801
- What if they try and stop the speech?
- We'll be there to assure they don't.

305
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:39,055
And if Michael points out the Seeker
to the guards instead?

306
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,182
We'll just have to trust him.

307
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,452
I admire her spirit.

308
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:00,903
She's always had a mind of her own.

309
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,492
How long were the two of you...?

310
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:06,245
We were always close,

311
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:08,760
since we were crawling on all fours.

312
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:12,285
After Darken Rahl is defeated,
maybe you could come back.

313
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:14,715
And you and Anna could pick up
where you left off.

314
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:19,085
Why are we talking about this?

315
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:24,964
Because you deserve a normal life.

316
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,079
A wife.

317
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:28,958
A family.

318
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,734
Wouldn't be fair to Anna.

319
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,487
Why not?

320
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,076
How could I marry her when my heart
belongs to somebody else?

321
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,286
Wait outside.

322
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,139
I didn't expect to see you.

323
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,926
I thought I'd surprise you.

324
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,703
You were gone when I woke up.

325
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,240
My niece was ill.

326
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:36,031
And you were so tired,
I didn't wanna wake you.

327
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:46,289
I owe you an apology.

328
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:50,338
I've been pushing you away.

329
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,564
The truth is,

330
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:55,955
I have feelings for you too.

331
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:58,694
I was just afraid
you were gonna leave.

332
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,115
But now that you're staying...

333
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:07,379
I don't wanna keep you waiting
anymore.

334
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,049
- I have to go.
- Please stay with me.

335
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:38,174
I can't.

336
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:40,898
But I'll be back.

337
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,210
Anna, what are you doing?

338
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Guards!

339
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,967
- Why?
- You killed my brother!

340
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,231
How many people
did you feed to those monsters?

341
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:19,608
How many?!

342
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:23,654
And I actually thought
we had a future.

343
00:30:36,987 --> 00:30:38,437
People of Hartland,

344
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:41,255
I have something very important
to talk about this evening.

345
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:54,852
Is there a problem?

346
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:59,125
Then begin the invocation.

347
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:09,408
People of Hartland...

348
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,053
... let us pray.

349
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,792
Master Rahl, guide us.

350
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,656
Master Rahl, teach us.

351
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:26,050
Master Rahl, protect us.

352
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:29,001
In your light, we thrive.

353
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:31,347
In your mercy, we are sheltered.

354
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:39,480
- Where's Anna?
- They've taken her.

355
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:40,754
Where?

356
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,233
Northwood Grove.

357
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,106
It's the Seeker!

358
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,450
It's all right.

359
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,258
Viceroy, the prisoner's been rescued

360
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:31,425
by a man
wielding the Sword of Truth.

361
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:37,724
Did you know your brother
was in Hartland?

362
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,075
Of course not.

363
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,775
Richard Cypher's a traitor to my family,
he's no brother to me.

364
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,750
Lord Rahl anticipated
the Seeker might return home.

365
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:02,575
You know what your orders are.

366
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:08,331
What orders?

367
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,138
You have to leave now.

368
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,767
- Leave? Why?
- They lied to me from the beginning.

369
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:25,729
They never tried to close the Boundary.
They been using magic to keep it open.

370
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:29,178
How?

371
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,242
The arch they built at the border,

372
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,517
it has magical properties.

373
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:37,366
It's kept the passage
from closing up.

374
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:39,961
The viceroy's on his way
to destroy the arch.

375
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:41,870
He says the Boundary
will then seal itself.

376
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,706
They'll cut off
the only route to here.

377
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,541
Defeating the Seeker
is more important.

378
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:49,420
They wanna trap you
on this side of the border.

379
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:51,588
Because if you can't return
to the Midlands,

380
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:54,413
you'll never be able
to defeat Darken Rahl.

381
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,106
Viceroy, a rider approaches.

382
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,900
First Councilor?

383
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:10,603
Don't do this.

384
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,318
Hartland needs the Boundary open.

385
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:17,035
You know very well
I have orders from Lord Rahl.

386
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,912
You'd be cutting off
our only trade route with the Midlands.

387
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,243
Think of your men.

388
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,034
All of you will be trapped
on this side of the Boundary.

389
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,750
A sacrifice we're willing to make
to defeat the Seeker.

390
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:29,591
I'm not.

391
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,800
Councilor, don't make the same mistake
your brother did.

392
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:53,525
One man cannot defy Lord Rahl.

393
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:56,779
You're right.

394
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,065
We'll get you to a healer.

395
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:48,557
It's too late.

396
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,934
Stay with me.

397
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:55,765
When I see our father

398
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,816
in the underworld...

399
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:01,966
I'll tell him

400
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:04,624
my brother

401
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,365
was a great hero.

402
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:37,555
You will order the Gars destroyed,

403
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,691
and disband all D'Haran forces
in Hartland.

404
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,069
Once I've left,

405
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,322
you will obey Anna's commands as if
they were my own, do you understand?

406
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:47,282
I will do as you bid, My Lady.

407
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:51,787
I wish I could control men
like that.

408
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,830
He has to tell the truth,
isn't that right?

409
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:01,001
My family were taken by your men.

410
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,410
Where are they?

411
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:05,842
I was ordered to gather women, children
and send them to the Keep of Edraan.

412
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:11,932
- It's in the Midlands.
- You've heard of this place?

413
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:14,005
Only in rumors.

414
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,562
The Keep is protected by dark
and powerful magic.

415
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,239
Why were they sent there?

416
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,551
I don't know.

417
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:27,155
We'll find your family, I promise.

418
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:29,345
Even if we do,

419
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:35,496
Rahl will keep sending soldiers
across the Boundary to kill more people.

420
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:44,214
Then I guess we're going to have to do
what he wanted.

421
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,264
Close the Boundary.

422
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,398
You'll set the charges
and destroy the arch

423
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:58,770
once Richard, Chase and I
are on the Midlands side.

424
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,316
After we fought so hard
to keep the D'Harans from closing it.

425
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,891
I'd ask you to stay,
but I know you have a bigger destiny.

426
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
And other people who need you.

427
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:34,765
There's something else very important
I need you to do.

428
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,975
It's an urgent message

429
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:42,272
from the high viceroy in Hartland.

430
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:45,075
What does the viceroy report?

431
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:50,082
"Lord Rahl,
I have the most glorious news."

432
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:53,704
In accordance
with your standing orders,

433
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:57,862
the Boundary has been sealed.

434
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,077
As for the Seeker...

435
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:07,255
- What of the Seeker?
- My Lord...

436
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:17,766
Is this message authentic?

437
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:21,153
It's in the viceroy's hand,
I'm certain of it.

438
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:25,202
My Lord, you've succeed.

439
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,654
The Seeker is dead.

440
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:01,726
Now there's really
no going home again.

441
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,690
I'm sorry about Michael.

442
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:15,828
We should get moving

443
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:19,748
before the D'Harans send troops
to inspect their handiwork.

444
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:23,123
If we run into them, got an extra pair
of hands to fight them with now.
