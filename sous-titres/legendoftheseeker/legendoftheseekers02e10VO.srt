1
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:02,733
<i>Richard Cypher,</i>

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:05,134
<i>you are the true Seeker.</i>

3
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:24,772
Richard, wake up.

4
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,391
It's late.

5
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,670
Richard, this is not the day
for you to sleep in.

6
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,633
Verna?

7
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,415
How'd I get back here?

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,110
Where else would you be?

9
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,066
I escaped from here.

10
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,729
I was headed for my friends.

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,426
Richard, you haven't
left the palace

12
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,125
since you came here
to be trained as a Wizard.

13
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,552
No.

14
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,814
This is a trick.

15
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,977
You're suffering
from Lacna'Han.

16
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:09,672
When Wizards near the end
of their training,

17
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,502
they're sometimes
plagued by

18
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:13,035
lost memories
and strange dreams.

19
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:16,434
The intense concentration
required by their studies

20
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,899
overwhelms their minds.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,231
It'll pass.

22
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,197
Now get dressed.

23
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,296
There's someone
who needs to see you.

24
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:36,061
Kahlan?

25
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:48,587
I've missed you so much.

26
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,288
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

27
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,021
Kahlan,
something's wrong here.

28
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:59,287
Sonia.

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,121
Sonia, this is my friend,
Richard.

30
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:06,954
Richard,
this is Sonia,

31
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:09,354
my daughter.

32
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,890
Daughter?

33
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,558
Sweetheart, do you think you
could wait in the other room?

34
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,959
I've a lot
of important things

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,459
I need to talk about
with Richard.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,228
Sorry.

37
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,962
She wriggled
out of my arms.

38
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,661
Come here, you.
Oh, there we go.

39
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,494
It's an honor
to meet Richard Cypher.

40
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,626
Richard,
this is Phillip.

41
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,995
The Seeker.

42
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:40,862
You're the one
who took my place.

43
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,897
No, there were two others
who came before.

44
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,732
Richard...

45
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,867
Phillip is my husband.

46
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,302
She keeps asking
when we're going home.

47
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,638
Sonia, this is our home now.

48
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,372
Let's find you
something to eat, sweetheart.

49
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,076
Kahlan, I've only been away
from you for a week.

50
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,843
How can
you have a daughter?

51
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,677
How can there have been
three Seekers named?

52
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:18,679
Richard, you've been here
in the Palace of the Prophets

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
for more than half a year.

54
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,548
And for us
in the outside world,

55
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,149
seven winters have passed.

56
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:30,151
The Stone of Tears
was destroyed.

57
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,819
And the rift
to the Underworld?

58
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,821
It can never be closed.

59
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,323
After Aydindril fell,

60
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,157
we rounded up what
few survivors we could find

61
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,624
and brought them here

62
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,792
to make one final stand.

63
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,761
They're all that's left?

64
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,129
Maybe in the whole world.

65
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,230
Where's Zedd?

66
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,836
I'm so sorry, Richard.

67
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:03,871
He gave his life
defending Aydindril.

68
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,272
He died a hero.

69
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,209
And Cara?

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,044
On our way out of the New World,

71
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,946
we were ambushed
by a baneling army.

72
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:19,281
Cara got cut off
from the rest of us,

73
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:21,616
and we haven't
seen her since.

74
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,757
I've been here
for seven years

75
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,893
and you've never tried
to contact me?

76
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:33,195
I got your letter.

77
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,931
That your training
was almost complete.

78
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:35,932
What letter?

79
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,732
That's why we came.

80
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,365
With your Wizard powers,

81
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,398
maybe you can still help us
fight the Keeper.

82
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,398
I didn't write this.

83
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,868
It's in your hand.

84
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,036
You couldn't have
had a child with Phillip.

85
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,804
You would never
confess the Seeker.

86
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,473
I didn't.

87
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,878
Many years ago, we were attacked
by the Sisters of the Dark

88
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,713
and they stole
my Confessor powers.

89
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,950
Once I lost them,
I was able to...

90
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,826
Kahlan, if what
you're saying is true,

91
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,528
I'll help you.

92
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,430
But I don't believe
any of it.

93
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,265
You think I'm lying?

94
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,700
No. Never.

95
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,103
But the Sisters
have been lying to me

96
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,237
ever since I got here.

97
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:28,772
That's why
I had to escape.

98
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,274
But then
I woke up back here.

99
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,609
They're trying to tell me

100
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,211
I lost my memory
because of my training.

101
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:37,114
Now you're telling me the Keeper
is on the verge of winning.

102
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:40,886
I think this is some
kind of trick or spell.

103
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,960
I know you, Richard.

104
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,828
And if you think
something's wrong,

105
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,696
then I'm gonna
help you find the truth.

106
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,735
What did you do to me?

107
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,238
Verna told me
about your confusion.

108
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:03,335
I assure you, everything
she said was perfectly true.

109
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:06,634
You've been right here
training for months.

110
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:08,836
You're lying.
I'm not.

111
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:10,971
Your training
is nearly complete.

112
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,006
Then why don't
I have any Wizard powers?

113
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,574
But you do.

114
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,977
Lift that urn
with your mind.

115
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,313
I can't do that.

116
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,114
Command it to rise, Wizard.

117
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,119
You have to try.

118
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,243
Banelings have
breached the gates.

119
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:02,946
Oh, sweetheart.

120
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:04,314
It's gonna be all right.

121
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,248
Mama and Papa will protect you.

122
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,526
You're bleeding.

123
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,428
It'll be fine.

124
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:23,530
The banelings have
cut off all the exits.

125
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:24,931
There's no escape.

126
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,772
Don't give up.

127
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:37,644
As long as we're alive,
the Keeper hasn't won yet.

128
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:40,082
These walls are strong.

129
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,887
These walls are strong...

130
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,426
And so is our will.

131
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,095
We can survive.

132
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,766
No matter how bad
things get...

133
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,536
as long as we stick together,

134
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,872
there's always hope.

135
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,442
We have to help him.

136
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:09,177
There's no help
for him now.

137
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,480
The Valley of Perdition was
created by the ancient Wizards

138
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,050
as a defense against
intruders from the New World.

139
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,253
After Richard
escaped from the palace,

140
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:21,155
he must have
stumbled into it.

141
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:23,524
The magic makes those
who enter it

142
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:26,061
experience
their worst fears.

143
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:28,830
There is no power
that can awaken them.

144
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:33,600
But if he stays there,
he'll starve to death.

145
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,436
His visions will kill him
long before that.

146
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:39,306
What happens to his mind
also happens in his body.

147
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,046
If he can't get out on his own,
we have to go in after him.

148
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:49,850
The magic of Perdition would
overwhelm even my powers.

149
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,052
If I give you my Han,

150
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:56,189
maybe you would have enough
power to withstand the magic.

151
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,190
No.

152
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,759
In 3,000 years,

153
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,535
no one who has wandered
into the Valley of Perdition

154
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,572
has ever escaped.

155
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,308
Prelate,
we can't let this happen.

156
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,278
It's the hand
of the Creator at work.

157
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,647
How can you say that?

158
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,749
The Prophecy says

159
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,918
if Richard Cypher
continues his quest,

160
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,722
he will help the Keeper
destroy all life.

161
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:24,926
But his death here will ensure
that never happens.

162
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,432
Hello, Sister Nicci.

163
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,870
You have no right
to hold me prisoner.

164
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,406
I have the right
to do far worse.

165
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,843
You betrayed our order
by helping

166
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,912
Richard Cypher escape
from this palace.

167
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,915
You were keeping him here
against his will.

168
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,650
You only freed him so that
he would fulfill the Prophecy

169
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,519
and deliver the Stone

170
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,587
to the Keeper of the Underworld,
whom you serve.

171
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:15,294
Name the Sisters of the Dark
or you will die.

172
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:17,629
You'll need me alive

173
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,564
if you ever hope
to remove my power

174
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,232
and restore it to Richard.

175
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,201
That is no longer possible.
After you freed Richard

176
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:27,604
from the palace, he wandered
into the Valley of Perdition.

177
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,840
Richard is going to die.

178
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,910
You failed, Nicci.

179
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,246
The new Seeker
has already been named.

180
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,082
He's on his way
to the Stone of Tears.

181
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,119
The compass is still
pointing the same way.

182
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,088
Maybe it's leading us
to the Stone of Tears.

183
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,923
No, it's leading us to Richard.
I'm sure of it.

184
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,558
Wizard, we've been
travelling for weeks.

185
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,460
Wouldn't it be faster if
you turned us into birds?

186
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,628
How would Leo
carry the Sword of Truth?

187
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,363
In his beak?

188
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:03,233
So, what kind of bird
would you wanna be?

189
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,935
What difference does it make?

190
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,270
I'm curious.

191
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,638
A blue-tailed sea hawk.

192
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,005
That's a noble animal.

193
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,007
One that attacks
without warning.

194
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,443
Nothing escapes its claws.

195
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:16,445
Do you know what
kind of bird I'd be?

196
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:19,315
A parrot that doesn't know
when to stop talking?

197
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,152
A banded falcon.

198
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,120
They're the only birds
that blue-tailed sea hawks

199
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,422
will fly with.

200
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,190
Keep going. I have
a stone in my boot.

201
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,628
Leo has
feelings for you.

202
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,196
Same feelings
all men have.

203
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,531
Fog's even thicker up ahead.

204
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:43,166
It means
we're getting close.

205
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,668
The fog hides
the path to the Old World.

206
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:57,279
The compass is telling us
to go straight through.

207
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,687
We're coming, Richard.

208
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,525
We're gonna need...

209
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,960
More water.

210
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,395
Check the cellar.

211
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,263
See if there are
any more water barrels.

212
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,632
I already tried.
The cellar's locked.

213
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:24,134
The Prelate must have a key.

214
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,469
<i>Water won't save anybody,
Richard.</i>

215
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,504
It's too late.

216
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,672
The Keeper's victory
is at hand.

217
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,674
You're only delaying
the inevitable.

218
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,742
It's only inevitable
if we let it happen.

219
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:37,811
It's better to surrender
our light to the Creator

220
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:40,547
than let the banelings
drag us to the Keeper.

221
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:43,550
You're gonna kill yourselves?

222
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,488
Creator, give us strength
for what we must now do.

223
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,989
And we will surrender our
strength for what you must do.

224
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,757
What about
the sanctity of life?

225
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:56,827
Killing yourself is an offense
to the Creator.

226
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:00,163
The fight is already lost.
Let us go home.

227
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:02,698
She wouldn't want you to give
up. She'd want you to fight

228
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,834
for every single life!

229
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:15,845
No!

230
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,887
Give me the names, Nicci.

231
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,390
You'll pay for this.

232
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:28,958
How?

233
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,993
Not even the powers
you stole from Richard

234
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,396
can overcome the rada'han
around your neck.

235
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:35,064
It is you who will pay.

236
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,736
Give me the names.

237
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,642
You want the names?

238
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:51,911
I'll give them to you.

239
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:54,580
Greta, Solange, Naya,

240
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:57,316
Jodelle, Reyna,

241
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:00,153
Roslyn, Liliana and Corrine.

242
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:02,622
We need to find them
immediately.

243
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:04,657
You're too late!

244
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:08,361
They're already in hiding,
doing the Keeper's work.

245
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:15,769
Keeper of the Underworld,

246
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,239
we faithfully do your bidding.

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,508
Now, in the name
of your servant Nicci,

248
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,045
we humbly ask
that you do ours.

249
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,662
You are a servant
of the Keeper.

250
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,431
Go, quickly.

251
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,263
No one's seen them
anywhere in the palace.

252
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,173
She's gone.

253
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:13,414
And she's taken
Richard's magic with her.

254
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:21,220
The most powerful Han
the world has ever known.

255
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,114
Sister Nicci.

256
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,350
You did well, Sisters,

257
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,318
but there's no time
for celebrating.

258
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,320
The Keeper's work
remains unfinished.

259
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,323
Richard Cypher is trapped
in the Valley of Perdition.

260
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,827
And we need to get him out
so he can fulfill the Prophecy

261
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,795
and deliver the Stone
to the Keeper.

262
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,866
There is another way to ensure
the Keeper's victory over life.

263
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,668
While you were
being held prisoner,

264
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,905
a new Prophecy
was revealed.

265
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,174
It is now written that, "As long
as the Mother Confessor's

266
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,510
pure heart beats,
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

267
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,513
Then her heart
must be stopped.

268
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,982
We've been saved the trouble
of having to look for her.

269
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,251
Our spies have learned
that she and her friends

270
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,286
are already headed toward
the Palace of the Prophets.

271
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:14,424
This is the hand
of the Keeper at work.

272
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:18,295
I look forward to
the Mother Confessor's arrival.

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,036
I don't think this weather
will hold much longer.

274
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,838
We should find shelter.

275
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,073
No. We need to cover
as much ground as we can

276
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,642
before the rain stops us.

277
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,279
We used to hear
stories about Richard

278
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,780
when I fought
for the resistance.

279
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,116
Where did you fight?
West Lorcastor.

280
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,217
Then you fought
the battle of Stone Canyon.

281
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,887
Yeah.
That was a great victory.

282
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,287
Well, it almost wasn't.

283
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,056
The D'Harans
had us surrounded.

284
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,058
We were out
of food and water.

285
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,626
Our commander deserted us.

286
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,061
You still managed
to defeat them.

287
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:55,331
A rider arrived with news

288
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,231
that the Seeker had
driven back the D'Harans

289
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,599
at the Battle
of Rising Ridge.

290
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,968
It was one man
against hundreds.

291
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:06,004
It inspired us to break through
the D'Haran line.

292
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:09,609
I hope you get the chance
to tell him that story.

293
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,212
I will.

294
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,988
Is everything
all right?

295
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:24,090
Accepting that
we had to name a new Seeker

296
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,092
wasn't easy for me.

297
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,460
But if anyone
other than Richard

298
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,928
had to take up
the Sword of Truth,

299
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,630
I'm thankful it was Leo.

300
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:36,135
He's gonna
help us find Richard.

301
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,417
There's somebody
at the gate.

302
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,270
Richard, let me in.

303
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,040
No.
It's Cara.

304
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,175
The last time we saw her

305
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:17,044
she was cut off from us
by a thousand banelings.

306
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,979
I got away from them.

307
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,847
It's impossible.
She's one of them.

308
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:23,417
Richard, you know I would never
take the Keeper's deal.

309
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,024
I'm letting her in.

310
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:34,894
It's a trick, Richard.

311
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,663
I'm not
leaving her out there.

312
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:38,998
If you're wrong--
I'm not.

313
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:48,174
It was a trick,
you fool!

314
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,375
She is a baneling.

315
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,515
No!

316
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,890
Mother!

317
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,589
Kahlan, don't move!

318
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,924
I can heal you.
No.

319
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,727
My husband

320
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,463
and my daughter are dead.

321
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,232
I don't wanna
live without them.

322
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,892
What have I done?

323
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,465
What have I done?

324
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,183
Your back's hurting?

325
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:11,951
I'm fine.

326
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:15,622
Your back only hurts
when you're worried.

327
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:17,056
Worried?

328
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,259
I'm brimming with confidence.

329
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:25,465
You're wondering what you
might've done differently

330
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:27,000
so that Richard
never would have gone off

331
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:28,301
with the Sisters of the Light?

332
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,841
You're always the one
to calm our fears

333
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,477
and reassure us that
everything will work out.

334
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:42,712
But you're allowed
to be worried too.

335
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,851
The river's too swollen
to cross.

336
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,820
We'll have to wait
for the rain to stop.

337
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:54,456
We should make the most of
this delay and get some sleep.

338
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,655
There's no telling
when we'll get another chance.

339
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,455
I'll keep first watch.

340
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,459
I hope the rain stops.

341
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:12,765
It's really coming down now.

342
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:14,266
Yes.

343
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:17,335
Before the sun went down, I saw
some clear skies to the west.

344
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:19,871
Hopefully, the wind will
cooperate and send them our way.

345
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,907
That would be good.

346
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,947
I do love the rain, though.

347
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,282
The way it makes
the earth smell--

348
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:43,494
You know, where I come from,
the man does that.

349
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,897
Then what are you
waiting for?

350
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:12,517
What is it?

351
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:14,219
For you.

352
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,722
It matches your leather.

353
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:23,962
Have I offended you?

354
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:26,132
Flowers make me sneeze.

355
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,169
Didn't last night
mean anything to you?

356
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,403
It was pleasurable.

357
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,574
But it doesn't make me
your mate for life.

358
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,843
I don't remember asking you
to marry me.

359
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,378
But I do care about you.

360
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:39,481
And I think you feel
the same.

361
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,583
You're mistaken.

362
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:50,122
You know, I've been
watching you for weeks,

363
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:52,657
and I can tell
you care about him.

364
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,795
You can't read
a Mord-Sith.

365
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,133
The Confessor in me can't.

366
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:00,202
But the woman can tell
you're not telling the truth.

367
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,972
It's a hard world we live in,
Cara.

368
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,877
We don't get many chances.

369
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:10,480
If you have feelings for Leo,
you should tell him.

370
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,716
We're here!

371
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,681
Kahlan Amnell,

372
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:50,649
it's wonderful
to see you again.

373
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,786
You were just a child
the last time I saw you,

374
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,589
I doubt you'd remember me.

375
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,425
But my dear Sister
who raised you always said

376
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:01,694
you were destined to become
a great woman.

377
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:06,198
And now here you are,
the Mother Confessor.

378
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm honored to see you again,
Prelate.

379
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,068
But I'm here for Richard.

380
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:13,437
I'm surprised that you'd
travel all this way.

381
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:17,374
I thought you'd be continuing
the quest with the new Seeker.

382
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,876
We have reason to believe
that Richard may be in danger.

383
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:21,311
Is he all right?

384
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,579
He's perfectly fine.

385
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,114
He's in training right now.

386
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:26,749
But I'll tell him
you're here.

387
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,551
Thank you.

388
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:32,621
In the meantime, please make
yourselves comfortable.

389
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:35,456
You must be exhausted
from your long journey.

390
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,198
Why didn't you tell
the Mother Confessor the truth?

391
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,966
Because she'd go
to the Valley of Perdition

392
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,067
and try to save Richard.

393
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,602
She'd end up trapped
like he is.

394
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,503
And when she realizes
you've lied to her?

395
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,139
By then I will have
sealed the palace.

396
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:00,843
You're trapping them here?

397
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,977
The Prophecy says
the Keeper can't win

398
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:05,046
as long as
the Mother Confessor lives.

399
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:08,882
The Sisters of the Dark will
stop at nothing to kill her.

400
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:11,684
Keeping Kahlan here is the only
way to ensure her survival.

401
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,354
Richard will soon be dead,
and once he is,

402
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,956
we'll tell her the truth.

403
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:20,459
She'll understand we were acting
in her best interest.

404
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:35,205
<i>Congratulations, brother.</i>

405
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:40,743
You are now
the last person

406
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:43,680
who will ever live.

407
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:52,289
Unfortunately, there is no one
left to kill you.

408
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,958
So you will have
the rest of your days

409
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,961
to contemplate your complete

410
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,896
and utter failure.

411
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,600
What is taking so long?

412
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,504
I'm sure Richard is just
as impatient to see you.

413
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,240
Something isn't right.

414
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,009
Did you sense the Prelate
wasn't telling you the truth?

415
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,745
No.

416
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,947
But maybe a woman
as powerful as she is

417
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,849
has the ability to prevent me
from reading her.

418
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:47,620
<i>( dramatic theme playing</i>

419
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,562
Leo.

420
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,666
Yes?

421
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,245
I have something
I need to say to you.

422
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,547
I'm listening.

423
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:16,988
I just wanted to say...

424
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:18,122
Where's Richard?

425
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,824
It shouldn't be much longer now.

426
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,359
The Prelate asked me
to serve you a meal.

427
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,095
We're not hungry.

428
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,230
Take us to Richard.
I can't do that.

429
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,531
He's in training.

430
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:28,264
No one's to disturb him
until he's finished.

431
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:30,597
You're lying.

432
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:33,827
Tell us where he is.

433
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:35,593
I swear on the Creator,
I don't know.

434
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:37,392
Then who does?

435
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,594
Only the Prelate.
Take us to her.

436
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:42,497
Now.

437
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:44,064
Richard's not here.

438
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:45,132
Where is he?

439
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,167
I can't tell you that.

440
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:49,335
Well, if you won't tell us,
we'll find him ourselves.

441
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:50,769
You won't be able to.

442
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,171
I've sealed the palace.

443
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:55,473
You're holding us prisoner?

444
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:58,376
No, I'm protecting you.

445
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,913
This is a new Prophecy.

446
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:06,416
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

447
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:09,752
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

448
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:12,354
If you leave the palace
to look for Richard,

449
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,789
your life will be at risk.

450
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,824
There are Sisters who serve
the Keeper who will kill you.

451
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,659
I'll deal with them.
No.

452
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:23,030
The Mother Confessor stays here,
under our protection,

453
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,798
until the Keeper is defeated.

454
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,266
Zedd will get through
your magic.

455
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,267
We're leaving now.

456
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,277
No!

457
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:42,578
Only a Sister of the Light

458
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,881
can remove the Dacra
without killing him.

459
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,687
Take it out of him.

460
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,556
Confess her
and I'll kill the Wizard.

461
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:58,058
You'd better hope your magic
is faster than Wizard's Fire.

462
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,493
You may kill me,

463
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:01,227
but you won't be able
to get out of the palace.

464
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:04,162
Only I can unseal it.

465
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,876
The magic is quicker than you.

466
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:22,911
If anyone throws another Dacra,
the Prelate dies.

467
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,022
You're defying
the will of the Creator.

468
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:40,491
The Creator's will?
Or yours?

469
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,159
They are the same.

470
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,927
Is it the Creator's will

471
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:47,330
that we hold
the Mother Confessor hostage?

472
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:50,232
That Nicci is on the loose

473
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:53,268
with the most powerful Han
ever known?

474
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,439
And that Richard will die
alone in Perdition?

475
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,841
Where is he?

476
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:02,977
I'll take you to him.

477
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:07,782
Unseal the palace now.

478
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:23,330
Our spy reports the Mother
Confessor's reached the palace.

479
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,535
Then the Sisters of the Light
can watch me kill her.

480
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:31,839
The message says they've already
come and left.

481
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,008
Does the message say

482
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,644
where they're headed?

483
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:46,151
Richard!

484
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,586
You can't go down there.

485
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:49,988
It's the Valley of Perdition.

486
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:52,924
No one who's wandered into it
has ever escaped.

487
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:56,093
He's in the grip
of powerful magic.

488
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:59,629
It's causing him to have visions
of his worst fears.

489
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,030
Eventually,
they will kill him.

490
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,699
And the same thing will happen
to you if you go to help him.

491
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,734
We can't just let him die.

492
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:07,535
Kahlan!

493
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:10,371
We can't afford to lose
the Mother Confessor.

494
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:13,073
I'll use all my powers
to try to get him out.

495
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:22,448
Get down!

496
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,694
Zedd!

497
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,030
Zedd.

498
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:44,761
Kahlan.

499
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:49,332
I'm sorry I failed you.

500
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,300
All is forgiven, Richard.

501
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:55,470
You don't need
to be in pain anymore.

502
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,371
You don't need
to be alone.

503
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,141
<i>You can be with me again,
forever.</i>

504
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,843
How?

505
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:08,847
All you have to do...

506
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,182
is die.

507
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,752
Oh...

508
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,020
<i>I can't do that.</i>

509
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,121
<i>You can.</i>

510
00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:19,557
There's nothing to fear.

511
00:36:19,558 --> 00:36:24,160
All you have to do
is take my hand

512
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:26,596
and come with me...

513
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,893
Come with me.
Please.

514
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:57,800
What's wrong, Richard?

515
00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:01,274
You're not Kahlan.

516
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,479
Of course I am.
No.

517
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,552
Kahlen would never
ask me to die.

518
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:10,987
She'd tell me
to keep living.

519
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:15,025
She'd say there could still be
life somewhere in the world.

520
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,727
Look around, Richard.

521
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:19,996
There's nothing left
in the World of the Living.

522
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:22,766
You're lying.

523
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:27,269
And if you're lying,
you're not real.

524
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,938
None of this is real.

525
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,566
I have to go.

526
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,801
No!

527
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:53,505
Leo!

528
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,398
You don't know how happy I am
to see you.

529
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:42,808
Cara?

530
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,750
Can you give him
the Breath of Life?

531
00:41:00,288 --> 00:41:03,723
No.

532
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:05,591
His body is beyond saving.

533
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,534
Leo gave his life

534
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:18,035
for the Mother Confessor.

535
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:20,237
In this and in every way,

536
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:22,973
he brought honor to the title

537
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:25,508
"Seeker of Truth."

538
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:28,244
We shall always
remember his courage.

539
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:30,715
We shall never
forget his name.

540
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:50,781
I do care about you.

541
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:15,436
You're going to need this back.

542
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:23,242
We have a quest
to get back to.
