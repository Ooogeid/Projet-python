1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,389
Run!

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,422
Run!

3
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,737
- Did we lose them?
- I think so.

4
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,689
Those bees were more relentless
than the Dragon Corps.

5
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,375
A lot of work for so little honey.

6
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:32,194
That's not enough for two.
You take it.

7
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,419
You.

8
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:35,868
I insist.

9
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:39,497
- But you did all the work.
- I'll eat at the next tavern we pass.

10
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,635
It can't be far.

11
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,252
- Which direction are we headed, anyway?
- East.

12
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,780
East? Towards the D'Haran border?

13
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:50,054
To Caddock, to be precise.

14
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:52,007
Breakfast. I'm starving.

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,172
I spoke with a friend in the resistance
while I was getting supplies.

16
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,311
It seems King Gregor
is facing a new enemy

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,312
and has requested the Seeker's help.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,649
- King Gregor?
- His kingdom borders D'Hara.

19
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,974
He's a strong ally
of the resistance.

20
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,570
One of the few leaders brave enough
to stand against Rahl.

21
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:13,656
Apparently,
he's done better than that.

22
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,438
Our friend says the king
has driven back the D'Harans.

23
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:18,911
They've pulled their troops away.

24
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:20,589
Why does he need our help?

25
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,664
What could be a bigger threat
than the D'Harans?

26
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,211
1x19 - <i>Cursed</i>

27
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,766
The Caddock border
shouldn't be much further.

28
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,790
Stay where you are!

29
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,835
Lower your weapons.

30
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,213
Unless I'm mistaken,
this is Richard Cypher.

31
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,791
The Seeker.

32
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,841
I'm Marius, brother of King Gregor.

33
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,940
Thank the Spirits
you received my message.

34
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,641
We came as quickly as we could.

35
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,684
Wizard Zorander.
Confessor.

36
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,432
It's an honor.

37
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,647
This is Flynne,
Captain of the Guard.

38
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,943
Forgive the rude welcome.
Our nerves are a little frayed lately.

39
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,780
Would that have anything to do
with why you asked us to come?

40
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,690
It's best if you hear that
from the king himself.

41
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,853
Thank you for coming so quickly.

42
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:27,747
It pains me to delay you on your
mission to defeat Darken Rahl.

43
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:31,937
Helping those who stand against
Rahl is part of that mission.

44
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,970
My kingdom is being terrorized
by a vicious beast

45
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,092
that's ravaging our countryside

46
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:43,221
and I need your help
to destroy this monster.

47
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:45,930
Tell me where to find this beast.

48
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:50,131
You already have.

49
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:52,917
It's me.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Five months ago the D'Harans
began amassing troops along this border.

51
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:04,991
From there, Rahl's soldiers launched
raids on our farmland, burnt our crops.

52
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:08,548
With our food stocks dwindling,
Rahl knew we couldn't repel a siege.

53
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:11,273
An invasion was imminent.
I had no choice

54
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,025
but to seek an alliance
with our neighbor.

55
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,130
Here, in Agaden Reach.

56
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,301
The domain of that she-devil Shota.

57
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:22,375
Forgive me,

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,472
but why would you seek an alliance
with someone as dangerous as Shota?

59
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,267
The witch-woman has the ability
to see the future.

60
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,364
I was hoping
she would help us change it.

61
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,437
I reminded Shota

62
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:39,536
our kingdom was all that separated her
from Rahl's tightening grip.

63
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,673
That if Caddock were overrun,

64
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,117
Agaden Reach would soon follow.

65
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,911
So I struck a bargain with her.

66
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,989
In exchange for my pledge
to defend her,

67
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:54,369
she promised to give me the power
to protect my kingdom forever.

68
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,079
And how exactly did she do that?

69
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,393
She cursed me.

70
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:03,759
Each night,

71
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,074
I would be transformed

72
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,345
into a Calthrop.

73
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,242
An awful beast that haunts
the nightmares of all D'Harans.

74
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,831
The Calthrop is one of the few things
D'Haran children are taught to fear.

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,431
For centuries,
they've frightened each other

76
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:29,835
around campfires with tales
of the creature's blood-lust.

77
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,498
For weeks I ventured close
to the D'Haran camps.

78
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,498
At nightfall,
I would become the creature.

79
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:41,203
The few who survived the slaughter
fled back to D'Hara,

80
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,630
spreading stories
of the brutal Calthrop

81
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,764
that stalked the forest
around Caddock.

82
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:50,014
Soon Rahl's forces were too terrified
to cross into our kingdom.

83
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,809
With morale suffering
and his troops stretched thin,

84
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,591
Rahl abandoned his attempt
to conquer us.

85
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,845
Once the D'Haran troops
pulled away from our border,

86
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,144
I went back to Shota
and I asked her to remove the curse.

87
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,119
I couldn't risk
butchering my own people.

88
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:07,718
But she refused.

89
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:11,370
And once the Calthrop's hunger
couldn't be quenched,

90
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:15,550
I had my most loyal men,
all sworn to secrecy,

91
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,252
chain me in the woods,

92
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,700
but the beast broke through the chains
and killed them all.

93
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,182
I spent

94
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,791
half my treasury on purchasing this:

95
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,603
A rada'han.

96
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,363
I'd hoped its ability
to suppress magic

97
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,062
would be enough
to overcome Shota's curse.

98
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,628
I locked the rada'han
around my brother's neck.

99
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,941
Yet he still transformed
and somehow managed to escape from it.

100
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,645
I was too ashamed

101
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:51,129
to have my people know
that their king was the Calthrop.

102
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:55,454
So now each night, I head
to the most remote part of the forest,

103
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:58,105
a place called Knollwood Grove.

104
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,645
Anyone venturing into the woods
after dark rarely makes it out alive.

105
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,762
I have no memory of these attacks,

106
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,095
but each morning,
I awake with the taste of blood

107
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,007
on my tongue.

108
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:16,652
Three days ago,

109
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,658
I awoke to find the savaged remains
of my latest victim.

110
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,544
The face staring back at me was...

111
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,812
... that of my own wife.

112
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,492
I had murdered my beloved

113
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,022
queen.

114
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,016
It's not your fault, brother.

115
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,545
You were only trying
to protect your kingdom.

116
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:47,312
And now the kingdom
must be protected from me.

117
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,094
I've tried to end my life.
Poison,

118
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:51,806
hanging,

119
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,967
a dagger to my heart.

120
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,600
But you can't be killed,

121
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,596
because Shota gave you exactly
what you asked for:

122
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,564
the power to protect your kingdom

123
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,019
forever.

124
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:10,281
- What makes you think I can help you?
- According to legend,

125
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,699
the only thing
that can kill a Calthrop

126
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,493
is the Sword of Truth.

127
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,667
Can't you lift the curse?

128
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,235
Only the one
who made it can break it.

129
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,629
I'll go to Agaden Reach

130
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:30,008
- and try to reason with Shota.
- Are you sure?

131
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,302
Few who have gone there
have ever returned.

132
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,381
I know.

133
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,758
I'm one of those few.

134
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,400
And if you fail?

135
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,799
What then?

136
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,866
I can't bear the thought
of killing another innocent person.

137
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,569
While Zedd is gone, I'll watch over you
and keep you from harming anyone.

138
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,570
How?

139
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,239
The monster can break
through our strongest chains.

140
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,159
I may have a few tricks

141
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,112
that your blacksmith doesn't.

142
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,905
When the evening bell chimes,
I will come find you, Seeker.

143
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,280
Your Highness, I'm coming with you.

144
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,382
Forgive me, but I've already
harmed too many people.

145
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:14,068
I couldn't bear to add
the Mother Confessor to that toll.

146
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,888
Father?

147
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:18,765
This is Princess Corah,

148
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,644
my daughter.

149
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,519
We're honored to have you here.

150
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,351
Our people have lived
in fear for so long.

151
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,860
We were very sorry to hear
about your mother, princess.

152
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:32,821
Just promise me

153
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,696
you'll find the horrible beast
that murdered my mother

154
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,969
and you'll kill it.

155
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,924
You're sure these chains will hold?

156
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,652
Zedd's magic has made them
unbreakable.

157
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,867
I hope you're right, Seeker.

158
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,597
But swear to me.

159
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,307
If it's a question
of my life or yours,

160
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:03,268
you'll kill me.

161
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:05,812
I swear.

162
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,732
We'll make sure
it doesn't come to that.

163
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,111
As much as I enjoy your company,

164
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,906
you can't watch over me every night.

165
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,129
I just have to do it until Zedd
can convince Shota to lift the curse.

166
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,759
I've been expecting you, Zeddicus.

167
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,512
Then you know why I've come.

168
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,528
I can't imagine it's to apologize
for scorning me all those years ago.

169
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,820
I was once a foolish,
young Wizard...

170
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,832
- I never meant to hurt you.
- And yet you left,

171
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,704
without a word of explanation.

172
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:57,698
Those words may have been my last.

173
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:02,536
I showed you our future together.

174
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,330
With our combined powers,
we could have moved mountains.

175
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:09,668
Our children would have ruled
for a thousand generations.

176
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,965
And now look at you, Zeddicus,

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
reduced to crawling back,
begging me for a favor.

178
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,752
Why should I do anything for you?

179
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,184
Not for me.

180
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,813
For King Gregor,
with whom you share a common enemy.

181
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,316
He's beaten back the D'Harans

182
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,818
and insured the safety
of his lands and yours.

183
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,514
The king killing his own people
doesn't benefit you at all.

184
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,842
Release him from the curse.

185
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,159
Put an end
to this pointless bloodshed.

186
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,677
Without the Calthrop,
this is what will come to pass.

187
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:09,628
The D'Harans will launch their army,

188
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:12,694
they will seize the castle,

189
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:14,981
Caddock will fall,

190
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,342
and my realm will be next.

191
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:20,822
What I bestowed on King Gregor,

192
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,075
it's not a curse.

193
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:26,615
It's a blessing.

194
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,378
- I met your mother once.
- You did?

195
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,427
She visited Aydindril
when I was a young Confessor.

196
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:40,795
She was very kind to me.

197
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,470
I can see the resemblance.

198
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,024
I still can't believe she's gone.

199
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:52,864
I lost my mother
when I was very young.

200
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:56,356
I know how painful it can be.

201
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,944
It would be easier if I knew
why she left the castle.

202
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,781
What she was doing out there
the night she died.

203
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:07,156
What is it, Duncan?
Where's Helena?

204
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,755
We took a wagon to fetch
her family, as you asked,

205
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,667
when we passed through Knollwood Grove,
our horse was bit by a snake vine.

206
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,801
I ran back here as fast
as I could to get another horse.

207
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,467
They're still at Knollwood Grove?

208
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:22,091
That's one of the beast's
hunting grounds.

209
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,052
It's almost sundown.
No one's allowed to leave the castle.

210
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,981
- But there are children out there.
- Just tell me where to find them,

211
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,933
- I'll bring them back.
- I'm going with you.

212
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,066
- No, it's too dangerous.
- I'm the one who put them in danger.

213
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,396
With the Calthrop loose,
my lady-in-waiting got worried.

214
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,277
- I sent her to go get them.
- Putting yourself in danger won't help.

215
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,045
No, it'll help you. We can move faster
if I show you the way.

216
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,700
It's started.

217
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,041
Please, Seeker,

218
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,893
don't let me hurt anyone else.

219
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,262
Stay back!
I don't want to hurt you.

220
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,397
As soon as we get this hitch,
we can get out of here.

221
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,111
Mother, I'm scared.

222
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,077
It's all right, little ones.
We'll be on our way soon.

223
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,428
Fight me!

224
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Run!

225
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:44,523
Run!

226
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,637
Take the children. Run!

227
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,870
Kill it!

228
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,277
Are you all right?

229
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,947
Kahlan, stop!

230
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:56,702
Kahlan, it's me, Richard.

231
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:03,665
Stop.

232
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,761
It's okay.

233
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,267
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you all right?

234
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:23,986
I think so.

235
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,354
Now that that beast is dead.

236
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,259
Father?

237
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,999
The Calthrop wasn't the only
monster out there last night.

238
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,586
That's the second time
I've gone into the Con Dar

239
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,353
and I still don't have control
over it.

240
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,766
The first time
I almost destroyed you,

241
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,653
and last night
I almost destroyed Corah.

242
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,895
But you didn't.

243
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:10,473
Only because you stopped me.

244
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:15,256
Once it gets a hold of me,
it's like I'm some wild animal.

245
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:17,449
I don't know what I'm doing.

246
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,200
You were trying to protect
me from the Calthrop.

247
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,828
If my mother were alive,
she could teach me to control it.

248
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
But on my own,

249
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,987
it's only a matter of time
before I hurt someone.

250
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,969
Someone I care about.

251
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:39,844
We killed the Calthrop.

252
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,242
Yes, I heard.

253
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,599
And that's the problem.
Shota showed me a vision

254
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,486
of what would happen to this kingdom
without the Calthrop.

255
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,813
I saw a D'Haran invasion,

256
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,640
soldiers storming the castle,

257
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,480
and one of their commanders
taking the king's throne.

258
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,434
Well, we know Shota's
visions can be averted.

259
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,273
But I'm afraid in order to do that,

260
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:03,743
we may need Shota
to curse someone else.

261
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,530
The D'Harans
will prepare their invasion

262
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:09,330
once they learn
the Calthrop has been slain.

263
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,160
As much as the people feared
and hated the beast,

264
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,003
it kept them safe from Rahl.

265
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,340
Then we have to make sure
the D'Harans don't find out.

266
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,459
If we can keep the legend
of the Calthrop alive,

267
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,440
we can keep the D'Harans
from invading.

268
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:26,259
And spare anyone else the burden
of carrying Shota's curse.

269
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,600
Maybe.

270
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,395
But how long could
we keep up such a ruse?

271
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,689
Long enough for me to defeat Rahl.

272
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,789
Why didn't my father tell me?

273
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,050
He was trying to protect you.

274
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,338
If my father didn't think
I was strong enough to hear the truth,

275
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,088
how can I lead this kingdom?

276
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:01,491
- I know you can.
- But maybe I shouldn't.

277
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:05,722
Maybe I should ask Marius
to assume the throne in my place.

278
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,398
If you decide it's too much,
no one would fault you.

279
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:14,486
But if I'm not mistaken,
your mother wasn't much older than you

280
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:17,442
- when she took the throne.
- But she had my father.

281
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,902
And you have both of them
inside you.

282
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,740
I've seen your strength.

283
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:27,094
You made the decision to ride out
to save Helena and her children,

284
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,369
even though you knew the dangers.

285
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,945
I don't think your people could ask
for a more courageous leader.

286
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:40,757
As Queen,

287
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,525
I pledge my fealty
to this great kingdom,

288
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,856
to defend its people
from all enemies,

289
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,498
and lead it into peace
and prosperity.

290
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,233
Spirits, bless our kingdom.

291
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,294
Spirits, bless our Queen.

292
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,219
The only way the D'Harans will believe
the Calthrop is still alive

293
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,938
- is if there's been another attack.
- My Queen,

294
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,763
Captain Flynne and I'll slaughter sheep
and leave the carcasses at the border.

295
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,559
We'll spread word
along trade routes.

296
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:32,956
The D'Harans will believe
it's the work of the Calthrop.

297
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:36,311
I may have something
that will help those efforts.

298
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,149
I can place severals of these chimes
in the forest that borders D'Hara

299
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,254
and cast a spell on them.

300
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,053
The slightest disturbance
in the air...

301
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:49,878
Say, from an approaching D'Haran,
and the chimes will ring out.

302
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,685
Only it won't be just any chime
they'll hear,

303
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,619
it will be the awful howls
of the Calthrop.

304
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:59,167
The ear is more easily frightened
than the eye.

305
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:04,076
We'll make preparations
at once, Your Majesty.

306
00:23:09,477 --> 00:23:10,679
I want to thank you.

307
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,056
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't been here.

308
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,344
If there's anything
I can do for you...

309
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,980
There is one favor you could
grant me, Your Majesty.

310
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,222
Why are you wearing that?

311
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:47,782
Because I can't trust myself.

312
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,397
I'm used to having control.

313
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:55,986
Being a Confessor
is about certainty,

314
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,326
about knowing the truth.

315
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:01,658
When I'm in the Con Dar
I don't have any of that.

316
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,776
The rada'han gives a little of it
back to me.

317
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,124
But we don't even know if it works.

318
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,514
It didn't stop King Gregor.

319
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:13,531
It works.

320
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:18,206
I can feel it suppressing
my power already.

321
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:24,604
Maybe it's something
that shouldn't suppressed.

322
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,747
You said only the most powerful
Confessors have it, right?

323
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:34,834
Then maybe this is a gift.

324
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:37,546
One you shouldn't deny.

325
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,788
It's a part of who you are.

326
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,968
When I'm in the Con Dar,
I don't know who that is.

327
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,316
More news
from our spy in the castle.

328
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,287
Not only is King Gregor dead,
but so is the Calthrop.

329
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:02,989
Then the kingdom of Caddock
is ripe for the taking.

330
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,417
But we must act quickly
if we want the Seeker as well.

331
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,911
According to our spy, he will not remain
at Caddock much longer.

332
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,707
He would leave the kingdom
defenseless?

333
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:15,332
The child-queen wants us to believe
that the Calthrop still lives.

334
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,507
- They plan to deceive us.
- To deceives us?

335
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,290
And how do they intend to do that?

336
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:27,196
If Kahlan could learn to use the Con Dar
just think of how powerful we could be.

337
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:31,172
There are some things
that even a Wizard of the First Order

338
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,896
doesn't fully understand.

339
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:35,327
This is one thing I...

340
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,553
I can't teach Kahlan.

341
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:42,505
Maybe we should respect her decision
to wear the rada'han.

342
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,668
A power is only valuable
if it can be harnessed.

343
00:25:46,387 --> 00:25:48,462
If not, then it's no power at all.

344
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,388
That sounded just like a Calthrop.

345
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,802
I haven't cast the spell yet.

346
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,437
Another monster?

347
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,811
Zedd's on his way to find out
who Shota cursed.

348
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:08,918
What do we do
when we find this person?

349
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,360
We prevent them from hurting
innocent people.

350
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,112
Shall I inform Prince Marius?

351
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,454
Is there something else
bothering you?

352
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,365
I was going through my mother's things
and found her diary.

353
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:29,629
I know why she was outside
the castle the night she died.

354
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,839
She believed my father
was unfaithful,

355
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:34,342
and that at night
he would meet a woman.

356
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,053
- Who?
- The diary doesn't say.

357
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,555
Only that the woman lived
near Knollwood Grove.

358
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:42,727
My mother went there
to confront them.

359
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,245
But the king couldn't have
been unfaithful.

360
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,810
- By night, he was the Calthrop.
- But my mother didn't know that.

361
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,776
My father kept it a secret,
even from her.

362
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,569
Why would she think
he was unfaithful?

363
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,716
Because someone told her.

364
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:57,573
The diary doesn't say who,

365
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,200
only that it was someone
she trusted.

366
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,928
Whoever told her knew where
the king would be at night.

367
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,228
And sent her to her death.

368
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:10,002
There's only one person
besides your father

369
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,171
who knew the truth
about the Calthrop.

370
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:14,908
Prince Marius.

371
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,385
Think about it.

372
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,438
Marius stood the most to gain.
An entire kingdom.

373
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:24,600
Maybe he orchestrated the queen's death
at the hands of the Calthrop.

374
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,608
And he knew the king
would be so grief-stricken

375
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,438
over killing his wife
he would wanna die.

376
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:33,185
So the prince summoned
the Seeker to fulfill his wish.

377
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,725
And if it's the kingdom
that Marius wants...

378
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,921
Then only one person
stands in his way.

379
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:41,281
Me.

380
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,204
No sign of Prince Marius.

381
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,039
My men have searched.
He's not here.

382
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,126
- When's the last time anyone saw him?
- When I informed him of the Calthrop.

383
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:52,086
He can't have gotten far.

384
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:54,774
I'll find him.
Keep the queen safe.

385
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,091
This way, Your Majesty.

386
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,849
What's the safest place
in the castle?

387
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:08,574
I'm afraid
there's no place safe for you.

388
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:14,150
- You're part of Marius' plot.
- Take them.

389
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,321
She wears a rada'han.
Her magic cannot harm you.

390
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,573
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

391
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:49,643
Where were you last night?

392
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,065
The sun's going down soon.

393
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:57,860
Maybe you came out here
to transform into the Calthrop?

394
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,795
- You think I'm the monster?
- I know you're a monster.

395
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,174
You arranged the death of the queen
and your brother.

396
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,037
Why would I do such a thing?

397
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:11,499
Because you thought he was too weak
to protect the kingdom.

398
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,649
I loved my brother.

399
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:15,753
But you loved his power more.

400
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,881
And you would do anything to get it
and hold onto it.

401
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:22,277
Even if it meant
striking a deal with Shota

402
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:23,911
to make you the Calthrop.

403
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,431
You've gone mad.

404
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:33,479
- We'll find out soon enough.
- Who is it, Shota?

405
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:35,664
Who have you cursed now?

406
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,916
You still don't understand,
do you, Zeddicus?

407
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,581
I didn't curse anyone.

408
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,072
Enough games.

409
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:48,828
I promised King Gregor that his kingdom
would be protected forever.

410
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,039
So I cursed the royal scepter.

411
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,117
Whoever inherits the kingdom,

412
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:58,879
inherits the curse.

413
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,681
It won't take them long
to break down this door.

414
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:11,463
I'll have to confess
one of the guards.

415
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,280
But I'll need your help
to take off the rada'han.

416
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:53,184
Wait.

417
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:56,278
We need to get everyone
out of the castle.

418
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:58,731
Take'em to the caves until you get word
it's safe to return.

419
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,065
Right away.

420
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,419
What's happening?

421
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:13,245
Corah is the Calthrop.

422
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,082
She's loose inside the castle.

423
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,919
We have to stop the beast
without hurting Corah.

424
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,755
Maybe we could use the rada'han
to change the queen back.

425
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,773
It didn't work on the king.

426
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:26,204
And why was that?

427
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,805
I have no idea what you're...

428
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,442
You were in charge of locking
King Gregor into the rada'han.

429
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:45,986
Each night I laced his meal
with a sleeping potion.

430
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,782
Once he was asleep,
I unlocked the rada'han,

431
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,115
unleashing the Calthrop.

432
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:53,202
So all we have to do is get this
thing around the beast's neck.

433
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:57,456
- I think Marius can help with that.
- How may I serve you?

434
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,354
You're going to be the bait.

435
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:08,453
It's all right.

436
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,365
I'm here.

437
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:18,746
I don't understand.

438
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:22,875
If I'm the monster, why did Marius
sneak out of the castle before sunset?

439
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,366
I was on my way to warn the D'Haran

440
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:27,713
that the Calthrop was still alive.

441
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:31,017
You murdered my mother and father,

442
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,385
all so you could kneel before Rahl.

443
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,923
In exchange for swearing
my allegiance to Darken Rahl,

444
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,223
the D'Harans agreed to leave me
on the throne.

445
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:41,894
But you weren't able to deliver
your message to the D'Harans.

446
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:44,605
So they think the Calthrop is dead?

447
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:49,401
They're planning to invade Caddock.
They'll be here soon.

448
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:53,725
Let them come.

449
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:57,487
I'll remove the rada'han, the Calthrop
will slaughter every last one.

450
00:33:58,408 --> 00:33:59,608
It's too late.

451
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,383
It's over, Seeker.

452
00:35:36,997 --> 00:35:38,397
There's no escape.

453
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:57,779
Bring the Seeker to me.

454
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,747
You won't kill me.
Rahl wants me alive.

455
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:08,478
True.

456
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:11,794
But he didn't say
in how many pieces.

457
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:20,508
You'll find it difficult to escape

458
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:22,930
without your hands

459
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,451
Fools. See what you've done?

460
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:50,249
This will come to pass within the hour.
We can't do anything.

461
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:56,575
You were right when you said

462
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,214
together we had the power
to move mountains, Shota.

463
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:05,333
In fact, I think we could move
something far greater.

464
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:09,322
Bring the Seeker to me.

465
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:17,276
You won't kill me.
Rahl wants me alive.

466
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:19,231
True.

467
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,531
But he didn't say
in how many pieces.

468
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:27,178
You'll find it difficult to escape

469
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,739
without your hands.

470
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:08,827
What witchery is this?

471
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:34,369
Don't you see, Zeddicus?

472
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,876
Together we can accomplish anything.

473
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,667
Nothing can stop us.

474
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:44,047
That's precisely the reason
why I left you all those years ago.

475
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:47,426
Ultimate power
must not go unchecked.

476
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,994
You know this
as well as I do, Shota.

477
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,763
We would become monsters.

478
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,808
That's the very reason
we must defeat Darken Rahl.

479
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:04,818
Then there is something else
I must show you.

480
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,268
The D'Harans won't stop running
until they reach the People's Palace.

481
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:22,515
And once the stories spread
of the Calthrop terrorizing the kingdom,

482
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,153
they'll think twice
about invading again.

483
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:28,341
What happens when my people
learn the truth about the Calthrop?

484
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:30,577
Maybe they don't need to know.

485
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:40,798
You can wear the rada'han
at night to suppress the curse.

486
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,189
But don't you need it?

487
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,571
My power is part of who I am.

488
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,283
I tried to deny it,
and it only put people in danger.

489
00:40:55,597 --> 00:40:56,912
I need to embrace it,

490
00:40:57,974 --> 00:40:59,189
learn to control it.

491
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,955
I think I have to do the same.

492
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:07,740
My father was too ashamed to tell
his people the truth about himself,

493
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,649
and look what it cost him.

494
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:14,223
If he'd told my mother
he was the Calthrop,

495
00:41:14,613 --> 00:41:16,640
she never would have left
the castle that night...

496
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:20,059
... and they'd both be alive.

497
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:24,438
Nothing good can come
from hiding who I am.

498
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:40,937
What's wrong?

499
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,350
When the D'Harans had you,

500
00:41:45,747 --> 00:41:47,847
I tried to bring on the Con Dar,

501
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:49,443
but I couldn't.

502
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,299
Even when I needed it most.

503
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:56,288
It took your whole life to learn
how to use your Confessor powers.

504
00:41:56,554 --> 00:41:57,472
Give it time.

505
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:06,481
We have to hurry.

506
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,100
- What is it?
- Shota showed me a vision.

507
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:14,005
There is another
<i>Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

508
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,326
Long ago, in secret,

509
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,288
an ancient monk transcribed
a copy of the book.

510
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,707
If we could get our hands on it,
we could defeat Rahl.

511
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,376
Did Shota's vision show you
where it is?

512
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:29,575
But there was more to her vision.

513
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,557
Soon Rahl will also learn
of the Book's whereabouts.

514
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:35,385
