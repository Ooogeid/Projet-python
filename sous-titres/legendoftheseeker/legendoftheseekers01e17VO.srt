1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:02,291
You be the hiders,

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:04,877
- I'll be the Seeker.
- All right.

3
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,211
Come out. Look what I found.

4
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:53,795
Can I hold it?

5
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,348
Maybe it's a puzzle.

6
00:00:57,828 --> 00:00:59,433
Maybe it's something magical.

7
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,404
You know why Zedd suggested
we go back to Cowley Glen, don't you?

8
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:13,200
He's hoping our friends there

9
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:15,344
have heard something
about Darken Rahl's movements.

10
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,827
There's a lot of places
where we might get that information.

11
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,583
But only one place
where the elder's wife

12
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:22,921
makes Zedd's favorite rabbit stew.

13
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,876
He asked me to get the recipe.

14
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:30,089
We're tramping up this mountain
like pack mules to fill Zedd's belly?

15
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:36,927
Do you hear that?

16
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,406
I don't hear anything.

17
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,531
Exactly.

18
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,158
Not even birds.

19
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,406
Dead.

20
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,692
All of them.

21
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:38,717
But how?

22
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:41,682
I don't know.

23
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:44,566
No weapons drawn.

24
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,080
There wasn't a fight.

25
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,944
"By proclamation
of Lord Darken Rahl:

26
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:27,138
"This is the fate of all those
who give harbor

27
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:29,344
"and comfort to the Seeker."

28
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,132
1x17 - <i>Deception</i>

29
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,071
They murdered all those people.
Unarmed women and children,

30
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:42,721
because they gave me food and shelter
a few months ago?

31
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,977
Darken Rahl has been killing innocents
long before you got to the Midlands.

32
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,524
From the tracks,

33
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,034
the D'Harans who attacked the settlement
weren't on horseback.

34
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,151
Those can't be the same ones.

35
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:10,225
Tell me, friend,
who is it I owe my life to?

36
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,353
Richard Cypher.

37
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,358
Then you must be Kahlan Amnell.

38
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,830
Something wrong?

39
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,976
No, it's just that we've been fighting
the D'Harans for so long and now,

40
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,676
to have the Seeker and Confessor
standing with us...

41
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:32,790
It's an honor.

42
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,584
I'm Garrick,
leader of the resistance.

43
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,811
That one is still alive!

44
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,916
Command me, Confessor.

45
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,714
My name is Carver Dunn. My unit
was dispatched here from Azarith.

46
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,655
- Why?
- The garrison needs reinforcements.

47
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,276
The rebels in this valley
have been growing stronger every day.

48
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,851
- I appreciate the compliment.
- Do you know what this is?

49
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,783
They call them Whisperers.

50
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,293
They have massacred four settlements
in our valley.

51
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:12,037
We found cylinders at all of them.

52
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,206
- Do you know how they work?
- A dark magic.

53
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,454
Some say Rahl's sorcerers have captured
the voices of Shadow People

54
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,215
and bottled them inside the weapons.

55
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,352
When their screams are unleashed,
they kill everyone within a league.

56
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,884
Rahl could wipe out
every village in the Midlands.

57
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,636
Or terrify people into submission.

58
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,568
Four attacks, all in this area.

59
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,226
These weapons
must be somewhere nearby.

60
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,371
- Maybe at the fort near Grayson?
- All the compliance missions

61
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,024
- are dispatched from there.
- Compliance missions?

62
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,779
We'll have to get into the fort
and destroy these weapons.

63
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,026
The fort can't be taken.
It's too big.

64
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,126
- Too many D'Haran butchers.
- Or

65
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:54,459
if we could steal
just one of these Whisperers,

66
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:59,024
we could wipe out
every soldier in the garrison.

67
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,921
You'll report as ordered,
get one of the weapons,

68
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,466
- and bring it back to us.
- Yes, Confessor, I'll try.

69
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,421
But I'm afraid I'll fail you.

70
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:11,180
- Why?
- Only certain soldiers are trusted.

71
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,766
What kind of soldiers?

72
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:16,477
Ones who enjoy killing.

73
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,539
- Then you'll have to steal the weapon.
- I'll do anything to please you.

74
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,901
But I don't think I'm clever enough.
I'll be caught.

75
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:29,323
Carver, have you ever been
to this fort before?

76
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:31,867
I've never been away
from my post at Azarith.

77
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,796
Then nobody here knows you?
No other soldiers were sent from Azarith

78
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,247
as reinforcements here?

79
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:39,413
I don't think so.

80
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:42,306
What are you getting at, Richard?
Please,

81
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,366
call me Carver.

82
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:46,925
I'll report to the fort
in his place,

83
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,324
trick them into giving me
a Whisperer.

84
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,742
Or steal it.

85
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,597
Either way, we use it
to wipe out the entire battalion.

86
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,601
The D'Harans may be brutes,
but they're not gullible.

87
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,020
You won't be able to bring your Sword
for protection.

88
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,878
And if they even suspect
that you're an imposter...

89
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:05,397
Which is why I'll have to convince them
I'm one of them.

90
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:09,166
- Name and rank?
- Archer Third Class,

91
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,134
Carver Aloysius Dunn.

92
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,046
Only a Confessor could get him
to admit to a middle name like that.

93
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:15,156
Keep going.

94
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:17,318
- Commanding officer?
- Captain Jandor.

95
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:19,093
- Attack position?
- Third pentangle.

96
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,624
- Battle arms?
- Twenty bolts.

97
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:21,917
Wife's name?

98
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,378
Marta?

99
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,442
- Mary?
- Maris.

100
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,467
One mistake and you're dead.

101
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,809
- You need to study more.
- The longer we wait,

102
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,877
the more time they have
to massacre more people.

103
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,805
- I'm ready now.
- Not quite yet.

104
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,975
Blacksmith,

105
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,475
it's time.

106
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,914
I'll do it.

107
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:56,313
You're sure?

108
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,379
I've had worse.

109
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,094
I'm Archer Dunn.

110
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,139
My unit was attacked by the rebels.
I'm the only survivor.

111
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:37,127
That's a very unfortunate story,
Archer Dunn.

112
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,823
"Dunn," there you are.

113
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,471
The rebels who killed my friends,
I wanna make them pay.

114
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,588
Assign me to a new patrol
so I can go after them.

115
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,783
You already had your chance to fight,
but you abandoned your duty.

116
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,208
You should have fought to the death.

117
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:59,162
I'm worth more to Darken Rahl alive
than I am as a corpse, trust me.

118
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,662
Haven't you heard, soldier?

119
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,783
Lord Rahl has issued new orders.

120
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,847
He wants to send a clear message
to our enemies.

121
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,606
D'Harans always fight to the death.
Cowards will not be tolerated.

122
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,109
You'll be executed.

123
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,575
- I wanna talk to the commander.
- Shut him up.

124
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:20,979
He's going to want to hear this.

125
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:24,998
You're making a big mistake!

126
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:28,251
- Gag him.
- I have information about the rebels.

127
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,707
If he has something to say,
I'll hear it.

128
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,217
But it better be good.

129
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:41,890
What is it?

130
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,476
After they ambushed us,
the cowards fled back into the woods.

131
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,562
I tracked them there.
I can take you to where they're hiding.

132
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:49,648
- Did you know this?
- He didn't say anything.

133
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:51,858
He's just trying to save himself.

134
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,344
I told him I wanted the bastards to pay
for killing my friends.

135
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:58,407
- Didn't give me a chance to say more.
- He abandoned his unit. There are...

136
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:00,742
I don't need you
to quote regulations to me, sergeant.

137
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,295
Tell us the location of the rebels.
I'll send my men

138
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,281
to find out
if you're telling the truth.

139
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:10,419
Lock him in the stockade
till they get back.

140
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:19,222
This D'Haran's
your new cellmate, Dror.

141
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,345
He's a coward,

142
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,973
but he told us what we've been trying
to beat out of you for weeks:

143
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:26,815
Where to find your rebel friends.
You'd better pray he's lying, Dror,

144
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:29,871
because if we find your friends
then we won't need you anymore.

145
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,983
Except to use your head
to decorate a pole.

146
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,612
D'Haran pig.

147
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:41,760
Rebel scum.

148
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,369
Trust me,
I gave them the right information.

149
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,204
Your friends are as good as dead.

150
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,221
And so are you.

151
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:00,030
We'll give Richard three days.

152
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,512
If he's not back by then,
we'll need a plan to get him out.

153
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,807
They store supply wagons
outside the gate, here.

154
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,203
If we set them on fire,

155
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,101
maybe that would draw enough attention
for one of us to slip in and find him.

156
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,226
Confessor.

157
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:14,863
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- When I need you, I'll let you know.

158
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,381
Is there something else?

159
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,570
I feel guilty.

160
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:27,454
- Because you've been Confessed.
- I felt this way for a long time.

161
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,289
Long before you used
your power on me.

162
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:32,209
It's about the things I did,
fighting for Darken Rahl.

163
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:35,406
Give us a moment.

164
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,506
I'm listening.

165
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:44,262
First, I haven't sent any of my pay back
to my wife in Azarith.

166
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,890
- I gambled it away at dice.
- You'll need to make up for that.

167
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,709
Yes, Confessor, I will.

168
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,520
There's something else?

169
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,434
Before I was conscripted into the army
I was a cook for a lord in our village.

170
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,548
It's all I ever wanted to do.
I never wanted to do anything else.

171
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,282
But Rahl needed every healthy man,
so I was forced to join the army.

172
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,646
Confessor, I did terrible things.

173
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,456
I went on raids, even against civilians.
I burned houses.

174
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,069
I hurt people.

175
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,095
I killed some.

176
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,799
That's what D'Haran soldiers do.

177
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,759
I didn't have to. I could have run.

178
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,734
The night before we raided Araban,
my friend Kerwin deserted.

179
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,721
He asked me to go with him but I didn't.
I was too afraid.

180
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,858
Well, you're not a soldier anymore.

181
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,402
Maybe we can find a way for you
to do some good now.

182
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,912
You lied.
You sent us into an empty clearing.

183
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,508
You could have gotten us killed
just to save your own skin.

184
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,017
You probably tramped in there
like a pack of boars

185
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,753
- and the rebels heard you.
- I can track better than anyone here.

186
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,798
There wasn't a fire pit, nor a snot rag.
There was never anyone there.

187
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,532
I would've found them.

188
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,889
You know what I think, sergeant?

189
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,708
You didn't wanna find the rebels.

190
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,269
Because if you found them,
you would've had to fight them.

191
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,690
Get him!

192
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,904
These men are cowards.

193
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,933
They can't track. They can't fight.

194
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,917
And if you don't want those rebels
to kill you all,

195
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,287
you need a man like me.

196
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,118
Those men you just bloodied
are my best soldiers.

197
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,118
All three of them
are your superiors.

198
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,869
Not my fault they couldn't use
the information I gave them.

199
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:02,694
Every good woodsman knows
a noisy hunter never catches his prey.

200
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,192
I don't trust anyone in this fort.

201
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,750
They're all schemers, liars, thugs.

202
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:13,930
You probably are too.

203
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,749
This is a very dangerous post.
The most dangerous in the Midlands.

204
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,998
Every day the rebels
get more aggressive.

205
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:25,567
Every time we step outside this fort
our lives are at great risk.

206
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:29,475
So more than anything,
what I need are men who can fight.

207
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,240
So maybe you are right.

208
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:35,213
Maybe I could use a man like you.

209
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:40,104
Sir, the men say you've got Whisperers
in this fort.

210
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,876
Give me one
and let me kill some rebels.

211
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,548
You got nerve, Dunn.
But you need to slow down.

212
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,414
I'm going on a mission tomorrow.

213
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,472
I need a man to go with me.

214
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,310
Prove yourself, then maybe
I'll let you have your revenge.

215
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,451
No one goes past you.

216
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:21,748
Off limits.

217
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,007
Comfortable with your new weapon?

218
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:36,339
It's not the Sword of Truth, is it?
But it'll do.

219
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:45,397
Dunn's getting closer to the captain
than a fly on a cow's ass.

220
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:48,483
Ask around.
See if anyone knows anything about him.

221
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,244
Everyone's got a weakness.

222
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,955
When I find out what Dunn's is,
I'm gonna crush him.

223
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,215
Look at that. Elk tracks.

224
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,257
I'd say he was 600 stone.

225
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,519
Eight hundred.

226
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:19,222
They're fresh. He knows we're here.

227
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:20,890
How can you tell?

228
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:24,068
See how his hoof pivots a little
as he caught our scent.

229
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:25,895
He ran off into the brush there.

230
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:30,558
If only we'd been downwind,

231
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,929
might have had venison for supper.

232
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,678
Sir, if I may,
what's our objective on this mission?

233
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,624
You wanted to know our objective.

234
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,294
There it is.

235
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,755
Grayson.

236
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:07,562
Ready to do your duty, soldier?

237
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,943
Is that family aiding the rebels?

238
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:15,653
If they are?

239
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,779
I'm ready to do
whatever's necessary, sir.

240
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,847
Well, you're a hard man, Dunn.
I like that.

241
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,427
But we're not going to kill them.

242
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,928
We're going to feed them.

243
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,373
- Sir?
- They're my family.

244
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,517
Look what your father's brought you!

245
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,812
The last chicken in the Midlands!

246
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:55,860
It's too dangerous for a soldier
to travel alone in these parts, Dunn.

247
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,412
Too many rebels'd like nothing better
than the ears of a D'Haran captain

248
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,492
to adorn their trophy belts.
That's why I had to bring you along.

249
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,896
Food's hard to come by
in Grayson these days.

250
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,782
It's the last loyalist village around.
The rebels are all over the trade roads.

251
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,081
So from time to time,

252
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:20,260
I requisition supplies for my family,
courtesy of Lord Rahl.

253
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,305
Naturally, it's against regulation
to visit your family except on leave.

254
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:27,697
That's why I requested
a posting near Grayson.

255
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,999
Of course, I'm not on leave, am I?

256
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,032
But I know all the other men
at the fort.

257
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,396
They talk.

258
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,864
I can count on you not to say anything
about this to the higher-ups, can't I?

259
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:43,575
I can keep a secret, sir.

260
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,953
If you don't, I can always hand you back
to Sergeant Frye.

261
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,167
Sorry, son.

262
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:57,582
Your clumsy dad didn't mean
to scare you like that. I'm sorry.

263
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,674
Tanner jumps
at every loud noise lately.

264
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,047
If I drop something,
or a wagon passes.

265
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:13,996
The war's been hard on him.

266
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,524
He's afraid
there'll be more fighting.

267
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:18,335
Fighting? Here?

268
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,070
A few months ago
rebels attacked our village.

269
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,382
He saw some people killed.

270
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,906
His best friend's house
was burned to the ground.

271
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,496
Do you have a wife, Carver?

272
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:31,184
Her name's Maris.

273
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,624
She's in Azarith.

274
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:34,895
She must worry about you.

275
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,022
Soldiers forget how hard war
is on their families.

276
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:42,281
Yes, ma'am, maybe we do.

277
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,953
Confessor, I found some blackberries,
and I made these for you.

278
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,332
I usually use butter,
but I could only find lard.

279
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,584
It's delicious.

280
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:17,922
There's more.

281
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,381
That's plenty for me.
Give them to the others.

282
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:28,577
Confessor, can I have a word?

283
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,224
What's he still doing here?

284
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:35,678
- He's not making any trouble.
- My men don't like it.

285
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,640
It's not up to them, is it?

286
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,218
Forgive me, but some of these men
have had their homes burned

287
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:48,032
and their families killed.

288
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:51,878
Do you know what the D'Harans do
when they capture one of us?

289
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,301
- We aren't D'Harans.
- They torture him

290
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:56,497
and then they publicly execute him
as an example

291
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,942
to anyone else thinking
of joining the fight against Rahl.

292
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,620
Now, my men think
we should do the same to Dunn,

293
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:04,937
so the D'Harans fear us
like they want us to fear them.

294
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:08,464
Do your people
want justice or revenge?

295
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:33,786
This is a magic whistle.

296
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:35,778
If you're ever afraid of anything,

297
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,004
a noise, something in the dark,

298
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:41,873
you just play the whistle
and you won't feel scared anymore.

299
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,478
Go ahead, try it.

300
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:07,779
That's the first time he's smiled
in three months.

301
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,117
I'm so grateful my husband has a friend
like you to watch out for him now.

302
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:29,129
Sir?

303
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,154
There's something
that's been weighing on my mind.

304
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:34,135
Can I tell you the truth?

305
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,183
- What is it?
- Your chicken was much too spicy.

306
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:41,302
I appreciate the honesty, Dunn.

307
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,676
And I appreciate
what you did for my son.

308
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,178
What the rebels did to him,

309
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:53,283
your village, my comrades,
I wanna make them pay.

310
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:57,495
It's time you gave me a Whisperer
and let me go after them.

311
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,621
I can't do that.

312
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,378
But I've showed you I can fight,
I can track.

313
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:03,876
I can be trusted.

314
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,296
I am beginning to trust you, Dunn.
I'm afraid we've run out of Whispers.

315
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,632
- Sir?
- Relax, Dunn.

316
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:12,510
A shipment's on its way from D'Hara,
should arrive tomorrow.

317
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,223
Isn't it too dangerous taking the weapon
through rebel territory?

318
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,390
That's why
they're being transported at night.

319
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,368
But even at night
the open roads can be dangerous.

320
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:26,446
The rebels will never see them.
They're going through the Rekuna Pass.

321
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,949
- I have orders to question him.
- I didn't get any orders.

322
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,498
You're right.
I don't have any orders.

323
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:45,752
But that rebel scum spit on me,
insulted my friends.

324
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:48,816
I want a piece of him. Thought
you might like to give me a hand.

325
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,721
Got a visitor, Dror.

326
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,265
Your old cellmate,
come to pay his respects.

327
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,936
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you escape.

328
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:11,652
- Why?
- Because I'm on your side.

329
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,437
I'm the Seeker.

330
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,740
Sorry
about how I treated you before.

331
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,849
I needed the D'Harans to think
I was one of them.

332
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:20,565
Now, I want you to go back

333
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,455
- and find Garrick.
- You know my brother?

334
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:25,666
We're working together
to stop the massacres.

335
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,088
You might need this.

336
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,929
How do I know this isn't a trick,
so you can follow me back?

337
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,876
Because I already know
where they are.

338
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:43,249
A cave, about 600 paces
southwest of the river crossing.

339
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:44,798
I need you to tell your brother

340
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:47,687
a shipment of Whisperers is coming
through the Rekuna Pass tonight.

341
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:50,372
If he acts fast,
he can capture them.

342
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:53,626
If you're the Seeker,
why not go after the weapons yourself?

343
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,075
If I don't make bed check,

344
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,755
the D'Harans will think I deserted
and send a search party.

345
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,998
But the next guard
doesn't come on duty until dawn.

346
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:08,741
If you go now, you can reach Garrick
and intercept the shipment

347
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:11,504
before anyone knows you're missing.
Get his uniform on.

348
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,465
I'll try to slip away and meet up
with you the first chance I get.

349
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
Come on.

350
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:23,648
You're late, Dunn.

351
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,270
I'm gonna have to report you
to the captain.

352
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,166
No need. I was just with him.

353
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:36,474
And he gave me this
to share with my comrades.

354
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,078
Pays to make friends
with the right people.

355
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:46,911
Plenty for everyone.

356
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:51,790
Don't shoot!

357
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,639
It's me, Dror.

358
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:01,065
- I thought you were dead.
- Only taken prisoner.

359
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,513
The Seeker helped me escape.

360
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,067
It's good to see you, brother.

361
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,429
We've got work to do.

362
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:28,715
Who's the new man?

363
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:31,904
Confessed D'Haran.

364
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,087
The one the Seeker is impersonating.

365
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,049
Let's move out!

366
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,057
I wanna fight the D'Harans.

367
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,063
Make up for the things I've done.

368
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,895
No more killing for you.

369
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:55,833
Just stay here
and make something to eat.

370
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,319
The men will be hungry
when we get back.

371
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,086
Rebel prisoner's escaped.
I need men for a search party.

372
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,545
I'll find him, sir.

373
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,590
- Captain, wait.
- Not now, sergeant.

374
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,967
Sorry, sir.
But you'll wanna hear this.

375
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,150
Tell the captain what you told me.

376
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:27,037
I was posted at Azarith
two summers ago.

377
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,731
I met Archer Dunn there.

378
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:32,728
And that's not him.

379
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:40,538
I remember Dunn because
another soldier at Azarith deserted.

380
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,154
A friend of his.

381
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,781
The officers suspected
Dunn helped the man escape,

382
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,000
but other archers convinced the officers
that wasn't possible.

383
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,080
- Why not?
- Well, Dunn was too timid.

384
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:55,167
He was too scared to even snicker
when others were mocking the officers.

385
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,379
They called him "Mouse."
He was a laughingstock.

386
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,641
That was two summers ago.
Maybe your memory's cloudy.

387
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,682
I remember Dunn clear as day.

388
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,803
Scrawny with yellow hair.

389
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,967
Did you get the weapons?

390
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:32,891
I'm glad.

391
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,376
Torben the blacksmith was killed.

392
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,469
I'm sorry.

393
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,271
Would you like something to eat?

394
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,356
Get away from me!

395
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:07,406
Sorry for the loss of your friend.

396
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,471
You're sorry?

397
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,882
You're one of them,
you D'Haran bastard!

398
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:16,067
Carver!

399
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:21,837
I need bandages.

400
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,308
Thank you for giving me
another chance.

401
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:50,568
He's dead.

402
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:55,774
This is ridiculous,
I never saw this soldier before,

403
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,541
- not in Azarith or anywhere else.
- You're calling Voss a liar?

404
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:01,757
You know Frye hates me.

405
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:04,213
I thrashed him in front of his men,
humiliated him.

406
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,110
He ordered this soldier
to make these accusations

407
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:10,196
- because he wants revenge.
- A liar's excuse. I am doing my duty:

408
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:13,382
Protecting against an infiltrator
and serving Darken Rahl.

409
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:15,849
Captain, this man is an imposter,
maybe even a spy.

410
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:18,432
It's time for him to get
four arrows in his chest.

411
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,772
You two are dismissed.
Don't push me.

412
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:27,309
Move.

413
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,785
You're confined to the garrison
till I get to the truth of this.

414
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,249
It was cold-blooded murder.
Dror must be punished.

415
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:44,402
You think I'm going to let you punish
my own brother for killing a D'Haran?

416
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,714
After what those pigs
did to him in their stockade,

417
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,629
after they killed
so many of our people.

418
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:51,635
It wasn't Carver who tortured
your brother or killed your friends.

419
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,554
He was a soldier in Rahl's army.

420
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,165
He was Confessed.

421
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,141
He was a changed man.

422
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,060
And he wasn't even armed.

423
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,605
It's my duty as a Confessor
to bring his killer to justice.

424
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,608
I'm not going to let that happen.

425
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,318
We have the weapons.

426
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:18,537
There's no need for Richard to spend
another minute in that garrison.

427
00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:21,981
- We need to get him out.
- Not yet.

428
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:26,854
We still have time before the D'Harans
realize they've been robbed.

429
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:29,131
Pack up the Whisperers.

430
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:33,010
We're going to pay a little visit
to the good citizens of Grayson Village.

431
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,013
- Why?
- Grayson is filled with loyalists.

432
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,642
Let's see how they like it when Rahl's
dark magic is used against them.

433
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,661
Those people are civilians.

434
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,481
You use the weapons against them
and you're no better than Rahl.

435
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,480
I won't let you do it.

436
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,947
Stay out of our way, Confessor.

437
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:09,987
I wanna believe you.

438
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:12,629
- Your instincts are sharp, sir.
- Don't try to flatter me, Dunn.

439
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:15,605
Swear to me on your father's soul
that you're telling the truth.

440
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:19,561
I swear.

441
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:23,016
I trusted you.
I brought you home to meet my family,

442
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:26,948
even thought we could be friends,
if that's possible in this cursed place.

443
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,146
So if you're lying to me,

444
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,111
I won't send you to the crossbows.

445
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:34,943
I'll kill you myself.

446
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:41,537
Dunn's wife is here.

447
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:45,293
- His wife?
- She's outside the gate, very agitated.

448
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:48,104
Claims she walked for days from Azarith
to find her husband.

449
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:50,629
Says he left her destitute.
Insists on seeing him, sir.

450
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:55,020
Sir, I know that's against regulations,
send her away.

451
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:55,973
You see?

452
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:58,470
Anyone else in this garrison
would murder his bunkmate

453
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,014
just for the chance
to smell his woman's skin.

454
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:04,351
When she sees this man isn't her husband
it'll prove he's a liar.

455
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,333
Let's find out.

456
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,702
You abandoned me.

457
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:35,724
You haven't sent a penny home
for your children.

458
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:37,468
How do you expect us to survive?

459
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,311
You shouldn't have come here.

460
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,935
Don't they pay you?
How much does he earn?

461
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:50,314
Well, ma'am, he's only been
at this posting a few days.

462
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,441
Well, he hasn't sent me
money for months.

463
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,063
You selfish wench.

464
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,613
Who's watching our children
while you're chasing after me?

465
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:00,214
Captain, I'm sorry about this.

466
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,058
Let me get rid of her.

467
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,264
May have made quick work of you,

468
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,557
but I don't think Carver Dunn
is any match for his wife.

469
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:12,741
- "Wench"?
- You started it.

470
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:15,506
- Did you have to hit me so hard?
- We have to get out of here.

471
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:19,343
Garrick's captured the Whisperers,
he's gonna use them to attack Grayson.

472
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,232
The village? It's full
of innocent women and children.

473
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:23,722
- Why?
- Revenge.

474
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:26,141
The captain's family lives there.

475
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,298
I have to warn him.

476
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:29,978
He'll know you're a spy.

477
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,402
Go.

478
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,099
He's the Seeker!

479
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:49,706
Close the gates!

480
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:22,614
Stop!

481
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:28,996
Out of our way, Seeker.

482
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:30,735
Don't do this, Garrick.

483
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,750
Think about what we're fighting for,
an end to all the suffering.

484
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,336
To stop us,
you're gonna have to kill us.

485
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,326
Take them all!

486
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:13,149
Get out of here
before they kill you all!

487
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:36,897
Stop!

488
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,705
Or everyone dies!

489
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,116
We're close enough to the village

490
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,953
that all of those people will be
on their way to the underworld too.

491
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:56,947
But I can still stop the Whisper
from releasing its magic.

492
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,847
So if you wanna save those people,
then retreat.

493
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:02,922
Now.

494
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,051
All of you!

495
00:39:07,856 --> 00:39:10,138
What's to stop you from killing them
anyway once we're gone?

496
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,725
That's a chance
you'll just have to take.

497
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:34,418
Run!

498
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:14,345
You betrayed me.

499
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,706
- But you're fighting the rebels. Why?
- They were going to attack Grayson.

500
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,750
Why do you
care about a loyalist village?

501
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:22,919
My mission is to stop Darken Rahl,
not kill innocent people.

502
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:26,840
Thank you for saving my family.

503
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,141
But my duty is to serve Lord Rahl.

504
00:40:39,456 --> 00:40:41,057
I don't wanna fight you.

505
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:43,667
Then die where you stand.

506
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,656
No, stay back.

507
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:23,833
I could have used a man
who can fight like you.

508
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:31,032
Do your duty, Seeker.

509
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,123
Finish me.

510
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:43,758
Go back to your family.

511
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:01,935
Maybe we should have kept at least
one of the weapons.

512
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,814
- We could have used it to attack Rahl.
- Nobody should have weapons like these.

513
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:09,526
Too many innocent people
have already died.

514
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:12,404
The D'Haran captain wasn't innocent.

515
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,283
He would've killed you in a heartbeat
if he had the chance.

516
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:19,256
He might still try again someday.

517
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,663
Why did you let him go?

518
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,585
Why did you try to protect
Carver Dunn?
