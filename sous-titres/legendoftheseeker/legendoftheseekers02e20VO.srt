The only way to close the rift
is the way the Creator

3
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:08,559
sealed the Underworld.
The Stone of Tears.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,326
(Richard)
I think it's a compass.

5
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,794
This orb will guide
the Seeker's way.

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,561
(Cara) To what?
Hopefully the Stone of Tears.

7
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:15,595
(Kahlan)
Richard, we can't trust her.

8
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:18,196

Twice now she's proven herself
to me. I can use her.

9

10
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:22,445

Suddenly you wanna
defeat the Keeper?

12
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:26,514

16
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,586
(Keeper)
<i>Send him back to me.</i>

17
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,788
I have no intention
of going back.

18
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,119
The only reason
you want to save the world

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,119
is to save yourself.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,222

Dahlia?
You know her?

32
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,802
We served together
for many years.

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,404
Why were you following us?

34
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,805
The true Lord Rahl
is in danger.

35
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,473
I need your help
to save him.

36
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,141
Darken Rahl
may have used magic

37
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:52,175
to come back
to the world of the living,

38
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,611
but Richard
is the true Lord Rahl.

39
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,546
I'm not talking
about Darken Rahl.

40
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,347
Or the Seeker.

41
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,982
I'm talking about your son.

42
00:02:04,086 --> 00:02:05,285
You have a son?

43
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:07,987
Many Mord-Sith
bear children.

44
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:10,723
But not many bear children
fathered by Darken Rahl.

45
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:16,928
Why didn't
you ever tell us?

46
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,963
It wasn't important.

47
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:19,998
What happened to the child?

48
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,366
He was taken from me
at birth.

49
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,769
Oh, Cara, I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,871
Don't be.

51
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:30,241
It was considered an honor
to be chosen by Lord Rahl.

52
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,180
You know where the baby
was taken?

53
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,681
Male children
born to Mord-Sith

54
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,683
are sent to be raised
by the Dragon Corps

55
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,119
to learn to fight
for D'Hara.

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
When Darken Rahl died,
my Sisters and I

57
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,321
went to find the boy.

58
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,089
We took him back to our temple
and served him

59
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,689
like the true Lord Rahl
he will one day become.

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,686
But a week ago, our temple was
raided by Sisters of the Dark.

61
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:57,453
The Sisters' powers are useless
against Mord-Sith.

62
00:02:57,454 --> 00:03:00,121
We thought so too,
but they've grown stronger.

63
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:03,324
We couldn't repel their magic.

64
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,459
I was the only Mord-Sith
to survive.

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,126
The Sisters took the boy.

66
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,961
Where?
I tracked them to a retreat

67
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,529
in the hills of Eritrane,

68
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,898
but I knew I wouldn't be able
to rescue him on my own.

69
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,735
We have more important
things to do

70
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:20,504
than chase after
a missing child.

71
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:24,641
Cara, there's nothing more
important than your son.

72
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,344
He's the future of D'Hara,

73
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:31,547
and he needs your help.

74
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,081
You know I can't read
a Mord-Sith.

75
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,422
Do you think
we can trust her?

76
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,859
(Cara)
I've known her for a long time.

77
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,827
Before we were Mord-Sith,
we were schoolmates.

78
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:48,229
She was taken
from Stowecroft too.

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,563
(Richard)
If there's even a chance

80
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,231
she's telling the truth,

81
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,000
we need to find this boy.

82
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,603
What we need to find
is the Stone of Tears.

83
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:57,372
This could be a trap set
by the Sisters of the Dark

84
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,908
to take you away
from your quest.

85
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,410
Cara, we're talking
about a child.

86
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,511
Your son.

87
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07,615
He means nothing to me.
( sighs )

88
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,685
Whether you care for him or not,
the child is out there.

89
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:13,687
A child with Rahl blood,
possibly Rahl magic.

90
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,921
If Sisters of the Dark
have him,

91
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,589
there's no telling
what nefarious purpose

92
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,057
they have for him.

93
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,357
Zedd, go with Cara.

94
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,757
If Sisters of the Dark
have learned new magic,

95
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,391
she may need your help.

96
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,026
Kahlan and I will keep following
the compass.

97
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:28,027
We'll catch up with you
just as soon as we can.

And the Seeker
defeated Darken Rahl,

100
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,258
and the people were freed
forever from his cruelty.

101
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,293
That's a lovely story.

102
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,927
Tell me another one.

103
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,429
Do you want to hear
my favorite?

104
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,830
I want to hear
all your stories.

105
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,464
It's about a man
who loves a woman so much

106
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:16,133
that he would give his life
twice over just to hold her.

107
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:17,835
I know that one.

108
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:20,303
It doesn't end
the way you want it to.

109
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,572
Elodie, I would swim
across an ocean.

110
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,939
I would slay dragons.

to the Creator.

And she has heard
your prayers.

to come with me.

If anyone could take on
the Sisters of the Dark,

it's the son
of Cara and Darken Rahl.

is going to be like?

would have to be a girl.

00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:59,198
It's a good thing the Wizard
sleeps so soundly.

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,066
( <i>soft theme playing</i> )

179
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:04,936
If we move quickly
we can reach Eritrane

180
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,771
and rescue the child
before nightfall.

181
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:13,277
And then you'll go back
to the Seeker and his quest?

182
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:14,278
Yes.

183
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,746
You don't have to.

184
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,614
You could stay with me.

185
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,716
We could raise
the Lord Rahl together.

186
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:22,117
Richard is the Lord Rahl.

187
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:26,354
Cara, you led the charge
at Pallus Ridge.

188
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,489
You were merciless
at Valeria.

189
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,958
You once swore to kill the man
you now serve.

190
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,627
What happened to you?

191
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:37,863
Richard.

192
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,373
The Seeker could use a fighter
as strong as you, Dahlia.

193
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,343
We could serve him together.

194
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,982
I should wake Zedd.

195
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,920

(Kahlan)
Oh, it's beautiful.

199
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,093
Look at the compass.

200
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,104
You must be the Seeker.

201
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,039
Yes.

202
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,808

My name is Asa.

206
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,683
We've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

207
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,218
( compass chirps )

208
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:14,324
The Stone of Tears.

209
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,865
In the beginning of time,

210
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:24,402
the Creator asked us to be
the Guardians of the Stone.

211
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:27,806
She knew, in her infinite
wisdom, that one day,

212
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,676
the Keeper would wage war
on the living.

213
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:34,113
She told us that a Seeker
and Confessor would come

214
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,745
to preserve the precious life
she created.

215
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,013
We've waited thousands of years
for you.

216
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:41,482
Your ancestors
would be very proud.

217
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,317
We have no ancestors.

218
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:45,519
I don't understand.

219
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,987
We're the same people to whom
the Creator gave the Stone

220
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,422
thousands of years ago.

221
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,423
You're the first generation.

222
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,691
How is that possible?

223
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,593
The Stone's magic
has protected us

224
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,328
and kept us from aging.

225
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,229
(All)
<i>Blessed is the Creator</i>

226
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,864
<i>Who gave us the Stone</i>

227
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,433
(Asa)
We've prepared a cottage
and a hot meal.

228
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,101
Elodie will take you.
(Richard) Thank you.

229
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,102
But we can't stay.

230
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:07,503
I need to get the Stone

231
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,738
to the Pillars of Creation
as quickly as we can.

232
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,372
The Pillars of Creation?

233
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,740
The Scroll of Valdaire
said I had to take it there

234
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:15,108
to seal the rift
to the Underworld.

235
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,044
I don't know anything
about a scroll.

236
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,179
But the rift to the Underworld
can never be sealed.

237
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,249
This valley will be protected
from the Keeper's destruction.

238
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,552
So the Stone must stay
right here with us.

239
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:27,521
And so must you.

240
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,660
We came here to save
the world of the living,

241
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,127
not to hide
from the Keeper.

242
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,129
The compass led you here,
didn't it?

243
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,131
Yes, but--
The compass was a gift

244
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:37,265
from the Creator.

245
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,700
One of our own, Ulrich,

246
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:42,069
sacrificed his eternal life

247
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,837
and carried the compass
out of the valley

248
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,105
so that when the end was near

249
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:47,640
you would find it, Seeker,
and be led back to us.

250
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:50,544
We found the compass in the tomb
of the first Abbot of Ulrich.

251
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,246
The order must
have been named after him.

252
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:56,482
I know nothing
about orders and abbots,

253
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,817
but I know you will
save the world.

254
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,451
How?

255
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:05,256
In time,
after the destruction is over,

256
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,958
you and the Mother Confessor

257
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,059
will leave our valley

258
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,161
and begin the world anew.

259
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,297
We can't have children.

260
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:18,398
That's why we need you.

261
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,569
Your children will be the new
first generation.

262
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,807
That is the Creator's will.

263
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:29,610
Even if this is true,
I don't believe the Creator

264
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,644
wants everyone else
in the world to die.

265
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,112
Since you are here,

266
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:35,481
it means the world's already
been corrupted by the Keeper.

267
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:36,816
The people are wicked.

268
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:38,818
You don't need to mourn
their loss.

269
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,886
That's not true.

270
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,788
There are good people
in the world.

271
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:44,589
(Elodie)
Asa.

272
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,724
We haven't left this valley
or seen the Creator

273
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,426
for thousands of years.

274
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:51,095
Maybe they know more
about the outside than we do.

275
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:55,966
The Creator has told us
all we need to know.

276
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,768
But I can't let the rest
of the world fall to the Keeper.

277
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,837
Not if there's a chance
to save it.

278
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,438
If you take the Stone
out of this valley

279
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,040
and fail to stop the Keeper,

280
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,174
the world will end

281
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,342
and you and the Confessor
will die.

282
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,377
There will be no one left
to preserve life.

283
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,645
That is how the Keeper
will win.

284
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,951
Is that a chance
you're prepared to take?

285
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,018
Yes.

286
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:23,955
Now, I don't want to fight you,
but we're leaving.

287
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:27,025
We're not violent people.

288
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,860
We can't stop you.

289
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:33,431
All we can do is pray
for the Creator's guidance.

290

I don't understand.

296
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,583
This is where
we came in.

297
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:57,984
The compass.

298
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:00,220
That's what got us
through before.

299
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,525
The compass was created
to lead us to the Stone.

300
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:09,360
Maybe now that it's done that,
its magic no longer works.

301
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,896
We need to find
another way out.

302
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:21,005
How much further
to Eritrane?

303
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,440
We're close.

304
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,709
Oh!
Dahlia, no!

Why are you doing this?

When it's all over,
you'll be glad I did.

Welcome home, Cara.

00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,394
Your sisters and I
have missed you.

317
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:26,678
Where's Zedd?

318
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,512
Your concern for the Wizard
is touching.

319
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,517
I shall put your tender heart
at ease.

320
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,518
He's alive. For now.

321
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,021
What do you want with us?

322
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,189
Isn't it obvious?

323
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,891
I want you back
on my side.

324
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,260
Though I must admit

325
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:50,365
you haven't made it easy
for me.

326
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:55,236
I may no longer have armies
at my command.

327
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,304
But fortunately,

328
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:01,575
I knew of your special
friendship with Dahlia.

329
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:06,080
I knew she would want you back
as much as I do.

330
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:10,150
My son

331
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:12,952
was never kidnapped,

332
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,053
was he?

333
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,459
Your son was killed
the day he was born.

334
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,196
I couldn't risk the little
bastard growing up

335
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,998
to challenge my authority,
now, could I?

336
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,202
Oh, Cara.

337
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,938
Has that made you sad?

338
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,907
You really have grown soft since
you started serving the Seeker,

339
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,141
haven't you?

340
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:41,579
It's my fault, I suppose.

341
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,716
I left your training
to underlings.

342
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:47,518
( Agiel whining )
But someone as valuable as you

343
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,892
deserves my personal attention.

344
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,597
This time,

345
00:20:57,598 --> 00:21:00,033
I won't make
the same mistake.

346
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:01,968
( Agiel whining )

347
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,945
We're right back
where we started.

348
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:13,382
There's no getting through
these cliffs.

350
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,252
If we can't go through...

351
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,858
we'll go over.

352
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:42,379
Where's Cara?

353
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,616

You held my hand so tightly,

386
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,331

that kept me from crying.

We knew if we cried
they'd just torture us more.

We survived because we protected
each other from our weaknesses.

That's what I'm doing now.

And even if I were confessed,

535
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:20,241
I couldn't possibly love you
any more than I already do.

536
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:27,649
( Kahlan sighs )

537
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,384
I'm sorry to disturb you.

538
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:31,886
I just wanted
to leave you some food.

539
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:35,623
The Creator has provided us
with wonderful things to eat,

540
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:37,526
a beautiful place to live.

541
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,561
Maybe you could learn
to like it here.

542
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:41,029
How could we like it here

543
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,397
when our friends on the outside
are suffering?

544
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,165
But you're safe here.

545
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,968
In a world free from the Keeper

546
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:50,704
and banelings and Darken Rahl.

547
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,841
Asa said none of you
have ever left this valley.

548
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,477
How do you know about banelings
and Darken Rahl?

549
00:32:57,478 --> 00:33:00,847
There are stories written
in the ancient scrolls.

550
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,215
She's lying.

551
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:06,018
Do you understand
what a Confessor does?

552
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,420
If you do not tell us the truth,
I will release my power

553
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,589
and you will be my slave
for as long as I live.

554
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,060
And in this valley, that is
going to be a very long time.

555
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,228
I'll tell you, but please,

556
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,562
you can't tell Asa

557
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,264
or he'll take the ring
away from me.

558
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,400
What ring?

559
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,869
Asa told you of Ulrich,

560
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,038
who took the compass
out of our valley.

561
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,375
Before he left, the Creator
made two magical rings

562
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:35,811
so that Ulrich could speak to
Asa even when he was far away.

563
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,113
When Asa slept,

564
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:39,581
I'd take the ring

565
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,283
so that I could speak
to Ulrich.

566
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,084
I was in love with him

567
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:46,420
and this was the only way
we could be together.

568
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:49,756
But he grew old
and you didn't.

569
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,625
When Ulrich died,

570
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:53,296
Asa cast his ring away.

571
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:59,206
But I found it
and secretly kept it.

572
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:02,476
Sometimes I would take it out
to remember Ulrich.

573
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:07,115
One day, I put the ring on
and an old woman appeared to me.

574
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:09,083
The old woman told me
she'd bought the ring

575
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:10,817
from a traveling merchant.

576
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:14,955
The ring has fallen
into many hands over the years,

577
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:16,890
and I've made
many more friends.

578
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,659
Who has the other ring now?

579
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,696
His name is Alastair.

580
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:24,232
He's the first man
I've loved since Ulrich.

581
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,801
I need to speak with him.

582
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:28,937
This may be our only chance
of stopping the Keeper.

583
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:31,839
But I would be defying Asa
and the Creator.

584
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,975
Elodie, if we don't
take this chance,

585
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:36,311
good people are going to die.

586
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,482
Do you believe that's what
the Creator wants?

587
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:41,352
I need to use the ring.

588
00:34:41,353 --> 00:34:42,988
When I last saw Zedd,

589
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,656
we were on the road
near Dalmoore.

590
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:46,625
He headed east
towards Eritrane.

591
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,926
He said he'd come back
to find us

592
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,159
when his mission
was finished.

593
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,692
Travel in the direction he went,

594
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:51,992
and if we're lucky,

595
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,494
you'll find him heading back
your way.

596
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:56,530
I need you
to give him the ring.

597
00:34:56,531 --> 00:35:00,033
And then he'll be able to get
you out of the valley.

598
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,601
And Elodie too?

599
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,641
I don't know.

600
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,576
( <i>menacing theme playing</i> )

601
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:17,616
Your training is finally over,
Cara.

602
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,719
But now you face
one final test

603
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,623
to ensure
that you are re-broken.

604
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:37,201
I want you to kill the Wizard.

605
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:48,832
( Agiel whining )

606
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,025
I know you, Cara.

607
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:57,118
This isn't who you are.

608
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:03,356
Don't keep me waiting, Cara.

609
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,565
( grunts )
Cara, no!

610
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,499
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

611
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,504
I told you I serve Richard.

612
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,141
We don't have much time before

613
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,708
the Sisters of the Dark
come back.

614
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:34,046
( Agiel whining )
( screams )

615
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,517
Let's go.

616
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:40,385
We need the key
to the rada'han.

617
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,359
(Zedd)
No, Cara!

618
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,827
If you kill him,
he'll tell the Keeper

619
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:52,495
where Richard is supposed
to take the Stone.

620
00:36:59,604 --> 00:37:01,204
Excuse me, friends.

621
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,139
Have you seen a tall man
with long white hair

622
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,342
pass through here? I spoke
to a man in Dalmoore.

623
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:07,510
He said he had seen him
on this road a few days ago.

624
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:11,379
We might be able
to help you.

625
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,114
But it'll cost you
10 shillings.

626
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,516
I don't have any money.

627
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:17,285
I'll have to ask
somewhere else.

628
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:18,219
No!

629
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,488
Ah.

630
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,056
(Alastair)
You can't take that!

631
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:26,494
Please.

632
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,662
I-It can't be worth much to you,

633
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,631
but the fate of the world
depends on it.

634
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:31,966
The fate of the world?

635
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,535
Well, no one's ever tried
that excuse before.

636
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,206
( wind roaring )

637
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,782
(Zedd)
Are you all right, young man?

638
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:51,086
You're Zeddicus the Wizard.

639
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,587
That's right.

640
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:54,922
The Seeker
told me to find you.

641
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:02,327
(Zedd)
I can't even sense
where the portal is.

642
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:05,030
Whatever magic allowed you
to pass through this rock

643
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:06,531
is beyond my powers.

644
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,367
If you can't get in,

645
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,902
what about
the spell of taking?

646
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:12,306
It doesn't work
on living things.

647
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:14,409
I can't use it to get you
out of the valley.

648
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,212
No, but you once used it to take
the Sword and compass from me.

649
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,680
It might work
on the Stone of Tears.

650
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:22,748
It might, but the last time
I performed that spell,

651
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:24,015
I had Shota's help.

652
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:26,050
I don't know
if I can do it on my own.

653
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:27,518
We have to try, Zedd.

654
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,287
And maybe if you get the Stone
out of here,

655
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:30,854
the compass will
start working again.

656
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,722
And lead you out
of the valley

657
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,490
But if it doesn't,

658
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:36,125
and Kahlan and I are trapped
here forever,

659
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:37,927
you'll still have
the Stone.

660
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:41,972
You and Cara can take it to the
Pillars of Creation without us.

661
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:44,443
The spell is more likely to work
if I can see the Stone.

662
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:54,653
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

663
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:08,566
It worked.

664
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,504
So does the compass.

665
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,141

Zedd, are you all right?

Cara attacked me.

677
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,981
She took the Stone.

678
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:56,684
I thought she had withstood
Rahl's attempts to re-break her,

679
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,853
but obviously
I was deceived.

680
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:01,486
Stay where you are.

681
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,122
We'll be there
as soon as we can.

682
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,931
The Stone is gone.

683
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,000
We can feel it.

684
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,202
What have you done with it?

685
00:40:21,203 --> 00:40:22,737
I sent it out of the valley.

Who has it now?

687
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,310
The compass is working again.

688
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,245
We'll get the Stone back

689
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:33,280
and take it
to the Pillars of Creation.

thought the Creator intended,

to defeat the Keeper.

what it's been like,
