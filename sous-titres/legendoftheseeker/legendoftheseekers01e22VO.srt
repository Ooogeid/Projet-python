What did you tell her?

547
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,618
It was perfectly simple.

548
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:34,154
All you have to do

549
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:38,092
is combine the magic of Orden,
Confessor and Agiel

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,961

the boxes,

even if this harlot's
willing to help you,

554
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,807
you're still missing one
essential ingredient:

555
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:58,145
The touch of a Confessor.

556
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,884
That's why she agreed
to marry Rahl,

557
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:07,421
so she could bear a child
that would help you.

558
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:11,425

to an abomination.

You're going to let

Do you know where
we can find him?

567

be very unhappy

in the world

569

hands on the power of Orden.

570
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,066
Take me to him.

576
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,555
The Seeker has returned.

577
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:16,924
He has all three
boxes of Orden.

578
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,493
He wants you
to confess him.

579
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:21,695
Why would he want that?

580
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:24,064
Because  you do
it at the very moment

581
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,632
he puts the boxes together,

582
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,769
and then he's struck
with a Mord-Sith's Agiel,

583
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,638
he will return to a time
before you were born

584
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:34,308

585
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,411
And then you, Master,
will never be.

586
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,513
I destroyed the Mord-Sith.

587
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:42,516
One of them has traveled
with him from the past.

588

They plot your demise.

589
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:47,054
Then I will kill them.

590
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:49,223
You won't be able to.

591
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,593
The Seeker will be waiting
with the boxes

592
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,895
at the Crags of Blood,
under the full moon.

593
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:56,630
And he is the Seeker.

594
00:35:56,698 --> 00:36:00,000
The moment he senses
the slightest threat,

595
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,703
he will put the boxes together.

596
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,738
And if you do not Confess him,

597
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:07,641
he will have
the power of Orden

598
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,810
and he will rule even you.

599
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:14,681
But you know
how I can defeat him.

600
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:19,486
If you Confess him,
but prevent the Mord-Sith

601

from adding her magic to his,

602

the man who controls Orden.
