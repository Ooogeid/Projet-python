(Richard)
The trail ends here.

8
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,871
Denna must be in there.

9
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,269
Then what are we waiting for?

10
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:46,633
If she doesn't have
the compass,

11
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,299
we need to find out
where she's hidden it.

12
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,197
We can't risk
killing her.

13
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,827
Kahlan, if we can draw her out,
you can confess her.

any survivors.

34
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:25,892

What's happening to him?

58
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,381
I don't know.

59
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,283
Maybe it's something
Denna did.

60
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,051
This is no Mord-Sith magic.

61
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,352
( grunts )

62
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,954
Zedd would know what to do.

(woman)
He won't be able to help him.

64
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,958
Only we can.

65
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,628
You're Sisters of the Light.

66
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,830
I'm Sister Verna.

67
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,065
This is Sister Katharine
and Sister Elizabeth.

68
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,266
What's happening to him?

69
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,169
The Wizard in him is awakening.

70
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:53,507
Wizard?
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,043
Twenty-four years ago,
we received a prophecy

72
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,380
that a great Wizard
would be born in Brennidon.

73
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,615
And we've been searching for you
ever since.

74
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,050
(Verna)
When we arrived in Brennidon,

75
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,153
the people said
that you'd been killed.

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,886
But still we kept searching.

77
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,921
I've been back in the Midlands
for over a year now.

78
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:12,824
Until a few weeks ago, we were
rotting in a D'Haran prison.

79
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,259
(Katharine)
But all the suffering
was worth it,

80
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:18,695
because now we've found you.

81
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,530
You've been having these
headaches for a while,

82
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:22,565
haven't you?

83
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,368
And they've been
getting worse.

84
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:26,836
Richard,
why didn't you say anything?

85
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:27,970
I didn't want to worry you.

86
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,973
You said you could help him.

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,407
Do it.

88
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:32,909
It's not that simple.

89
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:36,807
The headaches are a result of
the han bottling up inside him.

90
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,142
(Richard)
Han?

91
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,943
Han is the magic
that flows through the veins

92
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,144
of all Wizards.

93
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,279
I'm not-- Unh.

94
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,915
I'm not a Wizard.

95
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,150
You are the union
of two bloodlines

96
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,085
that possess very strong magic.

97
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,155
Rahl and Zorander.

98
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:57,324
Your han is so powerful,

99
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,425
if you don't
learn to use it,

100
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,859
it will kill you.

101
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,194
It is only by the hand
of the Creator

102
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,328
that we found you in time.

103
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,064
You must come with us
to the Palace of the Prophets.

104
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,799
Only there can we teach you
to control it.

105
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,835
(Katharine)
That is the duty
of the Sisters of the Light.

106
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:16,806
To instruct young Wizards
to master their gift.

107
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:19,443
Where is this
Palace of the Prophets?

108
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,312
In the Old World.

109
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,917
How long will it take to get
Richard there and cure him?

110
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:30,319
I'm not certain.
But we don't have much time.

111
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,888
You must leave with us
immediately.

112
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,623
I'm not
going anywhere.

113
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,325
We already have a Wizard,

114
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:39,795
and I gotta get him back.

115
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,264
Richard.

116
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:45,935

00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,208

<i>( ethereal theme playing )</i>

120
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:14,125
The pain.

121
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,561
It's gone.

122
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:21,899
What's wrong with her?

123
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,702
She's dead.

124
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:36,577
Sister Elizabeth
took your pain upon herself...

125
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,646
and it was so great
that it killed her.

126
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:40,946
Why would she do that?

127
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:44,482
The Sisters of the Light
are sworn to protect you.

128
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,151
And die for you, if necessary.

129
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,186
I don't want anybody
dying for me.

130
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,387
Give her
the Breath of Life.

131
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:54,325
No. You've seen
how powerful the han is.

132
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,894
Even the small amount
still inside Sister Elizabeth

133
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:58,829
would kill your Mord-Sith.

134
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,132
And eventually it will kill you.

135
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,068
But she cured me.

136
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,038
It's not a cure.

137
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:10,842
The pain will return,
and worse than before.

138
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,412
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,814
Richard,
you have to go with them.

140

I won't leave you.
I won't leave Zedd.

141
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,584
Cara and I
will find Zedd.

142
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,052
And the compass.

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,318
Your death won't help us
do that.

144
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,052
You're asking me
to give up my quest.

145
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,787
I'm asking you to stay alive.

146
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,259
I can't live
in a world without you.

147
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:35,260
Kahlan--

Richard.

149
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,732
If you love me,
you'll do this.

150
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,907
All right. I'll go.

151
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,709
And I'm coming with you.

The Sisters of the Light

153
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,578
aren't the only ones
sworn to protect you.

154
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,413
I'll come back as quickly
as I can.

155
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,781
But I need you to go
with Kahlan to find Zedd.

156
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:07,187
Protect her
as if she were me.

157
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,258
I think it's good
you're leaving.

158
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,493
You'd only
slow us down.

159
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:20,766
I'll miss you too.

160
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:27,171
What are you doing?

161
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,338
I don't know
how long I'll be gone.

162
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:30,839
And you can't wait for me.

163
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,976
Once you've found Zedd
and the compass,

164
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:35,181
he may have to name a new Seeker
to find the Stone of Tears.

Richard--

166
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,351
The quest is bigger
than just one man.

167

Take it.

168
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:51,262
But only until you return.

169
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,235
Something to protect
yourself with.

170
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:14,516
I love you.

171
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,885
And I will be back.

<i>( tender theme playing )</i>

173
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,631
Richard, for the last time,
you need to slow down.

174
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,999
The sooner we get there,

175
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,367
the sooner I can get back
to my quest.

176
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,635
Getting us lost won't help.

177
00:10:57,703 --> 00:10:59,937
There are many entrances
to the Old World,

178
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:01,638
but you must know
where to find them.

179
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,173
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

180
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,041
It took you 24 years
to find me.

181
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:10,612
Well, I assume they call you
"the Seeker" for a reason.

182
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,781
Maybe you can show us the way
to the Old World.

183
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,983
I can't see anything
in this fog.

184
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,985
Once you've finished
your Wizard's training,

185
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,653
you will see things
quite differently.

186
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,158
So, what does this
training involve?

187
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,926
You'll learn everything
you need to know

188
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:28,162
once we reach
the Palace of the Prophets.

189
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,130
How long does it take
to train a Wizard?

190
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,233
You ask a lot of questions.

191
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,168
Yes. And I'm used to
getting answers.

192
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,804
The training takes as long
as it takes.

193
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:40,205
Much of that is up to you.

194
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,473
It depends on
how fast you learn.

195
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,942
Well, you'd be surprised
at how fast I can learn.

196
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,343
That's what I'm afraid of.

197
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,079
What? You won't have
the pleasure of my company

198
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,380
for very long?

199
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,382
But you don't understand
the difference

200
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,617
between knowledge and wisdom.

201
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:55,186
Knowledge is easy to gain.

202
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:58,657
Wisdom is much harder.

203
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,359
Much harm has come from those
who don't know the difference.

204
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,294
Is she always this much fun
to be around?

205
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:13,237
We're here.

206
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,073

( Agiel whines )
( screams )

208
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,093
Time to get moving,
Wizard.

209
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:42,096
This is pointless.

210
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:43,931
The compass
is of no use to you.

211
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,699
It only works in the hands
of the Seeker.

212
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,068
You think I care
about this trinket?

213
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,204
The compass was the bait
to catch you.

214
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,539
Think of all I can accomplish

215
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,641
now that I have
a Wizard of the First Order

216
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,077
to do my bidding.

217
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,646
I'm afraid I'll be more useless
to you than that compass.

218
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,614
Not even you can resist

219
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,117
being broken by a Mord-Sith.

220
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,721
You're mistaken.

221
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,789
No.

222
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:16,291
If you think your friends
are coming to help you,

223
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,127
you're the one who's mistaken.

224

<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

225
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,273
If you need to stop
and rest...

226
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,442
Is that your way of saying
you need to stop and rest?

227
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,280
No, it's my way of saying
you're slowing us down.

228
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,315
We need to find
the next flower.

229
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:48,785
I think I have.

230
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:51,021
The roots are here, but
someone's picked the flower.

Yes, Confessor.

She said if we killed you,

248
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,717
we'd receive
20 gold pieces each.

249
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,986
And where were you supposed to
collect this payment?

I would have just been
a child.

That's usual when Wizards
begin their training.

It's better that way.
Why?

255
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,265
Because children
do as they're told.

Never.

get out of the way.

You've lost the trail.

276

We have to seek shelter.

277
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,260
And leave your Sister
to these creatures?

278
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:18,528
Sister Katharine was prepared
to give her life for you,

279
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:20,396
just like Sister Elizabeth.

280
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:23,332
You say you don't want
anyone to die for you,

but what about my life?

282
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:28,469
I've sacrificed half of it
already, searching for you.

283
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,838
And if I have to die out here
without getting you

284
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,239
back to the Palace
of the Prophets,

285
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,174
it will all have been
for nothing.

286
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,214
You failed me.

287
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:44,349

that they were still coming.

Oh.

289
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:50,688
And for that you feel
you still deserve payment?

290
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:53,528
And that of the other men who
no longer have use for theirs.

291
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,796
( laughing )

292
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:57,964
Ve-- Very well.

293
00:17:58,032 --> 00:17:59,833
You'll both be paid in full.

I assume that's
the going rate for failure?

297
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,219
My friends will never stop
coming for you.

298
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,555
They will if they assume
I'm dead.

299
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:20,725
You arrange that, can't you?

300
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,460
Gladly.

301
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,230
Would a knife
in the belly suffice?

302
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,970
I've given you two corpses.

303
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:35,436
Surely you can use your magic
to make them look like us.

304
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:38,571
Oh, I have the magic.

305
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,374
But you don't have the time
to torture me into using it.

306
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:43,708
You underestimate me, Wizard.

307
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:48,647
I have more subtle means
of persuasion.

308
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:56,720
All right!

309
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:59,588
But I have one condition.

310
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:01,590
That leave behind
the compass

311
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,525
so that they can continue the
search for the Stone of Tears.

312
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,360
As long as you
keep it from them

313
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,228
they will not stop
searching for it.

314
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:12,131
And eventually
they'll uncover your ruse.

315
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:17,703
It's the only way you can
truly be rid of them.

316
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,375
We have a deal, Wizard.

317
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,278

318
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:31,218

319
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,033
(Verna)
These are the Majendie.

320
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,335
They're allies
of the Sisters of Light.

321
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:58,875
You must be exhausted
after your ordeal.

322
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:01,144
If there's anything
we can do for you...

323
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:02,745
You could lend me
some of your men

324
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,213
to help me search
for Sister Katharine.

325
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,048
It's too late.

326
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,450
Looking for her would only
lead to more death.

327
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,252
The Mriswith have swarmed
this area.

328
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,488
When I left the Old World,
they were nearly extinct.

329
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:14,756
Somehow they've increased
their numbers.

330
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,091
That's impossible.

331
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,260
To control
the Mriswith's numbers,

332
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,728
the Wizards who created them

333
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,396
made them incapable
of reproducing.

334
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:24,531
Created?

335
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,965
For what?

336
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,467
During the darkest hour
of the Great Wizards' War,

337
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,236
when all was lost,

338
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,304
a group of Wizards
nobly volunteered

339
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,873
to be transformed into a vicious
fighting force.

340
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,776
Because of their sacrifice,
the tide was turned.

341
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:40,778
They won the war,
but lost their souls forever.

342
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,080
Bloodlust is all they know.

343
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,392
They're nesting in the
Lurra Caves, and from there,

344
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,231
they've been attacking
our trade routes.

345
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,266
And the road to the Palace
of the Prophets?

346
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,468
Impassable.

347
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,537
Captain Takoda,
we don't have much time.

348
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,439
I have to get Richard there.

349
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,107
Are you a Wizard?

350
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,376
Yes.
No.

351
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,979
Not yet.

352
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,448
He's on his way to be trained
in the gift.

353
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,684
Then perhaps when you
return from the Palace,

354
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,620
you can help us eradicate
the Mriswith.

355
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:15,323
I have to get there first.

356
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,162
There is one way.

357
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,565
( man coughing )

358
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,568
These Baka-Ban dogs have been
raiding our village.

359
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,537
Liar!
We came here to make peace!

360
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,508
There's a rock
half a league from here.

361
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:36,111
Take a few ot hese prisoners
and chain them to it.

362
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,846
The Mriswith will be
drawn to them,

363
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,481
which should allow you to pass

364
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,151
through their territory
unharmed.

365
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,852
(woman)
Get your hands off me.

366
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,488
( spits )

367
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,993
I'm not sacrificing anyone.

368
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:53,797
Then you will not make it

369
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:57,001
to the Palace of the Prophets
alive.

370
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:59,103
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

371
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,167
We have to take
the prisoners

372
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:04,670
to draw the Mriswith
away from us.

373
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:05,904
You believe
in the Creator,

374
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:07,373
but you'd willingly
let those people die?

375
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,241
They're an acceptable loss.

376
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,909
Think their lives
are worth less than mine?

377
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:14,245
There are so few Wizards left
in the world, Richard.

378
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,614
I don't care about
becoming a Wizard.

379
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:18,750
( groans )

380
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,324
( breathing heavily )

381
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,226
I'm only coming with you
to get rid of this pain.

382
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,829
But you're so much more
than that.

383
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:34,567
By learning to use your powers,
you could save many more people.

384
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,436
You could eradicate the Mriswith
once and for all

385
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:39,539
and make it so that no one else
has to die at their hands.

386
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:41,574
Yes. Starting with
these prisoners.

387
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:43,443
And who are they to you

388
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:45,579
that you would risk everything
to save them?

389
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,349
They're people
being fed to monsters.

390
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,517
I'm going to stop it.

391
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,152
No, I won't allow you
to do that.

392
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,187
Yes, you will.

393
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:54,889
And if you want me to come

394
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,123
to the Palace
of the Prophets,

395
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,292
you will help me.

396
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,200
( metal slicing )

397
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,003
( both scream )

398
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:13,305
The Dacras contain
powerful magic.

399
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:15,107
If you don't do exactly
as we say,

400
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,407
I will release it
and you will die.

401
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:17,374
Drop your weapons.

402
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:21,945
Now release
the prisoners.

403
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:23,379
Come on.

404
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:24,881
( keys rattle )

405
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,150
( hinges squeak )

406
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:28,618
Go, go.

407
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:31,252
Go, go, go.

408
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:34,855
May the Spirits
bless you.

409
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:38,757
( grunts )

410
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,327
(Richard)
Into the cells.

411
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:46,463
( grunts )

412
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:53,768
(Richard)
Let's move.

413
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,508
( grunts )

414
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,576
You should keep going.

415
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,311
You'll move faster alone.

416
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,445
Obviously.

417
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,115
But I made a promise
to Richard.

418
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:16,983
( groaning )

419
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,852
It's infected.

420
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,054
We need to burn the wound
closed.

421
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:24,622
We don't have time
to make a fire.

422
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,726
I don't need a fire.

423
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:32,562
But it will hurt.

424
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,099
I've been struck
by an Agiel before.

425
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:37,369
Not like this.

426
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:39,938
Do it.

427
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,481
( Agiel whining )

428
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,527
( panting )

429
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:04,496
Hm, I'm impressed.

430
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:07,564
Even the strongest Mord-Sith
would've fainted.

431
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:13,768
Kahlan?

432
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,770
(Richard)
You know, for someone who says

433
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:19,571
she came to make peace with the
Majendie, that was some punch.

434
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,038
The Majendie
lied to us.

435
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,640
They lured us to their town
with talk of peace.

436
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:27,443
I led 50 of my people here
to negotiate a treaty,

437
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,045
so they could use us as bait
for the Mriswith.

438
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,581
We're all that's left.

439
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:36,716
We prayed for the Spirits to
send the one who would save us.

440
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:39,619
My people call him
the Cahairn.

441
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:40,853
It's you.

442
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,922
( chuckles )

443
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,557
Something funny?

444
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,194
Oh, you think
I'm the Cahairn,

445
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:49,096
she thinks I'm a Wizard,

446
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,065
where I'm from
they call me the Seeker.

447
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,102
But you can just call me
Richard.

448
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,304
I'm Du' Challu.

449
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,506
Thank you for rescuing us.

450
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:02,141
If we can get you back to your
home, would you be safe there?

451
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,608
Yes.

452
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,309
Our village is protected
from the Mriswith.

453
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:06,677
How do we get there?

454
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,344
It's just across the river.

455
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:11,246
But the Majendie destroyed
the only bridge.

456
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:12,980
Is there somewhere else
we can cross?

457
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:14,748
At the mud flats.

458
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:16,315
Past the Lurra Caves?

459
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,316
That's where Captain Takoda
said the Mriswith are nesting.

460
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:25,287
Where are the prisoners?

461
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:26,621
They took them and fled.

462
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,089
They could be halfway
to their village by now.

463
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:30,390
Then we need
to get them back.

464
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,591
What about the Mriswith?
They'll slaughter us.

465
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,193
And if we don't recapture
the prisoners,

466
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,228
we'll be trapped inside
our own city.

467
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:38,663
We need those prisoners
to distract the creatures.

468
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,464
Yes, but sir,

469
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,066
who will distract them
from us?

470
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,671
This is it.

471
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,243
This is where the D'Harans
were supposed to meet Denna.

472
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,845
Zedd.

473
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,712
Zedd.

474
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,680
Zedd!

475
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:00,349
Zedd.

476
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,319
No.

477
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:07,921
Looks like he was able
to stab her

478
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:10,591
before she could kill him
with her Agiel.

479
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,400
( sobbing )

480
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:24,338
The Wizard fought well.

481
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:32,114
He got us the compass back.

482
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,017
( sighs )

483
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:45,459
How am I going to tell Richard?

484
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,601
What is it?

485
00:27:58,238 --> 00:27:59,105
(Takoda)
Stop where you are.

486
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:02,842
We only want
the prisoners back.

487
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,778
Give them to us
and you can go on your way.

488
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,579
So they can be killed
by the Mriswith?

489
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:09,381
The Majendie have been allies

490
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,584
with the Sisters of the Light
for generations.

491
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:12,952
They were bonds
forged in battle.

492
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:14,386
You must--
( screams )

493
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:21,526
( screams )

494
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:23,395
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

495
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:24,462
( glass shatters )

496
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:29,599
( glass shatters )

497
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,300
( screaming )

498
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,505
We have to move now.

499
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,975
If you get my people
back home,

500
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,176
then I'll stay behind and draw
the Mriswith away from you.

501
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,111
If not for you, I would've
been killed anyway.

502
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,847
At least this way, my death
will help save my people.

503
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,951
No. It's time
to make a stand.

504
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,319
We're going to fight
the Mriswith.

505
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:57,689
How can we fight something
we can't even see?

506
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,758
( soldiers screaming )

507
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,527
( birds singing )

508
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,372
I hope you don't expect me
to eat that

509
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,174
without proper
blackberry sauce.

510
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:18,043
Refusing to eat will only make
the journey harder for you.

511
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:21,580
I'm touched by your concern
for my well-being,

512
00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:23,215
but why are we going
anywhere?

513
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,550
Why not break me right here?

514
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:29,121
So your screams can reach
sympathetic ears?

515
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:33,827
No, I have a more suitable place
in mind for your training.

516
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:37,262
You have another choice.

517
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,366
You could be merciful.

518
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:45,271
You think I'll let you go?

519
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:46,905
Of course not.

520
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:49,509
But you could give me a swift
death instead of torturing me.

521
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:53,646
But that's the part
I enjoy the most.

522
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:57,217
I've given you a new life.
What else do you want?

523
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:01,388
You can't imagine the things
I want.

524
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:04,224
And you're going to help me
get them.

525
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:08,295
You served the Seeker well,
and now you'll serve me.

526
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,630
Never.

527
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:12,800
( scoffs )

528
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:16,271
I think you'll find it
quite liberating, Wizard.

529
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:20,408
For so long you've been burdened
with all the world's concerns.

530
00:30:21,144 --> 00:30:24,245
Once you're broken,
you'll have only one:

531
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:27,115
pleasing me.

532
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:30,652
Oh, Denna.

533
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,454
Look at me.

534
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:34,757
I'm skinny enough

I'll be a bag of bones,

I'll be dead.

There's no pleasure
in breaking someone

who's too weak to fight back.
Now eat!

I've lost my appetite.

to begin your training,

Without a Wizard of the First
Order to name a new Seeker,

we have to find a way

to get to Richard.
You need to rest.

549

Stay here.
I'll find horses.

550
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:30,196
I'm fine.

551
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,800
I need to rest.

552
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,268
I'm very tired.

00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:39,169
How can you be tired?

554
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:41,136

That cloud.

It's not moving

Why are we discussing

Because that's a tracer cloud.

562
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,687
The Wizard is dead.

What if those corpses
were a trick?

You're seeing

That's a message
sent by Zedd.

567
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,003
I know you're grieving
for the Wizard,

568
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,038
but you need to be strong enough
to accept the truth

569
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,306
that he's dead.

570
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,209
You're giving up
too easily.

571
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,011
And you're relying
on blind faith.

572

If your plan was to trap us,
you've succeeded brilliantly.

577
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:51,701
The mud will show
their tracks.

578
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,303
And if we know where they are,
we can kill them.

579

They're not killing people...

They're turning them
into Mriswith.

Maybe using their own
Wizard's blood.

We may still have time
to save her.

you won't kill me.

everything I ask.

the attention of the Seeker,

for nothing.

Well, the sooner we get there,
the sooner I can get back home.

715
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:02,011
You're not the only one
eager to return home.

716
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,714
I haven't seen mine
in 24 years.

717
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:08,884
How could you bear to be away

718
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,519
from your loved ones
for so long?

719
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:13,589
As long as you keep them
in your heart,

720
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,823
you take them
wherever you go.
