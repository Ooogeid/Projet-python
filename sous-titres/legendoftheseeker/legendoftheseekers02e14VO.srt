(Group)
Keeper of the Underworld,

6
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,992
hear our prayer.

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,999
Though we walk in this world,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,230
we live only
to extinguish the light.

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,078
We bow before you

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,354
and faithfully do
your bidding.

11
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,246
Sisters,

12
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,159
twice now
Nicci has failed

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,083
to kill
the Mother Confessor.

14
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:44,116
She shames us all
in the eyes of the Keeper.

15
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:46,445
But we can succeed
where she has failed.

16
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,199
How?
By taking her han.

17
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,465
She's too powerful.

18
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,515
Which is why we need
to increase our strength.

19
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,065
Some of you will have to
sacrifice your han.

20
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:00,629
How will we decide?

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,270
We've already decided.

( gasping )

24
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,405
Great Keeper
of the Underworld,

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,961
as I walk on the path
to eternal darkness,

26
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:19,079
grant me the strength
to carry your will.

27
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,612
Merissa,

28
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:35,194
do you really think
your han can compete with mine?

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,204
I'm not here to compete
with your han,

30
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:38,476
I'm here to take it.

31
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:41,057
There are only four
of you.

32
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,765
Either you overestimate
your power,

33
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,342
or you underestimate mine.

34
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:49,094
Each of us already killed
two Sisters.

35
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:50,565
And each
of those two Sisters

36
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,644
had previously killed five.

37
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,616
So you see, Nicci,

38
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,458
the odds aren't 4-to-1,

39
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,599
but 40-to-1.

Sister Nicci.

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,683
Lord Rahl,
have I displeased the Keeper?

46
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:35,159
The stench of your failure
passes through the veil

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,269
to sicken him even
in the Underworld.

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,475
Yet there is one way

49
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,214
you may regain his favor.

50
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,618
Tell me.

51
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,960
Bring me the Stone of Tears.

52
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,032
Lord Rahl,
the compass which points

53
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,141
to the Stone of Tears only works
in the hands of the Seeker.

54
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:53,715
Well, then, if you cannot
control the compass,

55
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,893
you must find a way
to control the Seeker.

56
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,433
What about
the Mother Confessor?

57
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:02,075
Prophecy says that the Keeper
is doomed to fail

58
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:04,181
as long as
her pure heart beats.

59
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:05,585
We can address
the problem

60
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,758
of the Mother Confessor's
beating heart

61
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,002
once you get the Stone
from the Seeker.

62
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,916
I may know a way

63
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,754
to control the Seeker,

64
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,993
find the Stone,

65
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,302
and kill
the Mother Confessor.

66
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:28,412
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

67
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,237
( bird chirps )

68
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:57,518
A strand of
the Mother Confessor's hair.

69
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,023
You have served
the Keeper well.

70

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,052
What's wrong?

74
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,687
Oh, I just didn't sleep
very well.

75
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,859
Cara probably won't be back
from her hunt

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,694
for a little while
if you want to get more rest.

77
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,394
I'm sure it will be fine.

78
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,295
(Cara)
Richard.

79
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:45,197
I was chasing a buck.

80
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:46,432
I found something better.

81
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,167
Where are the rest
of your Sisters?

82
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,468
(Cara)
Answer him.

83
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:53,901
( Agiel whines )

84
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,101

85
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,137
Cara, stop!

( gasping )
( gasping )

87
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:04,740
What has she done to me?

88
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,942
She's cast
the Maternity Spell.

89
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,644
It replicates the connection

90
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,345
between the mother
and a child in the womb.

91
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12,747
Whatever happens to the mother
happens to the child.

92
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:17,051
Kahlan's survival is now
completely dependent upon mine.

93
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:20,420
(Zedd)
A spell of that magnitude would
require all of your han.

94
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,989
She can't use any other magic.

95
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,724
I don't need any other magic
to get what I want.

96
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,528
An Alkalis stone.

97
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,398
I'm sure you know it's deadly.

98
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,966
If you don't do as I say,

99
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,834
all I have
to do is bite down,

100
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,835
and the Mother Confessor
will die.

101
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,004
And what is it
that you want?

102
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:43,806
You're going to lead me
to the Stone of Tears.

103
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:48,110
And if any of you attempt
to follow us Kahlan will die.

104
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,111
And so will you.
I serve the Keeper.

105
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,079
I'm not afraid of death.

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,815
Neither are the four
powerful Sisters of the Dark

107
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:56,817
who are trying to kill me
and take my han.

108
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,584
Since I can't use my magic,

109
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,252
I need your protection.

110
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,753
If you want her to live.

111
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,356
Kill her.

112
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,458
Cara can bring me back
with the breath of life.

113
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,328
To revive her,
you'd have to revive me,

114
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,264
and we'd be right back
where we started.

115
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:15,401
I'm going to the bridge now

116
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:17,737
and if you're not with me
by the time I get there,

117
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:20,372
the Mother Confessor and I
will meet the Keeper together.

118
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,480
We can't let her do this.

119
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,848
She's using my life
as a weapon against you.

120
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,583
Right now
we don't have a choice.

121
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,018
Zedd will find
a way to undo the spell.

122
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:42,088
Whatever happens,

123
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,056
do not let her
get the Stone.

124
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:47,259
I won't let anything
happen to you.

125
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,596
Then you'd best not let
anything happen to her.

126
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,971
Do you know how
to break the spell?

127
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:06,673
(Zedd) I do, but--
But what?

128
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,708
The only way to break
the bond is to re-establish

129
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,476
the stronger bond.

130
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,411
The one with
Kahlan's real mother.

131
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,881
My mother is dead.

132
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,415
(Zedd)
There may still be a way.

133
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,683
The Maternity Spell extends
through death.

134
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:22,385
So does the bond
with your mother.

135
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:24,386
I could summon her spirit
from the Underworld.

136
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:27,089
I'd be able to see
her again?

137
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,857
It wouldn't last
more than a few moments,

138
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,792
but it may just long enough
for me to re-establish

139
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,760
the bond
and break the spell.

140
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,028
Then do it.

141
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,863
Conjuring the dead
isn't that simple.

142
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,198
It's a complicated spell.

143
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,033
It requires many ingredients,

144
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,201
the most important being
an object that belonged

145
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:44,038
to your mother.
Something she treasured.

146
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:47,439
When Dennee and I left home,
we were lucky to get away

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,107
with the clothes
on our backs.

148
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,475
My father has everything
my mother owned.

149
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,212
(Zedd)
Do you know where
we can find him?

150
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:02,283
Last I heard,
he was living in Gramalia.

151
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,655
( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> )

152
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:17,029
Even if we find the Stone
and you destroy it,

153
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,064
even if you kill yourself
and take Kahlan with you,

154
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,332
you won't win.

155
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,438
Your fight against
the Keeper is futile.

156
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,306
In the end, he will win.

157
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,342
He always does.

158
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,777
Life is fleeting,

159
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,811
death is eternal.

163
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,288
They found us.

164

Run.

165
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,185
(Zedd)
Gramalia's just over
that ridge.

166
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,946
My father's estate
is just west of that river.

167
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,814
If he's still there.

168
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,082
(Cara)
How long has it been?

169
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,350
Fifteen years.

170
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,486
Close family.

171
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,688
Cara.
(Kahlan) It's all right.

172
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:10,590
When my father was
confessed to my mother,

173
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,959
of course he was completely
devoted to us.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,695
But when she died,
we found out who he really was.

175
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,130
I was 5.

176
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,864
Dennee was only 3.

177
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,466
He forced us to confess people

178
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,467
so he could build
his own fortune.

179
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,803
Men with wives,
families,

180
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,137
turned into slaves.

181
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:38,176
They gave him
everything they had.

182
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,779
There was one man, Devon.

183
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,246
When we confessed him,

184
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,115
his wife was devastated.

185
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,817
She begged us to give her
husband back to her.

186
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:50,686
I remember thinking
that next to my mother

187
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:53,388
she was the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

188
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,390
My father thought so too.

189
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,860
He made us confess her

190
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,229
and order her to his bed.

191
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,964
You had a power, he didn't.

192
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,732
You could have confessed him.

193
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,935
I know that now,
but he was this huge,

194
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:15,339
terrifying man, and--

195
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,274
(Zedd)
You shouldn't talk
about this, Kahlan.

196
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,109
It's upsetting you.

197
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,676
It's not that.

198
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:22,411

If we cross it, the Sisters
won't be able to follow us.

207
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,431
They won't need to.
We'll be dead.

208
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,399
I can get us through.

209
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,467

Yeah.

The wound won't heal
until Nicci heals hers

236

and she can't use any magic.

237

Then we'll just have to
keep it clean then.

at the manor.

I don't need to judge you.

247

I'm sure you're guilty
of whatever it is

you've been
locked up for and more.

249
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,367
I'm sure you didn't come all
this way just to insult me.

250
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,203
I've come
for my mother's things.

00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,371
Where are they?

252
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,140
I burned them.

253
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,976
(Kahlan)
I doubt that.

254
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:01,012
My mother's jewels
were very valuable.

255
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:05,883
And as much as you hated
my mother,

256
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:08,085
we both know you love
wealth more.

257
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:09,619
Don't you have
a palace filled

258
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,655
with jewels in Aydindril?

259
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,090
What do you want with mine?

260
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:15,824
They aren't yours.

261
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,793
Unfortunately,
that's true.

262
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:21,495
They belong to a warlord
named Aramis now.

263
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:25,365
When Rahl fell, Aramis
seized control of Gramalia

264
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,001
and threw everyone
who opposed him into jail.

265
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,736
My estate was the most
admired in the province,

266
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,205
so Aramis took it,
and everything in it.

267
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,940
Then we'll get
the jewels from him.

268
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,443
Aramis doesn't even know
that he has the jewels.

269
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,349
What do you mean
he doesn't know?

270
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:50,818
Oh, my dear daughter,
I'm not a fool.

271
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,419
Life has taught me that
in a single moment,

272
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,586
you can lose everything.

273
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320

274
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,321

00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:01,755
Where?

277
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:07,591
Tell me.

278
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:10,193
Or what?

279
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,659
You'll confess me?

280
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,862
Would you make a love slave
of your own father?

281
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:26,779
A sorceress put
a dark spell on Kahlan.

282

Whatever happens to
the sorceress happens to her.

283
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,857

Hm.

One word
from the Mother Confessor

and I could
take you there myself.

I can arrange
a short furlough.

I lost six years of my life
when I was confessed,

292
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,711
I have wasted months
behind these bars.

293
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,481
I will not lose
any more time.

treat this properly,

it's going to fester.

301

And that'll slow us down,
is that what you want?

302
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,404
How does that feel, dear?

303
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,739
Better. Thank you.

(Richard)
Why is your husband
destroying his crop?

305
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:45,381
Our fields have been
overtaken by snakevine.

306
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:47,750
It feeds on whatever we grow.

307
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:51,953
A few weeks ago the vines
overran our neighbors' garden,

308
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:55,589
crept in at the window,
strangled their little boy

Poor child.

00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,561
You know, the Sword of Truth can
cut through just about anything.

312
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,763
I could help your husband
kill the snakevine.

Tell them you don't have time.

318

He's going to help us.

320
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,826
I'm so sorry, but I don't have
time to help you after all.

321
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,660
I'll come back as soon as I can.

322
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,299
I could've killed
the snakevine.

323
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,634
It wouldn't have taken long.

324
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:53,570
Do you always stop along
your quest to help people?

325
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,472
No wonder you haven't found
the Stone of Tears.

326

Even if you had solved
their problem,

327
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,741
what about the people
at the next farm?

328
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,009
And the next?

329
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,776
You know, just because
I can't help everyone

330
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:04,311
doesn't mean I shouldn't
help anyone.

331
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:06,078
That's exactly
where you're wrong.

332
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,480
What would you do with a horse
whose leg was broken?

333
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,514
You'd put it out
of its misery.

334
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:13,248
This world
is like a lame horse.

335
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:16,317
Helping people only prolongs
their suffering.

The treasure's in a clearing
past those trees.

00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,990
If you can catch one
of the guards by surprise

338
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:26,525
and confess him, you could
order him to kill the rest.

339
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:27,959
No.

340
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,828
We'll wait until nightfall
and slip in unseen

341
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,430
and get the jewels without
killing or confessing anyone.

342
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:36,566
Isn't that what you do,
confess people?

343
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,934
You don't know anything
about me.

344
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:43,970
Frederick, why don't you
and I circle the grounds,

345
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,938
see what we're
up against?

346
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,052
He may be a bastard,

347
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,023
but his strategy was sound.

348
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:03,159
It was brutal and cowardly.

349
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,095
Just like he is.

350
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,731
I believed the worst
about my father,

351
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:12,738
but I was wrong.

352
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:15,841
It isn't the same.

353
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,675
You were tortured
into thinking

354
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,310
your father
had betrayed you.

355
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:22,279
I know what my father did.

356
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,214
I lived through it.

357
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:25,515
You survived.

358
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:26,816
It made you stronger.

359
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,318
Cara, I don't want
to talk about it.

360
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,556
I'm sorry,

361
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:35,891
I didn't mean to snap at you.

I'm just...

363
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,927

366
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,665
We need to stop and rest.

367
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,566
You're only trying to stall
our journey to give

368
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,067
your friends time to
break the spell.

369
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,169
If we keep going without rest,
we won't be able to fight

370
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,271
the Sisters
when they attack again.

It's going to rain soon.

373
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,844
If we spend the night
at the tavern we passed,

374
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,378
by the time we set out
in the morning,

375
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:03,747
the rain will have
washed away our tracks.

376
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,552
Are you warm enough?

377
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:12,121
I'm sure Kahlan's very cozy.

378
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:14,456
But if I get a chill,
I'll let you know.

379
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:16,624
I'm going to see
if somebody in the tavern

380
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,493
will sell us some horses.

I'm fine.

00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,247
Just a little dizzy.

Get the lady
another glass of wine.

This is the spot.

393
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,666
Can you hold this?
It's heavy.

394
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,337

Why?

You have Kahlan's blood

to make it up to her.

No.

I feel a little better now.

That should help
the swelling.

I used to take care
of people too.

445
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:24,704
It's true.

446
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,039
When I was a young novice,

447
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,106
all I wanted to do
was serve the Creator

448
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:30,908
and become a Sister
of the Light.

449
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,342
To prove I was worthy,

450
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,777
I volunteered to go
on a service mission

451
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:36,612
and give aid and comfort
to men in prison.

452
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:41,353
There was one prisoner,

453
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,689
he liked
to hear me sing hymns.

454
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,224
He asked to pray
with me, alone,

455
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:49,727
and I told the guard
it would be all right.

456
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:53,229
As soon as he left,

457
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,697
the man
forced himself on me.

458
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,702
I went back to the Prelate
and told her what had happened.

459
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:04,204
I admitted
I wanted to kill the man.

460
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,741
But the Prelate said
the Creator had given me

461
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,710
a great opportunity

462
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,512
to grant the sacred gift
of forgiveness.

463
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:21,791
What did you do?

464
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,762
I went back
and tried to forgive him.

465
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:29,832
I prayed to the Creator to
let the light shine through me,

466
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:34,603
but the man forced himself
on me again.

467
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:36,670
I was so ashamed.

468
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:38,772
I didn't want to tell
the Prelate that I had failed.

469
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:40,974
But that night,

470
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,275
when I went to sleep,

471
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:47,744
I dreamed of slicing
his throat with my dacra.

472
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:50,280
And I knew that was a message
from the Keeper.

473
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,916
A promise that if I served him,
he would protect me.

474
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:57,251
So the next day,
I went back,

475
00:26:57,252 --> 00:27:00,921
and I slit
the prisoner's throat.

476
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:04,658
That was the last
rotten breath he ever took.

477
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:08,527
I didn't feel a shred of guilt
or horror at what I'd done.

478
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:10,763
All I felt was powerful.

479
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,566
And that's when I knew
I had truly become a Sister.

480
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,535
A Sister of the Dark.

481
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:23,705
What happened to you
was wrong.

482
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:25,673
The whole world
is wrong.

483
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:28,341
That's why the Keeper
wants to end it.

484
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:29,676
And I thank him every day

485
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:31,677
for giving me
the strength to help him.

486
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:36,817
Nicci, you are strong.

487
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,585
But I don't believe
a person's strength

488
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:41,921
comes from the Keeper
or the Creator.

489
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:45,290
Your strength is yours
and yours alone.

490
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:48,860
And what you do with it
is up to you.

491
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:01,338
I was sure
once I saw her things

492
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:03,506
that I'd remember,

493
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:05,008
but I don't even know
which are hers,

494
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,811
let alone which ones meant
anything to her.

495
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,677
When I was under confession,

496
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:15,210
I bought this for your mother
in celebration of your birth.

497
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:19,982
And I got her
these earrings to match

498
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,317
when your sister was born.

499
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,884
Your mother wore them
every day.

500
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:31,350
I can't believe
I forgot.

501
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:35,251
Maybe there are other things
you don't remember.

502
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:38,187
I remember enough.

503
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,788
Like when we used to
have lunch together?

504
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:43,089
And you liked it
when I would cut your apples

505
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,058
in the shapes of stars.

506
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,594
And then I would lift you up

507
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,395
to feed the cores to the horses.

508
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:55,467
You only did that
because you were confessed.

509
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:56,668
You're right.

510
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,636
I didn't choose
to be with your mother

511
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,838
or to have children.
I was forced.

512
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,641
You've spent three days subject
to the whims of your sorceress.

513
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,910
I spent six years
confessed to your mother.

514
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:11,747
Confessors don't choose
honorable men as mates.

515
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:13,315
So you're saying I deserved it?

516
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,885
Hm.

517
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:20,621
Look at this.

518
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:21,689
( sighs )

519
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:27,328
Her name was Leah.

520
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,096
I made this for her.

521
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:32,132
Her father was
a stone carver.

522
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:34,468
And when I asked
for her hand in marriage,

523
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:36,836
he offered to teach me
everything he knew.

524
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:40,005
I took to stone carving
right away.

525
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,739
I'd found my calling.

526
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,241
What happened?

527
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,608
My father.

528
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:47,411
No son of his was
going to be a stone carver.

529
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,546
Or married to
the daughter of one.

530
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:52,649
Oh, he had more
ambitious plans for me.

531
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,619
He got me a commission
in the Dragon Corps.

532
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:59,489
I couldn't wait until
my service was finished,

533
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,358
so that I could get back
to what I loved.

534
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,826
But before I could,

535
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,793
your mother confessed me
in battle.

536
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:12,198
Whatever happened to you,

537
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:14,800
it doesn't justify
what you did to us.

538
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:17,001
For years
I was terrified

539
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,735
of what you were going
to force us to do next.

540
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,570
Dennee cried every night,

541
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,238
and I couldn't even comfort her

542
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:28,074
because you had bound our hands.

543
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:34,211
There's no excuse
for what I did.

544
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:37,681
But you should know that
as afraid as you were of me,

545
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,749
I was even more afraid
of both of you.

546
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:44,387
Knowing that with one touch,

547
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:48,591
my own children had
the power to destroy me again.

548
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,064
You found something?

549
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,632
Her necklace.

550
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:05,534
Now all we need is sunlight.

551
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:07,803
The spell won't work without it.

552
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:10,905
It'll just be
a few more hours now.

553
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:13,106
I'll get more wood
for the fire.

That was no ordinary spider.

558

It was sent by the Sisters
of the Dark.

559

I only have a few hours left,
at most.

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

561

We need to get you
to a healer. Now.

562
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:04,285
There's only one thing that
can save me from this poison.

563
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:06,754
The nectar
of the Midnight Blossom.

564
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,390
It only grows
in complete darkness

565
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:09,759
in the Caves of Arborea.

566
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,262
We passed those caves yesterday.

567
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,464
It can't be coincidence
that the one thing we need

568
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,134
to save your life
is so close.

569
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,401
It's a trap.

570
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,504
The Sisters will be waiting
for us.

571
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,872
If they wanted you dead,

572
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,276
why not just use
a stronger poison?

573
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,112
They want me to go to the caves
so they can kill me

574
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:26,482
with their dacras
and steal my han.

575
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:27,717
We don't have
a choice.

576
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:30,019
If you don't get that flower,
you'll die.

577
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,620
And so will Kahlan.

578
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,528
(Cara)
You'll be fine once
the spell is removed.

579
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,863
It's Richard
I'm worried about.

580
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:45,531
Once the spell is broken,

581
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,966
Nicci will be able
to use her magic.

582
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,001
Richard can handle Nicci.

583
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,902

it wasn't his fault.
