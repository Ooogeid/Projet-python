1
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:03,968
My child.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,007
Your eyesight
will fail you

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,306
if you keep reading
in this light.

4
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,175
Go home.

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,977
Soon.

6
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,513
You're getting lost in your
books again, aren't you?

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,050
May I ask
what you're working on?

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,620
Uh, I really shouldn't say.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,123
Oh.
- Excuse me.

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,125
Livia?

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,561
Good evening.
- James.

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,496
It's so late.
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,367
I've, uh--
I've finished.

14
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,238
My son has never looked
so handsome.

15
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,575
But I told you
I can't pay you.

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,776
You really shouldn't have.

17
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,011
Oh, that's all right.

18
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:48,446
Consider it a gift.

19
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:50,415
Well, thank you.

20
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,584
But you didn't
have to come all of this way.

21
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,986
Oh, I went by your house,
but there wasn't anyone there

22
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,755
so I--
- Aidan wasn't home?

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,157
No.

24
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,893
I have to go.

25
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,563
Brother Tovas, would you
put my papers away for me?

26
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,897
Of course.

27
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>The Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

28
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,477
It was destroyed
by the Seeker.

29
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,814
Uh, the original
was destroyed.

30
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,650
Uh, but as I'm sure
my Lord knows,

31
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,553
there are rumors
copies were made.

32
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,355
And you believe this woman
from Briamont,

33
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,724
this librarian,

34
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,860
is on the verge
of finding one of them?

35
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,162
I have been watching her
for some time, my Lord.

36
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,030
She has uncovered
a series of clues

37
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,433
suggesting that one
of the copies

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,668
is hidden somewhere
in the library.

39
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:47,305
She has deciphered all of the
clues save for the final one.

40
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,175
Once that is solved,

41
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,477
the Book's location
will be vealed.

42
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,013
This woman may be useful.

43
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,483
Perhaps we should invite her
to an audience with Lord Rahl.

44
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,654
I doubt her sympathies
lie with us.

45
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,057
Her husband was a scholar
and a misguided dissident.

46
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,894
He was looking for ancient
writings that would

47
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,631
undermine the legitimacy
of your rule, my Lord.

48
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,699
Uh, you'll be pleased to hear
that this traitor

49
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,735
perished at the end
of a D'Haran sword.

50
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,940
Long has the <i>Book of Counted</i>
<i>Shadows</i> eluded me.

51
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:26,378
As have the secrets of power
contained within its pages.

52
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:30,048
Do we have troops
in the region?

53
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,384
A forward detachment,
My Lord.

54
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,687
Order them to secure the library
and find this woman.

55
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,422
The Book will be brought to you
right away.

56
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,823
No.

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,762
This Book can be trusted
to no one.

58
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,132
I leave for the library
at once.

59
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,073
Welcome to the great library
of Briamont.

60
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,443
Our doors are open to disciples
of learning of all ages.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,915
A friend told us we could find
a particular volume

62
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,350
in your collection.

63
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,085
I'm merely
the gatekeeper.

64
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,020
Perhaps if you told me
the title of the book,

65
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,889
I could direct you
to the proper area.

66
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,624
I'm not certain
you would've heard of it.

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,826
It's a very old
and rare volume.

68
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,728
You should speak
to our librarian.

69
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,330
But she's not here today.

70
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,465
Do you mind if we look
around on our own?

71
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,848
We may need a librarian
after all.

72
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,123
Can you tell us when your
librarian is expected back?

73
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,059
Uh, difficult to say.

74
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,527
The Amulet of Carod.

75
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,964
You're a member
of the Brotherhood.

76
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,299
What do you know?

77
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,234
Only that they served
my people

78
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,269
in Aydindril for generations.

79
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,038
You're a Wizard.

80
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,840
Of the First Order.

81
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,046
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

82
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,614
I'm deeply honored.

83
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,484
This is Kahlan Amnell,
the Mother Confessor,

84
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,320
and Richard Cypher,
the Seeker of Truth.

85
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,122
I am your humble servant.

86
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,658
Our librarian, Livia,

87
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,327
has not been here
for many days.

88
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,262
She's been having trouble
at home.

89
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,765
She's a widow with a young son.

90
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,967
The boy's always been something
of a rapscallion.

91
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,202
But lately
it's been getting worse

92
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,238
since she
lost her husband.

93
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,440
And now
the boy's gone missing.

94
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,308
<i>Please, sir.</i>

95
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,377
My father, he beats me
night and day.

96
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,313
Thank you, sir.

97
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,049
May the Spirits protect you.

98
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,986
My own mother,
she put me on the street

99
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,221
with nothing but these clothes
on my back.

100
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,957
Anything you can spare.
No coin is too small.

101
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:56,361
Hey, you're driving away
my customers.

102
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,731
You wanna know what's really
driving them away?

103
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,068
Mm, that stench.

104
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,570
When's the last time
you had a bath?

105
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,272
Ah! Hey!

106
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,908
Put me down!

107
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,576
Put me down!

108
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,680
Put me down.

109
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,252
It brings a tear to my eye when
a boy your age turns to crime.

110
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,687
I-- I haven't
done anything wrong.

111
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,557
Begging is outlawed here.

112
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,359
It's a good thing I found you
before the constables did.

113
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,395
They would've made
an example of you.

114
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,063
I'd be happy to protect you
from them.

115
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,265
But it'll cost you.

116
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,267
This is all I have.

117
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,440
Hey! Unh!

118
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,908
What are you doing?

119
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,910
That's my money!

120
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,382
Now, I'm gonna
do you a favor, son.

121
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,817
I'm taking your money,

122
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,586
but I'm not gonna
break your legs.

123
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,054
You work for me now.

124
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,022
That money is all I have
in the world.

125
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,324
I'll starve.

126
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,594
Then I suggest
you get to work.

127
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,901
My snuff box!

128
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,704
That little maggot!

129
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,073
Get him.

130
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,312
Oh! Hey!

131
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,957
Hey.

132
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,639
Aidan?

133
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,407
What are you--?
- You have to hide me.

134
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,476
Your mother's been worried
half to death.

135
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,611
Where have you been?
- There are men after me.

136
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,848
Angry men.
- I'm-- I'm taking you home.

137
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,417
There isn't time.
They could be here any minute.

138
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,920
James, you have to hide me,
please.

139
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,426
Aidan?

140
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,397
Are you Livia?

141
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,933
Do you have news of my son?

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,202
Is that why you've come?

143
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,604
We're here
about something else.

144
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,272
A matter of grave importance.

145
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,542
Where's the boy?

146
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,212
Uh, boy? Wha--? What boy?

147
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,247
Don't play games with me.

148
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,183
Kraddik saw him run in here and
he didn't see anyone come out.

149
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,418
K-Kraddik?

150
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,021
That swindler?
He's as blind as...

151
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,857
...something that can't see
very well.

152
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,334
If I learn
you're hiding that boy...

153
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,275
<i>I don't understand.</i>

154
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,510
How did you know I was looking
for the <i>Book of Counted Shadows?</i>

155
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:00,912
A witch called Shota
had a vision

156
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,780
that you would find the Book

157
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,917
and that Darken Rahl would learn
of your discovery.

158
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,920
So if this witch told you
about the Book,

159
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,623
how is Darken Rahl supposed
to find out about it?

160
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,458
Who else knows
you've been looking for it?

161
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,859
No one.

162
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,097
But there's a scholar
at the library.

163
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,833
He's been asking a lot of
questions about my work lately.

164
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,938
What matters now is finding
the Book before Rahl does

165
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,307
and getting you
far away from here.

166
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,343
I'd do anything
to help the Seeker.

167
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,978
But I can't go anywhere
without Aidan.

168
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,214
Your son?

169
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,849
He hasn't come home
in three days.

170
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,519
It's my fault.

171
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,421
Ever since my husband died,

172
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,189
I've been trying to finish
his work.

173
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,725
Solve the final riddle,
find the Book.

174
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,595
I've become so obsessed,
I left my son alone.

175
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,631
Just when he needed me the most.

176
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,835
I'll find your son.

177
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,337
You have my word.

178
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,740
A friend saw him
on Barter Street.

179
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,476
I've been down there every day,
but those merchants--

180
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,679
They're thugs,
they won't even talk to me.

181
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,647
They'll talk to the Seeker.

182
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,885
I know
how hard this is for you,

183
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:16,321
but we need you to take us
to the library.

184
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,056
Perhaps Kahlan and I

185
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,125
can help you decipher
this final riddle.

186
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,865
I'll get my shawl.

187
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,669
As soon as you
find the boy,

188
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,705
you should meet us
at the library.

189
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:37,308
Livia, is this Aidan?

190
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,476
Livia?

191
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,711
Where did she go?

192
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,754
Mom!

193
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,422
Aidan!

194
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,157
Oh, thank the Spirits.

195
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,728
I'm so sorry. I'll never
leave you alone again.

196
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,797
I promise.
- I'm sorry I ran away.

197
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,903
Where are we?

198
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,282
Perfect.

199
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,354
No tracks.
She didn't leave on foot.

200
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:30,357
There's obviously magic
at work here.

201
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,294
This could be
Rahl's work.

202
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:35,762
We know he wants the Book.

203
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,163
He might have used
some spell

204
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,065
to abduct Livia,
take her to the library?

205
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,034
You and Zedd
should head back there.

206
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,136
I'm going into town. I promised
Livia I'd find her son.

207
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:46,873
Richard, our mission
is to find the Book.

208
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,275
Aidan's missing
and now so is she.

209
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:51,011
Somehow I think
there's a connection.

210
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:57,951
Far be it for us to question
the instincts of the Seeker.

211
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:11,798
James?

212
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,233
Hello, Livia.

213
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,035
How did you...?
- It's a long story,

214
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,636
but don't worry,
everything's fine.

215
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:17,804
The two of you
are safe here.

216
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,706
Where are we?

217
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:22,075
Do you like it?

218
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:24,177
This vista.

219
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:28,081
Have you ever seen anything
so perfect?

220
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,849
I'm not sure
about that hill, though.

221
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,551
It throws off
the composition a little.

222
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,586
James,
it's beautiful, but--

223
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:35,221
I know it's a lot
to take in.

224
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,491
Do you remember
when I used to...?

225
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,460
I'd come by the library
every day?

226
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,962
You were looking for books
on art and painting.

227
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,166
One of the books I found
was tucked away on a shelf.

228
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,668
It probably hadn't been opened
in a hundred years.

229
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:52,539
It described a lost form
of magic.

230
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:55,675
A kind that could only be
mastered by someone like me.

231
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:57,143
A painter. An artist.

232
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,146
You learned magic?

233
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:03,516
The book showed me how I could
create my own world.

234
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,186
Anything that I paint
on the outside is sent here

235
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,422
to this place
inside my painting.

236
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,757
That's where we are
right now.

237
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,025
Inside the painting.

238
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,061
You see those hills?

239
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,397
I found them on a farm
outside of Dorn.

240
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:19,332
And the forest?

241
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,535
That's from the grounds
of a D'Haran palace.

242
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:26,339
I brought them here the same way
that I brought you.

243
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:28,675
I've wanted to show you
this place for a long time

244
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,977
but not before
it was ready.

245
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,779
When Aidan came running in,

246
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:35,081
there was nowhere else
to hide him.

247
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,985
I knew how worried you'd be,
so I painted you here too

248
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:42,255
so that you could see
he was all right.

249
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:44,190
James, I'm grateful to you
for helping Aidan,

250
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:45,492
but we can't stay here.

251
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,660
Could you send us back?

252
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,028
You don't like it?

253
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,531
No, you don't understand.

254
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,233
The Seeker needs my help.

255
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,335
The Seeker?

256
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,303
There's a very important book
in the library,

257
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,205
and he needs it
to defeat Darken Rahl

258
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,840
and I'm the only one
that can find it.

259
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,308
You met the Seeker?

260
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,613
What are you doing?

261
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,915
We're--
We're friends, aren't we?

262
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:10,817
Yes.

263
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,520
Then trust me.

264
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,042
Welcome to the great library
of Briamont.

265
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,243
Our doors are open--

266
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:38,745
Where is the librarian?

267
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,713
She's not here today.

268
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,782
I'm afraid
she's not at all well.

269
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,717
If you'd like to come back
tomorrow--

270
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,420
You will take my men to her now.

271
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,756
Lord Rahl
will arrive soon.

272
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,858
Find the woman
before he gets here.

273
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,731
This library is now
under the authority

274
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,999
of the Dragon Corps.

275
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:03,236
Everyone out, now!

276
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:06,706
I can't walk any faster.

277
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,942
You want to die here?

278
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,023
Are you all right?

279
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,692
Thank the Spirits
you found me.

280
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,427
We were on our way
to see you.

281
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,462
The D'Harans,
they've taken the library.

282
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,097
Do they have Livia?

283
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,266
No. They were forcing me
to bring them to her.

284
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,835
Do you know where Livia kept
the books she was working on?

285
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:38,204
Locked in a cabinet
in the south reading room.

286
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,440
I'll slip in and get Livia's
work out of the library.

287
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,909
You two find Richard
and tell him what's happened.

288
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:45,044
They've sealed the building,
you'll never get past.

289
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:46,246
Oh, I'll be able to get in.

290
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,553
Have you seen this boy?

291
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:59,092
Do you know him?
His name's Aidan.

292
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,997
You better talk to them.

293
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:12,338
Where's the boy?

294
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:13,940
Last I saw
of that little maggot,

295
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,174
he ran into a painter's
workshop.

296
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:16,776
Oh, and you just let him go

297
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:18,111
out of the kindness
of your heart?

298
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,679
No!
You don't understand!

299
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:22,415
The boy went in
but he never came out.

300
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,617
He just vanished.

301
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,356
Richard.

302
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:34,994
Why are you here?

303
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:37,230
Well,
there's been a complication.

304
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,866
Any luck finding the boy?
Someone saw him in a workshop

305
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:42,669
a few blocks from here.
I'm headed there now.

306
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,144
The Seeker.

307
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,979
I was coming to find you.

308
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,682
Just-- Just a moment.

309
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,784
We're looking for a boy.

310
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:00,987
There.

311
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:22,075
Mom, look. The library.

312
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:23,743
James did it.

313
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,153
An enchanted painting.

314
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:32,021
So Livia and Aidan
are inside the painting?

315
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:35,158
Yes. Exactly.

316
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,727
Livia told me you needed a book
from the library,

317
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,197
but I couldn't take her
and Aidan out of the painting.

318
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,099
They'd be in danger
from those men.

319
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,835
So instead of bringing Livia
to the library,

320
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,704
you brought the library
to Livia?

321
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:51,140
Not just the library,
but everything in it.

322
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,043
All the people.
The books.

323
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,511
Amazing, isn't it?

324
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,180
Zedd was in the library

325
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:58,748
with a D'Haran patrol.

326
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,884
D'Harans?

327
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,318
Zedd's a Wizard.

328
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:04,520
He should be able
to handle a few D'Harans.

329
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,657
No,
you don't understand.

330
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:10,860
A Wizard's powers are useless
inside my painting.

331
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,729
The only magic that works
in there is mine.

332
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:20,336
My men tell me
you appeared out of nowhere.

333
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:22,972
What magic did you use
to hide from us?

334
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,345
Answer me!

335
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:42,158
Who are you?

336
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:47,096
Isn't it obvious? She's an
innocent woman

337
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,933
who's brought her son to the
library to read books.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,769
Something I seriously doubt
you're familiar with.

339
00:17:52,836 --> 00:17:55,538
How did you get past
my soldiers outside?

340
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,540
D'Haran scum!
You killed my father!

341
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,509
Adian, no!

342
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,679
Don't hurt him!

343
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:06,582
Tell me who you are,

344
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,620
or I'll reunite your son
with his departed father.

345
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:11,955
I...

346
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,259
I work here.

347
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,761
I'm the librarian.

348
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,229
<i>You need to use your magic</i>

349
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:21,931
and get them out of there.

350
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,299
I will.
Of course, Confessor.

351
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,168
But I can't.

352
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,170
Not from here.

353
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:29,005
You see this easel?

354
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:32,208
To get someone out, I need
to paint them on that canvas.

355
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,444
But I can only do that
from inside the painting.

356
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,812
It's how I designed it.

357
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,714
You can't go in there.

358
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,083
The D'Harans could take you
prisoner or kill you.

359
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,718
What other choice do we have?

360
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,023
Send me into the painting.

361
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,257
Richard...

362
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,659
I'll take care of the D'Harans

363
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,594
and help Livia find the book.

364
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,895
Yes.

365
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,998
And I can follow you in
and paint everyone out.

366
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,536
Where is
the <i>Book of Counted Shadows?</i>

367
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,772
I don't know exactly.

368
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,973
You're gonna find it
for me.

369
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,775
Because if you don't--

370
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,877
Hurting the boy won't get you
what you want any faster.

371
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll do anything you say.
Just don't hurt my son, please.

372
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,483
Do you have any idea
how stupid you are?

373
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,917
Aidan!
- Finding that book

374
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,352
won't do you any good.

375
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,987
Because even if you do,

376
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,889
you can't give it
to Darken Rahl.

377
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,858
Do you even know
where you are?

378
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,626
Have you looked outside?

379
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,294
You're not in
the Midlands anymore.

380
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,174
<i>It is said that you</i>

381
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,376
are the deadliest
of the deadly.

382
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,448
My elite guardians.

383
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,719
And how is it possible
for an entire library

384
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,854
to be spirited away
in front of you?

385
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:55,224
Did you see nothing
at all?

386
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:58,761
Well, since your eyes
are obviously useless,

387
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:02,065
allow me to do you the favor
of cutting them from your skull.

388
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,735
My Lord.

389
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,276
One of our soldiers
survived an attack

390
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,178
less than a league from here.

391
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:18,648
He says his men were set upon
by a Wizard and a Confessor.

392
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,922
I should have known
this was Wizard's work.

393
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,192
And if Zeddicus and
the Mother Confessor are nearby,

394
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,563
the Seeker cannot be far.

395
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,332
Send every last one of these
soldiers into Briamont

396
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,067
and the surrounding area.

397
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:39,635
Turn over every stone,
search every building

398
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:41,270
and bring me the Seeker.

399
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:42,438
Yes, my Lord.

400
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:46,309
<i>A Wizard must have conjured</i>

401
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,444
this illusion.

402
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:53,983
You appeared out of nowhere.

403
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,318
You must know something
about this.

404
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,254
Me?

405
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:00,156
I don't have any magic.

406
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:03,593
If I did, would I have let
your men capture me so easily?

407
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,995
But if there is magic
at work here,

408
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:10,466
if this entire building has been
sent to some mysterious realm,

409
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:13,970
then there's no telling
what other dangers lurk here.

410
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:16,506
If I was you,

411
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,075
I'd get out of this place
as fast as I could.

412
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,543
Keep him quiet.

413
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:23,212
Take a quad, scout the area.

414
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,282
Find out who's responsible
for this sorcery.

415
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,892
How long is this
going to take?

416
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,861
Something funny?

417
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,465
You look very...

418
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:47,570
...heroic.

419
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:58,281
A world without magic.

420
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,650
Sounds perfect.

421
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:03,686
Without magic,

422
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,821
you would be deprived
of your power to Confess.

423
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:09,692
The Sword of Truth would be
merely a piece of steel.

424
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,861
Magic has its uses,

425
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,730
but sometimes it...

426
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,101
...keeps people apart.

427
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:23,839
Are you ready, Seeker?

428
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:42,925
It's the Seeker!

429
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:46,862
Drop your weapon!

430
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:26,245
You're stalling.

431
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,448
I've been trying
to decipher this clue for weeks.

432
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:30,817
I don't think
you're properly motivated.

433
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,354
Please!

434
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,155
Let him go.

435
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,111
Drop the sword
or she dies.

436
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,584
If she dies, Rahl won't get
his precious book.

437
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,952
He'll kill you himself.

438
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,159
Not nearly as effective
as Wizard's fire,

439
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:16,162
but sometimes one is forced
to improvise.

440
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,166
James is going to get us
all out of here,

441
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,868
but first we've got to find
the Book.

442
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:23,770
I wasn't lying
to that D'Haran.

443
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,072
I don't know if I can solve
the final clue.

444
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,042
Maybe Richard and I can help.

445
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:32,145
This merchant claims

446
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,546
to have information
on the Seeker.

447
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,114
Is that so?

448
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,183
Yes, Lord Rahl.

449
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,684
The Seeker threatened me.

450
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:40,987
He was looking for someone,
a child.

451
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:42,688
Uh, for what reason,
I don't know.

452
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:45,258
But I told him where
the boy was last seen.

453
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:46,826
And where was that?

454
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:49,529
Surely news
of such import

455
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,832
would be worthy of a small
reward of some kind?

456
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,438
Tell Lord Rahl
where you saw the Seeker.

457
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,973
No, no,
please, general.

458
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,242
I do understand.

459
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:08,147
A man should
be justly rewarded

460
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,816
for information
as valuable as this.

461
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,756
Tell me
where you sent the Seeker

462
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:19,692
and rest assured
you'll never want for anything

463
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,627
in this life again.

464
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,162
Oh, you--

465
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,032
You're very generous, my Lord.

466
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,468
Third block south
of Barter Street.

467
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:31,571
Second door, east side.

468
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:33,506
Thank you.

469
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,142
You have been most helpful.

470
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:42,949
<i>I've been trying to translate,</i>

471
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:44,517
but the language must be old.

472
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,219
I've never come
across it before.

473
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,423
Richard has.

474
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,725
It's the language
of the <i>Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

475
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:55,194
An ancient script
that only the Seeker can read.

476
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,896
What does it say?

477
00:25:56,964 --> 00:26:00,466
"The book you seek
is hidden in a safe place

478
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:02,168
"between the world below

479
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,970
and the stars above."

480
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,873
That could be anywhere.

481
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,407
No.

482
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:12,278
It's here in the library.

483
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,816
This is
our astrological collection.

484
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:18,618
"The stars above."

485
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:22,255
And these are about the keeper
and the underworld.

486
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:24,624
"The world below."

487
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:23,683
"The truth of the words

488
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,384
"of the <i>Book of Counted Shadows</i>

489
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:27,153
can only be insured
by a Confessor."

490
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,059
My husband spent years
searching for this book.

491
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:37,196
All the time it was right here.

492
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,498
What we value most

493
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:41,500
is often closer than we think.

494
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:51,544
What are you still doing here?

495
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:53,946
Ha. Art can't be rushed.

496
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:57,850
D'Haran soldiers
are searching the town.

497
00:27:57,918 --> 00:27:59,885
It won't be long
before they come here.

498
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:02,121
We can't let Rahl's men get
ahold of the painting.

499
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:05,558
Once James is inside,
we'll smuggle it out of--

500
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:09,895
What have you done?

501
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:11,831
You heard what she said.

502
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,132
The D'Harans
are on their way.

503
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
She'll be safer in there.

504
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:16,235
You were gonna
get everyone out.

505
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,537
I'm going in next.
After I'm gone,

506
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,340
get the painting out of here.
Bury it in the forest,

507
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,276
someplace no one
will ever find it.

508
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:25,177
That wasn't the plan.
If you want to save the Seeker

509
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,046
and the others,
you'll do as I say.

510
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,954
Kahlan? What are you doing here?

511
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:37,089
I don't know.

512
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:45,431
Livia. Thank the prophets
you're all right.

513
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,967
What's going on?
Why is Kahlan here?

514
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:50,202
I-- I sent her here
to protect her.

515
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,537
We got what we came for.

516
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,772
It's time to go.

517
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,508
Go?

518
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,276
Why would anyone want
to leave this place?

519
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:01,414
Look at this world
I've created.

520
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:02,548
It's a paradise.

521
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,819
All of us
will be safe here.

522
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,087
We'll be happy...

523
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,357
...forever.

524
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:37,743
Where might you be off
to in such a hurry?

525
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,712
<i>James,</i>

526
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,015
if you want
to stay in this place,

527
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,650
that's your choice.

528
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,485
But we have a mission
to complete.

529
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,086
Your mission,

530
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,322
it's to defeat
Darken Rahl, but--

531
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,924
But what if Rahl defeats you?

532
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,258
He'll get his hands
on that book

533
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,661
and enslave all the world.

534
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,462
Everyone's better off
if the Book stays here

535
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,031
where Rahl can never get it.

536
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,465
<i>Sentimental tripe.</i>

537
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,668
Tell me.

538
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:06,672
Did you create these alleged
works of art?

539
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,274
No, Lord Rahl.

540
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,414
The Amulet of Carod.

541
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,149
You must be an ally
of the Wizard.

542
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:19,351
No doubt
you've seen him recently.

543
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,530
And what is this?

544
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:33,165
<i>I'm ordering you as a Confessor,</i>

545
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,367
to get us out of here.

546
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,935
You don't have any power here,

547
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,704
no magic.

548
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,405
We're all equals here.

549
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,840
<i>Curious.</i>

550
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,408
Everything I've
been searching for

551
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,644
in this wretched little town

552
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,746
is depicted right here.

553
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:51,149
The Seeker,
the Mother Confessor,

554
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,986
and the library.

555
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,154
If I was the sort
of person who believed

556
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,290
in myths and fairy tales

557
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,660
I might suspect that this

558
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:04,463
was an enchanted painting.

559
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,198
It's as you said, my Lord.

560
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,634
It's sentimental tripe.

561
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,470
It's worthless.

562
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,840
Well, then, you won't mind
if I do us all a favor

563
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,308
of destroying it.

564
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,612
My Lord, don't.

565
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,248
If you burn that painting,

566
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,984
you destroy
the <i>Book of Counted Shadows.</i>

567
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,689
You've been a good friend
ever since my husband died

568
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:32,457
and I'm grateful.

569
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:33,825
But we can't stay here.

570
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,460
Why would you want to go back?

571
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:37,296
There are D'Harans out there.

572
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,599
Maybe the same ones
that killed your husband.

573
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,368
Everything you love
is in this place.

574
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:45,504
Your son, your books--

575
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,839
And what about the Seeker
and his friends?

576
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,841
You can't keep them here.

577
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,377
Aidan needs people around him
who will be a good influence.

578
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:54,513
Without a father,
he needs someone

579
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,448
to teach him
right from wrong.

580
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:59,151
Can you imagine a better teacher
for him than the Seeker?

581
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,053
You're right.

582
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,721
The boy needs guidance

583
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,589
and maybe I could give it to him
but not here.

584
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,124
The two of you-- I--

585
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,327
I heard what you said
in my workshop.

586
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,228
I saw how you looked
at each other.

587
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,297
Both of you
wanted to come here.

588
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,066
Not as your prisoners.

589
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,767
But in the real world,

590
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,536
magic is your prison.

591
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,939
It's what
"keeps people apart."

592
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:24,042
Those are your words.

593
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,179
Out there,
your love would destroy him

594
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,882
but here,
you can be together.

595
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,784
If the <i>Book of Counted Shadows </i>

596
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,252
is in this painting,

597
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,254
then you've won.

598
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:39,191
Have I?

599
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,827
The Seeker could be learning
the Book's secrets

600
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,562
even as we speak.

601
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,198
But if he's imprisoned in there,

602
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,899
he can never again be
a threat to you.

603
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,835
Enough.

604
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,971
What?

605
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,074
What are you gonna do,
run me through?

606
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,943
If you kill me,

607
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,544
you'll still be here.

608
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:02,614
In time, all of you
will learn to accept it.

609
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,284
This really is a better place
for all of us.

610
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,722
May I suggest we take
the painting to your sorcerers.

611
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,157
In time,
they may find a way

612
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,659
to extract the Book.

613
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,395
Perhaps.

614
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,266
But at of the Seeker?

615
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,236
If his magic is the
only kind that works here,

616
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,671
we need to find
a way to recreate it.

617
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,907
James learned this magic
by reading in the library.

618
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:30,809
If we could find the books

619
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,577
we might be able to do the same.

620
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,414
James said it could only
be mastered by a painter

621
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,315
like him.

622
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,618
So without talent
it might not work at all.

623
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,953
We have to try.

624
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,322
I could use
some help finding those books.

625
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,830
This doesn't make sense.

626
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,331
What does he hope to accomplish

627
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,333
by keeping us here?

628
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,636
I don't think it
was ever about us.

629
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,876
Jas,

630
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,081
I know you think
that keeping us here

631
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,450
is going to get you
what you want,

632
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,353
but it's not going to work.

633
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,990
All I want
is to keep everyone safe.

634
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,494
I don't need any magic to know
that it's more than that.

635
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,399
You may have noticed

636
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:30,869
how Richard and I
look at each other...

637
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:34,973
..but I see how
you look at Livia.

638
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,344
I've admired her
for so long.

639
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,782
After her husband died,
I--

640
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,484
I thought I'd--

641
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,886
I'd have a chance, but--

642
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:49,287
She never
pays attention to me.

643
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,791
That's why I'm so glad
that you're here.

644
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,193
Confessors know
about these things, you--

645
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,928
You can explain to Livia,

646
00:34:56,996 --> 00:35:00,632
convince her
that I'm a good person.

647
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,034
I know how difficult
it can be...

648
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:07,506
...sharing your feelings
with the one you love.

649
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,476
What if she doesn't feel
the same way you do?

650
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:14,079
Of course she doesn't feel
the same way.

651
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,313
She barely knows me.

652
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,050
So you thought
if she was forced

653
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,253
to spend some time with you,

654
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,021
she would get to know you,

655
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,924
see who you really are,

656
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,225
and fall in love with you?

657
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,061
Why couldn't she love me?

658
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:34,799
I may not be a hero
like the Seeker,

659
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:38,937
or some great scholar

660
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,805
like her husband, but--

661
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,073
I'm an artist.

662
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,643
I've got so much to give.

663
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,011
I can protect her,

664
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,512
be a father to her son.

665
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,848
You have to give Livia a chance

666
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:52,017
to know you outside this world.

667
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,819
As beautiful as it is...

668
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:58,256
...it's not real.

669
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,296
<i>Since the Seeker's returned,</i>

670
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,432
he has brought me nothing
but misery and despair.

671
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,137
Time and again he has denied
me victory. No, Egremont.

672
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,041
It ends here.

673
00:36:18,077 --> 00:36:20,845
What of the Book
and its secrets?

674
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:26,751
Killing the Seeker
is more important than any book,

675
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,220
no matter what secrets
it may hold.

676
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:37,128
You can't!

677
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,145
What's happening?

678
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,589
My beautiful painting.

679
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,691
Someone's trying to destroy it.

680
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:16,092
Why would someone do this?
They're destroying paradise!

681
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,261
You can always
make another painting,

682
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,130
but you can't give people
their lives back.

683
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,965
You said you wanted
to protect Livia.

684
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,566
If you love her,
you can't let her die.

685
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,137
James!

686
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,906
I can't paint six people
before the fire gets here.

687
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:35,278
But you can paint the library
back to where it belongs.

688
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:37,213
Along with everyone inside.

689
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,284
Get your easel. Let's go!

690
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:43,787
You'd better hurry.

691
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:45,989
What about you?

692
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:47,324
There isn't time.

693
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,225
Richard.

694
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:51,561
What?
- We have to go.

695
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,668
Get to the library.

696
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,993
Faster!

697
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:04,634
I believe congratulations
are in order, my Lord.

698
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:22,652
Send the men to the library.

699
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:23,887
Now!

700
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:25,055
Follow me.

701
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,592
He did it. James saved us.

702
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,227
We should get moving.

703
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,329
The D'Harans
will be headed this way.

704
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:49,712
I've masked our trail.
They're not following us.

705
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,649
You can't stay in Briamont.

706
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:55,485
It isn't safe for anyone
who's helped the Seeker.

707
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:57,253
Where will we go?

708
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:59,222
Bishop's Landing
is two days' walk.

709
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,525
The resistance will help you
resettle. I can take you.

710
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:04,527
Mom,
you can't leave.

711
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:07,030
What about Dad's work,
your books?

712
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:09,466
I found the one that matters.

713
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,469
And as long as I have you,
I'll be all right.

714
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,774
I think
you'll be needing this.

715
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,844
I can't thank you enough.

716
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:23,613
You may have helped bring
this war to an end.

717
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:27,984
In his heart,
James was a good person.

718
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,054
Please try to make sure

719
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:33,123
his sacrifice
wasn't for nothing.

720
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,767
Don't worry.
It's only me.

721
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:56,446
A little light reading?

722
00:40:57,815 --> 00:40:59,482
Not how I'd
describe it.

723
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,688
Something on your mind?

724
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:09,792
I was just thinking
about James,

725
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,696
the world he created.

726
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,068
It would have been nice
to visit...

727
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:20,203
...now and then.

728
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:26,276
I know what you mean.

729
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,349
I'll let you get back
to your book.

730
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,084
This can't be right.

731
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,319
What is it?

732
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:37,887
It says there's only one way

733
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,355
I can defeat Rahl.

734
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:41,558
"To vanquish
the master of all,

735
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,428
the Seeker must wield
the power of Orden."

736
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,898
Orden?

737
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,768
To do that, we'd have
to get the boxes back,

738
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:54,070
reassemble them.

739
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,372
The last time we did that--

740
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,944
I almost became
as evil as Rahl himself.

741
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:03,813
