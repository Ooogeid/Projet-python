00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,670
Richard Cypher,
you are the true seeker.

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:08,704
( heroic theme playing )

5
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,569
It's holding steady
at north-northeast.

6
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:26,070
Which should bring us within
a league of Winterhaven by noon.

7
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:27,904
We could stop there
for a hot meal.

8
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:30,039
I thought the compass
was supposed to point the way

9
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,940
to the Stone of Tears,
not the nearest tavern.

10
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,107
To reach the Stone of Tears,

11
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:35,110
we need all the sustenance
we can get.

12
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,811
Zedd.

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,716
Look.

14
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,320
Somebody's favorite fruit.

15
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:47,368
The persimmon is far more
than my favorite fruit.

16
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,203
It's the pinnacle
of creation.

17
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:51,441
One doesn't often see
such a perfect specimen

18
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,578
this late in the season.

19
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,115
I hope none of you
are expecting a slice

20
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,652
of the last persimmon
of the year.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,221
Wouldn't think of it.

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,960
That's very generous of you.

23
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:10,335
Mm. Mm. Mm.

24
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,904
Any persimmon you can eat

25
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,039
without getting juice
on your chin...

26
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,244
Mm. --isn't worth eating
in the first place.

27
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,117
Can I have a, um...?

28
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,220
A drink of, uh...?
Argh.

29
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:25,190
(Cara)- Water?
(Zedd)- Yes. Water.

30
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,425
Thank you, Kahlan.
My name is Cara.

31
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:29,894
I know that.
You called me Kahlan.

32
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,530
I absolutely did not.

33
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,499
Zedd, you did.

34
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:34,733
I did?

35
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,101
Are you all right?

36
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:38,204
No, I'm not all right.

37
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,873
It's not indignity enough that
I have more aches in my joints

38
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,275
than joints in my body,

39
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,143
that I stumble to the privy
six times a night.

40
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,012
Now I'm forgetting
the word for water,

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,047
and calling people
by the wrong name.

42
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:49,916
I must be older
than I thought.

43
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:52,117
You? Old?
Zedd, I'd be lucky

44
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,019
to be half as sharp as you are
when I'm your age.

45
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,821
( sighs )

46
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:03,531
Where's Tarralyn?

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,099
Tarralyn?
Yes, Tarralyn, my daughter.

48
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,234
Where is she?

49
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,274
Zedd, Tarralyn
isn't with us anymore.

50
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,077
She died last summer.

51
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:19,015
My daughter's dead?

52
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,717
How can that be?

53
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,123
You've known about Tarralyn
for a long time.

54
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,557
This is not like you.

55
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,593
You have the best memory
of anybody I've ever met.

56
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,362
Zedd, something
is happening to you.

57
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,497
Happening. Yes.

58
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,865
Something's happening.

59
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,234
The persimmon.

60
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:39,902
Zedd's the only one who ate it.

61
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,371
Maybe it was poisoned.

62
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,275
Not poisoned. Spelled.

63
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:46,877
A spell of f-f-forgetting.

64
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,213
Is there a way to undo it?

65
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,949
Yes.

66
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,285
- A potion.
- A potion of what?

67
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:58,490
Elderberry blossoms, mandragora,

68
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,026
and the dust
of a Shadrin's horn.

69
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,361
We'll find them.

70
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,162
Zedd, who would have
done this to you?

71
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,431
There's only one person
powerful enough

72
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,300
to spell a Wizard
of the First Order.

73
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,702
Who knows exactly what fruit
I wouldn't be able to resist.

74
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,537
Who?

75
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,973
Zedd, who?

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,474
Shota.

77
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:19,211
Why would Shota
want to do this to you?

78
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,746
Why would who want to do what?

79
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,148
Take away your memory.

80
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,818
- Let go of me.
- Zedd.

81
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:31,125
Why are you all looking at me
like that? Who are you people?

82
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,727
Find elderberry blossoms.

83
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,429
I'll get the mandragora.

84
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:36,698
For the Shadrin, we'll have to
go into the caves we passed.

85
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,268
Keep Zedd calm.
Zedd. Zedd, it's all right.

86
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,236
Get away from me!
Don't let him get away.

87
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,006
No!
( Richard grunts )

88
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,645
No!

89
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,621
Richard.

90
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,790
( panting )

91
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:19,812
(Kahlan)
Richard, are you all right?

92
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,247
Unh. Where's Zedd?

93
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:23,516
He ran off.

94
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,551
You and I will go up to the
caves and try to find a Shadrin.

95
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:27,253
You follow Zedd.

96
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,888
He can't use his magic
against you.

97
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,289
When you find him,
bring him back here.

98
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,658
He's a very big Wizard.

99
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:34,627
I may have to do it my way.

100
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:37,430
Just don't kill him. Go. Unh.

101
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,498
( chickens clucking )

102
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,738
(Man)
Do you think I like having to
come down here personally?

103
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:47,573
Third week running
we've only gotten

104
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,176
four gold pieces
from you.

105
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:51,911
Didn't we agree
your fair share

106
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,581
of maintaining the beauty
of our great city was eight?

107
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,619
( man grunting )

108
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,221
Stop that.

109
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,358
You're hurting him.

110
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:07,727
What are you gonna do
about it, old man?

111
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,063
( chuckles )

112
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:14,700
( men laughing )
( man grunts )

113
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,060
Excuse me.

114
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,962
Yes?

115
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:47,266
You're very beautiful.

116
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,237
So I've heard.

117
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,809
( crowd laughing )

118
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:10,758
Payment upfront.
Payment?

119
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:13,427
You didn't think you could
partake of my wares for free,

120
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:16,029
did you?
( giggles )

121
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,264
Coins, old man. Those little
round, shiny things

122
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:20,233
you keep in that purse
on your belt.

123
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,168
Purse.

124
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,237
Oh, yes.

125
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:27,574
Coins.

126
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:29,543
I'm afraid
you'll need ten of those.

127
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,244
The price has gone up.

128
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:34,081
Now that half of every farthing
I earn goes to Drago.

129
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,284
I wish I had ten.

130
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,687
( magic chimes )

131
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,758
Do that again.

132
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,027
I'll try.

133
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,831
( magic chimes )

134
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,768
( crowd gasps )

135
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,207
Girls, uh, take this
gentleman upstairs

136
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,643
and see that he has
the best night of his life.

137
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,479
( women giggling )

138
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:08,082
What about her?

139
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,817
(Inkeeper)
Well, that would be
up to Salindra,

140
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,386
and Salindra's very choosy.

141
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,989
But if you ask her nicely,
she might go upstairs with you.

142
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,065
Salindra.

143
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,367
Will you come upstairs with me?

144
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,170
Sorry.

145
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,472
You remind me too much
of my grandfather.

146
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,739
( both laugh )

147
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,679
Come along, handsome.

148
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,781
Who needs her
when you've got us?

149
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,984
( giggling )
( loud bang )

150
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,019
( crowd gasps )

151
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,687
Why is it that when
I'm hunting down a man,

152
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,122
I never have to look further

153
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,758
than the first brothel
past the city gates?

154
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:52,560
- Keep away from me.
(Cara)- Sorry.

155
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:55,863
Your little adventure is over.

156
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,698
I'm taking you back
to Richard and Kahlan.

157
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,566
I'm not going anywhere with you.

158
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:02,168
I think you'll reconsider.

159
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,773
( bird calling )

160
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,376
(Shota)
Thank the Spirits you're safe.

161
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,781
Who are you?

162
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,082
How did I get here?

163
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,818
I'm Shota.

164
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,254
I brought you here.

165
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,822
I'm your friend.

166
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,293
If you're my friend, then
send me back to where I was.

167
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,561
Oh, I can't.

168
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,096
That woman in red
would have killed you.

169
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,132
I saved your life.

170
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,333
( chuckles )

171
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:33,702
I'm not gonna hurt you.

172
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:37,206
I love you.

173
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,876
I don't even know you.

174
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:44,413
Have the years taken that much
from you, Zeddicus?

175
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,650
Have you forgotten even me?

176
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:49,084
Zeddicus?

177
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:52,387
Oh, my love.

178
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,457
You don't know that you are
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

179
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:58,459
the greatest and most powerful
Wizard the world has known

180
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,528
in 3,000 years.

181
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,697
- I am?
- Yes.

182
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:07,035
There is so much to say, but we
don't have very much time.

183
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,371
The world is in terrible
trouble, and only we can help.

184
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,540
A rift has been torn
in the veil

185
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:13,509
between the Underworld
and the Land of the Living.

186
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:17,012
If the Seeker of Truth does not
find the Stone of Tears,

187
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,481
the Keeper will put an end
to all life.

188
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,784
The Seeker of Truth?

189
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,285
Who's that?

190
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,620
A great hero,
one that can only be named

191
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:28,389
by a Wizard of the First Order,

192
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,792
and you, you are the only
Wizard of the First Order alive.

193
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,894
- The only one?
- Yes.

194
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,896
But as you got older
and began to lose your memories,

195
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,165
you made a mistake.

196
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,602
You named the wrong Seeker.

197
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,204
A Seeker prophesied to fail.

198
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:44,407
That's terrible.

199
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:47,510
Yes, but fortunately,
I've found a new one,

200
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,714
a young man of great courage.

201
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:52,783
And once you name him,

202
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,986
and he is able
to fulfill his quest,

203
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,955
then not only
will the world be saved,

204
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,690
but then you and I will be free
to live together,

205
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:02,192
as we did long ago, in bliss.

206
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,895
And with our combined powers,
Zeddicus,

207
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,731
we will master the world
and protect it from evil.

208
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,267
But how can I help?

209
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,802
An old man, who doesn't remember
his own name?

210
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,605
Oh...

211
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:19,609
I can restore
what you have lost.

212
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:25,382
Your youth and the mastery
of all the spells and magic

213
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,087
that were yours
in that golden time long ago,

214
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:32,124
back when you were at the height
of your powers.

215
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,493
( inhales )

216
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,328
( suspenseful theme playing )

217
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,468
( exhales )

218
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:47,172
Come.

219
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:00,254
You are the great love
of my life, Zeddicus.

220
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:06,727
I'm not surprised.

221
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:11,626
The Keeper isn't resting,
and neither can we.

222
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:14,329
In order to name a new Seeker
and send him off on his quest,

223
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:16,465
we need two things.

224
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:19,969
First,
the Sword of Truth.

225
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,340
(Zedd)- I know them.
(Shota)- Yes.

226
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,276
The man you wrongly named
the Seeker,

227
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,611
and the misguided Confessor
who protects him.

228
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,446
They tried to attack me.

229
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:31,915
Of course they did.

230
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,549
To prevent you from naming
the new Seeker.

231
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:41,155
Shadrin.

232
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,858
( growling )

233
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:47,961
( roars )

234
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:02,645
(Man)
Halt and drop your weapons.

235
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,017
Poaching on the personal reserve
of Drago,

236
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,186
High Lord and Master
of Winterhaven,

237
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:12,755
is a crime
punishable by death.

238
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,791
We didn't know we were on
anyone's personal reserve.

239
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:19,295
Lord Drago was a great friend
of Lord Rahl's.

240
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,163
He'll be more than happy to see
the Seeker and the Confessor

241
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,832
hanging from his gallows.

242
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,067
Take them.
But don't let her touch you.

243
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,469
She's deadlier
than a poison dart.

244
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:31,106
( Richard yells )

245
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:33,475
( all grunting )

246
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,782
For what I am going to do,

247
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,951
I need to join my magic
with yours.

248
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,086
Give me your hand.

249
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,493
Think, Zeddicus.

250
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,127
You know the words
to the Spell of Taking.

251
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,497
I've restored them to you.

252
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:56,931
Yes.

253
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,700
Yes, I remember them.

254
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,734
Say them with me.

255
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,002
( grunting )

256
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,337
( chanting in ancient tongue )

257
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,478
( panting )

258
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,084
Astounding.

259
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,553
Not for us, Zeddicus.

260
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,455
For us, it's barely more
than a parlor trick.

261
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,627
( all grunting )

262
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,032
Richard!

263
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,738
The new Seeker needs one more
thing to complete his quest.

264
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,642
Stop! Unh!

265
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,877
( Richard grunting )

266
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:45,048
What's this?

267
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,282
Witchcraft.

268
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,418
( all grunting )

269
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,679
( grunts )

270
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:16,114
( panting )

271
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,483
- What is it?
- A compass.

272
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,286
In the hands of the Seeker named
by a Wizard of the First Order,

273
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,688
it will illuminate and light
the way to the Stone of Tears

274
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:27,157
and the salvation of the world.

275
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:28,958
But the province where we will
find the new Seeker

276
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,392
is many leagues from here.

277
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,860
We must leave immediately.

278
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,764
- Leave?
- Yes.

279
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:38,867
- Right now.
- I don't want to leave.

280
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,903
I like it here.

281
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,338
Is it Winterhaven that you like,

282
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:46,175
or one of the harlots?

283
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,478
I should have known that by
giving you a beautiful face

284
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,113
it wouldn't make you
any less of an old fool.

285
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,683
Fool, am I?

286
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,053
Many thanks for the beautiful
young face.

287
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,089
And the wonderful spells.

288
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,824
But I'm not going anywhere
with you.

289
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:00,892
( chants in ancient tongue )

290
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,166
( chants in ancient tongue )

291
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:10,635
( sighs )

292
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:11,703
( crowd chattering )

293
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:14,339
(Zedd)
Hello, Salindra.

294
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,974
Do I know you?

295
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,179
Well, I guess I don't look like
your grandfather anymore.

296
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:25,016
Oh. It's you.

297
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:28,119
Well, you certainly have a lot
of tricks up your sleeve. Heh.

298
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:31,055
What are you wasting your time
on a mouse like this for?

299
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,858
Oh, he is hardly a mouse.

300
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,936
Are you trying to impress me?

301
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,439
What is it?

302
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:51,508
Why are you looking at me
that way?

303
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,612
When I first saw you,

304
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,982
I thought you might be
the princess

305
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,285
I was looking for.

306
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:03,621
But I don't know,
dressed like that.

307
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,395
( crowd gasps )

308
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:13,164
(Zedd)
And what
self-respecting princess

309
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,566
goes around without a footman...

310
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:17,802
( crowd gasps )

311
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,704
(Zedd)
...and ladies in waiting?

312
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:22,974
( crowd gasps )

313
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:32,282
Well, the real question is,

314
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,119
what kind of princess

315
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,788
goes around without a prince?

316
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,010
<i>( majestic theme playing )</i>

317
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,280
Do you like the view?

318
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,151
(Salindra)
Very much.

319
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:56,753
Then allow me to welcome you
to your new palace.

320
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,788
I don't see a palace.

321
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,523
Not yet.

322
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,129
Girls?

323
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:08,364
Mm. Half a dozen of them.

324
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:09,665
Hanging all over him.

325
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,800
And then he disappeared.

326
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:13,767
I've been searching for him
all night.

327
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,068
Look.

328
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,971
I guess we know
where Zedd is.

329
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,307
Let's go.

330
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,344
Does this meet
with Your Majesty's approval?

331
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,046
I think it will do.

332
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:40,123
Once we get there, how do we get
Zedd to drink the potion?

333
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,424
(Shota)
You won't be able
to get near him.

334
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:45,760
Shota.

335
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,929
He thinks you're his enemies.
He'll obliterate you.

336
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:51,030
I don't know
what you did to him, or why,

337
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,366
but I'm gonna stop him before
he hurts somebody or himself.

338
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:57,103
Oh, just because you have
flowers and roots

339
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:58,338
and a Shadrin's horn,

340
00:17:58,406 --> 00:18:00,373
that doesn't mean
you can reverse my spell.

341
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,175
No, what I have done,
only I can undo.

342
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,410
Then do it.

343
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, heh, I will.

344
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,517
After he has named a new Seeker.

345
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,318
What?

346
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,387
( laughs ):
Oh.

347
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:15,724
He hasn't told you about
the Prophecy.

348
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,792
What Prophecy?

349
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,694
A month ago I told him
that it was written

350
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:22,530
in the Halls of Prophecy
that Richard Cypher will fail

351
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,598
in his quest to defeat
the Keeper.

352
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,833
Fail how? What do you mean?

353
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,935
I don't care about Prophecy,

354
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:31,604
and I don't have time
for your riddles and tricks.

355
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:34,773
None of my prophecies
have ever proved false.

356
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,775
I begged Zedd
to name a new Seeker,

357
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:39,979
but he was too blinded
by his sentimental attachment

358
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:41,247
to his grandson.

359
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:43,849
I hoped that if I stripped him
of his memories,

360
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,851
I might convince him to do
what had to be done.

361
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,486
Richard is the Seeker.

362
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:50,657
Of course you'd say that
about the man who you love.

363
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:53,527
But I didn't come here
expecting your help.

364
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,565
I came hoping for yours.

365
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,870
Why would I help you?

366
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:05,807
Because you don't care
who bears the name of Seeker,

367
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:07,842
you only care about
protecting Richard Rahl.

368
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,344
But if he continues
on this doomed quest,

369
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,180
the Keeper will win,
and he will die

370
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,416
along with everyone else
in the world.

371
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,217
Now, Zedd can't use his magic
against you.

372
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,386
If you subdue him,

373
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,121
then I can force him to do
what must be done.

374
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:25,925
Funny, how people always curse
the Mord-Sith,

375
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:27,827
until they need one.

376
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,930
Do you want Richard to live
or don't you?

377
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:34,033
You're right.

378
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:38,003
Wizards can't use their magic
against a Mord-Sith.

379
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,439
And neither can witches.

380
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:42,941
( screaming )
( Agiel whining )

381
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:45,243
There's only one way to
stop that from happening again:

382
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,545
Undo the spell you put on Zedd.

383
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,116
(Man)
No matter how much we give them,
Great Wizard,

384
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:53,817
Drago always wants more.

385
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,352
(Zedd)
I swear to you, sir,

386
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,323
and to all citizens
of Winterhaven,

387
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,295
such cruelty will never again
be tolerated in this city.

388
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:06,834
They've destroyed all my wares,
my children will go hungry.

389
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,703
If there's something
you can do to help...

390
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,875
( laughing )

391
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:17,344
Ha-ha! Thank you, thank you,
Great Wizard.

392
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,314
(Zedd)
Monica.

393
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,148
Will you accept this trifle,

394
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:23,650
in thanks for befriending me

395
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:26,720
when I was a ragged old man
with no castle to my name?

396
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,855
(Monica)
It's very beautiful,
Great Wizard.

397
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,490
But there's trouble
in Winterhaven

398
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,925
that all the jewels
of Athanasia can't fix.

399
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:37,096
The dead coming back to life,
murdering people in their homes.

400
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:38,797
The Keeper's work,
people say.

401
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:42,635
Same for the cracks in the
ground, opening up all over.

402
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:46,040
A tear in the veil
between the Underworld

403
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:48,209
and the Land of the Living.

404
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:50,111
There's a rift just outside
the walls of the city.

405
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,846
A monster crawled
out of it last week,

406
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,648
slaughtered two
of my best customers,

407
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,982
on their way back
to their village.

408
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,420
You have to help us.

409
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,725
To help you seal the rift,
and defeat the Keeper,

410
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,661
we need to find
the Stone of Tears.

411
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:09,063
And to find the Stone of Tears,
we need a Seeker.

412
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:11,599
Yes. Richard Cypher.

413
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,204
Hm, I'm afraid we can't rely
on Richard Cypher.

414
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:17,506
There's a Prophecy that says
he's destined to fail.

415
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:21,544
Don't worry,
we'll have a new Seeker.

416
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:25,047
Only a Wizard of the First Order
can name one,

417
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,917
and fortunately,
I am such a Wizard.

418
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,218
Who will you name?

419
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:35,625
As Wizard of the First Order,

420
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:39,829
I hereby name as Seeker of Truth

421
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:43,833
and Bearer of the Sword...

422
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:48,337
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander!

423
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,473
( all cheer )

424
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:56,591
( dramatic theme playing )

425
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,360
Yes.

426
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:01,296
The compass points
the Seeker's way.

427
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,932
My princess and I
will depart at once

428
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,733
on the quest
for the Stone of Tears.

429
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:08,636
( all cheer )

430
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:09,804
Secure horses
and provisions

431
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,739
for all those who wish
to accompany us.

432
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,974
Yes, My Lord.

433
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,278
What sorcerer dares to raise
a castle in my city?

434
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,014
I'm no sorcerer.

435
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:24,251
I am Zeddicus,
greatest of all Wizards,

436
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:26,153
Seeker of Truth,

437
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,489
and high lord
and master of Winterhaven.

438
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,224
This man will die.

439
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,493
And let it be known

440
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,595
that any friend of his
is an enemy of mine.

441
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,730
( giggles )

442
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:38,332
Oh, Drago,

443
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,601
you always were
a man who overestimated

444
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,202
what he had in his quiver.

445
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,773
I'm afraid this time you've
met more than your match.

446
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,476
Kill her first.

447
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:50,211
( screams )

448
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:57,451
The choice is yours.

449
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,420
You can join me on my quest,

450
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,255
or you can suffer the same fate.

451
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:03,657
Which is it going to be?

452
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:10,997
A wise choice.

453
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:12,965
( all cheering )

454
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,200
( chuckles )

455
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,237
( men screaming )

456
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:26,643
Drago.

457
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,512
My Lord.

458
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,351
You're alive?

459
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:35,386
No.

460
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:36,554
And neither are you.

461
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,024
Then this place--

462
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:40,858
(Rahl)
The Underworld.

463
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:44,194
You served me well
in life, Drago.

464
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:46,096
I did my best, Lord Rahl.

465
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:50,968
And I will reward you with
an offer from the Keeper:

466
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:53,570
Kill and live.

467
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:55,371
My Lord?

468
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,074
One more day of life

469
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,843
for every soul
you deliver to the Keeper.

470
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:04,114
I gratefully accept,
Lord Rahl.

471
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,383
And I will begin
by ripping out the heart

472
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:08,853
of Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander
and feeding it to my dogs.

473
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:11,990
Zorander the Wizard?

474
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,494
Yes, Wizard,
and now Seeker of Truth.

475
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:16,696
Seeker of Truth?

476
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,498
Yes, My Lord.

477
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:19,832
He named himself.

478
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,069
The former Seeker,
and the Mother Confessor,

479
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,938
are they with him?
Not that I saw.

480
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,807
But when I send
the Wizard to the Keeper,

481
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,609
you can ask him yourself.

482
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,510
Unfortunately,
a Wizard of the First Order

483
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,912
is not so easy to kill,

484
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,747
as you yourself discovered.

485
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:41,020
But don't worry,
your death will be avenged.

486
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,855
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

487
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:50,230
( trumpet plays fanfare )

488
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,203
( rift rumbling )

489
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,872
Halt!

490
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:59,174
( rumbling continues )

491
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,989
So this is a rift

492
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,290
between the Underworld
and the land of the living?

493
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:19,359
Yes, Wizard.

494
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,827
One of many,
all over the countryside.

495
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,897
(Zedd)
Do you hear me, Keeper?

496
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:26,066
Your plans will come to nothing,

497
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:27,935
for I, Zeddicus,

498
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,704
greatest of all Wizards,

499
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:33,475
high lord and master
of Winterhaven,

500
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:37,546
Seeker of the Truth,
and Sealer of the Rift,

501
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:41,150
will lock you in your
prison for all eternity.

502
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:43,485
( gasps )

503
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:45,321
( suspenseful theme playing )

504
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:48,090
( crowd gasps )

505
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:51,226
( chatter )

506
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:57,632
( grunts )

507
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,872
She's dead.

508
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,075
My love,
I will bring you back.

509
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,414
( chants in ancient tongue )

510
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:19,155
( gasps )

511
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:21,524
(Rahl)
Salindra.

512
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:24,327
Salindra.

513
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:25,962
(Salindra)
Lord Rahl.

514
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:28,331
( gasps )

515
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,099
(Rahl)
Don't be frightened.

516
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,135
It's much too late for fear
to do you any good.

517
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,738
What are you
going to do to me?

518
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:37,506
That would be up to you.

519
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:40,042
If you like,
I could give you a second life.

520
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:42,912
At what price?

521
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,281
Only small one.

522
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:48,217
Simply deliver the Wizard
to the Underworld,

523
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,186
along with the Sword of Truth
and the compass.

524
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:52,255
What do you need them for?

525
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,490
Haven't you heard?

526
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:56,260
The Keeper is fighting a war

527
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,661
to conquer
the World of the Living

528
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:00,364
and he needs your help.

529
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:02,399
Can he count on you?

530
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:07,406
Isn't there some
other price I could pay?

531
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:12,010
Don't tell me you've
fallen in love with him.

532
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:15,781
He's a nice fellow.

533
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,383
He's been kind to me.

534
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,952
They're all nice fellows to you,

535
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,522
as long as they have
a little gold in their pocket.

536
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:24,890
On the other hand,

537
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,958
you're welcome to stay here
with us in the Underworld.

538
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:31,396
The Keeper maintains a very
special chamber of torments

539
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:33,632
for those
who traffic in love.

540
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:38,303
Ask yourself,
what is the life of one Wizard?

541
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,006
Come, Salindra.

542
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,943
You're a practical girl.

543
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,811
( dramatic theme playing )

544
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:52,232
( chants in ancient tongue )

545
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:59,672
She's getting cold.
She's not coming back.

546
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,808
(Man)
There are some things
nobody can do.

547
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,377
- Not even you, Great Wizard.
- No.

548
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:07,413
There's nothing I can't do.

549
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:11,017
( chanting in ancient tongue )

550
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,556
( screams )

551
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:17,558
( gasps )

552
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:23,564
My beauty.
I've brought you back.

553
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:26,267
Zeddicus.

554
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,402
What am I doing here?
I said no.

555
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,870
What do you mean?

556
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:32,239
Oh, Darken Rahl told me
I could come back to life

557
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:36,377
if I turned against you,
but I refused.

558
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:38,011
( panting )

559
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,647
He was about to throw me
in the pit.

560
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:44,051
You can't imagine
how horrible it was...

561
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:47,087
And then suddenly
I was looking up at you.

562
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:50,556
You brought me back.

563
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:53,627
Yes.

564
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,495
And I'll never
let you go again.

565
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:03,503
Behold, I am Zeddicus,
greatest of all Wizards,

566
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,238
high lord and master
of Winterhaven,

567
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:08,874
Sealer of the Rift,
Seeker of Truth,

568
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:12,577
Defeater of Death
and Restorer of Life!

569
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:13,778
( all cheering )

570
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,415
That's Zedd?

571
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,151
Yes, that's Zedd.

572
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,020
He's named himself the Seeker?

573
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,789
This is a catastrophe.

574
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:26,691
When I have found
the Stone of Tears,

575
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:29,627
I will banish death
from this world.

576
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:31,061
Undo the spell.

577
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:33,263
No. It's too dangerous.

578
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:35,031
His magic's too powerful.

579
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,234
I'm not going out there
until you subdue him.

580
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:39,904
And leave you here?
To do whatever it is

581
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:41,372
you please
with Richard and Kahlan

582
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,940
the second
my back is turned?

583
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:44,642
( chuckles )

584
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,110
I don't think so.

585
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:47,946
Then we have a problem.

586
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:49,414
If you don't start moving,

587
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,216
you're going to have
a bigger problem.

588
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,085
No. We need to do this without

589
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:56,555
putting anybody in danger.
How?

590
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:58,557
When Shota took
away his memories,

591
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,325
he lost everything
he's learned in life:

592
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:04,696
wisdom, judgment,
knowing about consequences.

593
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:07,032
Don't forget about humility.

594
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,000
Of which he had precious
little to start with.

595
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,636
He thinks he's more powerful
than the Keeper.

596
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:13,237
He's turned himself
into a king.

597
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:14,972
He's even
found himself a queen.

598
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,474
If he sees us all coming,

599
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,810
he'll think we're trying to take
everything away from him.

600
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,244
Shota's right,
he could obliterate us.

601
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:21,546
So, what do we do?

602
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,681
With his powers,
he could actually succeed

603
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:26,518
in finding the Stone.

604
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,288
But he's not the true Seeker.
You are.

605
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:32,391
I doesn't matter
who has the title,

606
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:34,227
or who gets the glory,

607
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,196
as long as the Stone is found
and the rift is sealed.

608
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:38,599
(Kahlan)
He's lost his mind.

609
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,366
There's no way
we can count on him.

610
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,803
You're right.

611
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:46,439
( sighs )

612
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,106
But we don't want to make
him feel threatened.

613
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:49,407
Not now.

614
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,142
Whatever he's forgotten,
he's still Zedd.

615
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,544
If I can
get close to him,

616
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:56,714
talk to him,
gain his confidence,

617
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:59,683
maybe I could make him
see what he's doing,

618
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:03,020
and what the cost could be.

619
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,489
I'm so frightened for you.

620
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:07,190
About what?

621
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,762
Do you promise you won't
do anything crazy and reckless?

622
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,798
Salindra, tell me.

623
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:22,005
When I was in the Underworld,

624
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:26,343
in that awful,
terrible place,

625
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,478
I heard Darken Rahl
talking to the Keeper.

626
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:31,615
They're happy you've
taken up the Seeker's quest.

627
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,716
They think that while you're

628
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:36,586
chasing after
the Stone of Tears,

629
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,187
they will have time
to destroy us all.

630
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,560
But there's one thing
they're terrified of.

631
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:45,528
What?

632
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,999
They're terrified that you
are going to march into the rift

633
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:52,702
and battle the Keeper
with the Sword of Truth,

634
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,170
because they know
you would win.

635
00:31:56,641 --> 00:32:00,377
Oh, Zeddicus, I'm so afraid you
will try something like that.

636
00:32:00,444 --> 00:32:03,413
(Man)
Sir, this man wanted to see you.

637
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,881
He said it was
extremely important.

638
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:07,517
We've searched him head to foot,
he isn't armed.

639
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,051
I know him.

640
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,353
You remember me?

641
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,356
Yes,
you're the false Seeker.

642
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:16,692
You and your friends
tried to attack me

643
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,193
when I was still
an old man.

644
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:21,997
We weren't trying to attack you,
we were worried about you.

645
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,866
Do you remember anything
before yesterday?

646
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,970
No. Heh.

647
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,505
But why would I need to?

648
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,108
Nothing of any importance
happened to me before yesterday.

649
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,576
Something terrible did happen.

650
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,445
While you and I were walking
through the forest,

651
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,480
you ate a persimmon
that was spelled by a witch,

652
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,649
and you suddenly
lost your memory.

653
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:42,386
You were scared and confused.

654
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,755
We tried to calm you down,
but you ran away.

655
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,556
Who are you exactly?

656
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,094
I'm your grandson.

657
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:55,265
- Grandson?
- Yes.

658
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,334
And a man never
had a better grandfather.

659
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,840
You risked your life
for me hundreds of times.

660
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:06,210
Without you, the most evil
despot who ever lived

661
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,477
would still be on his throne.

662
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:12,182
- Would he?
- Yes.

663
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,985
You saved the world.
Many times.

664
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:19,290
Mm. Well, grandson,

665
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:20,791
I look forward
to knowing you better,

666
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:23,360
but right now,
I have a pressing engagement

667
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,695
with the Keeper.

668
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:25,963
Zeddicus. No.

669
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,565
Yes, Salindra.

670
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,835
I'm marching into the rift alone
to do battle with the Keeper.

671
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:31,436
You can't go into the rift.

672
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:34,039
Ah, but I can.
Zedd, no--

673
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:35,908
Don't worry, you won't
lose your grandfather.

674
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:40,179
I'll come back, with the blood
of Death himself on my sword.

675
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,147
No one goes into the Underworld
and comes out alive.

676
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:43,749
Nobody except me.
You'll be killed!

677
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:45,717
And the Keeper will have
the Sword of Truth,

678
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,051
and the compass.

679
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,753
The Keeper fears me.

680
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,621
What makes you think that?

681
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,257
I was told by somebody
who heard it with her own ears.

682
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:58,963
She's lying to you.

683
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,899
She's trying to lead you
into some kind of trap.

684
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:04,903
She wouldn't trick me.
She wouldn't lie to me.

685
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,406
She loves me. Stay back.

686
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:09,074
Zedd, no!

687
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:11,144
( grunts )

688
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:13,479
( suspenseful theme playing )

689
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,615
(woman)
Look out!
The Confessor is coming.

690
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,584
(Man)
Get her!

691
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:20,487
( grunting )

692
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,733
This isn't farewell.

693
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,401
Just a brief parting.

694
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,170
May the Spirits be with you,
Zeddicus.

695
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,006
They always are.

696
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,497
( grunting )

697
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:17,345
Get him out.

698
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,685
( chants in ancient tongue )

699
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:27,388
( grunts )

700
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:30,724
He went into the rift!
(Kahlan) No.

701
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,392
( gas hissing )

702
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,926
I'm going after him.

703
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,127
Richard, no!

704
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,962
I can't abandon Zedd.

705
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,764
Then I'm coming with you.

706
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,300
If Zedd and I don't come back,

707
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,236
someone needs to stay alive
to find the Stone.

708
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:17,109
Kahlan, the quest is bigger
than any of us.

709
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,644
Don't follow me.

710
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,390
( dramatic theme playing )

711
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,535
( suspenseful theme playing )

712
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:40,370
Zedd!

713
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:43,639
Don't go any farther!

714
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,707
Zedd!

715
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,081
Zedd!

716
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,860
( groans )
(Richard)- No, Zedd!

717
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:10,297
(Rahl)
Youth is fleeting,

718
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,498
isn't it, Zeddicus?

719
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:14,733
(Richard)
Zedd, get away from him.

720
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,903
Zedd!

721
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,142
For all of us, it would seem.

722
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,777
Including the Seeker.

723
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,379
Zedd, we have to go.

724
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,413
A valiant effort,
dear brother,

725
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,548
but the Keeper
has granted me

726
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,851
power over the gates
of his dominion.

727
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,919
( rumbling )

728
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:54,399
Richard!

729
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,312
( heroic theme playing )

730
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:16,149
Richard.

731
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,184
Zedd.

732
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:21,419
(Zedd)
I failed.

733
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,254
( Salindra grunts )

734
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:28,259
( gasping )

735
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,728
Don't worry, my beauty.

736
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:35,298
Whatever's wrong,
I'll heal you.

737
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,634
You can't.

738
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:43,371
I didn't deliver my side
of the bargain.

739
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,473
The Keeper's calling
in the debt.

740
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:47,908
Debt?

741
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:50,110
I tricked you.

742
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:51,744
Why?

743
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,380
I-- I--

744
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:57,582
I'm a practical girl.

745
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:58,749
( gasps )

746
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:01,785
( whimpers )

747
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,621
( gasps )

748
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,456
( sobbing )

749
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:09,925
( melancholic theme playing )

750
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,733
Break the spell.

751
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,836
Now.

752
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,808
( chanting in ancient tongue )

753
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:30,812
( dramatic theme playing )

754
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:46,496
(Zedd)
Richard. Kahlan.

755
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,165
What in the name of creation
have I done?

756
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,434
Whatever you did,
it's not your fault,

757
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:55,837
it's Shota's.
(Shota) No.

758
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,338
I was trying to save everyone.

759
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,706
And I might have succeeded,

760
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,939
if I hadn't underestimated
your pride and arrogance.

761
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:06,442
Which are exceeded
only by your own.

762
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:08,844
(Cara)
She's of no use to us now.

763
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:11,445
Should I kill her?

764
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,780
(Richard)
No.

765
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:14,682
We may need her someday.

766
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,853
Apparently, you've gainedwisdom.

767
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,359
When you're ready to name
a new Seeker, call on me.

768
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:32,229
Meanwhile,
enjoy the one you've got.

769
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,201
(Kahlan)
Zedd...

770
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,873
...can you do anything?

771
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:49,179
( chants in ancient tongue )

772
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:00,656
( sighs )

773
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,630
Something on your mind?

774
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,499
There's plenty on my mind.

775
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,067
Starting with
"I wonder if Zedd

776
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:11,503
"didn't tell me
about the Prophecy

777
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,806
because he believes
it to be true."

778
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,307
Is that a new power
of yours?

779
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,176
Being able to read
people's thoughts?

780
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,677
I didn't tell you not because

781
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:21,412
I had doubts about
your ability to succeed,

782
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:22,580
but because I didn't want you

783
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:25,249
to start having doubts
of your own.

784
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,184
What if Shota's right?

785
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,851
About some young swain of hers

786
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:30,686
she wants me to anoint
so she can wield

787
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,456
the Sword of the Truth
herself by proxy?

788
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,525
Shota thinks only of Shota.

789
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,960
If any proof were ever needed

790
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:40,829
that not just anybody
can be the Seeker,

791
00:41:40,863 --> 00:41:42,197
my own behavior today
provided it.

792
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,199
Will you have
to name me again?

793
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,234
No.

794
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:47,535
You were always the Seeker,

795
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,404
long before you first
held the Sword of Truth.

796
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:56,810
You faced death for me.
Literally.

797
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:01,480
What was it like,
being young again?

798
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,149
Oh, Richard,

799
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:08,253
it's years beyond count
since I felt that way.

800
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,555
That there was no mountain
I couldn't climb,

801
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,091
no woman I couldn't win.
( chuckles )

802
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,526
You made me young again.

803
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,894
Could you do that
to yourself?

804
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,429
Yes.

805
00:42:18,463 --> 00:42:20,131
Then why don't you?

806
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:23,000
Because one journey down
the agonizing gauntlet

807
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,901
of youth
is enough for any man.

808
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,805
She was very beautiful.

809
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,575
Yes, she was, wasn't she?

810
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:33,610
( soft theme playing )
