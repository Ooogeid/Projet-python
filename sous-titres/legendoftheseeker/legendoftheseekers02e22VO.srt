(Announcer)
<i>Previously on Legend of the Seeker</i>

2
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:07,417
(Richard)
<i>A tear in the veil between</i>
<i>this world and the Underworld.</i>

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:10,589
<i>The Keeper is waging war</i>
<i>on the Land of the Living.</i>

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,363
<i>He's using the rift to send</i>
<i>creatures into our world.</i>

5
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:14,967
<i>And the only way</i>
<i>to close this rift</i>

6
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:17,802
is for us to find
the Stone of Tears.

7
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:19,868
This prophecy means
that if you continue

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,374
searching for the Stone of Tears

9
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,711
<i>you will find it. But you will</i>
<i>give it to the Keeper.</i>

10
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:26,615
I don't believe
in prophecies.

11
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:30,655
Sister Nicci,
bring me the Stone of Tears.

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,825
From now on,
I serve only myself.

13
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,831
(Cara)
<i>The Seeker could use a fighter</i>
<i>as strong as you, Dahlia.</i>

14
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,467
We could serve him together.

15
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,869
(Kahlan)
<i>Do you think we can trust her?</i>

16
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,911
(Dahlia)
<i>I wish there were another way.</i>

17
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:45,613
(Rahl)
<i>Your sisters and I</i>
<i>have missed you.</i>

18
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:47,849
( Agiel whining )
Aah!

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,588
(Zedd)
<i>Cara attacked me.</i>
<i>She took the stone.</i>

20
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,791
It's good to have you back.

21
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,429
There has to be a way of undoing
whatever it was Rahl did to her.

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,267
There is one way but
the results are unpredictable.

23
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:01,539
<i>It's called</i>
<i>the Spell of Undoing.</i>

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,342
( chanting in ancient tongue )

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,983
You are now joined
as husband and wife.

26
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,954
(Zedd)
<i>The spell seems</i>
<i>to have changed everything.</i>

27
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,558
(Richard)
<i>It's a new day in D'Hara, Zedd.</i>
<i>I have the power of Orden.</i>

28
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,895
(Kahlan)
<i>So Richard has been able</i>
<i>to use his power wisely.</i>

29
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,631
Where's Cara?
Who's Cara?

30
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:20,202
(Richard)
<i>Sounds like she has a better</i>
<i>life in this world</i>

31
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,837
<i>than she did in the other one.</i>

32
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:24,441
(Keeper)
<i>Victory has been</i>
<i>stolen from my grasp.</i>

33
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>for you to serve me.</i>

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,115
(Marianna)
<i>Once we have</i>
<i>acquired the boxes,</i>

35
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:31,652
<i>we will be able to deliver</i>
<i>the Keeper a great victory.</i>

36
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,620
If Richard no longer
has the power of Orden,

37
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,456
<i>then the Mord-Sith</i>
<i>and Darken Rahl</i>

38
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:38,194
<i>are no longer</i>
<i>under his control.</i>

39
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,930
Kneel before me.

40
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,532
(Zedd)
<i>Rahl has the power of Orden.</i>

41
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,968
(Kahlan)
<i>He's controlling Richard.</i>

42
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,470
I can try to reverse this spell.

43
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,606
Do you really wanna
go back to an existence

44
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,942
where the dead
walk among the living?

45
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,878
The Keeper
is on the brink of victory.

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,382
(Zedd)
<i>I wish there was another way,</i>
<i>but there isn't.</i>

47
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,253
( grunts )

48
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,025
(Zedd)
Dahlia.

49
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,293
She's dead.

00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:07,335
(Dahlia)
Lord Rahl wants you alive.

52
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,807
But if you resist,
he'll settle for dead.

( coughs )

58
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,869
Kahlan, don't!
If I confess her,

59
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,171
I can command her to give Cara
the Breath of Life,

60
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,539
and then you can perform
the spell.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,343
I'm going to perform
the spell on Dahlia instead.

62
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,878
Why?
Because it should have

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,216
the same effect on her
that it did on Cara.

64
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:46,552
It'll undo all the Mord-Sith
magic that was ever done to her.

65
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,022
And if Dahlia were never
a Mord-Sith,

66
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,925
Darken Rahl couldn't have
used her to lure Cara away.

67
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:56,564
Zedd, we've seen how
unpredictable this magic is.

68
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:00,736
Kahlan, I can't give Cara back
the life she had in this world.

69
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,638
But if this spell works,

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,172
I can give her back
the life she had with us.

71
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:06,740
A life she was proud of.

72
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,843

(Zedd)
Cara!

82
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,315
Where's Cara?

83
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,753
(Cara)
I'm right here!

84
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,324
Thank the Spirits.

85
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,126
I appreciate the concern,
Wizard.

86
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,829
But it takes more than a few
banelings to kill me.

87
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,766
That's the Cara I know.

88
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,000
Zedd, are you all right?

89
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,202
I'm fine. I think.

90
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,704
Just tell me
where we are.

91
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,339
Gilgalar.

92
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,874
On the way to
the Pillars of Creation.

93
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:33,477
Zedd, what's going on?

94
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,446
It's a long story.

95
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:39,115
(Richard)
Well, you'd better
tell us on the move.

96
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:41,651
We need to find a safe place to
set up camp before it gets dark.

97
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:43,452
Are you sure
we shouldn't keep going?

98
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,787
Kahlan's right.

99
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,622
The solstice
is the day after tomorrow.

100
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:48,324
We need to get
to the Pillars.

101
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,125
We'll get there in time.

102
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,993
But not if we're so tired
that we can't fight off

103
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:55,496
the next horde of banelings
that attacks us.

104
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,965
( chuckles )

105
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,838
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

106
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:25,586

107
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:28,889
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

108
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:36,496
Quite a dramatic entrance,
Nicci. Even for you.

109
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:39,366
To what do I owe the pleasure?

110
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,735
It appears you and I now
have something in common:

111
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,837
Neither of us
serves the Keeper anymore.

112
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,872
Hm.

113
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:48,940
Tiresome old creature, isn't he?

114
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,276
It's so hard
to keep him happy.

115
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:53,612
And you won't be very happy
when the Seeker fails,

116
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:56,180
and your former master gets
his hands on you again.

117
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,715
He's not known for forgiving
those who betray him.

118
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:01,952
And the Seeker
is not known for failure.

119
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,421
Have you forgotten the Prophecy?

120
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:07,223
He will deliver the stone
to the Enemy of the Light.

121
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,458
If there is one thing
I have learned,

122
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,961
it is never to wager
against my brother.

123
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:15,231
Prophecy or not,
he will succeed.

124
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:21,136
Your overconfidence
can only mean one thing:

125
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:23,971
you know that Richard
already has the stone

126
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:26,173
and where he's taking it.

127
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:28,175
Tell me.

128
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,145
Why in all creation
would I tell you?

129
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,147
I can protect him.

130
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:35,717
But only if you tell me
where he's going.

131
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:40,120
And how do I know

132
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,756
that you are not still
in league with the Keeper?

133
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:45,092
So the great Darken Rahl

134
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,827
is just going to wait
for his little brother

135
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,562
to save the world?

136
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:50,930
Oh, waiting's not so bad,

137
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,434
as long as one finds amusing
ways to while away the time.

138
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,336
Why don't you join me?

139
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,270
The water's warm.

140
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,107
Not as warm
as it's going to be.

141
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,712
( screaming )

142
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:09,480
Where is the Seeker
taking the stone?

143
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,279
( screaming )

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,715
The Pillars of Creation!

145
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:20,119
(All)
Keeper, hear our prayer.

146
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,488
We live only to serve you.

147
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:25,756
Tell us, master, how to deliver
the world into darkness.

148
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:27,624
(Marianna)
Sisters!

149
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,192
Glorious news.

150
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:31,494
One of our order has spotted
the Seeker

151
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:32,996
on the plains of Gilgalar,

152
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,865
heading north,
toward the Alithian Sea.

153
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:37,166
We will travel there
and intercept him.

154
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,302
And how will
we defeat him on our own,

155
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,968
without the Keeper's help?

156
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:47,033
We summon him, Marianna,
but he does not come.

157
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,131
I fear he has grown deaf
to our prayers.

158
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,864
If the Keeper
will not come to us,

159
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:55,697
then one of us
must go to him.

160
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:57,533

( souls groaning in distance )

163
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,909
Keeper?

164
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,511
(Keeper)
<i>Why do you</i>
<i>and your sisters call to me?</i>

165
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:15,515
The Seeker is heading north
to the plains of Gilgalar.

166
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,617
If you order your banelings
to help us,

167
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,519
we can kill him for you.

168
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,189
(Keeper)
<i>I am finished with entrusting</i>
<i>my fate to underlings.</i>

169

<i>Now that I know</i>
<i>where the Seeker is,</i>

170
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,861
<i>I will stop him myself.</i>

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

173
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,305
If we can't get across, we may
not make it to the Pillars!

174
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:46,074
Run!

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,950
Kahlan, stop, it's too wide!

177
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,459
Catch up with me if you can,
but I have to keep going.

178
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,967
May the Spirits be with you.

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

180
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,966
(Zedd)
The rift extends as far
as the eye can see.

181
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,309
We can't leave
Richard out there on his own.

182
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,982
Then we'll just
have to go around.

183
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:47,957
(Garen)
Nicci will die for this,
My Lord.

184
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,926
You truly believe you
and your sisters are a match

185
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,495
for the most powerful sorceress
in the known world?

186
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:56,097
She infiltrated this temple
under your noses

187
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,465
and almost boiled me alive.

188
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,335
We will avenge the affront.

189
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,905
Revenge is a petty motive,
Garen.

190
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,673
Kill her we must, yes.

191
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,708
But not for vengeance sake.

192
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,843
We must kill her to ensure
my brother's victory.

193
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,012
Because if he fails,

194
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,815
the Keeper will
torture us all for eternity.

195
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,917
You do not believe
Nicci intends

196
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,651
to protect Richard
as she claimed.

197
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:24,454
I believe she intends to use him
somehow to serve her own ends,

198
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,522
whatever those may be.

199
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:28,657
Since we know where
the Seeker is going,

200
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,859
we know where Nicci will be.

201
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,361
But you cannot defeat her alone.

202
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:39,899
You will join forces with
the Seeker and his retinue.

203
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,402
My Lord--
You heard me!

204
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,871
In this dark hour
there is no one

205
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,940
we can depend upon more

206
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,876
than my fearless brother.

Banelings.

No, I'm not a baneling.

220
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,646
I'm the Seeker.

Declan.

Declan, I'm going
to get you out of here.

226

I can't leave my papa.

He's alive?

228
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,169

They killed him.

229
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,439
My mama too.

230
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,774
They killed everyone.

( sobbing )

232
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,250
I'm going to take you
someplace safe.

I'm counting on you to keep
this fire going, Declan.

234
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,623
It's a tough job,
but I think you're up to it.

235
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,629
There's enough
food and water in here

236
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,031
to last you
at least three days.

237
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,898
I'll be back for you
before then.

Oh, I wish I could take you,

It's the Stone of Tears.

I'm bringing it
to the Pillars of Creation.

Tomorrow, when the sun
is at its highest,

its light will
pass through the stone

248

and repair the veil
to the Underworld.

hurt you again.

We felt your spirit here,
in the World of the Living.

We were drawn to you,
like ships to a beacon.

You will tell no one
of my presence in this world.

Never, master.

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,001
But in this mortal flesh
you could be hurt or killed.

Let us protect you.

277
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:06,106
Why do I need
you to protect me

when I have the Seeker?

I don't understand.

280
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,612
I took the body of this boy,

281
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:16,385
who was killed
by my banelings,

282
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:19,122
because I knew
that Richard Cypher

283
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:23,125
could never turn away
from a helpless child.

284
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:28,297
You will kill him
and then take the stone.

285
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:30,699
No.

286
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,335
The time has come
to rely on Prophecy.

287
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:37,138
Soon, the Seeker will hand me

288

I am overjoyed to hear it.

But what of the second Prophecy?

291
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:49,818
As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

292
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,053
you cannot win.

293
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,755
Then it will be your task
to stop her heart.

294
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,523
Gladly, master.

295
00:16:57,524 --> 00:17:00,658

as the Seeker's:

be that easy to assassinate?

I'm on your side, Verna,
I swear.

all the way from
the Old World.

318

Why?

319
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,756
To tell you that
the Creator has sent

320
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,057
a new Prophecy about the Seeker.

321
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:37,560
What does this new Prophecy say?

the prelate's interpretation.

he left the Old World.

to help him.

made it around.

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,087
Then we'll have to hurry,
won't we?

350
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,922
Hyah!

351
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,694
How could she
have confessed Kahlan?

352
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,929
She must have absorbed
enough of Kahlan's han

353
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,563
to use it against her.

354
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:44,864
Then if we kill Nicci,
Kahlan will be released.

355
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:48,233
We have to catch up
to them first.

356
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,424
(Verna)
The hour of the solstice
draws near.

357
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:57,060
What can I do to help,
with so little time?

358
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,660
Send a message
by Journey Book

359
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,761
to your brothers
in all the provinces.

360
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,762
Tell them to search
for the Seeker.

361
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,098
If they see
he is traveling with a child,

362
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,033
they will know
the Prophecy is true.

363
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:11,036
And they must
kill the child.

364
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,273
Verna,
the brothers of this order

365
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,641
have devoted themselves
to protecting all life.

366
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:21,177
Prophecies are seldom as clear
as this one, Brother Joseph.

367
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:24,346
The Seeker is being deceived
by the Keeper

368
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,114
in the form of a child.

369
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,416
As soon as your brothers
find him,

370
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,351
they must act
without hesitation.

371
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:33,688
But if you are wrong, they will
be killing an innocent child.

372
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:36,290
And if I am right,

373
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,426
they will be putting an end
to the Keeper forever.

374
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,361
( sighs )

375
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:47,835
The Creator has put a sword
in our hands, Joseph.

376
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,371
Are we going to
lay it down,

377
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:54,207
or raise it in battle?

378
00:21:57,544 --> 00:22:01,479
( <i>majestic theme playing</i> )

379
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,756
Hyah!

380
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,958
We'll never catch them
on foot.

381
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,993
Don't you know
some sort of spell

382
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,594
to make us move faster?

383
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:26,765
Maybe we don't need a spell.

384
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,666
( horse whinnies )

385
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,301
Maybe we can
borrow some horses.

386
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,503
Or steal them.

387
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,506
(Zedd)
Mord-Sith!

388
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,211
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

389
00:22:57,241 --> 00:23:00,709
Lord Rahl has commanded us
to join forces with you.

390
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:04,243
Out of the goodness
of his hollow heart?

391
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:06,845
Out of an instinct
for survival.

392
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,546
If the Keeper wins,

393
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:10,681
Lord Rahl will be returned
to the Underworld

394
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:14,284
to face eternal suffering at
the hands of his former master.

395
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:17,053
Well, thank you
for your generous offer.

396
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,255
But I have a better idea.

397
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,423
We'll just take your horses.

398
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:23,082
Cara.

399
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,150
You can't seriously be
considering this.

400
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,519
If we fight them,
we could lose.

401
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,753
And they have four more
pair of hands

402
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:31,621
that can deflect
Nicci's magic.

403
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:32,922
( sighs )

404
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,463
So who's in charge here?

405
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,464
I am.

406
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,934
So who's in charge here?

407
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:49,336
You are.

408
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,738
Then let's ride.

409
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:03,849
Richard's boots made these
tracks, mistress.

410
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,051
But they're at least
a half a day old.

411
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:08,152
He's been here and gone.

412
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:10,921
That way.

413
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:13,690
Mistress,
I know Richard.

414
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:15,891
He's clever.

415
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,526
He may have realized
you're tracking him

416
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:19,527
and be setting a trap
for you.

417
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,363
I couldn't bear it if
any harm came to you.

418
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:23,997
Stop groveling.

419
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:25,899
The Seeker isn't
going to kill me.

420
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,768
He's going to serve me.

421
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,169
How?

422
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,937
He trusts you.

423
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,138
Once we've caught up to him,

424
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,039
you'll get close enough
to confess him.

425
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,041
That's why I didn't take
all of your han.

426
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,742
I will do
whatever you wish.

427
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,310
But how is the Seeker
going to serve you

428
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,511
if he's confessed to me?

429
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:46,480
You will order him to give me
the Stone of Tears.

430
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:49,115
It has the power
to bestow immortality

431
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,350
even while the Keeper
does me the great favor

432
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,319
of destroying all the rest
of the pathetic life

433
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,388
that inhabits this world.

434
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:00,260
You will order Richard
to be my consort,

435
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:03,930
and he and I will start
a new race in our image.

436
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,466
A people that follow my will

437
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:09,302
and my will alone.

438
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:12,905
Oh.

439
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:14,406
But, mistress,

440
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:16,942
if we don't catch up
to Richard in time--

441
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:20,044
That's why you're gonna
help me slow him down.

442
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,081

Does it hurt?

454
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,220
I'll be all right.

455
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:38,292
Give me the Stone of Tears.

456
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:39,527
Declan--

457
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:40,728
You can't get it
to the Pillars

if you can't see
where you're going.

459

You're very brave.

461
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,607
But I can't let you
take the stone.

462

You've seen how dangerous
it is for anyone who has it.

How will you make it
if you can't see?

00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:31,703
Maybe because Nicci

used Kahlan's own magic
to confess her.

530

The only way to free Kahlan
is to kill her,

Because for some stupid moment,

I was worried
I couldn't revive her.

00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:00,494
She was your friend.

538
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:03,330
That's what you people have done
to me. Made me weak.

539
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:06,299
No, Cara.
Your hesitation wasn't weakness,

540
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,768
it was a strength.

541
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,504
An instinct to preserve life
rather than snuff it out.
