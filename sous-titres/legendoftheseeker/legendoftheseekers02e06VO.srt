<i>Richard Cypher,
you are the true Seeker.</i>

4
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:23,038
See how the deer
changed direction

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,076
when he heard us coming.

6
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,748
Can you tell me
which way he went?

7
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,348
I don't see why
I need to learn to hunt.

8
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,950
We're not in
a Mord-Sith temple.

9
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,550
We don't have
slaves to bring us dinner.

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,118
I'm here to protect you,
Richard,

11
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:40,052
not provide meals.

12
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:44,192
Kahlan's not above
digging up roots.

13
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:48,229
Even Zedd's been known to do
the washing now and then.

14
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:50,026
We all need to contribute.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,024
Are you saying I'm not
doing enough for you?

16
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,426
Just tell me which way
the deer went.

17
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,695
That way.

18
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:12,130
Where the bark has rubbed
off the tree.

19
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,065
See, I knew you'd be
good at this.

20
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,639
Get me a strong one.

21
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:40,115
There's no need to harm us.

22
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,018
Take that girl too.

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,392
Spread out so I can get a better
look at the rest of you.

24
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,710
These men who attacked you,

25
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:10,944
do you know who they were?

26
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:13,878
Slave hunters.

27
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,743
And you didn't try
to fight them?

28
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,041
My people are called
the Minders.

29
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,575
We mind the laws
of the Creator,

30
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:22,277
who teaches us
that every life is sacred.

31
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,378
We love our enemies
as we love ourselves.

32
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,646
Love them?

33
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:26,813
I'd kill a thousand men

34
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,082
before I'd let one
make me his slave.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,118
Think of all the battles
fought over the centuries,

36
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,353
all the blood spilled,
all the victories won,

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,821
and what has it gotten us?

38
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,656
Only more battles,
and more blood.

39
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,891
The Midlands
is a bloody place.

40
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,726
If you don't fight,
even to protect yourselves,

41
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:44,927
how have you survived?

42
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,828
We're healers.

43
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,097
For thousands of years
people have come to us

44
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:50,798
with their sick
and injured.

45
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,333
And so we were respected
and left to live in peace.

46
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:54,868
You're not at peace anymore.

47
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:56,869
No.

48
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,571
With the passing
of Darken Rahl,

49
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,206
these lands turned
to chaos.

50
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:03,974
A warlord named Caldor

51
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,776
came across the mountains
and captured our village.

52
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,378
Those of us who escaped
came together in the woods.

53
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:11,947
- And the slavers?
- Caldor's men.

54
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,615
When they realized
we wouldn't fight,

55
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:16,450
they came after us, to force
us to serve their master.

56
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:18,652
Your camp is too vulnerable.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,587
We saw some caves
at the top of that ridge.

58
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,155
You'd be safer there.

59
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,390
We could escort you.

60
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,560
I know
you're trying to help.

61
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:29,162
But we've always been
all right on our own.

62
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,097
May the Spirits be
with you.

63
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,069
They don't want our help,

64
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:41,170
and we need to get back
to Kahlan and Zedd.

65
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,473
I don't like leaving
those people by themselves.

66
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,142
They have a right to follow
their own beliefs.

67
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,743
The Seeker
can't save everyone.

68
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,315
That's strange.

69
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,850
It's giving us a new bearing.

70
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:01,384
Which way
is it pointing?

71
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,187
Back the way we came.

72
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,322
To the Minders' camp.

73
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,890
Seeker, please, don't leave.

74
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,325
Caldor's men will be back.

75
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:14,627
Teach me how to fight,

76
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,162
so that I may defend
my people.

77
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,862
What about your beliefs?

78
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,396
My mother doesn't speak
for all of us.

79
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:24,432
Some of us think the old ways
don't make sense anymore.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,034
When Caldor's fighters
attacked our village,

81
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,003
my father stood
in front of them

82
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,937
and he prayed
for their spirits.

83
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,774
But they slit
his throat anyway.

84
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,642
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,744
I don't want your sympathy.

86
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,679
I want you
to teach me to fight.

87
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:47,417
I'm not asking you to do
anything you don't choose to do.

88
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,053
But if you want to join Kur
and learn to fight,

89
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,555
we'll stay and teach you.

90
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:54,458
Kur, fighting is not the way.

91
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:55,926
We'll go to the caves.

92
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,260
We'll barricade ourselves.

93
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:59,029
We'll be safe there.

94
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,364
For how long?

95
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,466
Till they starve us,
burn us out.

96
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,569
Who will fight with me?

97
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,944
You'd all rather stick
to the old beliefs,

98
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,280
watch us get cut down
and dragged away

99
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:21,048
until there's nobody left?

100
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,194
I'll fight.

101
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,996
No, Veta.

102
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,197
You know the Creator's will.

103
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,232
And I also know
I don't want to die.

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,834
Or be a slave.

105
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,902
Do you?

106
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,352
You Lot will stay here
with me and Kahlan.

107
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,354
Roga, will you let Zedd and Cara go
with you to the caves,

108
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,789
and protect you

109
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,561
until these people are ready
to protect you themselves?

110
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,103
We need to ask you
something.

111
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,706
Do you know anything
about the Stone of Tears?

112
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,741
Of course we know of it.

113
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:30,676
It's in our prayers.

114
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:32,310
Today, the compass we're following

115
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,713
shifted its bearing
to your encampment.

116
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,314
Do you have the Stone?

117
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:38,649
No.

118
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:41,418
We thought the Stone
had been lost forever.

119
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:44,655
For all our sakes,
I hope it hasn't.

120
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,630
Don't we need
better weapons?

121
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,297
Uh, these staves will do
fine for now.

122
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:59,300
The slavers have swords
and battle-axes,

123
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:00,968
what can we do with these?

124
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,705
I used to be a trail guide,

125
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,139
on the other side
of the Boundary.

126
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,942
Sometimes there were
bandits in the woods,

127
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,844
and all I had was a staff
to fight them off with.

128
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:17,082
Nobody I guided through
the woods ever lost a farthing.

129
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:27,623
One, two, three,
strike.

130
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,061
You have to give it
more than that.

131
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,832
One, two, three, strike.

132
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,406
Better.
But even harder.

133
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,474
You're fighting for the lives
of the people you love.

134
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,710
One, two, three, strike.

135
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,595
Kur?

136
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,063
Kur, answer me.

137
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,231
I knew no good
would come of this.

138
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,532
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,502
What is it Zedd?

140
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,704
I believe these people
are under a binding spell.

141
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:32,073
A very ancient
and very powerful magic.

142
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:35,109
They were fighting
when they collapsed?

143
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,110
Yes.

144
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,344
This is the first time
they've ever raised

145
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:39,845
a weapon against
an opponent.

146
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:42,614
That may be what caused
the spell to strike them down.

147
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,849
I don't understand.

148
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,418
The Wizards of long ago
created the binding spells

149
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,655
as a way of reining
in the powerful forces

150
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,356
that burn inside us.

151
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,891
Lust, anger,
envy, violence.

152
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,060
It could be that this spell
was put on the Minders

153
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,896
to prevent them
from raising their weapons.

154
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:02,598
If the magic is thousands
of years old,

155
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,232
how could it be affecting
these people now?

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,868
Some spells don't die with
those on whom they are cast.

157
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:11,104
They're intended to be passed
down through the blood.

158
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:13,173
Which may explain your people's
aversion to fighting.

159
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,841
We choose not to fight

160
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,076
because we love
the Creator and her works,

161
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,710
not because of a...
A spell.

162
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:20,378
Whatever the reason,

163
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:24,246
I think I can draw
the magic into my own body.

164
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,915
But healing all of them

165
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,516
will drain me
of my powers.

166
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,384
It may take days
for me to recover.

167
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,920
And who knows what
the consequences will be.

168
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,321
What do you mean?

169
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:36,589
The ancient Wizards
were men of great wisdom.

170
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,226
They did not cast powerful
spells for no reason.

171
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,928
We have no way of knowing
what will happen to them,

172
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:47,165
or me, if I remove
the binding spell.

173
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,033
We have to risk it.

174
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,362
Thank the Creator.

175
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,231
And the Wizard.

176
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:26,434
Don't thank me yet.

177
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:35,174
It's our turn to help you,
Wizard.

178
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:37,410
I'll take you back
to the caves.

179
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,946
Can we fight again now?

180
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,581
How can you even ask?

181
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,583
You saw the price you paid.

182
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:47,252
But the spell has been lifted.

183
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,788
Kur, if you fight again
and something happens,

184
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:52,158
the Wizard won't have
the strength to heal you.

185
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:01,033
If we don't learn to fight,
we die anyway.

186
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,337
You'll keep teaching us,
won't you?

187
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:12,110
This is not a game.

188
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,678
Your enemy's not going
to just stand there

189
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,046
while you poke at him.

190
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,549
He's going to try
to kill you.

191
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:19,783
You have to try
and kill him first.

192
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,588
Hesitate and die.

193
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,495
I brought you dinner.

194
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,498
Quick little bastards,

195
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,965
but not quick enough.

196
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,533
Thank you,
but we never eat

197
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,634
anything that's been killed.

198
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,004
Actually, I found them
by the side of the road,

199
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:52,406
where they died a natural,
peaceful death.

200
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,140
Cara.
We're Roga's guests.

201
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,842
There's no sense to this.

202
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,877
It's one thing not
to kill another person,

203
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,345
but you have to eat.

204
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,980
I saw some winterberries
growing along the path,

205
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,182
down below the rocks.
We'll gather some.

206
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,225
Go after them.

207
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:17,326
They don't want our help.

208
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,728
As long as we're with them,

209
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,929
I'm not going to allow
any more of them to be killed.

210
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:23,064
Go.

211
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:32,941
Hungry?

212
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:36,543
Not particularly.

213
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,245
Don't you like winterberries?

214
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:42,248
Maybe stuffed inside
a crisply roasted suckling pig.

215
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,651
Try one.

216
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,419
You may be surprised.

217
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,729
Good,

218
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,664
right?

219
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,635
Roga!

220
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,789
Take a message to Caldor:

221
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:28,890
Leave the Minders alone.

222
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,959
I won't let you hurt him.

223
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,727
I'm just gonna teach him
a lesson.

224
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:34,962
Yes.

225
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,563
The same lesson you've
both been taught

226
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,532
all your lives,
that violence will help you?

227
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,269
Do what you want.

228
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,403
I'm through with you.

229
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,306
Go in peace.

230
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:51,009
Serve the Creator,
and she will reward you.

231
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,258
Good work.

232
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,159
We'll start again
at first light.

233
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,864
Come on, Seeker.
Draw your sword.

234
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,064
A good soldier knows
when to rest.

235
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:19,498
Caldor's men aren't resting.

236
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,165
I want to test myself
against a real fighter,

237
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,064
with a real weapon.

238
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,196
You're not scared of me,
are you?

239
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,238
Hesitate and die. That's
what you taught us, right?

240
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,806
You've been paying attention.

241
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,280
Don't go so easy on me.

242
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,514
Nice move.

243
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,016
But know when your opponent
has a better one.

244
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,967
Richard,
what are you doing?

245
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:14,601
What does it look like?
I'm teaching him to fight.

246
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:16,135
You almost killed him.

247
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,204
He'll never learn to defend
himself until he's faced

248
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,772
someone who's trying
to hurt him.

249
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,207
Richard, you just started
training him two days ago.

250
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:24,243
I know what
I'm doing, Kahlan.

251
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:25,578
Don't get in my way.

252
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,063
Did he hurt the boy?

253
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,830
Mostly just scared
the wits out of him.

254
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:41,099
But there was an anger
in Richard's eyes

255
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,366
I'd never seen before.

256
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,168
It's bitter, and harsh.

257
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,571
Maybe you're just upset because
Richard raised his voice at you.

258
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,472
You weren't there.

259
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,841
Had you seen what happened,
you'd know something was wrong.

260
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,711
The Sword was glowing.

261
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:01,046
Glowing?

262
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:03,248
Does that mean something?

263
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:06,717
The magic of the Sword
is fueled by the Seeker's anger,

264
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:09,886
and with it he's able to fight
with the strength of many men.

265
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:11,955
But the Sword only glows

266
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,190
when the Seeker's anger
turns to rage.

267
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:16,958
He was out of control.

268
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,393
Could this
have something to do

269
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,394
with removing the binding spell
from the Minders?

270
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:22,862
I don't know.

271
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,296
But I need to see him.

272
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,899
- You're ready.-
- For what?

273
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,934
I only planned to teach you

274
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,435
how to defend yourselves
against the slavers.

275
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:35,271
But you're better fighters
than I expected you to be.

276
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:38,274
We're going to take your
village back from Caldor.

277
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,543
Am I wrong about you?

278
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:45,114
Are you afraid
to take back what's yours?

279
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:48,920
No. There's nothing
we want more.

280
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,093
But to fight Caldor,
we need better weapons.

281
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,962
The Wizard can
make them for us.

282
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,230
You won't always have
a Wizard to help you.

283
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,466
We'll get them ourselves.

284
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,668
How?

285
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:54,347
If it weren't for Kur,
we could all be dead.

286
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,283
Kur didn't hesitate.

287
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,019
He did what had to be done.

288
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,453
Grab a weapon.
It's time to go.

289
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,197
You were raised with
the belief that no man's life

290
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:18,200
is worth more than another's,

291
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,068
but I tell you today,

292
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:23,703
the enemies we will face
are not men.

293
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:27,873
They are the monsters
who held your father

294
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,208
and forced him to watch
while they violated your mother.

295
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:38,113
They are the demons
who forced hot coal

296
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,581
down your brother's throat.

297
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:47,587
They are the ghouls
who dragged your sister away

298
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:50,356
and forced her to live
in slavery,

299
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:53,391
humiliation and despair.

300
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,227
Don't fight the rage.

301
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:02,330
Let it hold you in its grip.

302
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:06,166
Let it guide the deadly
sweep of your sword.

303
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:18,079
Because it is
the torch of rage...

304
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:24,287
...that will guide
your way to victory.

305
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,427
This is where he was
training the Minders.

306
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,166
The slavers must
have taken them.

307
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:39,735
They weren't taken.

308
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,103
Not with Richard
to protect them.

309
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:44,640
Then where have they gone?

310
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,802
This is for my father.

311
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,100
Follow them into the forest!

312
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,802
Hunt them down!

313
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:03,371
And kill them all!

314
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:16,369
Our village has been...

315
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:18,070
...desecrated.

316
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,878
Creator, forgive those
who did this.

317
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,269
Tamra!

318
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:02,771
I never thought I'd see you
again in the this world.

319
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,473
Spirits be thanked.

320
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:09,144
The Spirits have abandoned us.

321
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,378
Never, Tamra.

322
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,779
Never.

323
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,048
She was taken slave
by Caldor's men

324
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,516
when they attacked
our village.

325
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,385
You can't imagine

326
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,953
what I saw.

327
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:22,121
The killing,

328
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:23,925
the blood,

329
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,696
And it was Minders doing it.

330
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:29,099
Veta.

331
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,201
And Kur.

332
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:34,137
Slashing men to the ground.

333
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,006
My son?

334
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:38,007
Killing?

335
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:40,710
Man after man.

336
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:44,013
His clothes were soaked
with their blood.

337
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,816
It was the Seeker
who led them to do this.

338
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,750
Th isn't Richard.

339
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:52,885
There's magic
at work here.

340
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:54,552
Caldor's men
tried to run,

341
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,688
but the Seeker
killed them anyway.

342
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,756
Maybe he thought
he had to.

343
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:04,590
These men are savages,
slavers and killers.

344
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,858
If Richard let them go,
they may have come back.

345
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:07,825
Kahlan.

346
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:16,432
Zedd, what is it?

347
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:19,467
Inscriptions written
in an ancient Wizard's tongue,

348
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,935
one I learned long ago.

349
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,904
There are more inside
the temple.

350
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,372
We've never known
what they meant.

351
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,541
If they mean
what I think they do,

352
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,342
then there's no telling
what terrible things

353
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,110
Richard may be capable of.

354
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,845
Find him. Bring him back here
as quickly as you can.

355
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,750
Cara, if Richard is
truly out of control,

356
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:42,087
then maybe only
Mord-Sith magic can stop him

357
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,090
from using the Sword.

358
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,132
Caldor's main camp.

359
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,603
All those tents.

360
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,405
There must be a hundred men.

361
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:05,107
That's a hundred more souls
for us to send to the Keeper.

362
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,375
How do we fight that many?

363
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,776
We don't.

364
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,911
These are the men
who killed our fathers.

365
00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:12,178
We can't let them live.

366
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,447
We won't.

367
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:17,116
If we're not gonna
fight them, then how?

368
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,655
We're going to burn them
while they sleep.

369
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,292
Are you all right?

370
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,063
I'm fine.

371
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,264
Richard.

372
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,333
What do you want?

373
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:43,268
You need to go back
to the village.

374
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:44,869
All of you.

375
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:47,337
We're not finished
with Caldor.

376
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:49,138
More killing only serves
the Keeper

377
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:51,506
and everything we're
fighting against.

378
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,641
The Minders have
their village back,

379
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,242
you've taught them
to defend themselves.

380
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,677
Isn't that enough?

381
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,279
No. It's not.

382
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,313
Let's move.

383
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:02,148
Richard.

384
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,688
You're not yourself.

385
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,156
Put down the Sword.

386
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,897
Not until Caldor and every one
of his men are dead.

387
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:15,834
Now,
you can stand with us,

388
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:18,772
or you can
fight against us.

389
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm not gonna let
you do this.

390
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:22,041
Richard, no.

391
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:52,870
Cara.

392
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:56,640
Cara.

393
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:58,107
Cara.

394
00:25:58,175 --> 00:25:59,809
Cara!

395
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,014
There's nothing
I can do for her.

396
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,116
I don't have my powers back yet.

397
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,185
You're healers.
You can help her.

398
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:14,353
Maybe I shouldn't.

399
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,721
What?

400
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:17,321
Did the Creator
give me the gift

401
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,656
of healing so I could put
a killer back in the fight,

402
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:21,991
only to kill again?

403
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,660
Isn't that a Mord-Sith's life,
one long killing?

404
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,261
You don't know
anything about Cara.

405
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,695
And if you can save her,
but you let her die,

406
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:31,197
isn't that the same
as killing her yourself?

407
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,336
Take her to my home.

408
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,380
How could I do it,
Zedd?

409
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,551
How could I raise
the Sword to Kahlan?

410
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,520
Nearly kill Cara?

411
00:26:57,588 --> 00:27:01,457
How could I have slaughtered
all those slavers?

412
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,263
I have something to show you.

413
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:12,901
These writings tell the story
of a bloodthirsty warlord

414
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,204
who used dark magic to chain
a clan of fierce warriors

415
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:19,874
to his will
3,000 years ago.

416
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,709
Through the chain flowed

417
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:25,212
a storm
of bloodlust and rage,

418
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,883
and together the warlord
and his warriors rampaged

419
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,351
through the Midlands,

420
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:33,153
leaving death
and destruction in their wake.

421
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:34,788
Who was this warlord fighting?

422
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,656
Anyone and everyone.

423
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,092
He was mad
for blood and power.

424
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,960
Finally,

425
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,663
he was captured
and beheaded,

426
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:47,433
on the spot where
this temple now stands.

427
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,234
The greatest Wizard
of that time,

428
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,570
fearing that the warlord's
bloodthirsty men

429
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:54,240
would become chained
to another dark master,

430
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:57,043
put a binding spell
on them,

431
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,680
that would cause them
and their descendents

432
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:04,683
to sicken and die if they ever
again raised arms in violence.

433
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,753
Those warriors were
ancestors of the Minders.

434
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,988
And when you removed
the binding spell,

435
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,056
they were free
to fight again.

436
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,226
Yes.

437
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,130
And free to become chained

438
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,665
to another master.

439
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,569
Me.

440
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,742
How?

441
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,977
Why?

442
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,046
Because, Richard,

443
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,315
the madman that first put
the spell on them

444
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,020
was named Canton Rahl.

445
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,257
He was your ancestor.

446
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,803
We start with water,

447
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,238
the foundation of all elements.

448
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:53,605
That's you.

449
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,275
To the water, we add alum.

450
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,243
That's the Minders.

451
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,748
When I removed
the binding spell,

452
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,517
the Minders became chained
to your will,

453
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,420
but the water stayed calm
as long as you stayed calm.

454
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:11,122
But then you added the magic

455
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,225
of the Sword of Truth
to the brew,

456
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:17,161
and that...

457
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,931
...was the vinegar.

458
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,569
Three elements, Richard.

459
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:27,038
Each of them harmless
on their own,

460
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:30,074
but together,
a catastrophe.

461
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:35,446
Because now that
we're chained together

462
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:38,047
when I feel the rage,
so do the Minders.

463
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:40,215
Yes.

464
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:43,018
Then to protect the Minders
we need to break the chain.

465
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,254
Maybe if I got
far away from them.

466
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:48,289
I don't think
that would work.

467
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:51,958
The chain seems to be like
a Confessor's magic,

468
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:55,094
which is broken neither
by time nor distance.

469
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,363
So whenever
I pick up the Sword,

470
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,797
no matter where I am...

471
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,399
Every time you use the Sword,

472
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,601
and lose yourself to your rage,

473
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,269
they will too.

474
00:30:04,337 --> 00:30:06,505
Then I need to learn
to control the Sword again.

475
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:11,943
I don't know
if it's possible.

476
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,579
The magic of the Sword
may have become too potent.

477
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,382
But I'll do what I can.

478
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,718
It seems so unlikely, Zedd.

479
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,153
Of all the clans
in the Midlands,

480
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,621
I just happen to meet one

481
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,056
that's magically chained
to my bloodline?

482
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:30,359
Nothing in this world
just happens, Richard.

483
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:32,694
The compass pointed us
in their direction.

484
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:33,762
Why?

485
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,163
The compass is supposed to

486
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,765
guide the Seeker's way.

487
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,500
Maybe that means more than just
showing us where to go.

488
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:43,636
You think there's something
I needed to do here,

489
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:46,206
- to help me find the Stone.
- Maybe.

490
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:48,774
Maybe there's something
you needed to learn.

491
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:51,210
About your ancestry,

492
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:52,544
about yourself.

493
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:53,778
Who knows?

494
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,446
Maybe you were brought here

495
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:57,281
to find an army
to fight with.

496
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,285
Caldor's men, they're
coming.

497
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:07,655
Always and again,

498
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:10,358
killing only brings
more killing.

499
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:11,925
Zedd,
have your powers returned?

500
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,260
Can you fight?

501
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:16,396
I couldn't incinerate a fly.

502
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:18,631
Cara's hurt. Zedd can't fight.

503
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,300
It's you and me,

504
00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:23,668
and the Minders we trained,

505
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:26,537
against dozens of men.

506
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,610
Then you'll need this.

507
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,579
No.

508
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,748
Not after
what I did to Cara.

509
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,549
We don't know
if the Minders can fight

510
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:43,352
without the Sword's rage
fueling their courage.

511
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,854
Zedd, when I hold that Sword
all I feel is hatred.

512
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,155
What happens
if I use it in battle

513
00:31:47,223 --> 00:31:49,357
and the fury takes
control of me?

514
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,293
I can't trust myself
with it anymore.

515
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,494
Not yet anyway.

516
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,130
Then what do we do?

517
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,585
My mother
and the other Minders

518
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:20,686
still have the binding spell
on them.

519
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:24,622
You know they can't fight.

520
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:26,724
They just have to look
like they can.

521
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:30,761
Halt.

522
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,811
The Minders want nothing more
than to remain in their village

523
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,212
and live in peace.

524
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,947
But if you force them to fight,

525
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,649
they'll fight to the death.

526
00:32:57,717 --> 00:32:59,851
Your death.

527
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,720
It's your choice.

528
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:04,288
It's your fault, Seeker.

529
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:06,824
These people were clever enough
to know not to fight back.

530
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,892
Until you came.

531
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,795
Now we're here
to take blood for blood.

532
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:15,265
You've already tasted
the wrath of the Minders,

533
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,867
and now you're outnumbered,

534
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,101
four-to-one.

535
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,512
If I do decide
to let you live,

536
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,881
how do I know the moment
we turn our backs,

537
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:37,384
your peace-loving friends
won't attack us?

538
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:39,486
I'm the leader
of this clan.

539
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:41,654
You have my word.

540
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,090
Only a fool trusts his enemy.

541
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,298
I know this woman,
Lord Caldor.

542
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,899
She's telling you the truth.

543
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,801
I would stake my life on that.

544
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,313
I accept your assurances.

545
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,249
But you have my word
that if any of your clan

546
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,685
attack one of my men,
I'll be back with a thousand.

547
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,722
Every one of you will die!

548
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,458
We need to restrain you,
so no one gets hurt

549
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:54,160
while Richard
and I work with the Sword.

550
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,032
I'm sorry.

551
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,899
I hope you won't
have to stay here for long.

552
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,334
What if the magic's too strong?

553
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:06,969
What if
you can't control it?

554
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:08,403
Then I won't use
the Sword again.

555
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:13,240
How will the Seeker
complete his quest

556
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:14,374
without
the Sword of Truth?

557
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:12,325
Let the power of the magic
rise within you.

558
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:13,660
Don't resist it.

559
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:15,461
I don't want to lose control.

560
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,963
The rage is part of you,
Richard.

561
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,498
Fighting against it only
makes it stronger.

562
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,572
What do you feel?

563
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,974
Anger.

564
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,909
- At what?
- Everything.

565
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:35,777
That's no reason.
What are you angry at?

566
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,612
- Darken Rahl.
- You've killed him.

567
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,046
You've used that anger up.

568
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,714
What are you angry at?

569
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,149
The Keeper.

570
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:44,285
The Keeper didn't
drag you into this fight.

571
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,620
You released him.

572
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,623
What are you angry at?

573
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:49,659
Losing my father
and brother

574
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,095
and everything
I knew in Hartland.

575
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:52,866
Everybody has to grow up
and leave home.

576
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,868
That's nothing
for a man to moan about.

577
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:56,136
What are you angry at?

578
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:04,544
I can't be
with the woman I love.

579
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:06,546
Lots of people can't be
with the ones they love.

580
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:08,314
Some of us have even lost
our children,

581
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:10,082
and you don't see us
flying into rages.

582
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,051
What are you angry at, boy?

583
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,786
I'm not your boy!

584
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:17,690
What are you angry at?

585
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,694
Tell me, Richard!

586
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:24,562
Who dragged you into this fight?

587
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,365
Who are you angry at?

588
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:34,805
You.

589
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:37,507
Now we're getting somewhere.

590
00:37:37,575 --> 00:37:38,975
All those years,
you knew who I was,

591
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,577
and you said nothing.

592
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:43,210
You lied to me
about being my grandfather.

593
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,012
You weren't ready
for the truth.

594
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,847
You took me out of Hartland.

595
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,916
You named me the Seeker.

596
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,718
You're the one who gave me
this damned Sword.

597
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,325
Richard, no.

598
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:00,960
No!

599
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,461
He has to stop himself.

600
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,957
I almost killed you, Zedd.

601
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,658
But you didn't.

602
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:40,560
You were stronger
than the rage.

603
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:47,967
This time.

604
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,102
But you will master it.

605
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,072
As long as you have the courage
to keep working at it.

606
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,278
It's yours, Richard.

607
00:38:59,346 --> 00:39:00,881
And only yours.

608
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:03,383
If you want it.

609
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,500
Try again.

610
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,068
That's it, Richard.

611
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:25,404
Good.

612
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,873
Now let it go.

613
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,385
You've done well.

614
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,266
It's pointing due east.

615
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,135
The way we were going before
it sent us back to the Minders.

616
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:57,238
Maybe I learned
what I needed to.

617
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,676
I think you have.

618
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,919
The hardest people to break
are always the ones

619
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:19,388
who weren't afraid
to die for their beliefs.

620
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:21,322
I think you'd be
especially difficult.

621
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:24,992
Thank you fohelping
save our village.

622
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,860
I hope the Creator isn't
too disappointed in us.

623
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,596
The next time you're
about to use your Agiel,

624
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:33,732
I hope you'll remember
that we defeated a whole army

625
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,834
without spilling
a raindrop's worth of blood.

626
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:54,215
What are you thinking?

627
00:40:54,283 --> 00:40:56,184
Just daydreaming, that's all.

628
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,321
You're actually trying
to lie to a Confessor?

629
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,357
When will I learn?

630
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:07,193
I thought I knew Richard.

631
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,427
I've watched him
his whole life,

632
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:09,962
and only seen
the good in him.

633
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,163
Until now.

634
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,664
There is only good in him.

635
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,599
It's the magic
that's the trouble.

636
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,100
Oh, if it were
only that simple.

637
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:20,770
Just a few weeks ago we learned
who his real father was,

638
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,105
a Rahl.

639
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,506
He wasn't raised
by a Rahl.

640
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:26,476
He was raised by George Cypher.

641
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:29,245
The Rahl bloodline carries
with it powerful magic.

642
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:31,414
And that magic
is in Richard.

643
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:33,482
I wasn't sure until now.

644
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,619
Magic isn't always passed
from one generation to the next.

645
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:40,422
But the only way he could have
become chained to the Minders

646
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,460
is through the magic
of the House of Rahl.

647
00:41:42,528 --> 00:41:44,529
He's still Richard.

648
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:45,763
He's still the Seeker.

649
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:50,400
Kahlan,

650
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,069
there's a part
of the Minders' story

651
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:54,304
I didn't tell him.

652
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:55,739
Canton Rahl,

653
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,474
the man who first put
the spell on the Minders,

654
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:00,176
wasn't always bloodthirsty.

655
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:02,044
He started out as a protector

656
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:04,713
and benefactor to his people.

657
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:06,782
But then
as his powers grew,

658
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:09,284
he began to fight
and to kill,

659
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:10,719
and the more he killed,

660
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:13,489
the more the blood lust
overtook him.

661
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:14,857
He went mad with it.

662
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:19,929
And now we know
that darkness is in Richard.

663
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,765
But Richard learned
to control the Sword.

664
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,567
He mastered his rage.

665
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,135
Yes.

666
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:28,637
He controlled the Sword today.

667
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:30,206
But what about tomorrow?

668
00:42:36,614 --> 00:42:44,514
