1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:05,268
<i>Richard Cypher,
you are the true Seeker.</i>

2
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:26,607
It's a good thing Mord'Sith
are used to torture...

3
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,877
because that's exactly what
eating this stew will be.

4
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,684
Well, maybe Zedd and Kahlan'll
find some mushrooms.

5
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:39,620
It's gonna take more
than mushrooms to save this.

6
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,868
We went to town
for provisions, gars attacked.

7
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:55,736
Where's Zedd?
Trying to fight them off.

8
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,653
Zedd followed them
in here.

9
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,863
Happy birthday!

10
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,637
We couldn't celebrate with
that awful meal, now could we?

11
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:33,574
Were you in on this too?

12
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:37,344
I suggested we celebrate
your birthday the Mord'Sith way.

13
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:40,481
I didn't think Mord'Sith
celebrated birthdays.

14
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,483
We don't.

15
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:45,119
Richard, I'd like you to meet
our generous host,

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,854
-Duke Anders-

17
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:50,958
Thank you. I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble.

18
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,793
Not at all. It's the least
we could do

19
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,562
for the Seeker on his birthday.

20
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,864
In years past,
this was a day of remembrance

21
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,699
for those slain in the massacre
at Brennidon.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,902
But when we learned you would be
passing so close to Dunshire,

23
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,738
we decided this day shouldn't be
a time of mourning anymore.

24
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,641
From now on, it will be a day
to honor the Seeker

25
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:09,376
and all he's done
for the Midlands.

26
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:11,011
Yeah.

27
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:13,247
May I introduce my son, Erik.

28
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:16,317
Would you honor us by leading
the first dance, Seeker?

29
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,920
He'd love to.

30
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,184
Care to join them?

31
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:52,753
I'd rather fight gars.

32
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,236
Cormac is quite good.

33
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:11,038
He's a favorite
among the locals.

34
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,275
It's my great pleasure to
perform for our guest of honor,

35
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,611
Richard Cypher.

36
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,314
And may I say what a pleasure
it is to perform

37
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,884
for the Wizard of the First
Order, Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.

38
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:28,822
Compared to your magic, all I
have to offer are mere tricks.

39
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,326
But I hope you'll enjoy them
all the same.

40
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,328
<i>Appreataro!</i>

41
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:40,067
I'll need a volunteer.

42
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,635
You, my dear.

43
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:44,305
I don't think so.

44
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:46,106
Cara, it's a party.

45
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,441
You're supposed to have fun.

46
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,685
I can only hope the Mord'Sith

47
00:03:57,686 --> 00:03:59,653
will not turn my magic
against me.

48
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,956
Just get this over with.

49
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:04,158
I'll need
another volunteer.

50
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,461
Perhaps the Mother Confessor.

51
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:08,562
All right.

52
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,972
Now, if you ladies
could step into these boxes...

53
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:26,180
<i>Appreataro!</i>

54
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:42,463
Seeker, would you like to see
your friends again?

55
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,765
I'm kind of enjoying
the peace and quiet.

56
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,103
But if you must...
Very well.

57
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:52,573
But in order to bring them back,
I'll need assistance

58
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,875
from certain members
of the audience.

59
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:58,312
Will the following gentlemen
please stand?

60
00:04:58,313 --> 00:04:59,947
Gareth J'Tan,

61
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:02,983
Grayson Logren,

62
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:04,685
Henrik Katara,

63
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:07,288
Malcolm Copatar,

64
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,622
and Erik Anders.

65
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,999
If you ever wish to see
the Mother Confessor

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,168
and Mord'Sith again, Seeker,

67
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:24,305
you will kill
these five cowards.

68
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:26,740
What did you say?

69
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,943
They will not cheat death again.

70
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:35,082
Bring Kahlan and Cara back now.

71
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,584
If you kill me,
you'll never find them.

72
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:42,389
And if these five men
aren't dead within a day,

73
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,692
your friends will be.

74
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,728
Oh, and Seeker.

75
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,963
In case you think
I've forgotten your birthday,

76
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,699
I have a gift for you.

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,868
<i>Appreataro!</i>

78
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:07,948
Wherever we are, we aren't
getting out this way.

79
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,389
Kahlan.

80
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,865
What does it say?

81
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,769
"You have one day
until the sands run out.

82
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,171
And when they do,
so does your air. "

83
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:39,146
You were right.
This party is lots of fun.

84
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:43,517
What is it?

85
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:47,755
It's a journey book.

86
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:54,094
"For writing
to your loved ones. "

87
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:56,096
I don't undersnd.

88
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,399
He wants us to write
to Kahlan and Cara.

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,868
So we have proof
they're still alive.

90
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,469
He knows Richard
won't do what he wants

91
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,537
if they're already dead.

92
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:04,671
It might be a trick.

93
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:07,808
There's one way
to find out

94
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:20,754
There's a message.
It's from Richard.

95
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:22,089
He wants to know
if we're all right.

96
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,826
Then we'd better write him back.

97
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:45,579
Your conjurer knows more
than just parlor tricks.

98
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,414
Wandering Dust.

99
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,550
Not something
easy to come by.

100
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,152
It allows the user to magically
transport things

101
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:53,620
from one place to another.

102
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,423
But no more than a-
A league.

103
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:57,891
My men are searching
the area.

104
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,860
Why does Cormac
want these five men dead?

105
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,566
He lost five sons in the war
against the D'Harans.

106
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,601
We all mourned his loss.

107
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,536
He was grief-stricken,

108
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:12,206
but I had no idea he was capable
of something like this.

109
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,041
But what does he have against
the men on the list?

110
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:17,544
None of us fought in the war.

111
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,747
But they weren't the only ones
who didn't fight.

112
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,416
We have a lottery.

113
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,819
Every eligible man in Dunshire
has a tile with his name on it.

114
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,654
Each year,
in the town square,

115
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:32,059
the men put their tiles into
a cauldron, and, blindfolded,

116
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,796
I choose the tiles of those
who will serve in our army.

117
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,131
Everyone has the same chance
to be called for service.

118
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:43,303
I wanted to fight,
but my name was never chosen.

119
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,672
We couldn't allow
all of our sons to fight.

120
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:49,576
They might all be killed,
much like in Brennidon.

121
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,812
Some men had to survive

122
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,648
to ensure the province
would survive.

123
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:58,352
Ours is a fair system.

124
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:00,587
Cormac doesn't seem to agree.

125
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:04,124
And he made sure everyone
in Dunshire knows it.

126
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,659
He's quite the showman.

127
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,928
You can't give in
to this madman, Seeker.

128
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,464
You can't kill us.
I'm not killing anyone.

129
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,366
Richard.

130
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,168
There's a message.

131
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:20,507
"We're trapped in a tomb with
only a day's worth of air.

132
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,277
"Get us out of here so I can
strangle that old magician

133
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,444
with his own entrails. "

134
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,647
That's definitely Cara.

135
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,849
Are there any tombs
within a league of here?

136
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,317
At the necropolis.

137
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,552
Where does Cormac live?

138
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:34,488
In a cottage
at the edge of the woods.

139
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,457
Go to his house.
Take some men.

140
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,627
See if there's anything that can
help us find Kahlan and Cara.

141
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,563
We're going to the necropolis.

142
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,434
Spread out,
search as many tombs as you can.

143
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,374
There must be
thousands of them.

144
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,677
The necropolis has been here
for centuries.

145
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,478
Hundreds more tombs
were added

146
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,414
over the course of the long
D'Haran war.

147
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:02,883
We'll do what we can, Seeker.

148
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,385
But I'm not sure we can find
one tomb among so many

149
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,487
before the sands run out.

150
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,919
There's another message
from Richard.

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,489
He wants us to look for anything
that'll help him

152
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,024
identify this particular tomb.

153
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,995
An engraving, an inscription...

154
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,964
I'll take this side.

155
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,269
Any luck?

156
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,037
Lt. Rankin's men
are searching the tombs.

157
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,839
But it's gonna take more time
than we have.

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,441
I was hoping
you'd found something.

159
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:45,445
Only the pieces
of a shattered life.

160
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:49,716
The table is still set
for five sons...

161
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,317
who will never return.

162
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,254
This man lost everything.

163
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,092
Except his grief.

164
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,999
Medals of valor.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,334
The highest honor we have.

166
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,038
Awarded to those
who died saving others.

167
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,973
These are
their lottery tiles.

168
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,030
What is it?

169
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,431
Could I see your tile?

170
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,672
They're the same weight.

171
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,906
Why shouldn't they be?

172
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,309
I held Erik's tile
in my hand.

173
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,744
His was heavier.

174
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,947
There's only one reason
to make some tiles

175
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,381
weigh more than the others...

176
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,084
To know which ones not to pick.

177
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,987
The lottery was rigged.

178
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,690
That's how the same five men
were never chosen.

179
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:06,993
Fortune didn't smile upon them.

180
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,629
The Duke did.

181
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,900
I served Duke Anders faithfully
all these years,

182
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,237
and risked death every day

183
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:21,274
in the war against Darken Rahl.

184
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,743
I saw men spill rivers of blood

185
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,280
to keep these lands safe.

186
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,651
All while those privileged brats

187
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,787
let others fight and die
in their place?

188
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:39,058
If killing a few cowards
will save the life

189
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,360
of the Mother Confessor,

190
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,794
you should run them through.

191
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,665
I understand your anger,
but I'm not giving in to Cormac.

192
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,101
If we run out of time,
you may not have a choice.

193
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,710
Have you found anything?

194
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,912
Nothing.

195
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,847
No marks.

196
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,582
No engravings.

197
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,219
Not even any bones.
It's-

198
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,488
It's all just rock.

199
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:12,025
We'd better tell Richard
we couldn't find anything.

200
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:31,411
"We can't find anything
in the tomb. "

201
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,981
But of course you can't.

202
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,084
But there's no need
for the Seeker to know that.

203
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,141
Kahlan and Cara
have found something.

204
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,110
It's an engraving.

205
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,645
That looks like a family crest.

206
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,081
But they haven't used those
since the Third Era.

207
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:09,949
They must be in one
of the older tombs.

208
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,285
There's a registry of those
tombs in the archives.

209
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,722
If we can find this symbol,
we can find Kahlan and Cara.

210
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,492
This is it.

211
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,448
This crypt is spelled.

212
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,017
Can you open it?

213
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,819
I can try, but it won't be easy.

214
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,317
Careful, Richard.
It could be a trap.

215
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,519
Kahlan!

216
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,021
Cara!

217
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,211
It's just a dead body.

218
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,685
Could there be another crypt
with these markings?

219
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,854
There was only one listed
in the registry.

220
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,323
Could one have been overlooked?
It's possible.

221
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,226
These tombs have been here
thousands of years.

222
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,861
Maybe the markings washed away.

223
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,464
Have your men focus their search
on tombs in this area.

224
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,609
Richard, wait!

225
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:30,116
It's too dark to track it.

226
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:32,285
I just wish I knew
what "it" was.

227
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,287
I think I do.

228
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:39,959
This has remnants
of dark sorcery.

229
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,894
The creature is called a Nygaax.

230
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:42,962
A Nygaax?

231
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,264
According to legend,
in ancient times,

232
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,834
those desperate for revenge
would pay a sorcerer

233
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:51,003
to wrap a living person
in bandages

234
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,639
infected with long-forgotten
magic, creating a creature

235
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,175
that would carry out
its master's bloodlust.

236
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,578
The Nygaax
is vengeance incarnate.

237
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,247
I've heard stories
of a Nygaax

238
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,850
that terrorized this area.

239
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,052
I thought they were just told
to scare children.

240
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,153
What stories?

241
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:10,289
Long ago, a feud broke out

242
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,625
between Dunshire's
two most prominent families.

243
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:16,796
The head of one family employed
a sorcerer to create a Nygaax

244
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,865
that massacred the other family.

245
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,501
The Nygaax claimed its victims
one by one,

246
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,436
and laid them
at its master's feet.

247
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,972
The way the story goes,

248
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,875
the carnage stopped
only when a wizard

249
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,877
sealed the creature in a crypt.

250
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:34,213
Cormac knew you were
too honorable to kill those men,

251
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:35,848
so he tricked us
into releasing it.

252
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,316
How do we stop it?

253
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,319
It can't be stopped. Only
controlled by a magical amulet,

254
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,787
which Cormac must have.

255
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:45,057
And he'll order it to go after
those men on the list.

256
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,627
We have to get to those men
before the Nygaax does.

257
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,255
I have a task for you.

258
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,600
This is pointless.

259
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:29,569
We've been at it
for hours.

260
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,270
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

261
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,272
We'll have run out of air

262
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:35,274
long before we dig our way
out of here.

263
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,813
It's not helping that these
torches are burning air

264
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:42,148
faster than we are.

265
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:45,051
Then we'll have to find a way
to snuff them out.

266
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,464
I can almost reach it.

267
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,732
Stand on your toes.

268
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,367
I am.

269
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,680
The torches are using less air
than we are

270
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:15,948
trying to knock them out.

271
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:21,821
Why would Cormac
have done this?

272
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:24,457
He was always
such a kind soul.

273
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,260
He must've found out
you rigged the lottery.

274
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:29,695
That's preposterous!

275
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,668
They're made
of lighter metal

276
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,404
than the tiles of the men
on the list.

277
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:42,375
Which is why they were never
chosen to fight.

278
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,976
Their tiles were heavier,

279
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:47,613
so you knew which ones
not to draw from the cauldron.

280
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:48,881
You could feel the difference.

281
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:58,057
How could you do this?

282
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:03,629
I loved you too much
to risk losing you.

283
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,831
Did Cormac love his sons
any less?

284
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:09,969
Erik, you're a virtuous man.

285
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,038
Educated.

286
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,974
One day you will be
a great leader.

287
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,709
Dunshire needs you alive

288
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,779
more than it needs
the son of a conjurer.

289
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:26,552
I knew Cormac's sons.

290
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,621
They were good men.

291
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:31,290
And they certainly didn't
deserve to die in my place.

292
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,394
And now your actions may cost
Kahlan and Cara their lives.

293
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:38,798
How can you judge me,
Wizard?

294
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,301
When you learned of the
impending massacre at Brennidon,

295
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:45,404
did you save every child
that was in danger?

296
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:46,772
Of course not.

297
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:49,408
You saved
the most important one. Him.

298
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:56,582
It may be distasteful to say,
but it is the truth.

299
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:01,287
Your life is worth more
than others.

300
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:03,656
Is it worth more than that
of the Mother Confessor?

301
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:06,492
Because that's who the Seeker
should be trying to save.

302
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,927
Not us.

303
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:11,063
We can do both
if we find Cormac.

304
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,899
We'll wait outside
and guard the entrance.

305
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,102
When the Nygaax comes for you
and the others,

306
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:17,436
we'll be waiting.

307
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:20,506
There may be a way we can make
it lead us back to Cormac.

308
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:23,709
Then we can force him to tell us
where Kahlan and Cara are.

309
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,044
But we'll have to do it quickly.

310
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,912
In the meantime,
bar all the doors.

311
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:28,381
Keep all the men
on the list safe.

312
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:30,683
That won't be possible.

313
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,718
Henrik didn't trust you, Seeker.

314
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,687
He was afraid you'd kill us

315
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,589
if you were desperate
to save your friends.

316
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,259
So he took a horse and fled.

317
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,462
He could be headed right
into the path of the Nygaax.

318
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:37,516
No! Please!

319
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:03,175
Help me.

320
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,317
Thank you for...

321
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:13,552
saving me
from the creature.

322
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,459
He's dead.

323
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:25,464
What did he mean, "thank you for
saving me from the creature"?

324
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,867
I'm not sure.

325
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,305
Zedd!

326
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:37,309
Zedd!

327
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,455
Zedd.

328
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,623
Zedd!

329
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:58,230
Zedd! You can fight this.

330
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:04,136
Zedd!

331
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:35,125
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

332
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,671
This man survived for centuries?

333
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:49,339
How is that possible?

334
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,809
The Nygaax's magic
is in the bandages.

335
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,511
They must've kept
this man alive.

336
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:57,347
Then there's a chance
to save the Wizard.

337
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:58,382
Yes.

338
00:24:58,383 --> 00:25:00,250
But the bandages only unwrapped

339
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:02,085
once the man trapped inside
was dying.

340
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:06,323
We need to find a way to free
Zedd without killing him.

341
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,724
Warn the Duke.

342
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,426
Tell him what happened here.

343
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:12,763
And if they try to kill the
Nygaax, they'll only kill Zedd.

344
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:15,432
And Kahlan and Cara?

345
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:16,767
They don't have much time.

346
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,802
Which is why
we need to find Cormac.

347
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,504
He's the only one who knows
where they are.

348
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:23,273
We'll follow the creature's
tracks back to him.

349
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:25,242
How can you be sure it's headed
back to Cormac?

350
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:27,811
It took Henrik's body.
According to your story,

351
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:30,247
it lays its victims
at its master's feet.

352
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:40,057
The Wizard shouldn't have tried
to stop you.

353
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:42,626
But you've done well.

354
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:48,365
Now continue your task, and
bring me the other four cowards.

355
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:04,581
The air's getting thinner.

356
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:12,122
There's one way to double
how long it lasts.

357
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,061
Kill me.

358
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:23,633
Has the lack of air
driven you mad?

359
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:26,803
It could give Richard the time
he needs to find us.

360
00:26:26,804 --> 00:26:29,072
And when he does, you can give
me the Breath of Life.

361
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,312
As tempting as the offer
to kill you may be...

362
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,282
Richard would never forgive me
if I let you die.

363
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:42,119
But I'd only be dead
for a short time.

364
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,787
And then you could
bring me back.

365
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:44,921
It's too big a risk.

366
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:46,757
We don't know how long

367
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:49,159
it's gonna take Richard
to find us.

368
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,898
But there is another way.

369
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,071
I'll die instead.

370
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:03,673
I can't bring you back.

371
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:05,876
But you can live.

372
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:09,613
Cara, no.

373
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:11,448
If you die
your death would be final.

374
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,186
Better one of us
than both of us.

375
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:21,491
I'm sorry
I've disappointed you.

376
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:23,994
But I did what I thought
was best for Dunshire.

377
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:26,596
And how much did your
rich friends pay you

378
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:28,765
to keep their sons
out of the army?

379
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:32,035
So you did do it for money.

380
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:35,305
What, you think it was for me?

381
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:39,976
All these years of war against
D'Hara emptied our coffers.

382
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,280
That money was used to equip our
soldiers with weapons and armor.

383
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:46,116
We didn't stand a chance against
the D'Harans without it.

384
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,518
My parents' gold
bought a lot of steel.

385
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,053
You knew?

386
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:53,523
Don't be so naive, Erik.

387
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:55,759
You thought it was
just a coincidence

388
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,195
year after year we were spared?

389
00:27:58,196 --> 00:28:00,897
I thought we were lucky.

390
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:03,633
We were.
To be born of privilege.

391
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:08,505
What's done is done.

392
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:12,008
Just be thankful you're alive-

393
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:14,678
Please...

394
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,647
Help.

395
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,326
Gareth!

396
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,728
No! No.

397
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,563
No, it's too late.

398
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,669
Don't move.

399
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,876
Where are Kahlan and Cara?

400
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,544
I'll tell you that...

401
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:49,613
once these graves
are filled.

402
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:52,015
You got what you wanted.
The Nygaax is free.

403
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:54,518
Now let Kahlan and Cara go.

404
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,888
I'm sorry, Seeker,
your friends are too powerful.

405
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:02,192
If I release them, they'll only
help you protect those cowards.

406
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:04,928
More bloodshed
won't bring your sons back.

407
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:07,998
They were good boys.

408
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:14,171
So brave.

409
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:16,173
They knew Dunshire
didn't stand a chance

410
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:18,909
against the D'Haran army.

411
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,747
When their tiles were drawn,
I begged them to run away.

412
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:26,449
But they refused.

413
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,086
They said it was their duty
to keep Dunshire free.

414
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,822
I saw their medals.

415
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:34,391
They were heroes.

416
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:37,194
They died
protecting others.

417
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:43,033
But by threatening the lives
of my friends,

418
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:45,402
you're dishonoring
what your sons fought for.

419
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:48,238
If you protect those cowards,
you're doing the same.

420
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,408
Don't worry, Seeker.

421
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:54,044
The blood won't be
on your hands.

422
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:58,014
And the Nygaax won't be taking
anymore lives, either.

423
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:01,751
You can't stop it.

424
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:03,687
I can with this.

425
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:06,289
I'm afraid not.

426
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,026
Only I know the incantations
which control the Nygaax.

427
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:12,829
And you're going to tell them
to me.

428
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,065
No.

429
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,934
I'm going to join my sons.

430
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,109
What is it?

431
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,345
This must be the Wandering Dust
Cormac used

432
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,880
to abduct Kahlan and Cara.

433
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,481
What if we used it?

434
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:48,883
Could it take us to them?

435
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:51,218
If Zedd were here,
he'd know how to use it.

436
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,553
But without the right spell,

437
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,288
who knows where
it would send us.

438
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,275
This is how Cormac
tricked us into thinking

439
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:17,044
we were writing
to Kahlan and Cara.

440
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,180
He got messages from them
in one book,

441
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,514
and then wrote to us
using the other.

442
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,656
Do you recognize this?

443
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,124
It's a map of the necropolis.

444
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,560
This area is marked.

445
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,895
That must be the tomb
where Kahlan and Cara are.

446
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:40,201
You were right.

447
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:43,771
About what?

448
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:50,077
You once told me
that it's a hard world,

449
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:53,280
and that we don't get many
chances to tell people

450
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,015
how much they mean to us.

451
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,223
There's no one a Mord'Sith
should hate more

452
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,358
than a Confessor.

453
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:11,832
I was trained to hate you.

454
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:17,204
But I don't.

455
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:23,577
And I don't want to die
without you knowing...

456
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:30,151
that I consider you
to be my friend.

457
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:39,660
I think of you
as a friend too.

458
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,608
We're going to get out of here.

459
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,877
We both know Richard.

460
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,846
He's coming for us.

461
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,981
He just needs
a little more time.

462
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,184
I know.

463
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:06,187
And I'm going to make sure
he gets it.

464
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,024
Cara, no!

465
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:15,396
Get out of my way.

466
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:20,134
No.

467
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:55,703
Stop pretending my life
means as much as yours.

468
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,922
Line the hall
and connect each fuse

469
00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:16,323
so that they run
into the courtyard.

470
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,993
And hurry!
We don't have much time!

471
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:23,831
What are you doing?

472
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,166
Dragon's Breath?

473
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,202
We know the Nygaax
will be coming back

474
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:29,803
for the rest of the men
on the list.

475
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:32,373
But to get inside, the creature
must come through here.

476
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:35,576
And when it does,
those doors will be barricaded

477
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,278
and sealed with mortar.

478
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:39,246
The Nygaax will be trapped
in here,

479
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:40,948
and then we'll blow it
into the underworld.

480
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,950
But you'll kill the Wizard
along with it.

481
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,085
Yes, but you'll be safe.

482
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,154
These men are going to take you
far from this place.

483
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,556
But you must leave now.

484
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:50,190
I won't go along with this.

485
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,927
I'm not giving you a choice.

486
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:07,074
Come.
You'll be safe inside.

487
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:19,687
There's... no air...

488
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,589
left.

489
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:05,573
Kahlan!

490
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,776
Cara!

491
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:10,245
Are you all right?

492
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:12,914
We are now.

493
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:17,452
I knew you'd find us
in time.

494
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:20,522
I'm fine.

495
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,959
Where's Zedd?

496
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,604
Go, go.

497
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:54,222
Quick, the fuse. Light it. Now.

498
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:03,031
If we have such a long journey
ahead of us,

499
00:37:03,032 --> 00:37:05,800
can I at least have
a drink of water?

500
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,489
Get away from the door!

501
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,331
The Seeker.

502
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:39,434
Seeker, you have to get away
from here.

503
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:41,669
We've trapped the Nygaax.

504
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,772
We're going to destroy it
with Dragon's Breath.

505
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:45,173
You'll kill Zedd!

506
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:47,842
Stop him!

507
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,151
Put your weapons down.

508
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:58,052
You heard the Mother Confessor.
Do it.

509
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,295
If the person inside
the bandages is dying,

510
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:08,830
they'll urap themselves.

511
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,231
If you use your Agiels
to bring Zedd

512
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:12,233
to the brink of death,
he'll be freed.

513
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:13,768
The bandages can't attack
a Mord'Sith.

514
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,637
You repel their magic.

515
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:17,739
And once Zedd's free,
maybe he can burn them.

516
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,461
Cara, now!

517
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,536
Make sure you don't kill him!

518
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,905
No! We must kill it.

519
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:53,908
No!

520
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,749
Father!

521
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:19,067
Zedd,
are you all right?

522
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:25,707
Erik, get out of here!

523
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:26,975
It wants me.

524
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,443
It'll follow me
back to the crypt.

525
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:30,044
Seal us inside and end this!

526
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,814
Erik, no!

527
00:39:58,107 --> 00:40:00,842
Zedd! Seal us in now!

528
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,977
No! Get out of here,
Richard!

529
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:13,421
Now we'll both die.

530
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:29,671
<i>Appreataro!</i>

531
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:40,014
The crypt is sealed.

532
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,517
The Nygaax can never
be freed again.

533
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,122
I'm sorry about your father,
Erik.

534
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:52,293
You should have let it
kill me.

535
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:54,228
And what would that have
accomplished?

536
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,500
My debt would be paid to those
who died in my place.

537
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,104
But your people would be left
without a leader.

538
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,773
How can I lead?

539
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:07,642
The people won't follow
a coward.

540
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:10,678
No. They won't.

541
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:15,550
But they will follow a man who
is willing to sacrifice himself

542
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:16,784
to save others.

543
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,702
You were wrong before.

544
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,004
Back in the tomb.

545
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:39,440
Your life is just
as important as mine is.

546
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,509
If it weren't for you,

547
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,911
we wouldn't have been able
to free Zedd from the Nygaax.

548
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,016
About what I said
back in the tomb...

549
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:52,353
It- It really meant
a lot to me.

550
00:41:52,354 --> 00:41:53,755
Forget I said it.

551
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:55,690
I was delirious
from the lack of air.

552
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:04,932
Is she all right?

553
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:07,235
She's... Cara.

554
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,106
I'm sorry you didn't get
a night of fun.

555
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:13,508
Not even on your birthday.

556
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:17,278
Well, you sure know how
to throw a party.

557
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:18,713
Can't wait to see what you do
next year.
