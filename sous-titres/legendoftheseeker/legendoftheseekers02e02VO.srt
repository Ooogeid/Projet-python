1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,835
The prophecy says
that the seeker

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,036
<i>Will defeat darken rahl.</i>

3
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:07,038
Thanks to the seeker,
that monster is dead

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,940
<i>And rotting for all eternity
in the underworld.</i>

5
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,609
Kneel before the keeper.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,611
Forgive me, master.
I have failed you.

7
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,546
No, you have succeeded

8
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,147
<i>Exactly as I intended.</i>

9
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:17,349
It's a tear in the veil

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,217
That separates the underworld
from the living.

11
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,552
This happened
when I killed rahl.

12
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,020
As long as it's open
there's no way

13
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,555
To prevent the keeper
of the underworld

14
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,423
<i>From sending his minions
to bring death</i>

15
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:26,958
<i>To every living thing.</i>

16
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,059
The only way to close the rift

17
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,828
Is the way the creator
sealed the underworld.

18
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,430
The stone of tears.
We'll find it.

19
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,032
Seek out the abbot of ulrich,

20
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,201
<i>For he keeps the secret of
the stone close to his heart.</i>

21
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,004
She's the one who helped me
kill darken rahl.

22
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,605
She did it to save
her own skin.

23
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,274
If you're foolish enough
to turn down

24
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,542
The throne of d'hara,
then you need me all the more.

25
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,710
If this is some sort of trick,

26
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,878
I will kill you.

27
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,147
Mark of the keeper.

28
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:51,716
The one who would
destroy all life.

29
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:56,454
Richard cypher,
you are the true seeker.

Season 02 Episode 2 
"Baneling"

32
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,278
Thanks for letting me
borrow this.

33
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:24,416
Although I can't say it helped
me sleep more soundly.

34
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,817
It's gonna take a while
to get used

35
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:28,253
To having
a mord-sith in camp.

36
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,855
Well, if richard trusts cara,

37
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,559
I suppose we'll have
to learn to as well.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,808
Does it hurt?

39
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,975
It's nothing.

40
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,082
The spirit of the tyrant
you killed

41
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,249
Comes back from the grave

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,886
And burns the mark of the keeper
in your chest?

43
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,489
It's not nothing, richard.

44
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,094
I wish I knew
what it meant.

45
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,229
What we do know is that we need
to seal the rift

46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,997
Between this world
and the underworld.

47
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:15,233
And to do that, we need to find
the stone of tears,

48
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:20,372
And to find the stone, we need
to get to the abbot of ulrich.

49
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,223
It must have burned at least
three months ago.

50
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,658
These weeds
are at least that old.

51
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,893
D'harans did this.

52
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,729
Then where are the corpses?

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,930
If the abbot isn't here,

54
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,999
Then we've come a long way
for nothing.

55
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,303
If d'harans did this,

56
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,339
And they didn't
kill the monks,

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,974
Where would they
have taken them?

58
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,810
From here, they would have been
taken to tothrayne.

59
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,745
What's tothrayne?

60
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:03,581
A death camp.

61
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,197
No, please, no!

62
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,099
I have a son!

63
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,169
The war is over!

64
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,337
I don't want to die!

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,815
Move! The faster
you get this loaded,

66
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,716
The faster
you'll get your reward.

67
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,332
General, why are we still

68
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,301
Executing prisoners?

69
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,803
The war is over.

70
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:02,674
We should be getting
far away from this place.

71
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,377
You've heard the reports
of reprisals against d'harans.

72
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,280
The best way to ensure
there are no reprisals

73
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,382
For what's been done here

74
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,818
Is to make certain that no one
lives to tell the tale.

75
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,021
Don't worry, commander.

76
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,692
We'll take this treasure
and we'll be faaway from here

77
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,895
By the time anyone comes
looking for retribution.

78
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,170
Just as soon as we've finished
the task at hand.

79
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,105
Stay there!

80
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,047
And now
here's your reward.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,021
All right,
I'll do you a favor.

82
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,623
I'll leave it loose.

83
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,558
You'll take longer to die.

84
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,400
The seeker. Kill him!

85
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,549
Thanks for the favor.

86
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,053
Bless you, seeker.

87
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,824
We're looking
for the abbot of ulrich.

88
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:09,427
We believe
he was brought here.

89
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,531
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about the abbot.

90
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,067
There are children here
we have to free.

91
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,737
The d'harans didn't just come
for resistance fighters.

92
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,905
They took our families too.

93
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,507
Where are they?

94
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,777
Come. I'll show you.

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,647
it's all right.

96
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,382
You're safe.

97
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,285
I need to find my son.

98
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,620
What's his name?

99
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,222
William. I'm eleanor.

100
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,591
Don't worry.
I'll help you find him.

101
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,794
Mother!

102
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,396
William! William!

103
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:46,631
Oh!

104
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,938
I thought I'd lost you.

105
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,542
Oh, thank the spirits
you're safe!

106
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,613
The abbot of ulrich.

107
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,415
He was brought here.

108
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,150
Where is he?

109
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,854
The general had him
executed yesterday.

110
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,791
I tried to stop
the executions.

111
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,728
You didn't try hard enough.

112
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,063
We all lived in fear
of the general.

113
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,699
There's a reason
that we called him the butcher.

114
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,801
If we hadn't
followed his orders

115
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,336
It would've been our necks
in nooses.

116
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,772
It may still be.

117
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,608
But that's for
the mother confessor to decide.

118
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,513
Lock them in the cells.

119
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,184
We came here
for the abbot.

120
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:42,120
He's dead.

121
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,088
There's no reason
for us to stay.

122
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,357
Look at these people.

123
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,426
They're sick, they're scared.

124
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,794
They have no place to go.

125
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,729
We can't just
leave them here.

126
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,933
There's already enough sickness
in this place.

127
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:01,706
Let's bury these bodies
before it gets any worse.

128
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,530
Lord rahl?

129
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:03,100
You served me well in life,
general.

130
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,271
It is my hope that you will
do the same for the keeper,

131
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,006
Now that you are dead.

132
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,342
I don't understand.

133
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:12,810
It's quite simple.

134
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,613
The keeper of the underworld

135
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,583
Wants to make you an offer.

136
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:30,924
Those of you
that are well enough

137
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,259
To travel are free to leave,
but those of you that aren't,

138
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,695
We'll be making a camp
just outside the prison.

139
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,034
If these prisoners are going
to gain their strength back,

140
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:43,269
We're gonna have to feed them
something more substantial

141
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,173
Than d'haran gruel.
Should we draw them warm baths?

142
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:49,676
Do you know of anyone heading
in the direction of deerfork?

143
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,864
The dragon corps wiped out
deerfork months ago.

144
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,716
But that's
my father's village.

145
00:10:56,717 --> 00:11:00,253
We'll try to find out where
the survivors have relocated.

146
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:02,855
Deerfork was a resistance
stronghold.

147
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,358
No one would've been
left alive.

148
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,394
My father wasn't
a resistance fighter.

149
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,830
He was just a locksmith.

150
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:12,932
That would've made no difference
to the dragon corps.

151
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,469
Where will we go?

152
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,339
The rest of my family
died here.

153
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:27,013
I am so sorry
for your loss.

154
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,749
But you need to be strong
for your son.

155
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,318
We'll see what we can find out
about your father.

156
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,859
You shouldn't give her
false hope.

157
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:43,796
It wasn't so long ago

158
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,798
That you served the one
who caused all this misery.

159
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,801
At least try to show
some compassion.

160
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:53,005
Come with me.

161
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:01,681
I checked the store rooms.

162
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,150
There's barely enough
to feed the rats.

163
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,113
How can there be this many
people with no food?

164
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:09,123
When the war ended,
supply shipments stopped.

165
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,160
What food there was
went to the guards.

166
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,259
The d'harans would sooner
put a knife in our bellies

167
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,345
Than a hot meal.
I'm sending cara out

168
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,160
To get provisions.

169
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,464
Hopefully there'll be enough
for everyone.

170
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,132
Move.

171
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,703
Everyone?

172
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:28,007
We'd have more if we didn't have
so many mouths to feed.

173
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,309
The d'harans will be brought
to justice,

174
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,511
But we're not gonna
starve them to get it.

175
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,314
Yes, mother confessor.

176
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,251
I need a horse.

177
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:45,992
We need the horses
to get provisions.

178
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:48,728
You can bury him outside
with the others.

179
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:51,530
I'm not burying my brother

180
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,299
Alongside the d'harans
who killed him.

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,668
He should be laid to rest
beside our mother and father.

182
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,570
We're going to need fresh water.

183
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,372
My village is half a day's ride.

184
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,507
I'll have the horse back
to you by morning.

185
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:02,775
Check on the sister.

186
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,013
Do it quickly.

187
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:14,387
I'm so sorry for your loss.

188
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:35,441
Seeker?

189
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,546
I heard you were looking
for abbot henry.

190
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,684
I was a member of his order.

191
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,986
We need to confide in you
a great secret.

192
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,354
There's been a tear
in the veil

193
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,156
Between this world
and the underworld.

194
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:53,259
The keeper is waging war
on the land of the living.

195
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,795
He's using the rift to send
horrible creatures

196
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,063
Into our world.

197
00:13:57,064 --> 00:13:59,498
And the only way
to close this rift

198
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,600
Is for us to find
the stone of tears.

199
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,703
We were told that abbot henry
had knowledge

200
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,504
Of the secret location
of the stone.

201
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:09,508
The abbots of our order
always wore a locket.

202
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,244
It has a rose inscribed
on its face

203
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:15,114
And it was passed down
from abbot to abbot.

204
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,017
Shota said the abbot would keep
the secret close to his heart.

205
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,953
The d'harans took the locket

206
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,955
When they brought us
to this awful place.

207
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:27,493
We lived in peace until
the d'harans came.

208
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,762
Seize the abbot.

209
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:30,863
What is this?

210
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:32,932
What is the meaning of this?

211
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:33,966
You have no authority here.

212
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:37,570
There's no need for this.

213
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:38,971
We're men of peace.

214
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,409
No! No! Please!

215
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,811
Please! That's sacred!

216
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,446
Anything taken from the abbot

217
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,048
<i>Would've been kept
with the valuables</i>

218
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,717
<i>We took from the other
prisoners.</i>

219
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:55,221
It was the butcher's plan
to escape with the treasure.

220
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:56,889
To disappear,

221
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,227
And use it to make new lives
for himself and his men.

222
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,062
Now the treasure can help us
give the prisoners

223
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,965
Their lives back. Open it.

224
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,426
I've seen him before.

225
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:12,865
A man came to the stables

226
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,568
Asking for a horse so he could
take his brother to be buried.

227
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,570
Apparently he took
the treasure instead.

228
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,671
And you believed
his story?

229
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:24,076
The confessor told me
I had to show more compassion.

230
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,679
Are you saying
this is my fault?

231
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,347
Yes.

232
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:31,083
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

233
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,384
We need to find him.

234
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,322
I came to give them some food.

235
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:51,136
Did you see who did this?

236
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:56,976
It was the butcher.

237
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:02,781
He's come back
from the grave.

238
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:10,548
Quickly, everyone get inside.

239
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,817
This way.

240
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:20,825
Is it true
what they're saying?

241
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:23,461
That the butcher
killed those people?

242
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:25,363
I don't know.

243
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:26,831
But you'll be safe
inside the prison.

244
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,069
We need to set up a guard
through the night,

245
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,604
Make sure no one
gets in or out.

246
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:34,839
I can take first watch.

247
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,743
Keep the doors locked.
Keep everyone inside.

248
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:39,977
That won't stop him.

249
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,813
I got to see what
the butcher was capable of

250
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,581
When he killed my friends.

251
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:45,116
If he has come back
to take his revenge,

252
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,518
He won't stop
until he's killed us all.

253
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,087
Whoever it is,
we'll keep them out.

254
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:51,589
But just in case.

255
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,435
I've looked everywhere.

256
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:07,071
There's no sign of whoever
murdered these men.

257
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,073
Is it possible
the rumors are true?

258
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,641
The butcher's come back
from the grave?

259
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:12,743
Like darken rahl did.

260
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:14,912
Darken rahl was just a spirit.

261
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,248
Spirits don't have bodies.

262
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,818
They can't pick up knives
and slaughter people.

263
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,187
Well, we're going to find
who did.

264
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,755
In the meantime,

265
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,191
I need you to find the man
who stole the abbot's locket.

266
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,527
He can't
have gotten far.

267
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,798
I don't want him tortured
or killed.

268
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,199
Bring him back alive.

269
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,069
I'll do my best.

270
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,740
If this butcher's escaped
from the grave,

271
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:46,244
I'd like to see it
for myself.

272
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,720
Someone dug him up.

273
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:58,022
No.

274
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,624
He clawed his way out.

275
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,803
So did the rest
of the d'harans we buried.

276
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,344
Could this be the work
of the keeper?

277
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,512
Darken rahl?

278
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:24,282
It's possible.

279
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:29,687
Who else could bring
the dead back to life?

280
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:32,123
The mord-sith.

281
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,327
Cara's with us now.

282
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:38,562
Why would she come all this way
to resurrect some d'harans

283
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:39,897
With the breath of life?

284
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:43,301
She served rahl
and fought side-by-side

285
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,202
With the d'harans for years.

286
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:47,405
Cara helped me defeat rahl.

287
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:48,673
That should earn her
some trust.

288
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:56,180
Whoever did this,
however it happened,

289
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:57,481
We have a big problem.

290
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,054
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

291
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,092
We have to find them first.

292
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:15,299
I'm not here to harm you.
Who are you?

293
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,269
I am abbot henry.

294
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,875
The d'harans told us
that you had been hung.

295
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,612
After the d'harans
executed me,

296
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:31,482
I awoke in the underworld.

297
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:36,921
<i>In a pit of unimaginable
suffering,</i>

298
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:41,125
<i>I was greeted
by darken rahl himself.</i>

299
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,660
Rahl?

300
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:47,164
He told me that the keeper
wished to make me an offer.

301
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:52,970
He would allow me to return
to the land of the living,

302
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,840
But he demanded
an awful price.

303
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,511
In exchange
for letting me live again,

304
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:06,484
I had to agree
to kill for the keeper.

305
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,653
He made you a baneling.

306
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:15,159
Banelings are dead souls

307
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,862
Who selfishly bargain
for a second life

308
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:21,599
In exchange for killing others.

309
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,601
I thought they were
just a legend.

310
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,036
So did I,

311
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:27,471
But it seems the keeper
is using the tear in the veil

312
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,507
To give the dead a chance

313
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,442
To return to the world
of the living.

314
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:34,078
I guess the butcher and his men
accepted his offer.

315
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:39,316
So can anyone who die
become a baneling?

316
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:41,352
Maybe not.

317
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:44,155
Maybe only
in places like tothrayne.

318
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:47,091
The veil between our world
and the underworld

319
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,894
Is weakest in places
of great death.

320
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,862
The rift is growing.

321
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:53,397
If we don't close it soon,

322
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,366
The keeper could send banelings
back anywhere.

323
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:01,272
We need to find
the stone of tears

324
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,340
To close the rift in the veil.

325
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,843
Brother bertrand told us
that the secret of the stone

326
00:22:05,844 --> 00:22:07,311
Was inside your locket.

327
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:09,280
Yes.

328
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:12,983
That's why I had to take
the keeper's offer.

329
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:17,755
To reclaim the locket and ensure
the stone's location

330
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:19,356
Wasn't lost forever.

331
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,559
Well, we're trying to find
the locket right now.

332
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:24,929
what's wrong?

333
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:32,303
I haven't fulfilled my end
of the keeper's bargain.

334
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:37,208
I haven't killed anyone yet.

335
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:41,045
I'm being called back
to the underworld.

336
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:53,691
Tell us what we need to do
with the locket.

337
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,926
I spent years learning
the rituals I would need

338
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:57,828
To pass on to you.

339
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,231
There's simply not enough time.

340
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,769
Well, we have to buy you time.

341
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:09,173
How?

342
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:14,211
You have to kill someone.

343
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:30,261
I'm not sure I can do this.

344
00:23:30,262 --> 00:23:31,662
You'll be killing a d'haran

345
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:34,064
Guilty of horrible crimes.

346
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:37,468
It may be the only way
to defeat the keeper.

347
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:53,384
They're already dead.

348
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,211
We have to find someone else
for him to kill.

349
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,080
There's no time.

350
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,684
You must listen to me.

351
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,888
The locket contains
a runescriber.

352
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,492
The magic imprints a rune

353
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,761
Onto the palm
of the one who opens it.

354
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:30,034
You must take the rune
to the province of pamorah.

355
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,170
The rune is the key

356
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,372
That will open the--

357
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,131
What about me?

358
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,735
Don't I get any?

359
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,005
Oh, there's plenty
to go around.

360
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,717
Sorry to interrupt.

361
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,986
I know you're mourning
the loss of your brother.

362
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,856
We all grieve
in our own way.

363
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,999
Where's the treasure?

364
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,469
I'm not afraid of you.

365
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,039
Do you know what horrible things
they did to me at tothrayne?

366
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,507
Intimately.

367
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:46,410
I didn't break when
they put me on the rack

368
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,245
Or when they threw me
in the drowning pool,

369
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,515
Or when they spun me
on the wheel of pain.

370
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,418
Torture me all you want.

371
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,253
You'll be wasting
your time.

372
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,923
Oh, I don't want
to torture you.

373
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,358
I have other ways
of loosening your tongue.

374
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:08,465
After the awful way
they treated you in that place,

375
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,000
I can see why you would hire
those women

376
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,468
To bring you some comfort.

377
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,806
But I'll do things to you
those women can't even imagine.

378
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,144
Many know of a mord-sith's
ability to bring pain,

379
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:24,214
But few know we are equally
skilled at bringing pleasure.

380
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,920
First, I'm going to...

381
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,332
And then I'll...

382
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,576
But first
you need to tell me where--

383
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,878
In a cave
three leagues outside town.

384
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,313
At the fork in the river.

385
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,249
Get dressed.

386
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,185
But I told you
where the treasure was.

387
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,953
Take me to it.

388
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,255
Now.

389
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,658
What about that thing
you were going to do?

390
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,227
And that other thing
sounded good too.

391
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,098
All right, all right.
Just the first thing, then.

392
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,038
The rune is the key,
but a key to what?

393
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,602
We have no idea what to do
with it once we get there.

394
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:19,567
We have a bigger problem:

395
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,381
The butcher and his men are
out somewhere

396
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:22,283
And they need to kill.

397
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,210
But who killed these men?

398
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,629
The butcher wouldn't bother
with a locked cell

399
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:30,577
When there's much easier prey
within these walls.

400
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:33,250
Who else would
want them dead?

401
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,953
I'm sure any prisoner would want
revenge against the d'harans.

402
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:42,674
But only one of them
had keys to the cells.

403
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:44,100
Who?

404
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:45,531
A prisoner.

405
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,131
A resistance fighter.

406
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,832
Find him.

407
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,698
What's stopping
these dead d'harans

408
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:56,380
From taking the keeper's deal

409
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,443
And becoming banelings
themselves?

410
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,789
You said banelings are creatures
of the flesh.

411
00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:08,324
When their souls return to this
world, they need a body.

412
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,320
What are you thinking?

413
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,190
We burn them, zedd.

414
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,811
Richard.

415
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,850
This is what
you're looking for.

416
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,523
Did you open this?

417
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,925
Answer me.

418
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,526
Yes.

419
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,862
Some strange ink came out
and did this.

420
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,965
What?

421
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,669
You've been marked
by powerful magic, boy.

422
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,838
We have to take him
with us to pamorah.

423
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,372
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

424
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,878
Take him to kahlan.
Have her confess him.

425
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,547
No. We don't know how
the confessor's touch

426
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,449
Will affect the rune's magic.

427
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,352
Seems this is worth
quite a bit to you.

428
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,854
At least as much
as the treasure.

429
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,790
You want me to go with you
to this pamorah?

430
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,958
It'll cost you.

431
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,659
You're not getting
the treasure.

432
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,395
Well, then, I guess I'm not
going anywhere.

433
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,397
And this hand goes
where I go.

434
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,032
Not if I cut it off.

435
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,002
When do we leave?

436
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,737
Lock him
in the warden's office

437
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,005
Until we deal
with the banelings.

438
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,851
You know,
this would be a good place

439
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,419
For you to keep up
your end of our bargain.

440
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,291
Hey. Hey!

441
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,562
Hey! Hey!

442
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,900
Our thief won't be going
anywhere without us.

443
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,434
You brought him back
without a scratch.

444
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,803
How'd you manage that?

445
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,005
I have other methods.

446
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,641
What kind of methods?

447
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,113
Well, however you did it,

448
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,414
It's good work.

449
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,650
Did you expect anything less?

450
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,852
I'm just glad to have you
on our side.

451
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,720
Maybe you can tell
zedd and kahlan

452
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,156
That they can stop sleeping with
weapons under their pillows.

453
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,095
The d'haran guards
were killed on your watch.

454
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,364
I gave you keys
to the cells and a weapon.

455
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:37,301
You wanted revenge
for the death of your friends?

456
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,737
I won't lie to you,
mother confessor.

457
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,539
After what they did
to my friends,

458
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm not sorry
they're dead.

459
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,943
I'm just sorry I wasn't
the one who did it.

460
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,317
I believe you.

461
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,687
Which means there's still
a killer out there.

462
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,046
Look, you can let me out.

463
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,682
I'm not going to try
to escape.

464
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,234
I'll go with you
to this pamorah.

465
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,650
He's dead.

466
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:06,691
He was the key
to the stone of tears.

467
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,056
Please, don't hurt me.

468
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,528
There's nothing to fear here.

469
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,049
Where am I?

470
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,165
In the underworld.

471
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,438
I-- I'm dead?

472
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,173
Yes.

473
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,309
But you don't have
to remain that way.

474
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,413
All the keeper asks is that
in exchange for life,

475
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,882
You kill for him.

476
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:58,418
No, please!

477
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,388
You bear the rune.

478
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,566
No!

479
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:21,074
Are you all right?
Can you talk?

480
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:27,147
I-- I thought I was dead.

481
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:28,248
I brought you back.

482
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:32,786
You're welcome.

483
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:39,793
I saw darken rahl.

484
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,063
Darken rahl?

485
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,198
Who stabbed you?

486
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,302
At first I couldn't figure out

487
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:53,340
How you got into a locked cell
to kill the d'harans.

488
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:56,343
But then I remembered.

489
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:58,745
You're the daughter
of a locksmith.

490
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:04,017
You must have died
before we arrived.

491
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:06,920
I only accepted
the keeper's offer

492
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,922
So that I could
watch over william.

493
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:13,526
This war has already made
so many orphans.

494
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,528
I couldn't bear the thought
of my son

495
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:19,766
Being so alone
and helpless.

496
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:24,371
I had to keep killing
to satisfy the keeper.

497
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:28,108
But after what
the d'harans did to us,

498
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,576
They deserved it.

499
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:32,445
And when you ran out
of d'harans?

500
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,850
Wouldn't you kill to protect
the ones you love?

501
00:34:42,857 --> 00:34:46,159
You know we can't let you
kill any more people.

502
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:52,265
Promise me

503
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:56,269
That you'll make sure
my william is safe.

504
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,929
We need to get to the armory and
grab every weapon we can find.

505
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,764
And how will we find
the butcher and his men?

506
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:26,533
Well, they need to kill.

507
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:28,568
They'll go where they can find
the easiest prey.

508
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:48,655
That's the last of them.

509
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:50,523
We'll need more.

510
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:54,294
Then we'll head north.

511
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:56,596
I have a more important task
for you, general.

512
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,032
My lord.

513
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,837
You must capture the one who
bears the rune of pamorah.

514
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,940
Tell me where
I can find him.

515
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,008
He's in tothrayne.

516
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:12,479
But my lord,
the seeker is there.

517
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,116
Then you don't have much time.

518
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:19,219
The runebearer is the key
to finding the stone of tears.

519
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,387
If the seeker
should acquire the stone,

520
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,691
Then the rift between
the two worlds will be closed,

521
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:28,495
And all of you returned
to the underworld.

522
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,230
I will not fail you.

523
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,767
Kahlan is keeping
everyone safe.

524
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,452
You, cara and I are going
to track the banelings.

525
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:37,774
And when we find them?

526
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:40,260
We trap them and burn them.

527
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,718
We're not gonna
need the horses.

528
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,372
Give us the one
who bears the rune.

529
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:12,948
Again!
Put your backs into it, men!

530
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:16,818
When flynn was in
the underworld,

531
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,086
Rahl must've seen the rune.

532
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:19,712
He must know it's the key
to the stone of tears.

533
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:20,463
These walls are strong.

534
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:22,242
If the banelings can't
get to us, they can't kill

535
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,855
And they'll die again.

536
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,750
He'll just send his men
to find more victims.

537
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,867
They'll grown stronger out there
while we grow weaker in here.

538
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,208
They're not gonna stop
until they get in.

539
00:37:31,744 --> 00:37:33,560
Well, if they want in,
we'll let them come.

540
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,948
And what about kahlan
and all the others?

541
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:37,528
We'll get them out the back way.

542
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,698
This is a prison.
There is no back way.

543
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,600
We can make one.

544
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,954
Quickly!
Let's go, come on.

545
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:54,723
Hang on.

546
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,424
Hurry.

547
00:37:58,628 --> 00:37:59,995
Come on.

548
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:13,208
They've all gone.

549
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,209
Not all of us.

550
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:23,685
Welcome back to tothrayne.

551
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,658
After all the suffering

552
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,593
These people have been through,

553
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,595
Now they'll have a chance
to rebuild their lives.

554
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,464
Zedd's already helping them
with that.

555
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:14,602
That's for you.

556
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,770
Thank you.

557
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,806
For your family.

558
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,040
Thank you.

559
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,475
You know,

560
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:22,844
It's a long road to pamorah.

561
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:24,946
It could get
a little lonely.

562
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,414
You're right.

563
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:32,153
It is a long road
to pamorah.

564
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,490
aah!

565
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:37,258
And if you want to make
it there in one piece,

566
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:39,427
You won't try my patience.

567
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:41,596
The seeker said
you needed me alive.

568
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,631
Yes.

569
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,568
But he didn't say
you had to be comfortable.

570
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:02,917
William, this is bertrand.

571
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:05,019
He's gonna take you
to a place called timberfalls.

572
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,689
There's a family there
that can't wait to meet you.

573
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,891
I think
you'll like it there.

574
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,393
Lots of children
to play with.

575
00:40:11,394 --> 00:40:13,695
Does that sound all right?

576
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,671
Thank you. Goodbye.

577
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:49,197
Now I know what rahl meant

578
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,965
When he said I was marked
for the keeper.

579
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:54,803
With every person I kill,

580
00:40:54,804 --> 00:40:57,672
I'm giving the keeper another
soldier to add to his army.

581
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:04,012
Killing my enemies
only makes him stronger.

582
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:06,514
It's not just your enemies.

583
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:08,283
It's people like eleanor.

584
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:10,652
Good people desperate enough
to accept the keeper's offer.

585
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:15,523
He's using their desire for life
to create more death.

586
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:20,395
Then can we risk
killing our enemies?

587
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:24,532
We don't have a choice.

588
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:27,435
If we have to kill to save
an innocent life, we'll do it.

589
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:32,273
No matter how many souls
the keeper claims,

590
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,676
As long as there are even a few
people left to create life,

591
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:38,213
<i>And as long as people are
willing to protect that life,</i>

592
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:39,547
<i>The keeper can't win.</i>

593
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:42,116
It's just over
this next hill.

594
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,021
You know, the other children
will be so excited to see you.

595
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:50,892
Hey, uh...

596
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,565
You all right, william?

597
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:04,138
Are you hurt?

598
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:14,315
You're a baneling.

599
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:20,016
