1
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:02,087
1x18 - <i>Mirror</i>

2
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:12,219
- It's getting late. I have to go.
- You're not going anywhere.

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,605
Evil doesn't wait.

4
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,180
Take me with you.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,190
It's too dangerous.

6
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,942
When all this is over,
I'll come back for you.

7
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:27,454
I swear.

8
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,406
Do you really love me?

9
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,034
The Seeker never lies.

10
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,766
Where have you been?

11
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:52,517
I got my foot
caught in a hunter's trap.

12
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:56,643
I'm sure you got something
caught somewhere.

13
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,539
We need to move now.

14
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,353
Please. We've already paid our tribute
to Lord Rahl.

15
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,691
The demand's doubled. There's a war on,
as you may have noticed.

16
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,484
If we give you more gold,

17
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,237
we'll have no money
to buy seeds for our crops.

18
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,791
We'll starve.

19
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,199
And then Lord Rahl
will get nothing out of us.

20
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:17,027
Maybe this town would fare better

21
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,370
- with one less mouth to feed.
- Drop the sword.

22
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,940
Let me live, that I might serve you.

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,651
How long you live
depends on how well you serve.

24
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:54,989
- Are there more of you coming?
- If I'm not back by nightfall,

25
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,032
my commander
will send the Dragon Corps.

26
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,745
Not only for the tribute,
they'll come for the whole treasure,

27
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:03,372
and they'll slaughter
anyone who tries to stop them.

28
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,875
Please, Seeker, you have to help us.

29
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,213
People of Ixwood, do not despair.

30
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,134
Go to your houses,
close the shutters, bolt the doors.

31
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:18,679
We will wait in the treasury,
when the rats walk into the trap.

32
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,269
Stand watch on the road.
When you see the Dragon Corps coming,

33
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:28,623
race back here, knock three times
on the door of the treasury,

34
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:30,788
and hide yourself.

35
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,018
Go.

36
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:39,379
Come, come!

37
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,698
This is a great day

38
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,885
for the people of Ixwood.

39
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,677
You have given us hope
in a dark time.

40
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:55,202
Be sure to thank your wife
for all this marvelous food.

41
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,203
You can thank her yourself.

42
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:00,221
Is there any other service
I can perform for the Seeker?

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,832
I'm sure the Seeker
is more than grateful

44
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,004
for the service
you've already provided.

45
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,568
Thank you both for everything.

46
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,133
The gratitude is ours.

47
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:30,200
I hope for your sake
she's a better hunter's trap

48
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,846
than she is a cook.

49
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,252
Did the D'Harans come?

50
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,220
Where's the Seeker?

51
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:46,214
What if they killed him?

52
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,565
The Seeker hasn't been killed.

53
00:03:58,782 --> 00:03:59,905
He's tricked us!

54
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,490
Summon the Town Guard.

55
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,743
We've been robbed!

56
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,668
- What took you so long?
- You try running in this corset.

57
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,626
Was it the corset
that slowed you down,

58
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,951
or the flagon of spirits
you guzzled last night?

59
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:18,376
It was freezing.

60
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,886
Funny how many cold nights
we've been having lately.

61
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:25,203
I was beginning to think
you'd run off with the loot.

62
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,266
You know you can trust us, Gwildor.

63
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:31,103
Well, I know I can trust you
to come back for this.

64
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,190
- Do we have to?
- I would say so.

65
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,902
With the price Darken Rahl has
on these pretty little mugs of ours.

66
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,197
Do it, Gwildor.

67
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,552
Look on the bright side, Frytss.
You may have a big belly,

68
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,596
but tonight
you'll have plenty to fill it with.

69
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,749
And here's to the poor unsuspecting town
of Lothringham,

70
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,767
next stop on our little tour
of the Midlands.

71
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,451
Here, sorry about the wait,
my lovelies.

72
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,109
Lunatic asylum in here tonight,
as you can see.

73
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:21,487
Hands to yourself, swine.

74
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,449
That's right,
cram it in before it walks away.

75
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,910
You should talk,
you bloated bag of swill.

76
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:31,497
Warms my heart
to hear you lovebirds coo.

77
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,915
Lovebirds my posterior.

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,811
If you hadn't found that mirror
and brough into the current business,

79
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,671
that one would be a distant memory
of wasted youth by now.

80
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,370
Soon enough, my dove. Just
a few more bags of gold salted away,

81
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,647
and I will never again have to look
into your shing eyes and ask myself,

82
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,764
- "What was I thinking?"
- Meant for each other, aren't you?

83
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,144
Like two fleas on a dog's pos...

84
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:52,702
What?

85
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,726
I'm so glad to see you both
alive and well.

86
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,277
What brings you back here?

87
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,788
We parted ways with Zedd two weeks ago.
We're supposed to meet him here.

88
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,282
- You seen him?
- Not yet.

89
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,743
But I'll give you a room
while you wait for him.

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,330
Thank you, Bianca,
but it's too dangerous for you.

91
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:16,390
Rahl's been killing people
who give us shelter.

92
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:19,315
We'll camp in the woods,
and come by tomorrow.

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Could I at least give the Seeker
and the Confessor a hot meal?

94
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,033
We've been on the road so long

95
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:27,428
I'm not sure we remember exactly
what that is.

96
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,221
Come on.

97
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,681
We'll steal horses.

98
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:36,302
If we gallop all night
we'll cross the River Kern by dawn.

99
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,524
Don't you see
what an opportunity this is?

100
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,069
The Sword of Truth is the most valuable
objects in the Midlands.

101
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,905
It could easily fetch us
a hundred thousand pieces of gold.

102
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,992
Steal the Sword of Truth
from the Seeker? Sorry.

103
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,325
My skin's worth 100,001.

104
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,794
- You have a buyer?
- They'd be trampling each other

105
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,959
for the honor of meeting my price.

106
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,739
But if you'd rather go back
to fleecing children out of their money

107
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,036
or whatever it was you were doing
in the gutter I dragged you out of...

108
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,426
I'll find somebody
who wants to be rich.

109
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,766
If the Seeker catches us
stealing the Sword of Truth,

110
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:18,286
he'll run us through with it.
I'm telling you this is a bad idea.

111
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,735
That's what you said the time
we swindled the town of Norwich.

112
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,566
Look at how fat
you got off that feat.

113
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,348
The town of Norwich
hardly compares to the Seeker.

114
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:28,186
- He didn't have all these muscles.
- Well, you have them now,

115
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,782
- so I'd say you're equally matched.
- Yes, but...

116
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,536
How do you think he got
all these muscles, you wine-soaked hag?

117
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,623
By hacking apart hundreds of D'Harans.
That's how.

118
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,834
I may have the body
but I don't have the talent.

119
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,853
Lucky for you, I have both.

120
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:44,946
You're gonna fight him?

121
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,965
No, you pigeon head.

122
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:51,470
I am going to use the one tool
that the Seeker is defenseless against.

123
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,268
All filled up and ready to go.

124
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,898
We have time for a quick swim.

125
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,166
I thought we were in a hurry.

126
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,074
That was before the sun came out,
and it got so hot.

127
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:23,176
Come on.

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,839
It's beautiful.

129
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,759
What are you waiting for?

130
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,644
Don't be so serious all the time.

131
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:45,343
It's just a swim.

132
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,628
You gonna be very sorry walking around
in those wet pants all day.

133
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,571
This is a bad idea.

134
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:14,597
You won't say that
once you're in the water.

135
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,343
We really should get going.

136
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:01,141
This is a very bad idea.

137
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:12,819
- What if you lose control?
- I can control myself.

138
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,280
Can you?

139
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:21,370
You know what, you're right.

140
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:23,395
This is a very bad idea.

141
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,803
I was coming to see
if you were all right.

142
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:39,888
I thought
you were filling the water skins.

143
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,017
I seem to have left them behind
at the lake.

144
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,019
- I'll get them.
- All right.

145
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:48,622
Just hurry.

146
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,461
Why did you do that?

147
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,635
Do what?

148
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,910
What is this?

149
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:23,614
You take your clothes off,
you swim that close to me...

150
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,852
Take my clothes of?
What are you talking about?

151
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,309
Your hair's dry.

152
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,065
- That wasn't you in the lake.
- Your hair's wet.

153
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:35,402
That wasn't you in the forest.

154
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:41,325
Someone has got
some very powerful magic.

155
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,094
Someone very close by.

156
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,081
- What?
- I know my sword, and this isn't it.

157
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:50,821
Someone stole the Sword of Truth?
How did that happen?

158
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,462
- I was distracted.
- By a woman you went swimming with.

159
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,557
I thought it was you.

160
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:57,570
They can't be far.

161
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:00,845
I'll look for tracks by the lake,
you go up the path.

162
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,389
Thank you for seeing me, captain.

163
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,794
You have something to tell me,
tell it quickly.

164
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,095
Is there still a reward being offered
for the capture of the Seeker?

165
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:13,774
You know where they are?

166
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:16,581
Is the price
still a million pieces of gold?

167
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:22,532
What reward could be greater
than the glory of Lord Rahl's gratitude?

168
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:29,706
Yes, a million,
to be shared with the arresting officer.

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,084
Of course.

170
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,336
If you know where they are,
let's hear it.

171
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:37,605
Perhaps we should discuss that
someplace a little more private.

172
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,834
We wouldn't want some eager pair of ears
beating us to the glory.

173
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,473
A hundred thousand divided by three,

174
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,602
leaves 10, carry the one.

175
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,914
No, carry the three.

176
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,075
Wait. Thirty goes into 90...

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,581
Let me just make it easier for you.
Just divide by two.

178
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,054
But there's three of us.

179
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,362
What have you got in there, cheese?

180
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,777
Why does Gwildor deserve any of it?

181
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,702
Haven't you noticed that every time
he gulls us into one of his schemes,

182
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,850
we're the ones
who end up risking our hides?

183
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,794
If we run, we can get to the gold
in the cave before he does.

184
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,871
- But he has the mirror.
- But we have the Sword.

185
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,422
With which we conk him
the minute he gets there.

186
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,583
And then we split up the treasure,
and the money from the Sword,

187
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,775
and never have to lay eyes
on each other ever again.

188
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,185
Best part of all.

189
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:28,942
Halt!

190
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,226
I'll take the Sword, Seeker.

191
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,465
I'm not the Seeker.

192
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,193
Take it.
It's all yours.

193
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,698
Apparently the Seeker's
legendary courage is just... a legend.

194
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,952
Rahl will have no trouble breaking him
in the dungeons of his palace.

195
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,022
Arrest them,
and don't let the Confessor touch you.

196
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,897
But I'm not the Confessor.

197
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:57,461
This is just a disguise.
It's a magical one.

198
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,084
When our friend gets here
he'll change us back to who we are.

199
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,082
- We're thieves.
- We cheat widows.

200
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,059
We steal pennies
out of blind people's cups.

201
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:06,898
- Then we steal the cups.
- We stole the Treasure of Ixwood.

202
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,263
Silence!

203
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,432
Gag them, and gag em well.

204
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,101
If I hear one squeak,
it's your head.

205
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,239
My love.

206
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,271
I found you.

207
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:31,496
Last night was the most
wonderful night of my life.

208
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:38,376
I... She... I never saw her before.
Did you find anybody?

209
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,772
- No, but it looks like you did.
- Whoever you are, I'm very sorry.

210
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,258
You may have met somebody
who looks like me, but I'm not him.

211
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,652
You don't want the Confessor
to think you've found another.

212
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,608
She'll understand. Love
is never something you have to hide.

213
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:54,476
I left a note for my husband.
I told him I was running away with you.

214
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,394
There they are!

215
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,863
I knew you'd lead us
straight to these lying thieves,

216
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,358
you faithless wench.

217
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,044
So the legend of the Seeker
was a lie all along.

218
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,879
You use your reputation

219
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:13,328
to prey on peoples' trust and fear,
and then rob them blind.

220
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:17,045
It wasn't enough to steal our treasure,
you had to steal my wife?

221
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,084
He didn't steal me.
We love each other.

222
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,937
And the Seeker
would never steal our treasure.

223
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,407
I'm sure he took it somewhere
to keep it safe.

224
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,968
Well, if it's so safe,
you tell us where it is.

225
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,678
We don't know where it is.

226
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:33,974
Someone's using some kind of magic
to make them look exactly like us.

227
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,607
Sir, we don't want to fight you.
We're after the same people you are.

228
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,229
- If you help us...
- Silence!

229
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:44,025
Maybe once the Seeker is dead,

230
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,445
the Confessor
will be more cooperative.

231
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,325
Run, my love. Run!

232
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:54,764
Come on, get them!

233
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:11,048
A third of a king's ransom
wasn't enough for you, you needed more.

234
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,732
If you were the real Seeker,
you would have sacrificed yourself

235
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:15,142
and let the woman get away.

236
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,642
When a real woman comes along,
I'll do just that.

237
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:27,800
Come here.

238
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,669
You're not doing this
cause I look like this?

239
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:48,798
If I cared about looks, do you think
I would have picked you to begin with?

240
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,179
We'll get out of this.
We've gotten out of worse.

241
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:58,660
Like the time we were doing
the kidnapped sister in Glensborough.

242
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:02,771
And the Duke walked in
while I was changing my wig.

243
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,946
And threw us into the dungeon
with that ogre.

244
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,900
Who smelled like rotting monkeys.

245
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,087
None of which would have happened
if you hadn't taken it upon yourself

246
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:20,038
to deflower the Duke's daughter.
Have you ever met a woman

247
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,999
who you didn't think would look better
with her knickers on the bedpost?

248
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:28,050
- Clayre.
- Don't even try.

249
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,976
I'd have to be a few tomatoes
short of a salad

250
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:33,172
to go down that garden path again.

251
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,138
I don't know about you,
but I am getting out of this dung heap.

252
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:40,941
Hello? Anyone out there?

253
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:49,823
We lost them.

254
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:54,611
Except every citizen in Ixwood
is going to be looking for us.

255
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,496
We need to give them
their treasure back,

256
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:59,953
before the stories spread of the Seeker
and the Confessor being thieves.

257
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,960
Except we have no idea
which way the imposters went.

258
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,294
- Or if they even look like us.
- If ever there was a time we need Zedd.

259
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,048
Maybe he's at the tavern by now.

260
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,672
Let's find out.

261
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,836
I can't believe

262
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:22,363
after fighting legions of D'Harans,
Mord-Sith and Rahl himself,

263
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:25,485
I lose the Sword of Truth
to a couple of petty criminals.

264
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,855
I mean, has the Seeker
ever lost the Sword before?

265
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:32,905
Don't worry.

266
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:34,885
We'll get it back.

267
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,083
Drinks for everybody.

268
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,669
I've captured the Seeker
and the Confessor.

269
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,234
You heard the gentleman.

270
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,986
Rum all around,
from the good bottle.

271
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:57,260
A word with you in private, barmaid?

272
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,181
Of course.

273
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:10,142
I know that you
and your gentleman friend Gwildor

274
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,449
have been harboring
the Seeker and the Confessor.

275
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:14,486
Lies.
People will say anything in this town.

276
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,363
What I don't know
is where this Gwildor is.

277
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,522
Well, that makes two of us.
I haven't seen him in days.

278
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:23,228
I have instruments in my stockade.

279
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,682
Very, very sharp ones,

280
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,637
that could have you
singing quite a different song.

281
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,033
Look, you can carve me to bits,

282
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:35,498
I still won't know where he is.

283
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:40,193
Then there's only one way
you can save yourself.

284
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,753
Get your hands off me.

285
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,089
I belong to another.

286
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,311
You know,

287
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:51,314
it's not often a man
can be absolutely certain

288
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,503
of the faithfulness of his beloved.

289
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:12,078
You could kill a woman,
giving her a fright like that.

290
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,379
What have you been up to?

291
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,757
Changing into D'Haran Captain,
capturing the Seeker and the Confessor.

292
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,042
Or should I say,

293
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:23,724
two petty thieves who at the moment
resemble them most remarkably.

294
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:27,735
Poor, poor, Frytss and Clayre.

295
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,822
This wouldn't have anything to do

296
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:34,023
with collecting
a rather sizeable reward, now, would it?

297
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:36,067
You brilliant woman,
how did you guess?

298
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:40,126
I've sent word to Darken Rahl.

299
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:44,215
Tomorrow morning, a Mord-Sith
will take the Seeker to his dungeons,

300
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,654
little suspecting that she's paying
a million pieces of gold

301
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:49,581
for a sorry pair of imposters.

302
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,318
After which, you and I will

303
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,919
will proceed to a certain cave
in the forest.

304
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,171
Where Frytss and Clayre
will not, alas,

305
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,716
be on hand to collect
their share of the treasure.

306
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,315
Leaving us to bear that burden

307
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,459
all by ourselves.

308
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,854
- Where's the D'Haran captain himself?
- Retired on his pension, I believe.

309
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:15,478
At the bottom of a well.

310
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,194
I need you to hold onto this.

311
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,154
I don't want a Mord-Sith
anywhere near it.

312
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,114
Wise, wise thinking, my love.

313
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,254
Just one favor.

314
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,205
Change back into the captain first.

315
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,315
I warn you,

316
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,771
he's heavily armed.

317
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:38,546
You know
I like a well-equipped soldier.

318
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,078
Come on.

319
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,467
Sorry, we're closing.

320
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank the Spirits you're safe.

321
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:18,463
- Bianca, can we...?
- Of course.

322
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:24,354
Have you seen Zedd?

323
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,479
Not yet.

324
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,179
What's going on?
And how did you escape?

325
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:32,850
We were never caught.
Someone's impersonating us.

326
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,437
Who? And how is that even possible?

327
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,296
That's what we need to find out.

328
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,944
If people are saying the Seeker
and the Confessor have been captured,

329
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,563
then the D'Harans
must have caught the imposters.

330
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:46,458
The nearest D'Haran
is three leagues here.

331
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:48,157
We'll get them out.

332
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,744
But don't you realize
what a chance this is?

333
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,652
If Darken Rahl
thinks he already has you,

334
00:22:54,777 --> 00:22:56,545
then he won't be looking for you.

335
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,323
You should get as far away from here
as you can.

336
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:01,587
The imposters stole
the treasure of Ixwood.

337
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,758
And the Sword of Truth.

338
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,679
I'm so frightened for you.

339
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,724
Will you at least
take one precaution for me?

340
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,007
- What precaution?
- There was a D'Haran commander in here,

341
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:20,231
bragging the Mord-Sith and her escort
are coming down the main road.

342
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,709
Take the old goat path.
Out the front, left at the well.

343
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,226
It's slower,
but at least you'll get there alive.

344
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,781
- Thank you for your help.
- No, thank you.

345
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:31,206
And may the Spirits be with you.

346
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,278
I hate to think how many towns
those charlatans have raided.

347
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:54,903
Or how many corsets.

348
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:58,461
Maybe Bianca is right.
We have to get the Sword of Truth back

349
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,719
but why not let the D'Harans
hand the imposters over to Rahl?

350
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:04,595
I mean, if he thinks that
he's captured the Seeker and Confessor,

351
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,862
- he would stop looking for us.
- Rahl's too smart to be fooled by them.

352
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,828
- He'll realize their frauds.
- At least they'll be in his dungeon,

353
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:13,098
they won't be able
to steal from anyone else.

354
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:16,381
Rahl's not going to let them rot
in his dungeon.

355
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,748
He wanted you alive
so he could break you.

356
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,834
Force you to kneel before him
as an example to those that follow.

357
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,712
Now he has that.

358
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:28,626
He could force them to say
and do whatever he wanted.

359
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,263
Make them swear their allegiance
to the House of Rahl.

360
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,545
And the people of the Midlands
would believe it.

361
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,183
As far as they would know
we wouldn't be fighting for them.

362
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,004
They'd be fighting for Rahl.

363
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:45,066
You.

364
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:47,318
There.

365
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,529
Turnkey.

366
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,700
Do they really expect me
to eat this slop?

367
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,801
If you brought me
some of those luscious,

368
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:02,999
juicy mutton chops
I saw the officers eating,

369
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:05,840
I could make you

370
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:08,163
very

371
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,618
glad that you did.

372
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,533
What's the problem?

373
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,463
Is it those stories you've heard

374
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:23,794
about Confessors and the terrible things
that they can do to a man?

375
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,931
That's all just made up
to scare you.

376
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,693
No, it isn't that.

377
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,030
This one's yours, love crumpet.

378
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:50,856
What?

379
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,092
I know how excited you get
around leather and chains,

380
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,762
but are Darken Rahl's torture chambers
really a better alternative?

381
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:24,428
The prisoners have escaped!

382
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,166
- What? Where are you going?
- As far away from here as I can get.

383
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,794
- What?
- The idiots have escaped.

384
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,853
When the Mord-Sith discovers
I've let them get away,

385
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:52,193
I'll be fish food.

386
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:55,378
Give me the mirror,
change me back right now.

387
00:26:55,503 --> 00:26:56,503
Wait.

388
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,393
This might actually play
into our hands.

389
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,741
- How?
- Darling, I was coming here to tell you

390
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,165
Richard and Kahlan are on their way here
now to free Frytss and Clayre.

391
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:09,835
You grab them
when they get here then...

392
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,296
And the Mord-Sith arrives,
I deliver the real thing.

393
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,728
But the gold in the cave?

394
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:17,177
Frytss and Clayre
must be halfway there by now.

395
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,216
You're a D'Haran captain.

396
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,056
- Send a quad after them.
- With orders to kill.

397
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,557
There's my boy.

398
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:26,419
Go back to the tavern,
pack your things.

399
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,689
I'll come for you tonight.
A million gold pieces richer.

400
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:37,161
When Gwildor gets here,
we hide behind the rock,

401
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,717
knock him out,
grab the amulet and run.

402
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:42,542
What if he's ready for that?
What if he knocks us out?

403
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:45,417
- I say we take off right now.
- You can do what you like.

404
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,478
I'm not running around the countryside
with this bull's-eye on.

405
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,126
Fine, Gwildor's all yours.

406
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,041
You're not scared of Gwildor.

407
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,666
You're just not ready to give up
those rippling muscles.

408
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,823
A story to tell with pride, boys:

409
00:27:57,948 --> 00:28:01,398
the day you saw the Seeker
and the Confessor die in agony.

410
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:05,975
You wanna story to tell with pride?

411
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,244
Promise you'll let us go on our way,

412
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,647
and the Seeker here
will be more than happy

413
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,774
to finish
what I was so rude to interrupt.

414
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,329
What?

415
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:20,197
Show no mercy.

416
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:35,254
Thank all the Spirits in creation
I found you in time.

417
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,668
Yes, thank them indeed.

418
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,722
I was on my way to the tavern
to meet you,

419
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:43,037
but the town was all abuzz with the news
that the Seeker had been captured,

420
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:45,039
so I followed these D'Harans...

421
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,642
What's all this?

422
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,895
Well, we're just keeping it safe.

423
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,230
For the good people of Ixwood.

424
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,649
The nasty D'Harans
were about to seize every bit of it.

425
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,688
Well, we'll have to take it straight
back to the good people of Ixwood

426
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:03,491
before the nasty D'Harans
seize every bit of us.

427
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:06,132
Absolutely. Instantly.

428
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:09,477
But there's no reason to drag yourself
all the way to Ixwood.

429
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:11,562
We'll just trot the gold
right over there,

430
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,606
and meet you at the crossroads.

431
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,836
Meet me at the crossroads.

432
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,417
Good plan.

433
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,841
Like we did that time in,
where was it, Massenthal.

434
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:23,094
Massenthal.

435
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,038
That's right.

436
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:29,600
Seeing as the town of Massenthal
was brought into being 3 seconds ago,

437
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:32,645
I'll make sure
the gold gets back to Ixwood.

438
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:37,024
And you'll tell me who you are
and what you've done with my friends.

439
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:48,937
It's not well-guarded. That's lucky.

440
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:51,568
You know what Zedd says:
"A man who trusts in luck

441
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,543
"better have plenty of it."

442
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,624
I suggest you save a little fight
for the Mord-Sith.

443
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,038
And how does this amulet work?

444
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:45,483
If I can get somebody to look into it,
their reflection stays inside.

445
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:48,429
- And if I get you to look into it...
- I can turn you into them.

446
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,139
Montressor's Mirror.

447
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,835
Created by a sorcerer

448
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,394
who wanted to capture the image
of his beloved dying wife

449
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,228
and then have her with him always.

450
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,792
- It's been lost for centuries.
- Well, Gwildor found it.

451
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,540
He won it at cards.

452
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:04,184
This is Gwildor's fault.
He pulled us into this.

453
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,524
I only went along with it
because pork-brains here

454
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,309
swore that we were gonna be aiding
the true Seeker in his quest.

455
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:11,619
Gwildor's her friend, not mine.

456
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:15,831
And for a few tots of rum,
she could be your friend too.

457
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:21,137
How did this Gwildor
manage to capture

458
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,088
the real Richard
and Kahlan's reflections?

459
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,708
When they came through
a few weeks ago,

460
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,292
Gwildor's lady friend tricked them
into looking into the mirror.

461
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:30,279
She just gave them
a shave and a bath.

462
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:33,178
- She's a tavern keeper, her name's...
- Bianca.

463
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,201
And we thought she was a friend.

464
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:42,026
If she's not your friend anymore,
that means she's your enemy,

465
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:46,362
and seeing as she's our enemy too,
that makes us all friends, right?

466
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:51,276
In the broadest possible sense.

467
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,142
Well, then, friend,

468
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:58,374
we're glad we could help you,
and we'll just be on our way then.

469
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,086
Not so fast.

470
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:10,886
The curtain has not yet fallen
on your performance.

471
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,274
Going somewhere?

472
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,192
Why, you shouldn't sneak in like that,
you could scare a person to death.

473
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,820
Richard and Kahlan
have been looking for you.

474
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:30,926
Thank the Spirits,
we found each other.

475
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,863
I've just freed them
from the D'Harans.

476
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:35,274
Freed them.

477
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,288
That's wonderful.

478
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't even try, Bianca.

479
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,667
Did you think you could fool
a Wizard of the First Order?

480
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:46,714
I want the magic mirror, so
when I find the imposters you created,

481
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,141
I can change them
back to their sorry selves

482
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,969
before they heap even more infamy
on the Seeker's good name.

483
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:56,805
If you give me the tiniest clue
as to what you're talking about,

484
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,052
- perhaps I can help you.
- Would a touch

485
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,812
of the Confessor's hand
be clue enough?

486
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,963
How do I know she's not an imposter?
How do you know...?

487
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:10,596
There's only one way to find out.
Are you willing to risk it?

488
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,862
I'd love to have you
as my willing slave, Bianca.

489
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,994
All the things
I'd have you do for me.

490
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,713
No, take it. Take it!

491
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,292
And may it bring you
less trouble than it's brought me.

492
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,087
Where's Gwildor?

493
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:26,919
He's at the D'Haran camp,

494
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:31,467
- posing as a captain of the guards.
- Where are Richard and Kahlan?

495
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:37,038
You mean, they're not...?

496
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,017
You're looking well for someone
who just stabbed a knife

497
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,979
in the back of every friend she has.

498
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:48,602
Where are the real Seeker
and Confessor?

499
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,072
They've probably fallen into the trap
that Gwildor set for them.

500
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:56,912
The Mord-Sith may already have come
to take them to Darken Rahl.

501
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:59,495
Please, let me go.
That's all I know.

502
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,705
That's all the help I can give you.

503
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:06,633
I feel certain you have much,
much more to give.

504
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:17,161
The gold?

505
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:21,350
Lord Rahl insists upon delivery
of the captives to the People's Palace

506
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,992
before the reward is paid.

507
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,746
He's been disappointed
too many times.

508
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,911
If you want the gold,
you'll have to come with us.

509
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:35,643
It will be my honor to personally
present the captives to Lord Rahl.

510
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:39,910
His gratitude would be even greater
if you delivered the Wizard as well.

511
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,371
And where might the Wizard be,

512
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:45,561
Seeker?

513
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,267
Wait!

514
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:05,102
You have been fooled, mistress.

515
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,965
These are the real Seeker
and Confessor.

516
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,900
The ones ye got there are imposters.

517
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:13,902
And so is he.

518
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:18,158
He's nothing but a common thief,
disguising himself with magic,

519
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,001
and I can prove it.

520
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,233
How could you betray me?

521
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:35,841
Now to unmask his accomplices.

522
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:41,180
I don't know who you are,
nor what kind of magic you have,

523
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,141
and I don't know who's real
and who is not,

524
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,477
so I'm gonna take you all
to Darken Rahl

525
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:49,456
and let him sort it out.

526
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,690
He's rather good at that.

527
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,348
Take them.

528
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,401
Death isn't good enough for you.
Having your head crushed between stones

529
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:24,088
while rats gnaw your feet to the ankles
is barely good enough for you.

530
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,318
What did I do to deserve
such a good fortune?

531
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:41,716
He's setting a trap for you.

532
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:44,409
Of course he is. Some feeble attempt
to rescue his friends.

533
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,351
Which is why
I'm going to walk into the trap alone.

534
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:52,291
The one person in the world
a Wizard can't use his powers against

535
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,526
is a Mord-Sith.

536
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,142
In a manner of speaking.

537
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:21,306
What about me?

538
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:44,803
Run!

539
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:56,587
Gwildor!

540
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,980
Catch them.

541
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,197
I'm sorry, mistress.
There are so many of them.

542
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,284
And I can't run.
But at least you have the Wizard.

543
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:09,513
Cold comfort,
when the prize was the Seeker,

544
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:11,914
but better than no comfort at all.

545
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm not the Wizard,
I'm Bianca, the tavern keeper.

546
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,250
The Wizard bewitched me

547
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,380
and tied me up to lure you
away from the prisoners.

548
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:22,883
Gwildor, it's me.

549
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:25,844
Tell it to Lord Rahl.

550
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:43,069
Are you all right?

551
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:46,643
You're not Kahlan.

552
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,910
There's nobody around, Seeker.

553
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:53,914
Your dream could come true,
with no price to pay.

554
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,626
- Why would you wanna do that?
- Story to tell my grandchildren?

555
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:59,711
Who knows, they might be yours.

556
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,756
Don't you find me desirable?

557
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:10,055
Which is why you'd better stop.

558
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:15,956
You may be the one true Seeker,
but you're not very much fun.

559
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,259
Ever the fast worker, aren't you?

560
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:24,778
How anyone gets around with these...

561
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:27,781
things on them
is entirely beyond me.

562
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,012
Well, thank you for everything.

563
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,140
We won't take any more of your time.

564
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,713
Leave them.

565
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,893
We're just gonna let them get away?

566
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,972
We don't have time to take them
to the nearest constable.

567
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:02,315
And they don't have this.

568
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:06,447
That's gonna be a very useful thing
to have around.

569
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,113
I'm not so sure about that.

570
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,742
Sometimes I think there's entirely
too much magic in the world.

571
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:21,084
Well, drop me a note,

572
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,220
if you ever learn
how to write your name.

573
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:26,253
I'll address it care of any tavern,
any place, any time.

574
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:27,628
To think when I met you,

575
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:30,968
I had a few pieces of gold in my pocket
and a shred of dignity.

576
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:34,484
For the rest of my life, I'll celebrate
the anniversary of seeing your face

577
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,509
for the very last time ever.

578
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:49,905
- Silver spurs.
- Gold bridle.

579
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,116
- The Winterhaven Double-Cross?
- With the Trollsbridge variation.

580
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,828
Please. Please, kind sir!

581
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,557
My wife has fallen ill.

582
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:06,093
Maybe we should have come along
a little later.

583
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:08,281
Given you and Clayre
some time together.

584
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:10,206
I'm not interested in her.

585
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,422
Don't you think she's pretty?

586
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:16,094
Why do I get the feeling
there's nothing I can say right now

587
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,973
that isn't going to get me
in trouble?

588
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:21,055
You're growing in wisdom every day,
my boy.

589
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,726
Don't despair, my darling.

590
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:29,083
I love you.

591
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:31,947
At least
we'll always have each other.

592
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:34,076
Gwildor, it's me.
