<i>you are the true Seeker.</i>

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,032
( people coughing )

6
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:27,594
Ohh.

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,798
( indistinct muttering )

8
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,198
Seeker?

9
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,630
Our prayers have been answered.

10
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,295
What happened to these people?

11
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,762
They're calling it
Keeper's Blight.

12
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,797
Please, be careful.

13
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,297
It only takes one touch
to pass it on.

14
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:03,595
Rumor is, it was brought
to our world by banelings.

15
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,630
Who needs a knife when you
can kill with your fingertips?

16
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,464
The sick come here
'cause they believe

17
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:13,897
that the Monument of Ardris
has the power to heal them.

18
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:16,363
Most perish within days.

19
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:17,764
Zedd, maybe the compass
led us here

20
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:20,031
so we can help them.

21
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,067
( chants in ancient tongue )

22
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:27,067
( gagging )

23
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,667
Zedd?

24
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,169
This blight...

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,533
It's indeed fueled
by powerful black magic.

26
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,934
If I try to absorb it,
it'll kill me.

27
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:46,560
( <i>ethereal theme playing</i> )

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,530
(Kahlan)
No, don't, you'll be killed!

29
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,202
You healed him.

30
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:13,103
Who are you?

31
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,038
I am the Creator.

32
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,440
All will rejoice in my light.

33
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:45,152
If she's the Creator,
I'm the Queen of Tamarang.

34
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:46,585
She's healing people
I couldn't.

35
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:50,053
Maybe, but the Creator lives
in the Spirit World.

36
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:53,922
This woman is flesh and blood.

37
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,990
I'm going to find out
who she really is.

38
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,557
Kahlan, be careful.

39
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:59,024
Whoever she is,
she's very powerful.

40
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,194
May I speak with you.

41
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:07,997
Of course, Kahlan.

42
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:11,699
I miss our talks.

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,000
I beg your pardon?

44
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,502
You used to pray to me
to take care of your mother

45
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:17,570
after she died.

46
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:19,739
And to protect your sister
from your father's brutality.

47
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:24,275
So many pray
for selfish reasons, Kahlan,

48
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:26,176
but never you.

49
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:29,245
(Kahlan)
<i>It's so hard to believe.</i>

50
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,847
Faith is hard.

51
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,249
It is all right
to have doubts.

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,717
You wouldn't be
the Mother Confessor

53
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:38,520
if you weren't inquisitive.

54
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,455
You're wondering,
if I am who I say I am,

55
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:44,090
why haven't I come
to this world sooner?

56
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,025
Why have I allowed
so much suffering?

57
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,492
The thought did cross my mind.

58
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:52,861
I wish I could wave this hand
and make the darkness go away.

59
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:55,863
The Keeper is as powerful
as I am.

60
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,931
And now that the veil
has been torn,

61
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:59,132
he's growing stronger.

62
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,400
If you are the Creator,

63
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,836
you could tell us where to find
the Stone of Tears.

64
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,704
Even the Stone of Tears
won't save you

65
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,438
if I don't first destroy

66
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,173
the Keeper's
most powerful servant.

67
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,542
Who?

68
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,679
Richard Rahl.

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,614
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

70
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,682
Richard isn't a servant
of the Keeper.

71
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:20,783
The Keeper is devious.

72
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,984
He hides his servants well.

73
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,786
But Richard's actions
clearly show him

74
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:26,821
to be an enemy of the Light.

75
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,055
But everything he's done--

76
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,156
Has secretly been
to serve the Keeper.

77
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:32,557
I don't believe that.

78
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:33,658
Your love for Richard

79
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,993
blinds you
to his true nature, Kahlan.

80
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:39,162
Just as my love
for the Keeper once blinded me.

81
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:41,531
You know my story.

82
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,165
Your mother taught it to you.

83
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,434
Yes.

84
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,902
In a time before remembering,

85
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,271
the Keeper's love
for the Creator

86
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,739
brought our world into being.

87
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,611
People were made in their image,
perfect and immortal.

88
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,280
But the Keeper
soon grew jealous

89
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,981
of the Creator's love
for her children.

90
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:00,982
He made your kind mortal,

91
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,819
so he could murder
our firstborn.

92
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,920
He betrayed me,

93
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:10,891
brought death and suffering
to the world we had created.

94
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:15,863
I wept.

95
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:17,998
So profound was my grief
that it took shape.

96
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,533
The Stone of Tears.

97
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:23,469
I used it to banish
the one I had loved,

98
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,239
trapping him
in the Underworld for eternity.

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,409
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

100
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,879
Just as seeing
Richard's true nature

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,148
will be the hardest thing
you've ever done.

102
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,716
I could have simply
destroyed Richard.

103
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:37,818
But before I do, I need you

104
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,620
and the First Wizard
to see the truth.

105
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,625
So that he will name
a new Seeker,

106
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,093
and you will agree
to come with me

107
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,728
to a place
where you'll be protected.

108
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,431
It is the only way
to ensure my Prophecy.

109
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:53,704
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

110
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,673
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

111
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,348
People believe in Richard.

112
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,619
He's the only one who's fought
for them in a very long time.

113
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,288
And many of them wonder,
as I often have,

114
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,490
if the Creator
has abandoned them.

115
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,591
If you destroy Richard

116
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,959
without giving him
a chance to defend himself,

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,328
the people
may turn against you.

118
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:23,733
Please.

119
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,601
Please.

120
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,469
Give me a chance to show you

121
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,137
that his heart
and his motives are pure.

122
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,109
You're very important to me,
Kahlan.

123
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,045
You always have been.

124
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,147
If it will help you
and others accept my decision,

125
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,049
then I will hear
what you have to say.

126
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,084
( whispers ):
Ah, thank you.

127
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:47,155
But the Seeker
will face judgment.

128
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,990
( sighs )

129
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,962
It's a trick.
For all we know,

130
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,833
she's an agent of the Keeper
sent to destroy Richard.

131
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,734
She's telling the truth.

132
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:01,735
Or at least she believes
what she's saying.

133
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,504
You can't even read
a Mord-Sith.

134
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:07,406
Yet somehow you know what a
woman this powerful is thinking?

135
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,275
There's more to it.
She knows things.

136
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,478
We should leave.

137
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,513
Now.

138
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,447
Resume the search
for the Stone.

139
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:21,117
I can't let Richard
find the Stone.

140
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:23,686
I've quelled the magic
of the compass.

141
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,123
( indistinct chatter )

142
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:31,859
Forget the compass. Go.

143
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,727
I can repel her magic.

144
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,095
( people gasping )

145
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,897
I don't want to harm you,
Wizard.

146
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:39,065
Zedd, no!

147
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,601
She may be strong enough
to kill you both.

148
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,640
And if we run,
the people will believe

149
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,676
what she's saying about me.

150
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,781
They'll turn against me,
and we'll never find the Stone.

151
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:03,756
I've made mistakes,

152
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,824
but I'm not an agent
of the Keeper.

153
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:08,093
I don't know
if you're the Creator or not,

154
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:12,197
but I'm not afraid
to be judged by anyone.

155
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:15,367
Richard Rahl,
you claim to serve the Light.

156
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,903
Tell us,
how have you done so?

157
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:21,540
I found the Boxes of Orden.

158
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,378
(Richard)
<i>And used them to kill</i>
<i>the tyrant Darken Rahl.</i>

159
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,313
( <i>epic theme playing</i> )

160
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,053
( shrieking )

161
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,266
You say that
in destroying Darken Rahl,

162
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,866
you were serving me,

163
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,567
but tell us, Richard,

164
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,970
what was the result
of Rahl's death?

165
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:02,477
(Zedd)
This crack in the earth,
it's a tear in the veil

166
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:05,280
that separates the Underworld
from the World of the Living.

167
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,248
(Kahlan)
How could this have happened?

168
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,884
In all my years as a Wizard,

169
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,952
I've only known
one form of magic

170
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,321
strong enough to tear the veil.

171
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:17,057
The Power of Orden

172
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:21,728
This happened
when I killed Rahl,

173
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:25,332
when the Boxes of Orden
exploded.

174
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,167
As long as it's open,

175
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,436
there's no way to prevent
the Keeper of the Underworld,

176
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,671
the great enemy of all
that walks, breathes,

177
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,373
and grows in the Light,

178
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,275
from sending his minions
to bring death

179
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,410
to every living thing.

180
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,178
Creatures from the Underworld,

181
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,481
banelings
returning from the dead

182
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,682
to terrorize the living.

183
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,954
How many of you were aware
it was the Seeker

184
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,956
who unleashed these horrors
upon the world?

185
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,457
( indistinct muttering )

186
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,693
I didn't do it intentionally.

187
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,595
And I've sworn
to find the Stone.

188
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,597
And if you should find it,
what will you do with it?

189
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,098
Use it to seal the rift.

190
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,068
Are you aware of a Prophecy
that says otherwise?

191
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,807
Yes.

192
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,976
(Richard)
<i>"In the time</i>
<i>of the tearing of the veil,</i>

193
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:14,013
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

194
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,450
"he will find it,
only to deliver it

195
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,652
to the Enemy of the Light."

196
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,988
The Creator herself
gives us these Prophecies

197
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,657
to guide our actions.

198
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,526
And yet you continue
your search for the Stone.

199
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,161
I don't believe in Prophecy.

200
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:31,296
The Prophecy comes from me.

201
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,197
Are you saying you don't
believe in the Creator?

202
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,933
( crowd muttering )

203
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,974
Open your shirt.

204
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,081
Tell everyone what that is.

205
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,086
It's the Mark of the Keeper.

206
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,490
( all gasp )

207
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,824
How did you receive it?

208
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,395
RAHL:
<i>You are for the Keeper.</i>

209
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,365
( screaming )

210
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,533
What did Rahl mean,

211
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,101
"You are <i>for</i> the Keeper"?

212
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:15,239
Maybe Rahl marked him
because he wanted the Creator

213
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,442
to believe that Richard
had turned against her.

214
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,580
If you really are she,
apparently his plan is working.

215
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,282
The Mark is only bestowed

216
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,117
upon the Keeper's
most loyal servants.

217
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,418
Maia!

218
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,788
Thank the Spirits!

219
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,423
I heard the Creator
had returned

220
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,091
and knew in my heart
it must be you.

221
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,692
Who are you?

222
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,862
I'm her mother.

223
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,600
It is wonderful
to see you again, Mother.

224
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,313
You have a mother?

225
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:52,825
I was born into this world
as all of you were.

226
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,661
You say you're here
to destroy Richard,

227
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,662
but he would've been
just a child when you were born.

228
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,397
I could foresee the horrors

229
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,831
that will one day
threaten the world.

230
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:05,068
So 20 years ago, I caused myself
to be born to this woman,

231
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,870
knowing my divine strength
would manifest when I needed it.

232
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,671
That's absurd.

233
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,940
What do you mean,
"manifest"?

234
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,409
This mortal body
couldn't contain my powers

235
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,278
until it came of age.

236
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,447
Creator, more people suffering
from the blight

237
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,884
have come for you
to heal them.

238
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,753
As soon as I've done so,
we will resume.

239
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:35,092
I always knew one day
she would embrace her divinity.

240
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,260
She doubted it?

241
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,729
It was a heavy burden
for a young girl.

242
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,397
She wanted to be
like everyone else.

243
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,365
But I always knew
my daughter

244
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,068
was the living incarnation
of the Creator.

245
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,436
The truth came to me in a vision
before she was born.

246
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,739
When did you see her last?

247
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,173
Two summers ago.

248
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,743
She ran off with a boy
from our village, Jason.

249
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,611
The Creator ran off
with a boy...

250
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,846
She was at that age.

251
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,280
I knew I had
to let her go,

252
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,183
and have faith tt one day
she would see the truth.

253
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:05,451
And now she has.

254
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,818
And where is Jason?

255
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,354
They lived in a cabin
south of Rivermore.

256
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,889
Please excuse me.

257
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,823
I want to be with my daughter.

258
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,225
My Creator.

259
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,030
They're both mad.

260
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:23,732
Maybe so.

261
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,933
Find this Jason.

262
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,501
Mm.

263
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,870
You've left a trail of corpses
in your search for the Stone,

264
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,406
and yet you continue to kill,
knowing that every soul

265
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:34,275
you send to the Keeper
makes him more powerful.

266
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,877
I only kill
to protect my friends

267
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,246
or other innocent people.

268
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:41,381
And even then, I only do it
when there's no other choice.

269
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,316
( men grunting )

270
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,956
So you've never killed
for any other reason?

271
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:53,260
Or when you could have defeated
an enemy some other way?

272
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:56,031
Yes, once...

273
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:57,466
( women screaming )

274
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,878
(Richard)
<i>But I wasn't myself.</i>

275
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,279
You could've taken those men
prisoner,

276
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,646
but instead
you slaughtered them.

277
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,878
They were slavers and murderers.

278
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,280
And it wasn't Richard's fault.

279
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,315
He was possessed
by an ancient spell,

280
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,451
and I taught him
to control it.

281
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,090
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

282
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,193
Who dragged you into this fight?

283
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:39,631
Who are you angry at?

284
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,668
You.

285
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:47,071
Now we're getting somewhere.

286
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,939
All those years,
you knew who I was

287
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,040
and you said nothing.

288
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,975
You lied to me
about being my grandfather.

289
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,709
You weren't ready for the truth.

290
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,577
You took me out of Hartland.

291
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,246
You named me the Seeker.

292
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:03,818
You're the one who gave me
this damned Sword!

293
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,219
Richard, no!

294
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,853
No.

295
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:09,355
He has to stop himself.

296
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:11,790
Ahh! Uh.

297
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:17,863
Uh.

298
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:19,397
He may have refrained
from killing you,

299
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,963
but that doesn't
change the fact

300
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,430
that he sent
slavers and murderers

301
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:26,199
to the Underworld to join
the Keeper's army of souls.

302
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,969
Only because of the magic
that possessed him.

303
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,237
But he was strong enough
to overcome it.

304
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:33,572
So you were convinced
it was over,

305
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:37,474
that Richard would never again
succumb to his rage?

306
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,080
It's okay, Zedd.

307
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:47,817
We're here to tell the truth.

308
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:54,123
I did have some doubts.

309
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:56,793
Kahlan, there's part
of the Minders' story

310
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:59,062
I didn't tell him.

311
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:02,532
Canton Rahl, the man who first
put the spell on the Minders,

312
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,035
wasn't always bloodthirsty.

313
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:08,605
He started out as a protector
and benefactor to his people.

314
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:11,708
But then as his powers grew,

315
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,010
he began to fight and to kill,

316
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,579
and the more he killed,

317
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,315
the more the blood lust
overtook him.

318
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,750
He went mad with it.

319
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:24,487
And now we know
that darkness is in Richard.

320
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,491
(Kahlan)
But Richard learned
to control the Sword.

321
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:29,293
He mastered his rage.

322
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,894
Yes.

323
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:33,430
He controlled the Sword today.

324
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:34,932
But what about tomorrow?

325
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:42,238
But my doubts were fleeting.

326
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,641
I am convinced that any rage
Richard may still carry

327
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,544
will never again
get the better of him.

328
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:53,182
How can you be so sure?

329
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,618
Because I've given up the magic
that fueled my anger.

330
00:16:57,854 --> 00:17:00,022
Tell us how you did that.

331
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,324
(Woman)
<i>Say the words with me.</i>

332
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,259
( chanting in ancient tongue )

333
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:19,441
Uh!

334
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:24,614
You were the most powerful
wizard born in 3000 years,

335
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:27,249
yet you gave your powers
to someone you hardly knew.

336
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,584
The magic would have killed me.

337
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:30,186
I didn't have a choice.

338
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,354
You could have stayed
at the Palace of the Prophets,

339
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,723
mastered your wizard powers,

340
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,126
learned how to use them
to serve me.

341
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,862
The Sisters of the Light
told you this,

342
00:17:38,863 --> 00:17:40,029
but you didn't listen.

343
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,229
They lied to me.

344
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,630
Because they were afraid

345
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,763
you would resume your mission
in service of the Keeper,

346
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,031
which is exactly
what happened.

347
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,499
I don't serve the Keeper.

348
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,101
No? Tell us.

349
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,203
This woman
you gave your powers to.

350
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,271
Is she a Sister of the Light?

351
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,939
No, she's a Sister
of the Dark.

352
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,076
And whom do
the Sisters of the Dark serve?

353
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,076
The Keeper.

354
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,577
( crowd gasping )

355
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:04,712
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

356
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,381
You knew this, and yet you still
gave this woman your powers.

357
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:10,985
I made sure she couldn't
keep using them.

358
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:31,506
Now the Sisters
won't be able to follow you.

359
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:35,275
All that power. Useless.

360
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,144
With the rada'han
around her neck,

361
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,078
she couldn't use my magic.

362
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,615
So she was never able
to harm anyone, ever again?

363
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,651
No. She escaped.
I don't know how.

364
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,952
I do.

365
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,889
The Keeper has agents
everywhere,

366
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,590
and not all of them
walk on two legs.

367
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:25,952
Your magic, your han,
was a divine gift from me,

368
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,521
but you gave it willingly
to a Sister of the Dark.

369
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:31,723
How can you expect us
to believe

370
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,224
that you are not
an agent of the Keeper?

371
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,807
Richard.

372
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,946
Hey, what are you thinking?

373
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:47,947
Honestly?

374
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:50,583
Yeah.

375
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:55,288
I'm thinking maybe
the Prophecy is true.

376
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,925
Maybe I'll fail.

377
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:01,561
You've always said
you don't believe in Prophecy.

378
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:05,530
There was a Prophecy
that said I'd defeat Rahl.

379
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,898
Maybe I can't ignore
this one

380
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,235
just because I don't like
what it says about me.

381
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,705
Richard, this woman,

382
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,506
I don't know
if she is the Creator

383
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:15,542
or some kind of charlatan.

384
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,243
Cara's trying to find out.

385
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:21,681
But whoever she is,
tomorrow,

386
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,250
we're going to tell
your side of the story.

387
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:26,352
She and everyone else here

388
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:30,289
is going to see
what I have never doubted.

389
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,691
Your heart is pure.

390
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:37,363
You are and always will be
on the side of good.

391
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:40,966
What if I'm not?

392
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,401
How can you say that?

393
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:45,370
I'd never willfully
do the Keeper's bidding.

394
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:50,176
But what if I'm serving him
without even realizing it.

395
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:51,843
Maybe that's what this is.

396
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:54,745
Some way of controlling me.

397
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,848
Making me think the wrong
decision is the right one.

398
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,621
Maybe I'm an agent of the Keeper
and I don't even know it.

399
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:15,568
Hello?

400
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:24,610
Jason?

401
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,482
( women grunting )

402
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,097
( cries out )

403
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:55,738
I'm guessing you're Jason.

404
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,572
Are you going to kill me too?

405
00:21:57,573 --> 00:22:00,141
Not if you tell me the truth
about Maia.

406
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,117
( gasps )

407
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,020
What a pleasure this is.

408
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:13,357
It's not often I'm fortunate
enough to enjoy the company

409
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:18,262
of two such devout
Sisters of the Light.

410
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:19,597
I would offer you the chance

411
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:21,799
to return to the world
as banelings,

412
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,436
but alas,
you're both far too pious

413
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:27,606
to accept the Keeper's
generous proposal.

414
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,976
Do your worst to us,
Darken Rahl.

415
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,442
You and your Master
will soon be finished,

416
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:38,141
now that the Creator
has returned

417
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:40,275
to defeat all those
who serve the Darkness.

418
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,210
Returned?

419
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,445
How?

420
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,780
Where?

421
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:50,718
You will soon learn everything.

422
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,687
But not from us.

423
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,456
Then allow me
to loosen your tongues.

424
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,194
( screaming )

425
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:06,602
(Kahlan)
The Seeker is an agent
of light and justice.

426
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:09,438
And I have faith
that every one of you

427
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,908
will soon shed any doubts
that you may have about him.

428
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,944
Every one of you.

429
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,677
No one has slain more

430
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:19,411
of the Keeper's servants
than Richard.

431
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:21,644
Perhaps most terrifying of all

432
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:25,279
was a creature
known as a screeling.

433
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,680
Tell us what happened
when one of them

434
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:28,848
crawled out of the rift.

435
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,683
It attacked the people
of Ehrengard.

436
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:33,253
( loud squealing )

437
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:35,189
( men yelling and grunting )

438
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,594
Hey!

439
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:40,996
( <i>heroic theme playing</i> )

440
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:45,602
You wanna rip somebody's
head off, take mine!

441
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:51,907
Ahh!

442
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:55,110
( grunting )

443
00:23:57,547 --> 00:24:00,416
Uh, Zedd, now! Ah.

444
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:05,754
( screeching stops )

445
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,373
( crowd cheering )

446
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,745
Richard killed
the Keeper's pet,

447
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,548
but the Keeper
has many fearsome servants.

448
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:39,519
I'm sure by now
you all know about banelings.

449
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,658
Ordinary people,
men, women, even children

450
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,227
who have died but agreed to kill
for the Keeper every day

451
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:49,329
in exchange for a second life.

452
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,997
Tell us about the first time

453
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,267
you encountered
this horrible new enemy.

454
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,403
It was at a place
called Tothrayne.

455
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:57,937
(Men)
Uhh!

456
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:59,973
( men grunting and shouting )

457
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,111
(Man)
They've all gone!

458
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,513
(Richard)
Not all of us.

459
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:15,921
Welcome back to Tothrayne.

460
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:18,157
Ahh!

461
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,459
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

462
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,203
Ahh!

463
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,914
Why would the Seeker
have slaughtered

464
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:45,915
so many of the Keeper's minions

465
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,451
if he himself
were an agent of the Keeper?

466
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,186
What better way for Richard
to gain the trust

467
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,920
of t Mother Confessor
and the First Wizard

468
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:54,756
than to slay a few
of the Keeper's pawns?

469
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:56,492
You may have destroyed
a few banelings,

470
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:58,394
but isn't it true
that there are thousands of them

471
00:25:58,395 --> 00:26:00,596
wandering the land,
biding their time

472
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:03,564
until they can make
their next kill?

473
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,879
Lord Rahl.

474
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,847
How may I serve you?

475
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:23,614
I've been told that
the Creator has returned

476
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,784
to the World of the Living
as flesh and blood.

477
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,253
I'm instructing all my banelings
to search for her.

478
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,492
If it's true, she shouldn't
be hard to find.

479
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,796
Surely the deluded masses
will be abuzz

480
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,299
with the news of her arrival.

481
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,169
I will try to find her,
My Lord.

482
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,173
But if it is true,
she will be trying to seal us

483
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:44,375
back in the Underworld
for all eternity.

484
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:46,610
If the Creator has been
foolish enough to return

485
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,680
in a mortal body,
then she is vulnerable,

486
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:53,816
and it is I who shall
extinguish Her Light

487
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:56,952
for all eternity.

488
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,141
Tell us, Seeker,

489
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:03,543
have you seen Darken Rahl again,
since the day he marked you?

490
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:06,745
Yes. In the Underworld.

491
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:09,781
( crowd gasping )

492
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,816
And how did you come
to be there?

493
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:13,918
I was killed.

494
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,921
Goodbye, Seeker.

495
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,959
(Richard)
<i>And when I opened my eyes,</i>

496
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,062
<i>I was in a sea of dead souls.</i>

497
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:26,399
( souls grunting and yelling )

498
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:37,341
How wonderful to see you again,
my brother.

499
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:39,576
Welcome to the Underworld.

500
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:45,582
And what did he say to you?

501
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,951
He made me an offer.

502
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:49,453
Become a baneling.

503
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:52,123
Return to your body
before it's too late.

504
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,958
You're a fool if you think
I'm going to kill

505
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,793
to serve the Keeper.

506
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:57,394
You've already killed
enough people

507
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:59,563
to earn yourself
a place of honor here.

508
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,131
What difference
will a few more make?

509
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:03,601
I won't do the Keeper's bidding.

510
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:06,303
You do the Keeper's bidding
every time you take a life.

511
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:10,340
The reason you kill
doesn't make a difference.

512
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:12,376
You want to see your beloved
Kahlan again, don't you?

513
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:16,880
Kahlan will go on without me,
and so will Zedd.

514
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,981
He'll name a new Seeker.

515
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:22,985
They'll find the Stone of Tears
and seal the rift,

516
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:23,987
and you and your master

517
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:25,855
will be trapped
in this pit forever.

518
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:28,224
Why would the Seeker
turn down an offer

519
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,625
for a second chance at life

520
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:33,729
if he is now, and was then,
an agent of the Keeper?

521
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,265
We have only Richard's word
for what he and his brother

522
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,300
said to each other that day.

523
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,537
Even I cannot see
into the realm of Death.

524
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:46,208
Would you have us believe that
Richard accepted Rahl's offer?

525
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:47,743
That he is a baneling?

526
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,845
No, the Keeper and his agents
are too clever.

527
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:53,448
They knew Richard
would be brought back

528
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:55,950
to the world
of the living by other means.

529
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,484
Tell us how it is
that the Seeker

530
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,120
is standing here again today

531
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,928
We used magic to revive him.

532
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:14,602
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

533
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,746
Richard?

534
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,788
( sighs )

535
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,791
Richard didn't need
to become a baneling

536
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,960
because he knew the people
he had tricked into loving him

537
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,562
would stop at nothing
to bring him back.

538
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:46,233
You have revealed
through Prophecy that

539
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,369
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

540
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,104
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

541
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:51,204
I have.

542
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,206
Then it stands to reason

543
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:56,243
that if the Seeker
were an agent of the Keeper,

544
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:57,945
he would have killed
the Mother Confessor

545
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:00,980
as so many of the Keeper's
minions have tried to do.

546
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:07,887
And yet, the Seeker has done
precisely the opposite.

547
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,757
Tell us, Mother Confessor,

548
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:15,059
how many times
has the Seeker saved your life?

549
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,996
More times than I can remember.

550
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:20,497
The first was the day we met.

551
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,798
Stay back!

552
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,066
Shoot her.

553
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,503
Ahh!

554
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,439
Leave her alone!

555
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,973
(Kahlan)
<i>He saved me again at Tothrayne.</i>

556
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:35,912
Uh!

557
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,550
<i>He did it again at Stowecroft.</i>

558
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:50,092
The Mother Confessor's word
is final.

559
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:52,427
These heroic deeds you describe,

560
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:54,797
they all happened before
I revealed my Prophecy.

561
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,501
Even after the Prophecy
was known to him,

562
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:01,270
the Seeker protected
the Mother Confessor's life

563
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:03,439
when it was threatened
by a Sister of the Dark.

564
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,609
If you don't do as I say,
the Mother Confessor will die.

565
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,750
We can't let her do this.

566
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,851
She's using my life
as a weapon against you.

567
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,620
Right now,
we don't have a choice.

568
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:20,222
Zedd will find a way
to undo the spell.

569
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,992
Whatever happens,

570
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:26,394
do not let her get the stone.

571
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:30,765
I won't let anything
happen to you.

572
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,168
So you left the Mother Confessor
to go with a Sister of the Dark.

573
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:34,770
Why?

574
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,305
She cast a maternity spell.

575
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:37,973
Anything that would happen
to the Sister

576
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:39,141
would happen to Kahlan.

577
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:41,076
I had to protect her.

578
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:43,412
Then you found a way
to remove the spell?

579
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:44,580
No. Zedd did.

580
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:47,482
So it was in fact
the First Wizard

581
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,451
who saved
the Mother Confessor's life

582
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,453
while you used a pretext
to spend days alone

583
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:52,554
with a Sister of the Dark.

584
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,989
You're twisting
everything I say!

585
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,524
If Richard
were working for the Keeper,

586
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,492
why hasn't he simply
run me through with his Sword?

587
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:00,994
Because he needs your help
to find the Stone.

588
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:05,165
But if I allow him to find it,
he will no doubt kill you,

589
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,668
deliver the Stone to the Keeper,
and the World will be lost.

590
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:10,737
( crowd gasping )

591
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,609
(Cara)
Richard! Kahlan!

592
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,746
Don't listen to her.
This woman is a fraud.

593
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:19,813
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

594
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,995
This man is Maia's husband.

595
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:28,296
They were living a quiet life

596
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:33,766
until the Sisters of the Light
abducted her.

597
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:34,933
I went with them willingly.

598
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:37,668
Because they put
some kind of spell on you, Maia.

599
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,670
That's not true, Jason.

600
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:42,339
The Sisters
are my most devoted servants.

601
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,174
Is that why they were
holding Jason prisoner

602
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:47,143
and tried to kill me?

603
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:48,277
They were protecting Jason,

604
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:51,147
helping him accept my Light.

605
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,054
Jason, tell us
about your life with Maia.

606
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:03,027
We were so happy
until they came.

607
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:11,736
Creator.

608
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,943
At last we've found you.

609
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:21,012
This is madness!

610
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:22,680
The Sacred Scrolls told us
we would find you

611
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,882
in this province on this day,
and here you are.

612
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:27,684
Get out of our house!

613
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,526
We both knew
this day might come.

614
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,962
Because of your mother's
visions.

615
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:42,131
She's out of her mind,
you told me so yourself.

616
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:48,169
I tried to deny it, but I can
see now I was wrong.

617
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,104
These Sisters have come for me,

618
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:52,540
just as my mother
always said they would.

619
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:56,077
Maia, you're not the Creator,

620
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:58,012
you're my wife.

621
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:00,515
I don't know what kind of spell
they've put on you,

622
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:03,084
but I won't let you go.

623
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:06,053
Creator,
I know you love this man

624
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,522
as you love
all your children.

625
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:11,059
And it would be dangerous for
him if he tried to follow us.

626
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,228
Perhaps one of my Sisters
and I should stay behind,

627
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:15,896
watch over him,

628
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:20,101
help him to accept the truth
of who you really are.

629
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,771
Maia?

630
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,678
I'm sorry, Jason,

631
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,948
but I must go with them.

632
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,884
The fate of the world I created
depends on it.

633
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:42,652
Maia.

634
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,523
Maia.

635
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:53,259
Jason, before that day, have you
ever seen Maia use magic?

636
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,960
No.

637
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,362
She was an ordinary girl.

638
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:01,733
So how does an ordinary girl
suddenly become the Creator?

639
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:05,270
I told you, my divine strength
could not manifest

640
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,906
until my body was mature enough
to contain it.

641
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:11,375
So tell us,
did the Sisters of the Light

642
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,644
help you manifest
this divine strength?

643
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,647
Yes,

644
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,382
exactly as the ancient scrolls
predicted.

645
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:26,055
The scrolls also tell us
you are to destroy

646
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:29,424
the Keeper's deadliest servant,
the Seeker.

647
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:31,795
Destroy the Seeker?

648
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,065
Why?

649
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:36,235
We tried to show Richard
the path to your light,

650
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,670
but he refused us.

651
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:41,240
You are the only one who will
have the power to stop him.

652
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:44,710
What power
are you talking about, Prelate?

653
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,244
I don't have any magic.

654
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,613
This has always been
the holy purpose

655
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:49,814
of the Sisters of the Light.

656
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,316
For centuries,
we have been gathering

657
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,684
the most powerful han
in the world,

658
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,754
preparing for this day

659
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:59,857
when we would return
that power to its divine source.

660
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,625
You.

661
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,527
One by one, the Sisters
surrendered their han to me.

662
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:06,562
( chanting in ancient tongue )

663
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,801
How many of them
gave you their magic?

664
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,537
All of them.

665
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:20,473
( chanting continues )

666
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,880
You're not the Creator.

667
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:30,184
The Sisters of the Light
created you.

668
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:34,889
The Prelate lied to you,
just like she lied to Richard.

669
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,526
Silence. There is another
agent of the Keeper among us.

670
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:39,694
( crowd whispering )

671
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:43,798
Baneling!

672
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,535
Zedd!

673
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,336
Ahh!

674
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:54,708
You have nothing to fear.
Now that I have returned,

675
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:58,245
all the servants
of the Keeper will be destroyed.

676
00:36:58,246 --> 00:36:59,813
All of them.

677
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:00,848
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

678
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:09,077
I sincerely hope your demise
was not in vain, Drago.

679
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:12,682
No, My Lord. I found her.

680
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:16,252
The Creator.
You're certain?

681
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:17,487
Yes.

682
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:19,056
She's at the Monument
of Ardris.

683
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:24,128
She's there to pass judgment
on the Seeker.

684
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:25,630
(Keeper)
<i>The Creator, are you certain?</i>

685
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:29,067
As certain as I can be, Master.

686
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:32,104
She has demonstrated
great power.

687
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,672
She has cured the blight

688
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:35,073
our banelings
have been spreading.

689
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,743
(Keeper)
<i>Open a rift, bring her to me.</i>

690
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,413
I will do as you command,
Keeper,

691
00:37:40,414 --> 00:37:44,351
but my baneling has told me
the Seeker is with her.

692
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:47,421
If I open a rift
then he will die too,

693
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:49,723
and we cannot let that happen,
not yet.

694
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:50,757
He is too valuable.

695
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,826
The Creator herself
has prophesied

696
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,793
that he will deliver us
the Stone of Tears.

697
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:58,294
(Keeper)
<i>Open a rift, Darken Rahl.</i>

698
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:00,690
<i>I've been separated</i>
<i>from the Creator</i>

699
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:02,223
<i>since the world began.</i>

700
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:05,857
<i>I must know that this woman</i>
<i>is truly my beloved.</i>

701
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:08,861
<i>Use all the power</i>
<i>I've bestowed upon you</i>

702
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:12,464
<i>and bring her to me now.</i>

703
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:13,932
The Sisters of the Light

704
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,134
have been working against
Richard from the beginning.

705
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:18,703
First, they trapped him
in their palace.

706
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:21,906
Then they left him to die
in the Valley of Perdition.

707
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:27,610
When they failed, they sent
a false Creator to execute him.

708
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:31,413
This hearing is over.
My judgment is final.

709
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:33,081
Richard Rahl is an agent
of the Keeper

710
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:35,482
and will be destroyed.

711
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:39,285
You're not going to lay a finger
on my grandson.

712
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,686
Stand aside.

713
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,589
All of you.

( <i>epic theme playing</i> )

715
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:56,570
Cara, no!

716
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:59,306
Ah!

717
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:01,542
( rumbling )

718
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:06,347
(Woman)
What's happening?

719
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:07,347
Maia?

720
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,349
(Man)
Run!

721
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,217
It's the Keeper.

722
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:12,753
He's opening a rift
directly under us!

723
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:16,658
Let's get these people
outta here!

724
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:19,161
(Zedd)
Run back!

725
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:25,668
Get down.

726
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:28,170
Come on, come on, get up.

727
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:54,698
We gotta get outta here,
come on.

728
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,334
No. I can close the rift.

729
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:04,974
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

730
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,493
( panting )

731
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:28,696
(Keeper)
<i>You have failed me,</i>
<i>Darken Rahl!</i>

732
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:31,631
Forgive me, Master.

733
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,904
Why did you push me
out of the way?

734
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:46,174
I don't know
if you're the Creator or not,

735
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,743
but either way
you're flesh and blood.

736
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:50,079
That stone
would have killed you.

737
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,815
The Seeker risked his life
to save yours,

738
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:55,717
even after you condemned
him to death.

739
00:40:58,153 --> 00:40:59,887
The truth couldn't be clearer.

740
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:04,759
Richard is good.

741
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,327
You have to see that.

742
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,197
You can't destroy him.

743
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:14,600
I used all my han
to seal the rift.

744
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:16,002
I couldn't destroy
the Seeker now,

745
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:17,970
even if I wanted to.

746
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:20,505
( sighs )

747
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:26,143
But the Mother Confessor
is right.

748
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:27,844
I can see now by his actions

749
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,312
that the Seeker
is clearly on the side

750
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:31,347
of good and Light.

751
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,585
( compass chirps )

752
00:41:38,754 --> 00:41:40,121
(Richard)
It's working again.

753
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:44,191
Without her powers,
Maia can't quell its magic.

754
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,692
Which way is it telling us
to go?

755
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:48,862
Maybe we don't need
to know.

756
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:52,032
Maia, can you tell us
where to find the Stone?

757
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,200
( crowd gasping )

758
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:53,434
(Kahlan)
She's gone.

759
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:04,723
The Creator?
She was just a deluded girl

760
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:08,327
who was manipulated
by the Sisters of the Light.

761
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,362
I can't explain
some of the things she knew

762
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,063
about Richard and me.

763
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,499
You were raised
by the Sisters of the Light,

764
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,468
and Richard was a prisoner
in their Palace.

765
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:19,003
They obviously told Maia
what they knew.

766
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,072
Some of the things Maia knew
I never told anyone.

767
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:25,809
With that much power, maybe
she could read our thoughts.

768
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,214
There is another possibility.

769
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:32,350
Maybe she was exactly
who she claimed to be.
