1
00:00:00,865 --> 00:00:02,835
My Lord, we've done it.

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:06,125
We've located
the Third Box of Orden.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,798
Where?

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,343
The tracer cloud has come
to rest over the Plains of Morrow.

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,630
So close to the People's Palace?

6
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,473
The Wizard is being brazen.

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,535
Perhaps it's some kind of ploy.

8
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:21,895
No doubt Zeddicus is using magic
to protect the box somehow.

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,500
Send a battalion
to the Plains of Morrow.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,515
Tell them to find the box
at any cost.

11
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,415
Yes, My Lord. At once.

12
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,045
Egremont, do you remember
your D'Haran history?

13
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:44,395
My Lord?

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,587
The Battle of the Plains of Morrow,

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,674
turning point in the Great Wizard War,
3,000 years ago.

16
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,343
I studied it in my youth, My Lord.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,949
But do you know why,

18
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:56,960
to this day, the grass

19
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,266
on the Plains of Morrow
is always green,

20
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:02,687
in all seasons,
through blizzard and drought?

21
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,150
Because it grows

22
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:09,275
in the bones and blood of the Wizards
massacred in the battle.

23
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:10,805
Zeddicus

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,948
must be using their magic
to shield the box somehow.

25
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,118
Whoever finds the Box of Orden
will be honored

26
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,485
and rewarded by Lord Rahl himself.

27
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,225
Would anyone else
like to walk away from their duty?

28
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,484
Find the Box of Orden.

29
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,030
For Darken Rahl,

30
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,446
and for D'Hara!

31
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,170
1x16 - <i>Bloodline</i>

32
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:18,280
What are you doing?

33
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,556
Well, I thought you wanted me
to keep you sharp.

34
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,437
I didn't say kill me.

35
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:30,107
If I got that close to killing you,
apparently you need the practice.

36
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,207
I leave for a fortnight and you two
are at each other's throats.

37
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,712
One more day, and we were gonna
come looking for you.

38
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:57,040
- Where have you been?
- Disposing of the box.

39
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,553
Which is, at long last,
safely hidden.

40
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,847
- Where?
- Under Rahl's nose,

41
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,017
surrounded by seven concentric walls
of lethal magic.

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,720
Eventually his lordship

43
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,525
will run out of men
to fling against my fortifications,

44
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,495
and go after the box himself.

45
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:15,110
- And when he does...
- He'll wish he hadn't.

46
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,601
My Lord.

47
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,215
Why do you make me hurt you
like this?

48
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:53,524
I'm sorry I failed you, My Lord.

49
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,165
So you have claimed, too many times.

50
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:59,835
The fact remains, you let the Seeker
slip from your grasp.

51
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,565
I deserve my punishment.

52
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,578
And more.

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,755
Release me,

54
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:20,890
and I'll show you such pleasure
that all will be forgiven.

55
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,721
Pleasure, alas, must wait.

56
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,433
I have learned the exact location
of the Third Box of Orden,

57
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,810
but my men have failed
to retrieve it.

58
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,535
Send me.

59
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,273
I will succeed.

60
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:38,235
I should never have sent men
to do a Mord-Sith's job.

61
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,415
But you would not want
to disappoint me again, Denna.

62
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,565
I will return with the box.

63
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,075
But you won't be able
to do it alone.

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
First,

65
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,755
you need to capture the one person

66
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,893
that I fear most in all the world.

67
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,365
The Seeker will not escape me again.

68
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,135
Someone far more fearsome than he.

69
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,630
Mother.

70
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,725
Hello, Jennsen.

71
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,012
I'm sorry I had to hurt your mother.

72
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:50,349
But I'm here on extremely
important business.

73
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:53,885
Important to the peace and the happiness
of the whole world,

74
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,856
and I need to be sure
that I can count on your help.

75
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,665
Let her go.
Please.

76
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:02,195
First,

77
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,322
I need you to do something for me.

78
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,783
- And for Lord Rahl.
- Jennsen, no.

79
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,284
Whatever she asks,

80
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,452
don't...

81
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,919
I really hope you won't make me
kill your mother, Jennsen.

82
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,925
Somewhere in this field
is a jeweled box.

83
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,245
Find it.

84
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:30,806
Why do I need a shovel?

85
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,145
You can see it?

86
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,565
The Wizard made it invisible.

87
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:41,775
It's been right here all along.

88
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,535
Bring it to me.

89
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,215
These men...

90
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,485
What happened to them?

91
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,035
Killed by the Wizard's magic
when they tried to retrieve the box.

92
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,746
Then how am I supposed to get it?

93
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,685
You never told her.

94
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,127
Told me what?

95
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,775
Forgive me, Jennsen.

96
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:04,923
I was hoping
you would never have to know.

97
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,555
Allow me, Jennsen,

98
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,969
to be the one to show you

99
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,305
how very far from ordinary

100
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,931
you really are.

101
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,005
Once every generation or so,

102
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,321
a child is born

103
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,241
upon whom
magic has no effect whatsoever.

104
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,665
You're a very special girl, Jennsen.

105
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,371
Now get me the box.

106
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,517
Let my mother go.

107
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,205
When she has a head start,
I'll give you the box.

108
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:06,068
Do you think you're in a position
to negotiate with me?

109
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:10,781
Take it. Please. I'm sorry.

110
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,913
What is that?

111
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,745
A magical alarm,

112
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,294
in case someone, somehow,
managed to get the box.

113
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:26,880
How could anyone
have broken through your magic?

114
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:31,885
Brilliant.

115
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,804
The Wizard put a signal spell on it.

116
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,680
No doubt he's already racing this way,
with the Seeker and the Confessor.

117
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:38,976
I did what you wanted.

118
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,985
Please, let us go.

119
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,265
I can't let you go, Jennsen.

120
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:48,277
I need you to carry that box
to the People's Palace yourself.

121
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,362
I can't get it there safely
without you.

122
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,105
Don't help her. Let her kill me.

123
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,455
Look at them, Jennsen.

124
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,125
Look.

125
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,870
Did the Wizard

126
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,213
give a thought to the innocent men
he would

127
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,651
brutally slaughter?

128
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,176
To their fatherless children?

129
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,770
He thought only
of protecting the treasure

130
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,932
which he stole from Darken Rahl,

131
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,570
who seeks only to spread peace

132
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,769
- throughout the Midlands...
- She's lying to you.

133
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,354
Ask yourself, Jennsen:

134
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,825
which of us is really the liar here?

135
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,568
Why has your mother
hidden your powers

136
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,625
from you all these years?

137
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,572
Why has she hidden you,

138
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,040
like some dirty,

139
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,034
shameful secret?

140
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,745
Darken Rahl has dreamt of universal
peace ever since he was a little boy.

141
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,230
But now, the Seeker
has returned to the Midlands

142
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,880
and is relentlessly trying
to destroy that dream.

143
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,440
You never told me any of this.

144
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:55,330
But Lord Rahl knows
that the Seeker is only a puppet

145
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,555
dancing on strings jerked
this way and that by a Wizard.

146
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,224
In his wisdom

147
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:01,719
and his mercy,

148
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,312
Lord Rahl sent me to offer
the Seeker a chance to stand

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,940
at his side and declare peace
throughout the territories.

150
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:12,069
And do you know how the Seeker
greeted this offer?

151
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,989
He ran me through
with the Sword of Lies

152
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:18,155
and left me for dead.

153
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,702
You told me the Seeker was a hero.

154
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,912
He is a hero.

155
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:26,166
Why did you lie to me
about who I am?

156
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,985
You've seen
what a monster this woman is.

157
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,797
How can you believe
one word she says?

158
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:34,758
I don't know who the monster is.

159
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,465
I don't know anything anymore.

160
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,225
Jennsen?

161
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,185
Get it back!

162
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,197
There.

163
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,872
I underestimated you, Jennsen.

164
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:11,285
But not as tragically
as you have underestimated me.

165
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,375
Please. Stop.

166
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,849
I'm the one who threw the box.

167
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,615
Punish me!

168
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,435
Denna?

169
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:40,145
She's alive.

170
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:49,495
She's holding the Agiel,

171
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,419
- it's not hurting her. How can she do?
- Because

172
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,756
she is pristinely ungifted.

173
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,275
Stay back.

174
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,224
That's the other side of your gift.

175
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,435
Not only can't you be
harmed by magic,

176
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,188
but you can't use it, either.

177
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,857
You have a lot to learn
about yourself.

178
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:18,545
The pristinely ungifted
are entirely immune to magic,

179
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,115
but they rarely survive
past childhood.

180
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,032
- Why not?
- For generations,

181
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,595
the House of Rahl has found them

182
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,623
and murdered them at birth.

183
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Why?

184
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:33,460
Because Rahl's magic
can't hurt them,

185
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,095
or enslave them.

186
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:38,265
What would be more dangerous to him?

187
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,225
Mistress!

188
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,205
I have the box.

189
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,415
Now bind her hands to it
and bind them both to the horse.

190
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:47,790
And hurry.

191
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:51,144
If the Wizard and his friends haven't
already found us, they soon will.

192
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,658
Defend the box.

193
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:11,164
You look like you've seen a ghost.

194
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:02,665
Run!

195
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:04,455
Taralyn?

196
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:13,195
Let me go!

197
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,590
- I have to help my mother!
- We will. We will.

198
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,939
As soon as we get the box
as far away from Denna as we can.

199
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,665
If it will save my mother,
I'll give it to her.

200
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,486
If Darken Rahl gets this box,

201
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,130
we'll all be slaves,
everybody in the world.

202
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,157
And your mother would be
as good as dead anyway.

203
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,760
I don't even know you.

204
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,285
Why should I listen to you?

205
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,370
Because he's the Seeker.

206
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,875
If you're the Seeker,

207
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,405
then that woman Denna is torturing

208
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,216
is your mother too.

209
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,925
I was born three years
after the massacre at Brennidon.

210
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,405
My mother,

211
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,355
oour mother,

212
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:02,445
held me in her arms for eight days
after I was born,

213
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:06,275
because she was afraid I would be
taken away from her like you were.

214
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,745
She's still afraid
to let me out of her sight.

215
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,675
Every year,

216
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:15,372
she lights candles
for your birthday,

217
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:18,935
imagines what you look like,

218
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,305
how tall you are,
if you have freckles.

219
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,605
Zedd, you knew my mother.

220
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,003
Could it really be her?

221
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,054
Then...

222
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:35,295
Then what?

223
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:46,736
I'm not here to fight. I'm here to
deliver a message from Mistress Denna.

224
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:49,410
She holds the girl's mother
at the Cave of Sorrows.

225
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,658
You bring the box or she dies.

226
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:53,995
You have until nightfall.

227
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,415
We have to go. Now.

228
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,595
I'm sorry, child,

229
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:04,120
but we cannot forfeit the final
Box of Orden for one person's life.

230
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:05,785
That's easy for you to say.

231
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:08,985
She's not your mother.

232
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,535
She's my daughter.

233
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,401
I am your grandfather.

234
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,991
And apparently yours as well, child.

235
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:50,737
All this time,

236
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:53,970
and you never told me?

237
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,767
I was afraid you might have to choose
between the mission and family.

238
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,987
I never wanted to put you
in that position.

239
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:09,402
Did you know?

240
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:13,547
- I wanted to tell you.
- I asked her not to.

241
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,061
What am I to you two?

242
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:22,426
Just a pair of hands
to hold the Sword of Truth

243
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,801
and fulfill your precious Prophecy?

244
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:28,579
Who's our father?

245
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:29,854
I don't know.

246
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,270
I don't even know
if we have the same one.

247
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:35,586
Every time I tried to talk about it,
Mother got so angry, or sad,

248
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:37,611
so I finally stopped asking.

249
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:42,102
- I'm going after her.
- Richard, wait.

250
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,070
For what? There's no time.

251
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,351
I'll give Denna the box,
I'll get Taralyn safe,

252
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:50,527
then I'll follow Denna, get the box back
before she delivers it to Rahl.

253
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,831
- And if you don't catch her in time?
- How can you just stand there

254
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,491
and let your own daughter
be tortured by a Mord-Sith?

255
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,758
Your mother gave up
her first-born child for a reason.

256
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,317
She knew that you were born to stop Rahl
from enslaving the world.

257
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:09,170
She knew that you had to survive,
no matter what.

258
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:12,712
If you let Rahl get the box,

259
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,343
then your mother's sacrifice
will have been for nothing.

260
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,055
That's not gonna happen.

261
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,057
I can't let you leave with the box.

262
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:25,103
What are you gonna do?
Cook me with Wizard's Fire?

263
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,172
I would never hurt you.

264
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,537
I'm just going to stop you.

265
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,719
Come on.

266
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,610
You can't stop Richard
if I'm with him, can you?

267
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:49,274
You can come with us
or you can stay.

268
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:53,186
Either way,
we're going to save our mother.

269
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,159
Are you all right?
Here.

270
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:19,324
It's sprained. You're not going anywhere
until I bind it.

271
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:20,992
Let me help.

272
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,870
Your magic can't heal her.

273
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:33,747
She must think her grandfather
a cold-hearted bastard.

274
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:37,938
Someday she'll understand.

275
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,539
What if there is no someday, Kahlan?

276
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,066
You have to convince Richard
to stop this madness.

277
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:49,421
You're the one who's always saying
we have to trust the Seeker's instincts.

278
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,996
This is different.
This is his mother.

279
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:56,265
When he sees her being tortured, I fear
he's going to throw the box to Denna

280
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,904
just to make her stop.

281
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,625
Are you worried
that Richard is going to do that,

282
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,159
or that you are?

283
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:08,016
Denna's going to be ready for us.
She's going to have more soldiers.

284
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,374
How can we fight her?

285
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,588
Over the past few months,

286
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,380
I've been attacked
by flying monsters,

287
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:18,878
tracked by bounty hunters,
tortured by Denna,

288
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,594
and beaten bloody
by Darken Rahl himself,

289
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:23,304
and I'm still here,

290
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,272
all in one piece.

291
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:26,465
I think.

292
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,351
I see it now.

293
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:31,656
- What?
- When you smile,

294
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,732
right around the eyes,
you look just like our mother.

295
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:41,746
Try that.

296
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,606
If the box can do what you say,

297
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:52,777
give Darken Rahl
power over the whole world,

298
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:57,128
then I don't think our mothe
would want us to trade it for her life.

299
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,933
Can you think of another way?

300
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:07,958
If this cave has some kind of magic
around it, I can get through that.

301
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,184
She'd be ready for that.

302
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,108
There might be a way.

303
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,442
But it would all depend on you.

304
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:19,934
Anything.

305
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,065
- Where is the box?
- I don't have it with me.

306
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,908
Do you think I'm playing games?

307
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,869
Bring it to me or I kill her.

308
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:31,645
Go ahead.

309
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:36,002
Then go back to Rahl and explain to him
how you failed him.

310
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,769
I'm guessing

311
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,929
that whatever punishment you endured
for letting me escape,

312
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,337
gonna seem like a pinprick compared
to what he'll do to you this time.

313
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:51,030
You won't let
an innocent person die.

314
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:53,945
I'm not as soft-hearted
as I used to be, Denna.

315
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,059
Not since I met you.

316
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,831
So I will let this woman
die in a heartbeat

317
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,512
if it keeps Rahl
from getting all three boxes.

318
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:03,869
But,

319
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:06,544
there's a way
we can both get what we want.

320
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,821
I'm listening.

321
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:13,623
First, we put down our weapons.

322
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:38,183
The only bargain I'll consider
is the one that ends with me

323
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:40,977
handing the Third Box of Orden
to Darken Rahl.

324
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:42,819
I'll give you the third box.

325
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,710
After you help us
steal the other two.

326
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:50,559
Impossible.

327
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:53,287
You know your way in and out
of the People's Palace, don't you?

328
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:56,035
I know the place
better than he does.

329
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,669
But I'm not foolish enough
to try stealing the boxes.

330
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,659
I'm not asking you to.

331
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,173
But if you know the palace
as well as you say,

332
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:08,321
then you know about the magical barriers
Rahl uses to protect it.

333
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:13,161
You believe
the pristinely ungifted one

334
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,476
can get past
Rahl's magical barriers.

335
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:19,984
Well, it's suicide.

336
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:23,075
But if you hand me the box,

337
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:25,561
I'll draw a treasure map
for Jennsen.

338
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,312
You draw the map,
Jennsen brings back the first two boxes,

339
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:33,494
- then we give you the third.
- What if Rahl suspects that I helped?

340
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,447
If you don't return with the third box,
he's going to kill you anyway.

341
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,624
So I'd say it's a risk worth taking.

342
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:41,032
Once you have all the boxes,

343
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:43,798
how do I know
you'll give me the third?

344
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,889
Because you have Jennsen's mother.

345
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,780
This woman is very important to you,

346
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,040
isn't she, Richard?

347
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,570
Like you said,

348
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:06,152
I'd rather
not let an innocent person die.

349
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,405
Do we have a deal?

350
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,924
Shall we seal it with a kiss?

351
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,846
Kill me, and I can never revive her.

352
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:47,015
I'll give her the Breath of Life
if you bring me the Third Box of Orden

353
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,154
by the time the rising sun
is full in the sky.

354
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,776
You two stay here
and protect the box.

355
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,430
Jennsen and I go to the palace.
Nothing has changed.

356
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,249
Everything has changed.

357
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,670
She has proven, as if proof were needed,
that she cannot be trusted.

358
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:08,590
You said if Darken Rahl
got all three boxes,

359
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,550
he'd have power over everyone.

360
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,714
Could anyone who had the boxes
use that magic?

361
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:16,407
Whoever puts
all three boxes together

362
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,023
has instant and absolute control
over everybody.

363
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,735
What he commands is done.

364
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,508
If I got the other two boxes
out of the palace,

365
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:26,275
Richard could put them together

366
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,943
and command Denna to give our mother
this Breath of Life.

367
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:32,145
The magic of Orden is too dangerous.

368
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,449
It would intoxicate whoever wielded it,
corrupt him.

369
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,410
Then we go ahead with the deal.

370
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,227
We grieve for Taralyn
and get Jennsen and the box

371
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,927
as far away from here as possible.

372
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:46,440
Denna still needs us
as much as we need her.

373
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:49,710
She knows she won't get the box
if we don't get Taralyn alive.

374
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,218
You would send your sister
into the belly of the beast?

375
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,096
You would leave your daughter
to die?

376
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:00,766
Yes, I would.

377
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,285
Jennsen, dear one.

378
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,984
For 23 years I built walls
against the pain of losing your mother.

379
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:14,530
And now, with you before me,
all those walls are crumbling.

380
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:18,927
I've only just found out
I have a granddaughter.

381
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:21,280
I can't bear
the thought of losing her too.

382
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,121
You won't lose me, Grandfather.

383
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,971
The People's Palace
is surrounded by a tree line

384
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:35,927
that acts as a magical barrier.

385
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:39,013
Only those who have been spelled
by Rahl's sorcerers

386
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,484
can pass in and out of the barrier
without being instantly killed by it.

387
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:47,367
Richard will have to wait for you
on the other side.

388
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,402
There will be alarms,
but you won't set them off.

389
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:57,198
Just make sure the archers patrolling
the battlements don't see you.

390
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,497
They shoot on sight.

391
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,260
There's a secret entrance
on the south end of the palace

392
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,290
that leads to an escape tunnel.

393
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,010
As Lord Rahl's personal bodyguards,

394
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,236
only the Mord-Sith
know of its existence.

395
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:14,424
You'll see the opening.

396
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,586
But make sure
no one is watching you,

397
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:18,982
because what they will see

398
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,927
is someone
walking through a solid wall.

399
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,721
Follow the tunnel to the staircase.

400
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,906
At the top is an archway
guarded by a lone sentry.

401
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:37,998
He passes every 90 seconds.

402
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:41,155
Wait until he goes by,

403
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:43,146
and then run straight ahead,

404
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,053
to the entrance
to Rahl's Ceremonial Chamber.

405
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,232
Rahl trusts no one,

406
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:54,794
so there are no living guards
watching over the chamber itself.

407
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,373
It's protected only by magic.

408
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:00,561
The final magical shield,

409
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,804
the one closest to the boxes,
allows only Rahl himself to get through.

410
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,694
Of course, you're the exception.

411
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,188
But be careful.

412
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:30,707
Even if you make it past
all the shields and guards,

413
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:35,371
Darken Rahl has an uncanny ability
to sense when things are awry.

414
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:44,591
Lord Rahl, Mistress Denna
has sent word by Journey Book.

415
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,848
She will arrive
by nightfall tomorrow

416
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,702
with the Third Box of Orden.

417
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:52,036
Tell her she'll be greeted
with the strumming of harps

418
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:55,089
- and the blast of trumpets.
- You doubt her, My Lord?

419
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:57,774
I doubt the very sun at noon,
Egremont.

420
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,887
Zedd, Kahlan, we have the boxes!

421
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,014
Thank the Spirits.

422
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,152
I was caught in the room with Rahl.

423
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:33,955
I was this close to him.

424
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:37,215
He picked up the boxes.
He held them, he caressed them.

425
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,525
Imagine his surprise the next time
he drops in to play with his toys.

426
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,271
Look.

427
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:47,743
We have to get the third box
to Denna.

428
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,557
It's right here.

429
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:58,141
Welcome back, Seeker.

430
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:01,443
You've succeed, of course?

431
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,628
I thought we had a deal.

432
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:06,824
I've changed my mind.

433
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,432
I've decided I want all three boxes.

434
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:11,920
Now.

435
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,539
We don't have all three.

436
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,779
Only two.

437
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,798
We've hidden the third.

438
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:24,101
Tell me where it is,
or I'll kill your loved ones

439
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:25,990
one by one.

440
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,604
And then it'll just be you and me.

441
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:34,303
Do you think I would ever let you
have the power of Orden?

442
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:35,752
At any price?

443
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:40,171
Because you'd rather
I had the power than Rahl.

444
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,257
I'd treat you kindly.

445
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,742
I'd give you whatever you wanted.

446
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:48,003
Or

447
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:51,139
I can take away
what you care about most.

448
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,246
- Take the Confessor first.
- Wait!

449
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,512
At least grant me the governorship
of the lands west of the River Drun,

450
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,429
where I can live with my friends
in peace.

451
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:27,172
What better governor could I ask for
than the Seeker?

452
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,886
Then I'll show you
where the third box is.

453
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:12,891
- Kill them all!
- Stop!

454
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,894
Drop your weapons. All of you.

455
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,472
Take us to our mother.

456
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:53,220
The sun isn't up yet.

457
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,591
You said you could revive her.

458
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:58,716
That was before I was
under your command, My Lord.

459
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,269
I lied to you.

460
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,322
I knew
she'd never last until sunrise.

461
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,474
I'm sorry, My Lord.

462
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,360
I failed you.

463
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,058
I am so sorry.

464
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:48,734
What are we going to do with her?

465
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:54,907
Kill her.

466
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Slowly.

467
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:11,715
If that is your wish, My Lord.

468
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:36,198
Harder.

469
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:56,485
The way of the Seeker
is not vengeance.

470
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:58,948
Not vengeance.

471
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,889
Justice.

472
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:03,350
Are you sure
you can tell one from the other?

473
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,102
You gave me the third box.

474
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,771
To stop Denna from killing us all.

475
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,103
Why should it stop there?

476
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,802
Don't you see what happens now?

477
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,702
I go to the People's Palace.

478
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,574
I order Rahl to fall on my Sword.

479
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,727
I punish the guilty,
liberate the Midlands.

480
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,699
The war is over.

481
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:27,894
I've won.

482
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:29,894
Not this way.

483
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,838
You'd become the very tyrant
you would have killed...

484
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,256
Silence, old man!

485
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:43,320
You've all killed innocent people.

486
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,410
And now you will kill each other.

487
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,729
Pick up your weapons
and fight to the death.

488
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,205
Anyone left standing,
burn them to ash.

489
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,111
I may have only just met you,
brother,

490
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,619
but I know this isn't you.

491
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,997
Don't touch the boxes.

492
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:35,859
Magic doesn't work on me.

493
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,922
Not even the magic of Orden.

494
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:05,138
- What did I do? What did I do?
- It wasn't you.

495
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,377
It was the power of Orden.

496
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,560
Finish me off

497
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,791
before Darken Rahl finds me.

498
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,570
Enough killing.

499
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:32,833
Please.

500
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,449
Leaving me to Darken Rahl
is worse than killing me.

501
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,737
Then I suggest you run.

502
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:11,909
You can't come with us, Jennsen.

503
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:14,974
It's too dangerous.

504
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,003
Now that I've found you,
I wanna stay with you, help you.

505
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,079
And so you shall, child.

506
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:25,912
In your possession, the Boxes of Orden
can never be found by magical means.

507
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:28,621
But since they should
always remain separated,

508
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,516
you'll take two
and we'll protect the third.

509
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:33,342
Where will I keep them?

510
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,678
We have friends in the resistance
who'll take you in.

511
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,003
Friends we would trust
with our own lives.

512
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:40,800
And when all this is over,
we'll come and see you again.

513
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:42,697
And be together.

514
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:44,488
As a family.

515
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:53,747
I'll escort you to our friends

516
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:57,746
while Richard and Kahlan try to find out
where Rahl is going next.

517
00:38:58,327 --> 00:38:59,645
Because rest assured,

518
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,794
he won't be staying in the palace.

519
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:18,689
May the Spirits light your way
through the land of shadow

520
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,970
to the halls of eternal peace.

521
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,718
She brought us all together
in the end.

522
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:56,743
Come closer.

523
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,396
Closer.

524
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,085
Tell me,

525
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:09,588
what do you see?

526
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,343
The pristinely ungifted one
is on their side now.

527
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,123
Issue a proclamation.

528
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,603
Let it be known
throughout the Three Territories

529
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,036
that until the Wizard,

530
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:41,843
the Seeker,

531
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:46,499
the Mother Confessor, and all three
Boxes of Orden are brought to me,

532
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,046
the people will feel my wrath

533
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:53,578
one village at a time.

534
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,755
- What I did...
- That wasn't you.

535
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:10,460
Man possesses the power of Orden
as the power of Orden possesses the man.

536
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,468
No. It was me.

537
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,825
I felt that anger.

538
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:18,372
That hatred.

539
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:21,952
I still do.

540
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:24,831
If you didn't,
you'd be a statue, not a man.

541
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:28,527
We all have dark desires,
yearnings for vengeance.

542
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,445
And you must remember
how those feelings stirred your blood,

543
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,974
because what marks the line
between good and evil

544
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:35,868
is the choice not to act on them.

545
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,496
A choice you've always made
since I've known you.

546
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:42,039
And I've known you
since the day you were born.

547
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:46,121
- Can I call you Gramps?
- Not if you value your life.

548
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:50,497
Do you remember once when I little,

549
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:54,482
I climbed the wall of your garden
and stole some apples from the big tree?

550
00:41:55,488 --> 00:41:58,171
And you came outside
and I thought for sure

551
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:01,393
the crazy chicken man of Blackthorn Hill
would eat me for lunch.

552
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,456
You just stood there, staring.

553
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:11,729
I was drinking in the sight
of my beautiful grandson.

554
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,073
You ran off so quickly,

555
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,440
over the wall and down the hill...

556
00:42:19,128 --> 00:42:20,987
So much time lost, Richard.

557
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:24,285
So much left unsaid.

558
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:35,755
Never even got to talk to my mother.

559
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,345
Then let me tell you about her.
