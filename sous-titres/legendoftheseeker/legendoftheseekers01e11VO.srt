1
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,628
I'm taking breakfast to Evelyn,
she's still down with that bad leg.

2
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,722
- Will you be all right till I get back?
- I've got my accounts to finish.

3
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,803
That's not
what I'm talking about, Conor.

4
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,378
- I'm worried about you.
- You should be worried.

5
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,315
For your own safety, as well.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,090
Make sure you stay
on the main roads today.

7
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:29,194
Don't you think it's possible
you're overreacting to all this?

8
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:31,357
There's two of us dead, Nella.

9
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,817
I don't care
if they looked like accidents.

10
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,326
Someone out there
is targeting the resistance.

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:38,586
When Kahlan gets here,
we'll find out who.

12
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,819
- Kahlan's coming?
- I sent an urgent message.

13
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,364
She'll show you
the truth of my words.

14
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,178
I don't need a Confessor to tell me
I should believe in my husband.

15
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,157
You've decided
where we're taking the box?

16
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:01,826
The one place in all the Midlands
where Rahl can't get into,

17
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,001
neither by spell nor by force,

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,690
is the Crypt of the Ancient Seeker
at Tavol'Rang.

19
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:10,331
And that's where we're headed,
with a detour to my home town,

20
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:13,456
- to pick up the key.
- Pack up. We need to go now.

21
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:17,826
Agreed. It's a day's walk to my house,
and three more to Tavol'Rang.

22
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,308
We need to go by way of East Marwen.

23
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,273
This message found its way to me
in the marketplace.

24
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:27,006
- Some friends of mine are in trouble.
- The entire Midlands is in trouble

25
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,145
if we don't get this box
locked away safe.

26
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,355
I know.

27
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,605
But the friend that sent that message
is a leader in the resistance.

28
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,883
He and his wife
risked their lives to hide me

29
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,708
when I was running from Aydindril
with The Book of Counted Shadows.

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,683
We'll just have to meet up
after you get the key.

31
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,393
Wait. You can't go alone.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,570
He's right.

33
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,078
A Confessor can't travel
without her Seeker,

34
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:50,900
the Seeker can't travel
without his Confessor.

35
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:53,986
But who would trouble themselves

36
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,198
with an old man in a tattered cloak?

37
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,258
Thank you, Zedd.

38
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,974
I'll meet you in East Marwen,
the day after tomorrow,

39
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:05,637
with the key in my hand.

40
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,955
The box goes with me.

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,028
Too many D'Harans in these parts
on the lookout for the Seeker.

42
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:27,893
Conor?

43
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,519
Nella?

44
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:34,681
What's wrong?

45
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:47,541
1x11 - <i>Confession</i>

46
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,043
Sync: Kasius

47
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:51,355
I came as fast as I could...

48
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,307
Eternal darkness
upon the soul of whoever did this.

49
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:08,145
This is Constable Declan.
I sent for him.

50
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,188
You can speak freely,
he's one of us.

51
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,067
I'm Kahlan Amnell.

52
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:17,237
It's been a long time
since we had a Confessor in East Marwen.

53
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,319
You've come when you're most needed.

54
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:22,826
Richard Cypher.

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,790
It is an honor beyond words
to meet the Seeker,

56
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,354
though I wish
we met under happier circumstances.

57
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,598
Do you have any idea?

58
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,634
I can't bring Conor back,

59
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:44,001
but I swear to you
on my power as a Confessor...

60
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,976
I will bring whoever killed him
to justice.

61
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,566
Conor knew he was in danger.

62
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,154
The message said that two of the men
in your group were already dead.

63
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,618
We believe they were murdered
by traitors in league with the D'Harans.

64
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,418
One of the men
appeared to have taken his own life,

65
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,971
but there was no reason for him
to have done that.

66
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:15,564
The other was crushed under his wagon
while he was fixing a wheel,

67
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,809
but nobody saw it happen.

68
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,452
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

69
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:23,277
I left before breakfast.

70
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,801
The sun was just coming up.

71
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,094
I spent the morning with a friend,

72
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,680
she's been sick,
and when I came back,

73
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,247
the place was torn apart, and I...

74
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,065
Was anything missing?

75
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:43,276
Just his inkwell.

76
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,445
The golden one his father gave him,

77
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,896
and a silver bowl
he kept on his desk.

78
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,436
The sick friend you visited,

79
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,536
- does she live near a marsh?
- No, a meadow.

80
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:54,871
Why?

81
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,969
It's just these seeds,

82
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,991
they're still green, newly fallen,

83
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:02,462
from a stalk of Kindon grass
and it only grows in marshes.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,341
There's just one marsh around here.

85
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,151
I've never been to Conor's house
in my life.

86
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,825
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm sure.

87
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,605
I stay close to home.

88
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,898
So you wouldn't know anything
about a mysterious highwayman

89
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,440
who roams the roads at night,
robbing travelers?

90
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,782
A man like that
might even be capable of murder.

91
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:39,749
- I wouldn't know anything about that.
- Would you know anything about this?

92
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,350
Kindon seeds.

93
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,845
They were found
on the floor of Conor's home.

94
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,861
The only Kindon grass in East Marwen

95
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,141
grows in the marsh
next to your property.

96
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,557
Where were you this morning,
Niles, around sunrise?

97
00:05:58,887 --> 00:05:59,887
I was...

98
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,354
in the woods.

99
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:03,074
Hunting.

100
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,986
You can't lie to a Confessor, Niles.

101
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:12,663
Never been to Conor's house,
have you?

102
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,372
Declan, what are you doing?

103
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,289
I'm sorry, Luna.

104
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,209
Conor Greenleaf is dead.

105
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,662
By your brother's hand.

106
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:30,300
- Niles would never...
- Don't make this harder than it is.

107
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,010
My brother is not a murder.

108
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,312
Let him go.

109
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,071
He won't tell me anything.

110
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,405
We need to know
the full truth of his crimes,

111
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,159
so the people know
justice has been done.

112
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,155
Will you Confess him?

113
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,731
What if you're wrong,
and he's innocent?

114
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,357
He'll lose his mind, his will,

115
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:04,501
- for nothing.
- I can tell he's lying.

116
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,777
In Westland,
we have judges and counsels,

117
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,362
we make sure somebody is guilty
before we punish them.

118
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,341
Counsels,

119
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,011
no matter how wise, make mistakes.

120
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,528
Confessors don't.

121
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,558
It's three murders.

122
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,067
We owe it to Conor,

123
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,400
and we owe it to the resistance.

124
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,170
I got you.

125
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,431
Tell me what happened
when Conor was killed.

126
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,043
It was the morning.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,964
Early in morning.

128
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:07,048
I went to his house...

129
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,279
I'm sorry I lied to you, Confessor.

130
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,369
I killed him

131
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:18,463
and I took the bowl

132
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,656
and the inkwell.

133
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:23,496
Do you know anything
about the deaths of Conor's two friends?

134
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,710
Did anyone help you?
Are you working with the D'Harans?

135
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:30,217
Nobody helped me.

136
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,256
Please, don't hate me.

137
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:35,995
Please.

138
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,435
Go with them peacefully.

139
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,478
Accept your fate with dignity.

140
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,925
Under the power of a Confessor,

141
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,963
Niles Braggindor has admitted
to taking the life of Conor Greenleaf.

142
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,528
He will be punished

143
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:33,647
in accordance with the laws
of the Midlands and East Marwen.

144
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,420
We're lucky you came and you did.

145
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,632
Justice is uneasy to come by
these days.

146
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:01,678
I'm sorry for your loss.

147
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,841
I loved Conor like a brother.

148
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,044
I know you did too.

149
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:11,223
Thank you for helping me
bring his killer to justice.

150
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,523
This town is lucky to have you.

151
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:18,320
Conor risked his life
thousands of times fighting for freedom,

152
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,169
and then he dies
in a common robbery.

153
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,301
That still doesn't explain
the other two deaths.

154
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,102
Constable!

155
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,170
I've been robbed.

156
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:31,207
Sit down, I'll find you a healer.

157
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:32,637
I don't need to sit,

158
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,925
I need to find the thief
who stole everything I own.

159
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,956
- Where did this happen?
- Two hour's ride north of here,

160
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,593
just after sunrise. A highwayman
put a blade to my throat.

161
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,152
I tried to fight him off,
but he was too strong.

162
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,733
Why don't you come into my chambers?
You can describe him.

163
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,769
I don't need to describe him.
He's right in front of me.

164
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:53,521
Impossible.

165
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:57,211
Niles was here
in East Marwen at sun up,

166
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,006
taking the life of another man.

167
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:01,451
I'm telling you,

168
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:03,718
he's the one who robbed me.

169
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,020
If that's true,
we just executed an innocent man.

170
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:34,332
Thaddicus.

171
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,278
- Good day to you.
- Thaddicus, it's me. Zedd.

172
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,858
Of course it is.

173
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,568
It's only been 23 years,
how could I forget?

174
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,661
There was no way for me
to send word.

175
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,046
I was on the other side of the Boundary,
in the Westland.

176
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:58,161
I'm sure you had magical business
of earth-shattering importance there.

177
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,093
I did.

178
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:10,113
Thaddicus, is Mother...?

179
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,259
Here?

180
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,148
Of course she is.

181
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,714
Where else would she be?

182
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,700
Come,
she'll be overjoyed to see you.

183
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:50,837
When?

184
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:52,906
Five years ago.

185
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,092
Your name on her lips.

186
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,808
Where's my Zeddicus?

187
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:59,219
Why didn't my Zeddicus
ever come home?

188
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,867
You look like
something the dog rolled around in.

189
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,212
Come in and have something to eat.

190
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,252
And a bath.

191
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:17,444
A highwayman
had a knife to your throat.

192
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,261
You were frightened.

193
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,177
Of course I was frightened.

194
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,531
- But I know what I saw.
- I know, I know.

195
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:27,243
Identical beard, similar clothes.

196
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,474
Don't forget his eyes.

197
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:31,854
His eyes.

198
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,886
You were looking into his eyes.

199
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,231
Just looking into mine
for the past quarter hour.

200
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,157
So what color are they?

201
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,174
My eyes?

202
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,030
Grey.

203
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,214
Blue, actually.

204
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,862
Amazing how the mind
plays tricks under pressure, isn't it?

205
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,151
Or...

206
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:04,593
someone paid you to come here
and say all this.

207
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,006
- And stab me?
- A warning,

208
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,432
of what they might do
if you don't play along.

209
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,030
That man robbed me.

210
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,780
When you confess someone,

211
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,873
they fall in love with you.

212
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,779
Are you sure
that once Niles was confessed,

213
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:30,108
he didt just tell you
what he thought you wanted to hear?

214
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,681
The confessed
can't lie to a Confessor, ever,

215
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:34,519
for any reason.

216
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:38,802
What did they take from you?

217
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,906
A bag of silver.
All my tools.

218
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,087
And a bracelet
I was bringing to my wife.

219
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,219
Green stones in a gold circlet,
with rubies along the edge.

220
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,280
You're lying.

221
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,156
What are you going to do,
confess me so you can prove that?

222
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,100
Your confessions
aren't all that reliable.

223
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,999
Did you say green stones
in a gold circlet?

224
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:01,913
What about them?

225
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:05,260
That's it.
That's my bracelet.

226
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,118
Where did you get that?

227
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:10,909
My brother gave it to me.

228
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:12,591
When?

229
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:15,140
- This morning.
- Right after he stole it from me.

230
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,032
He stole it from you this morning?

231
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:20,405
Around sunrise?

232
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,030
Then he couldn't have killed Conor.

233
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,425
My brother may have been a thief,

234
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,516
but he was no murderer.

235
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,074
You killed him.
He didn't have to die.

236
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,707
Calm down, Luna.

237
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,177
Calm down.

238
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,044
Are you proud of yourself,
Confessor?

239
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:47,562
You murdered my brother

240
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:51,134
as sure as you drove
a stake into his heart.

241
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:58,512
I'm sorry, Nella.

242
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,980
Niles didn't kill Conor.

243
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,518
He was robbing a man
when your husband died.

244
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,214
You confessed him.

245
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,149
He said he did it.

246
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:11,842
I don't understand.

247
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,117
Neither do I.

248
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:15,826
If Niles was innocent,

249
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,132
then why were Conor's things
in his house?

250
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,978
And how did those seeds
get on my floor?

251
00:16:21,562 --> 00:16:23,492
We're searching for answers.

252
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:26,150
We don't have them yet.

253
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:31,780
Maybe we do.

254
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,019
Unless a man
can be in two places at once,

255
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,508
then the whole thing is crazy

256
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,607
and every time something crazy
happens in the Midlands,

257
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,164
there's always one thing behind it:

258
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,085
magic.

259
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:50,507
I'm right about this. Is there anyone
in East Marwen who has magic?

260
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,989
There's a man up in the caves
who claims to be a sorcerer.

261
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:02,005
An innocent man is dead,
because of me.

262
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,715
It's not your fault.

263
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,216
It couldn't be.

264
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,403
Maybe somebody's doing
something to you.

265
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,407
Maybe it's Darken Rahl,
maybe he's...

266
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:11,528
Nobody...

267
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,377
Not even a Wizard of the First Order

268
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,073
has magic powerful enough
to work against a Confessor's.

269
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,039
There's something wrong with me.

270
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,315
Listen.

271
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,170
There is an explanation for all this
and we'll find it.

272
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,131
I know you.

273
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,236
And who you are is more
than some magical power you have.

274
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:49,633
Go! He's getting away.

275
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,278
I'm going to pull it out.

276
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,964
You have to go. Now.

277
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,152
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'll go into town, I'll get Declan.

278
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,805
You have to catch him.

279
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:22,099
Go. I can walk. Now.

280
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:09,503
Luna.

281
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,682
You're a fine cook, Thaddicus.

282
00:19:46,906 --> 00:19:50,103
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not patronizing you.

283
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,958
You always had a gift
in the kitchen.

284
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,803
Your vegetables, so fresh and crisp.

285
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,653
As opposed to...

286
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,324
May the Spirits forgive me.
Mother's.

287
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,739
Remember those carrots?

288
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:12,992
Paste.

289
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,838
I gagged every time.

290
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,847
Twenty-three years, Zedd.

291
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,404
Twenty-three years.

292
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,253
Your room's just as you left it.

293
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,453
I go in every now and then,

294
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,154
make sure the mice
haven't brought the place to ruin.

295
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,609
Just passing through, is it?

296
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,445
I came for something very important.

297
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,197
What a surprise.

298
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,183
Zeddicus shows up
because he needs something.

299
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,432
And what is it this time?
Night Stones?

300
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:50,977
Sorcerer's Sand?

301
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,354
Well, you're too late.
I sold it all years ago.

302
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,714
You didn't sell what I came for.

303
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,800
The key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

304
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,281
That was the first thing to go.

305
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:09,035
Have any idea what you've done?

306
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,812
Our family
always protected that key.

307
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,649
It was a sacred vow our ancestors

308
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,711
made to the First Order of Wizards.

309
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:21,500
Here's the truth of the situation,
brother: I'm not a Wizard.

310
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,092
As you never  let me forget.

311
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:27,901
You know as well as I do
that not every child inherits the power.

312
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:30,213
I am not going to apologize
for the ways of fate.

313
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:33,029
So the way you lorded me, that...
That was fate?

314
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:36,169
How you left me to do the kitchen chores
cause you were meant for greater things?

315
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,649
The way it was always
"Run off and play, Thaddicus,"

316
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:43,361
while Father gave his precious time
to the training of the great Zeddicus?

317
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,415
Memories are slippery things,

318
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,688
but the crack of Father's stick
across my knuckles is hard to forget.

319
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,026
You need the key?

320
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,974
Why don't you use your mystical powers
to conjure it?

321
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,528
You always loved showing off your magic
to your poor, powerless brother.

322
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:01,880
You know it doesn't work that way.

323
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:05,525
Wherever you went,
you should have stayed there.

324
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,277
That key was not yours to sell.

325
00:22:09,257 --> 00:22:10,955
You were always like that,

326
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,642
no thought of anything
beyond the next penny in your pocket.

327
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,977
I'll bet all the jewels in Tamarang

328
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,814
that whatever you sold it for
went straight to the gaming tables.

329
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,027
Be sure to bolt the door
on your way out.

330
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,189
Did you see who it was?

331
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,840
He was just a cloak in the shadow.

332
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,436
Are you sure it was a he?

333
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,201
Luna's out of her mind with rage,

334
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,078
most of it directed at you.

335
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:56,351
Her father made his living as a hunter,
just like Niles.

336
00:22:57,198 --> 00:22:59,250
The girl knows
how to use a crossbow.

337
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,283
- We need to go her cabin.
- I don't think you're ready.

338
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:03,983
I've had worse. We're going. Now.

339
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,098
What happened?

340
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,757
I killed her.

341
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,428
I tracked Luna to the house.

342
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,060
I mean, I knew it was Luna
when I saw the cloak and crossbow.

343
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,386
And then...

344
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,780
And then what?
You saw the crossbow...

345
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:31,416
I heard a noise. It was Luna.

346
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,174
She attacked me,
so I defended myself.

347
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,508
She scratched at my neck.

348
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:41,818
She was defenseless.

349
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:45,159
- I didn't have to hurt her.
- Please,

350
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:46,846
don't hurt me.

351
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,410
But I killed her anyway.

352
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:57,262
I don't believe
that you killed that woman.

353
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,140
Look at me.

354
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:05,145
The Richard I know risks his life
every day for others.

355
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:09,333
You wouldn't kill a defenseless woman,
I know you.

356
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,558
I did it, Kahlan. I remember it.

357
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:17,366
Just like Niles
remembered killing Conor.

358
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:21,578
Maybe his memories weren't real,
and neither are yours.

359
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:26,208
You said that magic
had to be behind all this.

360
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,874
Well, now I'm starting to agree.

361
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:31,130
We need to go find that sorcerer.

362
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:34,009
Well, I hope you're right.

363
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:36,630
'Cause right now,
I don't trust myself.

364
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,892
What if I do
something like that again?

365
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:40,913
You won't.

366
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:43,600
Because I'll be with you.
Every second.

367
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:50,996
What did you come back for,

368
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,759
another magical treasure
for one of your schemes? Well, go away.

369
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:55,362
I lost them all at cards.

370
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:59,366
No more waiting, Zorander.

371
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,348
One hundred gold pieces.

372
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,829
You only won 70 off me.

373
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:07,562
The extra 30
is the price of my patience.

374
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,305
I haven't got any.
I can't pay you.

375
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,255
You're gonna pay. Slowly.

376
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:15,899
If I can't get my money,

377
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,951
then I'll just have to have some fun
with you instead.

378
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,794
If you ever dare
to show your face to my brother, ever,

379
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,145
you'll wish
I had burned you to cinders.

380
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,286
Now get out.

381
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:03,552
Why'd you come back?

382
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:08,431
I got about a league from here
when my temper cooled and I realized...

383
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:16,193
The task that calls me away
is a grave one, Thaddicus.

384
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,976
The chance
that I will not return alive is...

385
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:22,101
Is great.

386
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,101
I didn't want to go to the Shadows
knowing that my last words

387
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:28,924
to the only brother I have
in all the world were

388
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,049
unkind

389
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:31,827
and unfair.

390
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,329
Now let's get you cleaned up.

391
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:40,645
You look like one of Mother's turnips
after an hour in the pot.

392
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:43,981
Besides,

393
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:46,530
I always did love

394
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,664
showing off my powers.

395
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:57,584
You're the only sorcerer
anywhere near this village.

396
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,958
Do you know anything
about these murders?

397
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,262
Were they your doing?

398
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:08,308
He's telling the truth.

399
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:11,807
And I'm really more
of a sorcerer-in-training, anyway.

400
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,793
I've been studying magic books
my whole life,

401
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:18,682
I've learned a few minor tricks, things
you can do with powders and potions.

402
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:22,259
- You don't have any powers?
- That doesn't mean I can't help you.

403
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,035
My knowledge in the field
is quite extensive.

404
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,640
You say these victims
believe they did something they didn't?

405
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:31,195
They don't just believe...

406
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,542
they actually see themselves
doing it in their heads.

407
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,773
Shared visions.

408
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:38,919
Memory magic.

409
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:42,166
I've read something about that in...

410
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:43,864
here.

411
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,782
There are accounts

412
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,285
of an ancient device

413
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,786
that produces the effect
you speak of.

414
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:52,193
Here we go.

415
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:53,770
Azzallel's Orb.

416
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:56,084
Azzallel was a fantastically
gifted wizard.

417
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,795
His wife gave birth
to a blind daughter.

418
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,352
Azzallel tried but failed

419
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:03,887
to manifest new eyes
for his baby girl.

420
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:06,004
So instead, he created a way

421
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,824
of plucking visions from his head

422
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:11,124
and placing them inside hers.

423
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:13,435
Azzallel's Orb was stolen

424
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:16,194
200 years ago
and believed to be lost forever.

425
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:17,996
Hello, Bosin.

426
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:21,216
Still stealing money
from old ladies?

427
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,730
I found something.

428
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:28,267
When we were searching Luna's cabin,

429
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:31,767
one of my men pulled this scorched paper
from her fireplace.

430
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,015
There's handwriting there,

431
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,445
but I can't make it out.
Maybe you'll have better luck.

432
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:39,816
No luck required.

433
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:42,097
This I can help you with.

434
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:43,543
May I?

435
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:52,223
Dust of a Shadrin's thigh bone.

436
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:03,927
Like I said,

437
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:05,506
a few minor tricks.

438
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,051
"Dearest Luna.

439
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:17,676
"I can't meet you tonight.

440
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,463
"I think my wife knows.

441
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,401
"Missing you desperately. Conor."

442
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:24,236
Conor and Luna were lovers?

443
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:27,032
If Nella knew about that,

444
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,142
she'd have a good reason
to kill her husband...

445
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:31,744
and Luna.

446
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:39,752
My husband is dead.

447
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,261
Why are you doing this to me?

448
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,586
Did you kill Conor and Luna?

449
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:06,695
And then gave the memories
of what you did to Niles.

450
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:08,567
And me.

451
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,750
I'm sorry.

452
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,912
Where is it, Nella?

453
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:16,802
Where's the orb?

454
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:03,471
I told Conor I was leaving
to take breakfast to a sick friend.

455
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:06,774
But I didn't make it very far.

456
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:12,825
After I killed Conor,

457
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,017
I gathered seeds
from the grasses near Niles' cabin

458
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:20,019
and scattered them around the body.

459
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:25,835
Then I ransacked my house
and hid our possessions in Niles' cabin.

460
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:30,864
All that was left was to put the visions
of what I did into Niles' head.

461
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,764
And the memories Richard
has of murdering Luna?

462
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,932
Right after I killed her,

463
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:42,567
Richard came running
into the cabin from the woods.

464
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,478
How could I have done such a thing?

465
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:58,715
It's time to go, Nella.

466
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,387
And lemon cake, my own creation.

467
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,662
You know,
you could make a living at this.

468
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:16,972
An honest one.

469
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,309
Patronize me again,
you'll get a pack full of sand.

470
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,298
Where to now?

471
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:28,567
The less you know about where I'm going,
and why, the better, for your own sake.

472
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,124
I know I'm guilty
of occasional self-importance,

473
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:34,592
but in this case,

474
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:37,558
the fate of the world
actually may depend

475
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,680
on the success of the errand
that calls me.

476
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:49,831
In that case...

477
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,862
you'll need this.

478
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:05,863
The key to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

479
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:10,152
You had it all along?

480
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,485
Of course.

481
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:14,072
Mother would've come back
from the grave

482
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:17,076
swinging that iron skillet if I'd let it
out of my sight for a second.

483
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,868
How could you put me
through such a thing?

484
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:21,646
I was angry

485
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:24,525
that you came home
for something you needed...

486
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:27,191
and not to see me.

487
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,581
I needed to see you too.

488
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,479
- How are you feeling?
- Like I killed an innocent woman.

489
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:54,894
I still keep seeing her die.

490
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:58,026
Hearing her screams.
Feeling her blood on my hands.

491
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,147
I loved Conor and Nella.

492
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,763
They would've given
their lives for me.

493
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:08,841
They almost did.

494
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:11,441
To lose them over this?

495
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,052
Over jealousy and anger.

496
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:20,723
You don't have to watch.

497
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:26,459
The other two who died,

498
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,654
I'd like to talk to their families,
see if there's anything you didn't find.

499
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,553
I'll take you to them, after.

500
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:35,827
Don't worry,

501
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,793
Conor's work will go on here,

502
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:41,638
no matter what.

503
00:35:58,377 --> 00:35:59,777
Are you all right?

504
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,016
When you described Luna's attack,
you said she was scratching you, right?

505
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,207
She went after my face...
Well, Nella's.

506
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:13,101
She scratched me right here.
Hurt like a stinging nettle.

507
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:16,860
I just saw three deep scratches
in that exact spot on Declan's neck.

508
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,158
- What are you saying?
- It's no coincidence.

509
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:24,618
Luna scratched her attacker. And whoever
attacked her committed all the murders.

510
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,456
Nella Greenleaf will now
be consigned to the Shadows,

511
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:33,794
in accordance with the laws
of the Midlands and East Marwen.

512
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,185
- Wait!
- Stop!

513
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:38,757
- Lower the door.
- He killed Conor! He killed them all!

514
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Now!

515
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:10,721
I'm not with the resistance

516
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,400
I've been killing
off the resistance.

517
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:17,521
Why?

518
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,227
I believed in Darken Rahl.

519
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,811
That he would protect us.

520
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,476
You had to know that killing Conor
would draw attention.

521
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,675
I had no choice.

522
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,692
Conor was growing suspicious of me.

523
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:39,863
When he told me he sent for your help,
I had to act quickly.

524
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,145
The hard part

525
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:48,247
was making the murder
look like Niles did it.

526
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,084
Where did you get Azzallel's Orb?

527
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,686
From my father.

528
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,188
It's belonged to my family
for hundreds of years.

529
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:03,923
It's a wonderful device,

530
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:05,418
really.

531
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,072
All you have to do

532
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:10,034
is think of what you want
the other person to remember

533
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,595
and the orb does the rest.

534
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:17,432
Everything was perfect,

535
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:22,065
until the man Niles robbed
on the road showed up,

536
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,638
after Niles was

537
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,208
hanged.

538
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:26,835
And then you

539
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,058
kept asking questions.

540
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:36,295
With a Confessor around,
I knew I'd never be safe.

541
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,410
So I tried to kill you.

542
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:43,151
And with the Seeker tracking me,
I knew I had to cover my tracks.

543
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,219
I ran straight to Luna's.

544
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:00,393
Don't hurt me.

545
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,911
So you're the one
who knocked me out?

546
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,279
I put the memory of Luna's murder
into your head.

547
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:17,268
It seemed like the best plan
at the time.

548
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,679
What I didn't count on

549
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:22,566
was the Confessor fighting
for your innocence.

550
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:27,492
That's when I gave Nella
the memories of everything I did.

551
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,850
To make her the mastermind.

552
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,936
So Conor and Luna were never lovers?

553
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:37,318
I wrote that letter myself.

554
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:42,128
I knew the hermit had the power
to restore burned objects.

555
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:46,129
It's a trick he performs
at children's parties.

556
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:49,003
Did you kill the other two?

557
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:51,217
The suicide, and the accident?

558
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,150
Both of them.

559
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:00,480
I see the error of my ways now,
Confessor.

560
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:05,957
I only hope you allow me
to atone by serving your will

561
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,137
for the rest of my days.

562
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:12,522
My will

563
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,037
is that you die by nightfall.

564
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:25,112
But by then,
you'd better be a long way from here.

565
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:30,053
I sent word to the D'Harans
that the Seeker was in East Marwen.

566
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:34,405
They're on their way
from Fort Naramond, to take the Seeker.

567
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,503
They'll be here by sundown.

568
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:40,164
We should go.

569
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,440
There's still one thing
I need to do.

570
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:46,591
It wasn't your fault.

571
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:48,776
Declan had us all fooled.

572
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:54,391
I should have suspected him sooner.

573
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,853
At least you got justice
for my husband.

574
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:08,256
Anything you need.

575
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,918
Whenever you need it.

576
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,416
A remarkable story.

577
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,418
And a very powerful piece of magic.

578
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:25,070
I remember killing that woman
as clearly as I'm looking at you now.

579
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,255
No one should have to live
with a memory like that,

580
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,282
except a real killer.

581
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:34,181
I could use Azzallel's magic
here to pluck it from your mind.

582
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,266
I'd be very grateful.

583
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,989
Although Richard's probably
not the one who needs it most.

584
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:42,715
- Would you...?
- Absolutely not.

585
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,543
What I did really happened.

586
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,245
I'm not as infallible as I thought,

587
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:56,304
and it cost a man's life.
I don't ever want to forget that.

588
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,597
Things were never
this complicated in Westland.

589
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,569
You could always go back.

590
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,267
Not a chance.

591
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,047
On to new pressing matters...

592
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:16,029
The magical key
to the Crypt of Tavol'Rang.

593
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:17,204
You got it.

594
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,269
How was the visit with your family?

595
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:25,982
It was a visit with family.

596
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,504
Are you ready?
