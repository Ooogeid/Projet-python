1
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:13,008
Zedd, behind you!

2
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:19,181
For the glory of D'Hara!

3
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,864
Command me, Confessor.

4
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:36,766
Tell me why you attacked us.

5
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,868
We have standing orders
to kill the Seeker.

6
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:41,170
Maybe you haven't gotten word.
The war's over.

7
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,306
Yes.

8
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:45,207
But there's a rumor among
the officer corps

9
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,109
that the Seeker
is of the Rahl bloodline,

10
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:48,911
that he's next
in line for the throne.

11
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:51,914
Then the D'Harans should
serve him, not try to kill him.

12
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:54,283
My commanding officer,
General Grix

13
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,819
wants to claim the throne
for himself.

14
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,422
He's trying to eliminate anyone
that would challenge him--

15
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,856
Not only the Seeker,
but rival generals

16
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,391
in the D'Haran army as well.

17
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,627
Only a Lord Rahl
can rule the empire,

18
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,963
not some common foot soldier.

19
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,333
This General Grix
doesn't sound very interested

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,034
in the royal lines
of succession.

21
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,303
Where can we find him?

22
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,073
He may command a legion but Bain
is a man like any other.

23
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,141
He'll be more open to compromise

24
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,043
once he's lost someone close
to his heart.

25
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:23,212
Order the quad
to deploy the first weapon

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,549
in the General's
home village, Norwood.

27
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:29,618
General Grix,
you have a visitor.

28
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:37,927
I have a message for you, sir.

29
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,998
I'm listening.

30
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,100
You'll have
to read it for yourself.

31
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,644
What does it say, sir?

32
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:00,916
It's an invitation.

33
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,326
General Grix isn't here.

34
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,261
Where is he?
No one seems to know.

35
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,130
He and his guards left
on horseback a day ago.

36
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:15,765
They rode northeast.

37
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:17,800
We'll track him.

38
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:20,202
Confessor,
there's something else.

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,004
A quad left the camp
on a raid this morning.

40
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,407
They were armed
with a cache of Whisperers.

41
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,741
"Whisperers"?

42
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,210
Magical weapons.

43
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,980
They kill by releasing
the captured screams

44
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,548
of Shadow People.

45
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:34,016
A sound so deadly
they can wipe out

46
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,584
every living creature
within a league.

47
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,520
Where is Grix getting
these weapons?

48
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,789
I wish I knew, Confessor.

49
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:42,258
I do know
that Grix wants to use them

50
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,026
to wipe out the home villages
of his rivals,

51
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,629
to scare them into submission.

52
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,130
You and Zedd,
track the quad.

53
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,499
Intercept them before they can
set off any of these Whisperers.

54
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:51,667
We'll go after the General,

55
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:53,369
find out where
he's getting these things.

56
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,604
We'll meet up in the glade east
of Carthran Lake.

57
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,063
Oh. I told you
we needed one alive.

58
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,332
He could have killed you,
Confessor.

59
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,702
Kahlan.

60
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,305
There's one missing.

61
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:40,449
Confessor, command me.

62
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:41,817
Where's the other Whisperer?

63
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,520
We hid it in Norwood...

64
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,122
under the East bridge.

65
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,156
When will it detonate?

66
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,759
Answer me!

67
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:54,697
When the sun reaches
its highest point in the sky.

68
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm so sorry.

69
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,901
We have less than an hour.

70
00:04:58,969 --> 00:04:59,969
Guard the crate.

71
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,207
If you had assumed the throne
of D'Hara months ago,

72
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,842
the army would
be helping you in your quest

73
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,410
instead of trying to kill you.

74
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:10,312
If I'd claimed the throne,
I wouldn't be on a quest

75
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,780
to find the Stone of Tears.

76
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,182
I'd be too busy killing
and scheming

77
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,717
to keep control of my empire.

78
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,486
Sometimes ruthlessness is
required of a leader.

79
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,890
Fear is the only thing
that has ever united D'Hara.

80
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:22,825
I'd never try
to get people to follow me

81
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,426
by killing and terrorizing them.

82
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:27,429
Your sentiments are noble,
but impractical.

83
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,532
A true leader takes power.

84
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,001
He doesn't ask his subjects
for permission first.

85
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:36,338
That was Darken Rahl's way,
not mine.

86
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:37,740
Now, let's go find Grix.

87
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:46,549
We're too late.

88
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,332
What did you do?

89
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,621
What happened?

90
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,091
I cast a deafness spell.

91
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,327
So we couldn't hear
the sound of the Whisperer.

92
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,229
Which is the only reason
we're still alive.

93
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,863
What about the villagers?

94
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,465
They're fine.

95
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:39,602
I spelled every living creature
from here to the horizon.

96
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,670
Even the field mice
were protected.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,675
Well, I'm sure the field mice
are very grateful.

98
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,945
Now let's get those Whisperers
and get back to Richard.

99
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,552
A general trying
to conquer all of D'Hara

100
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,021
makes a detour
to visit a brothel.

101
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,290
Should I pretend
to be surprised?

102
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,262
Welcome to
the Palace of Athania.

103
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,796
What is your pleasure?

104
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:11,267
Tonight it seems
the pleasure is all mine.

105
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:14,870
Denna.

106
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:17,439
It's good
to see you again, Seeker.

107
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,310
I heard a rumor you were
traveling with a Mord-Sith.

108
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,746
Thank you, Bella,
I'll look after our guests.

109
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:24,780
Yes, Madame Denna.

110
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,448
Madame Denna.

111
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,517
The right hand
of Darken Rahl,

112
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:31,787
reduced to peddling flesh.

113
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,722
Times are difficult.

114
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,225
A Mord-Sith has
to make a living

115
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,627
now that the war is over.

116
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:40,829
I'm simply taking
what I've learned

117
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:43,666
and putting it to good use.

118
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:48,570
Pleasure after all
is the inverse of pain.

119
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:52,374
Knowledge of one makes mastery
of the other so much easier.

120
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:55,244
You of all people
should know that, Cara.

121
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:58,847
The place of a Mord-Sith
is at the side of Lord Rahl.

122
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:03,018
So the rumors are true.

123
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,587
We're looking for a D'Haran
General named Grix.

124
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Do you know him?

125
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,358
I find it's good business
to be friendly

126
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:10,993
with the local commanders.

127
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,228
You provide them with whores

128
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,131
and in exchange,
they leave you alone.

129
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,500
Many of my clients would enjoy
your acerbic tongue.

130
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,470
You could do very well here.

131
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,172
What's your interest
in the general?

132
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,774
He's gotten hold
of a supply of Whisperers.

133
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:28,444
He's planning to use them
against other D'Haran officers,

134
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:31,447
destroy their villages.

135
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,750
If we don't find Grix, he could
wipe out half your clientele.

136
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,519
If you know where he is,
you'd better tell me.

137
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:39,455
He left.

138
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,090
When you find him--

139
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:44,026
and I'm certain you will.

140
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:47,363
--remind him he still owes me
for the damage he caused.

141
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,931
The General
and his men drank too much

142
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,500
and destroyed one
of my finest suites.

143
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,269
I'll pass that along.

144
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:55,637
As pleasant as this has been,

145
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,307
I have other guests
to attend to.

146
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,976
But I hope you will
both indulge yourselves

147
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,678
while you're here.

148
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,780
Compliments of the house,
of course.

149
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:09,051
It's the least I can do
for old friends.

150
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:27,202
Sorcerer.

151
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,638
Have you been selling these
weapons to the D'Harans?

152
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:30,973
I had no choice, madame.

153
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,275
I needed to sell Whisperers
to raise funds

154
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,144
to complete
my work for you.

155
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,045
This potion isn't easy
to come by.

156
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,380
And it's not cheap.

157
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,849
This single vial
is worth more than any jewel

158
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,618
in the Caves of Coradin.

159
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,288
You fool, you brought
the Seeker here.

160
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,956
I thought you wanted the Seeker
to come here.

161
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,458
I did.

162
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,494
But not yet.

163
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:56,632
I still haven't completed
the General's training.

164
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:13,174
I know Denna.

165
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:15,543
She's involved
with Grix in some way.

166
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,912
I'm going
to take a look around.

167
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,780
Find Zedd and Kahlan.
Bring them here.

168
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,382
It will take at least a day

169
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,450
to get back
to the meeting place.

170
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,753
Kahlan and Zedd may
not even be there yet.

171
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,255
If Denna is involved
with this general,

172
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,658
I'm going to need Kahlan
to get the truth out of her.

173
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,026
I can't leave you alone
with her.

174
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,227
I can handle Denna.

175
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,565
Go on, hurry.

176
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,041
Excuse me.

177
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,411
Are any of you acquainted
with a friend of mine?

178
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:53,881
A D'Haran general, name of Grix.

179
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,216
You're the Seeker, aren't you?

180
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,784
Yes.

181
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,556
You have done so much
for the people of the Midlands.

182
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:06,193
Allow me to give you something
in return.

183
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:09,897
Compliments of the house.

184
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:15,469
Leaving so soon, Cara?

185
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:20,441
Your merchandise is too delicate
for my taste.

186
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,711
Of all the Sisters of the Agiel,

187
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:26,447
you're the last I expected
to find with Richard.

188
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,148
I serve Lord Rahl.

189
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:31,418
You serve anyone
with a purse full of coins.

190
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,654
You may find this hard
to believe,

191
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,490
but I have a great deal
of affection for Richard.

192
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:38,559
I admire him.

193
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:41,528
But "Lord Rahl?"

194
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:42,830
You doubt it?

195
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:45,065
Do you truly believe Richard

196
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,968
has what it takes
to rule the Empire?

197
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:49,236
Is he bold enough,

198
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:51,639
ruthless enough?

199
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:53,040
It's not the place
of a Mord-Sith

200
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,643
to question the Lord Rahl...

201
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,977
only to serve him.

202
00:11:57,045 --> 00:12:00,581
And if you
were still a true Mord-Sith,

203
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,149
you'd serve him too.

204
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,652
Under the right circumstances,
I might.

205
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,587
But I fear Richard's
been compromised.

206
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,088
Compromised?

207
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,556
By Kahlan.

208
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:11,792
You've seen
the way they are together.

209
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,696
She wouldn't need to confess him
to get him to do her bidding.

210
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:18,832
He'd sacrifice anything
for her.

211
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,403
His mission...
even you.

212
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,406
You don't know the first thing
about the Mother Confessor.

213
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:27,141
I know that Kahlan Amnell

214
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,610
doesn't care for Mord-Sith.

215
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:32,413
She tried to kill me, twice.

216
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,516
She's a woman of honor.

217
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,418
She spared my life

218
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,553
even after she learned
I killed her sister.

219
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,658
Her loyalties
aren't in question.

220
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,727
Yours are.

221
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:49,063
Safe journey, Cara.

222
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,298
I'll take good care of Richard.

223
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:56,036
If he has so much as a scratch
when I get back...

224
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,072
you'll be sorry.

225
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,376
You don't need to do that.

226
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:04,778
I just want to talk.

227
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,213
Don't you think I'm pretty?

228
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:09,116
Yes. Very.

229
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,551
But my heart is spoken for.

230
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,522
It's not your heart
that I'm interested in.

231
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,691
There are so many pleasures
to choose from.

232
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,228
Madame Denna
has instructed me personally.

233
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,964
I can even teach you some things

234
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:27,134
this woman of yours may enjoy.

235
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,372
I'm sure you're very good
at what you do.

236
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:34,208
But I need to know
about General Grix.

237
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,348
If I tell you...

238
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,583
will you help me?

239
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,584
Help you how?

240
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:49,156
This is my son, Edrand.

241
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,759
He's beautiful.

242
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,660
His father--
my husband.

243
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,597
--was killed during the war.

244
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:02,336
Maybe even by the very soldiers
who come to this place.

245
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,508
There's no other work for women
in ts province.

246
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:10,043
I only do this
so I can feed my son.

247
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:13,547
They say there's honest work
to be had in the Nathrin Valley,

248
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:16,650
but it's far from here and there
are bandits on the roads--

249
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:18,085
I'll make sure
you get there safely.

250
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,825
Thank the Spirits
you came here, Seeker.

251
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,361
I knew you'd help.

252
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:30,531
Did the general say where
he was going before he left?

253
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:32,633
The general never left.

254
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,934
His horse is still
in the stables.

255
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,309
Where is the Seeker?

256
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,845
With Lucinda.

257
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:47,614
Madame Denna told us there's
gonna be a big conclave

258
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,016
at the palace tomorrow.

259
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,384
She says General Grix
has invited

260
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,985
every battalion commander
in the province.

261
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,654
Did she say why?

262
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,123
All I know is we're supposed to
keep the commanders "happy."

263
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,692
That will be all.
Thank you, Lucinda.

264
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,361
Yes, Madame.

265
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,499
I thought I'd get
at least an hour.

266
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,870
You don't fool me, Richard.

267
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:12,473
We both know Lucinda

268
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,008
isn't woman enough for you.

269
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,244
There is someone else here

270
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:20,981
who I believe you
would find very enticing.

271
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,883
I'm surprised
you didn't request her.

272
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:27,387
It's not often
I entertain guests personally

273
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:30,057
but for you

274
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,293
I could make an exception.

275
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:36,230
If it would make
the experience more exciting,

276
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:39,600
I could even put on
a white dress.

277
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,437
Seeker!

278
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:48,509
Seeker!
Let her go.

279
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,192
Richard, no.

280
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,360
Take her below.

281
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,931
No! Madame, please, forgive me.

282
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,001
I'll do anything you ask.

283
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,509
Please...

284
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:23,911
I have a son.

285
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,379
You should have
thought about him

286
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:27,781
before you talked to the Seeker.

287
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,783
I'm ready to begin.

288
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:31,485
Are you certain
we should do this?

289
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,819
There's very little potion.

290
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:36,089
I don't have soldiers at my beck
and call anymore.

291
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:38,058
I need someone
to stop that Mord-Sith

292
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,060
from bringing the Confessor
and the wizard back here.

293
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:43,030
As you wish.

294
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:05,319
No.

295
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:08,388
Merciful creator
protect my child!

296
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,225
Please. No.

297
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:09,650
Who are you?

298
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,386
Where am I?

299
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,488
Everything's all right.

300
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:15,956
I'm a friend.

301
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,526
I've summoned your spirit
from the Underworld.

302
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:21,028
What have you done to me?

303
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,830
I've given you another body.

304
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:25,966
Another chance at life.

305
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,269
Why?

306
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,005
So you can
take vengeance on Cara,

307
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:35,175
the Mord-Sith who killed you.

308
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,529
What do we say?

309
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,632
Thank you, mistress.

310
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,001
Whatever it
is you think you're doing,

311
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,135
it won't work.

312
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,874
You had the D'Haran Empire
within your grasp,

313
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,177
and with it,
power beyond reckoning.

314
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:09,580
All you needed to do

315
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,416
was close your hand around it.

316
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,418
But you didn't.

317
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,619
You couldn't.

318
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,289
You're weak, Seeker.

319
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,991
Undeserving
of the title Lord Rahl.

320
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,029
I don't have time to sit
on Darken Rahl's throne.

321
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,764
I have a mission to complete.

322
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,166
I know.

323
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,303
The Stone of Tears.

324
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,038
That compass won't guide you
to the Stone.

325
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,272
It only works for me.

326
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,341
I'd better hold on to it
for you then.

327
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,778
I'd hate for it
to become damaged.

328
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,715
I know all
about your scheme, Denna.

329
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,817
The conclave.

330
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,087
You're using Grix
to get his rivals to come here.

331
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,923
You're planning to capture
and train them.

332
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,725
and use them to rule D'Hara.

333
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:59,129
I like how you think, Seeker.

334
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,298
But there's a flaw in you plan.

335
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,835
Assuming I could break
the entire officer corps,

336
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,271
that only gives me
control of the army.

337
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,506
To rule D'Hara,

338
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:13,610
one requires
the loyalty of the people.

339
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:16,814
For that,
I'd need a legitimate heir

340
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,116
to the empire.

341
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,386
Someone of the Rahl bloodline.

342
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,522
You think you're
going to train me?

343
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,825
You tried that before
and you failed.

344
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:31,328
I don't need to train
you to control D'Hara.

345
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,998
Whatever it is you're planning,
you won't succeed.

346
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,301
Cara's on her way
to get Kahlan and Zedd.

347
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,636
Unfortunately for you,

348
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:43,207
Cara isn't going to live long
enough to deliver her message.

349
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,210
Kahlan?

350
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:48,312
Zedd?

351
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,215
Who are you?

352
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,853
Kahlan?

353
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,987
You know me?

354
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,691
It's me, Dennee.

355
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,261
Your sister.

356
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,564
My sister is dead.

357
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,900
I know it's hard to believe,

358
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:45,735
I don't look like myself,
but it is me.

359
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,203
My spirit was summoned

360
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,239
from the Underworld
and placed in this body.

361
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:53,243
No, this is a trick.

362
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,378
Whoever she is,
she did try to confess me.

363
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:59,983
Do you remember
the meadowlark you found?

364
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,318
The hatchling
with the broken wing?

365
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:05,722
We brought it into the house.

366
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:08,324
You nursed it until
it could fly.

367
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,727
The day you set it free,
we both cried.

368
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,328
Do you remember
what you told me?

369
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,466
"The things you love--"

370
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,334
"The things you love
will always come back to you."

371
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:21,404
Look into my eyes.

372
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:22,839
You'll see I'm telling
the truth.

373
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,814
Little sister.

374
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:39,289
Have I pleased you, Mistress?

375
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:41,658
Very much so.

376
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:44,627
I have one final task for you.

377
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:46,596
When you've achieved it,

378
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:49,165
you'll have completed
your training.

379
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,500
Would that make you happy?

380
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:55,104
Whatever makes you happy,
Mistress, makes me happy.

381
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:59,309
I want you
to kill yourself.

382
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:07,984
Mistress, how can I
serve you if I'm dead?

383
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,331
General, don't give in to her!

384
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:25,435
Do it now.

385
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,370
Yes, Mistress.
General, no!

386
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:35,578
You've lost your mind.

387
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:40,316
Why train Grix if you were
just planning to kill him?

388
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:41,784
<i>The woman said this</i>

389
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:44,687
Mord-Sith had just left
and that she had killed you too.

390
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:48,524
I'm so glad
that you're alive.

391
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,293
She said once
I'd killed the Mord-Sith

392
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,794
she'd help me start
a new life.

393
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:54,097
Denna.

394
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,666
Richard and I tracked Grix
to a brothel she's running.

395
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:59,102
He thinks she's involved
with the general somehow.

396
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,004
He sent me back here
to get you and Zedd.

397
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,006
Apparently she was
supposed to stop me.

398
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:05,241
What better assassin

399
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,443
to send after a Mord-Sith

400
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,479
than a Confessor
bent on revenge.

401
00:24:09,546 --> 00:24:11,047
Her touch would have
been deadly to Cara

402
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,215
if you hadn't have
stopped her.

403
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:13,616
Why did you, Kahlan?

404
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,019
This woman and her
Sisters of the Agiel

405
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:19,022
came to Valeria,
hunted us.

406
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,825
I had to drown my own child
to keep him from them.

407
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:26,262
They killed his father,
and then she killed me.

408
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,730
I know.

409
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:28,865
You know?

410
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,700
There's so much
that I need to tell you,

411
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:32,735
but I don't have any time.

412
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,537
If Richard is with Denna,
he's in trouble.

413
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,072
We need to go now.

414
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,909
No. I'm not going anywhere
with that monster.

415
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:46,249
Mistress, General Bain
has arrived with his battalion.

416
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,684
And the rest of the officers?

417
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,787
They'll be here soon.

418
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:54,090
I want you and the others
to keep them in good spirits

419
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:57,326
until I'm finished here.
Of course, Mistress.

420
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,697
Hm.

421
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,467
We could have been
so good together, Seeker,

422
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:08,071
and in a way, we still can be.

423
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:12,008
The pain will be brief,
but intense.

424
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,543
You remember, don't you?

425
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,946
Whatever you're planning,
Kahlan will stop you.

426
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:19,248
Hm.

427
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:24,153
Not this time.

428
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,388
Goodbye, Seeker.

429
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:31,127
I nearly killed Cara when
I learned what she did to you.

430
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,462
Why didn't you?

431
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:35,098
Richard.

432
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:39,268
He needs her. She's proven
herself a loyal ally.

433
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:43,606
I struggle every day
with what she did to you.

434
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:46,109
A part of me still
wants vengeance,

435
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,977
but I've had to put
those feelings aside.

436
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:50,113
She isn't the person she was

437
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,215
when she led that
mission to Valeria.

438
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:53,583
She's changed.

439
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,417
Kahlan.

440
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,121
Something's wrong.
What is it?

441
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:01,557
My Agiels. Their magic,
it's not working.

442
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:05,495
There's no pain.

443
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,929
How can that be?

444
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:10,533
The Agiels get their power
from the Mord-Sith's bond

445
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,736
with the presiding Lord Rahl.
Richard.

446
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:17,540
If the bond has been severed,
it can only mean one thing...

447
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:21,711
Richard's dead.

448
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:44,367
How wonderful to see
you again, my brother.

449
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,504
Welcome to the Underworld.

450
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,229
There is someone else

451
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,898
you should say hello to.
Another new arrival.

452
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:12,367
I believe you're
already acquainted.

453
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,706
Grix.

454
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,877
The good general

455
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:25,247
was one of my most
faithful servants.

456
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,883
The chaos he unleashed
after my demise

457
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:31,653
sent thousands of souls
to this place.

458
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:34,389
I just offered to give
him a second life.

459
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:37,626
A chance to continue his
ruthless ways as a baneling,

460
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:39,928
but he refused.

461
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,898
He says his "Mistress"
instructed him to turn down

462
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:44,500
the Keeper's generous offer.

463
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,701
Do you know why?

464
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:49,104
Because he says that
she is going to use

465
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:52,741
magic to place his spirit
in your body.

466
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:06,755
For once,
our interests are aligned.

467
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:09,691
If what Grix here
says is true,

468
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,827
then Denna and this
sorcerer of hers

469
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:13,328
have revived an ancient magic

470
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:17,799
capable of stealing any soul
from the Underworld.

471
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,369
The Keeper cannot allow
anyone to hold this power.

472
00:28:20,436 --> 00:28:22,938
He must have dominion
over the dead.

473
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:24,706
You and your Keeper
are afraid of her.

474
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,909
There isn't much time, Richard.

475
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,311
Soon Grix will be summoned

476
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:32,447
and there isn't anything
I can do to stop it.

477
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:34,983
Once his spirit
is inside your body,

478
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:38,086
you will be my guest
here for eternity.

479
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:41,690
There's only one way
to thwart Denna's scheme.

480
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:43,759
Accept my offer.

481
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:45,694
Become a baneling.

482
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:48,564
Return to your body
before it's too late.

483
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:50,566
You're a fool if you
think I'm going to kill

484
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,401
to serve the Keeper.

485
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:53,902
You've already
killed enough people

486
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,171
to earn yourself
a place of honor here.

487
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,706
What difference
will a few more make?

488
00:28:57,774 --> 00:29:00,142
I won't do
the Keeper's bidding.

489
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,911
You do the Keeper's bidding
every time you take a life.

490
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:06,949
The reason you kill
doesn't make a difference.

491
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,951
You want to see your beloved
Kahlan again, don't you?

492
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:13,522
Kahlan will go on without me
and so will Zedd.

493
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,025
He'll name a new Seeker,
they'll find the Stone of Tears

494
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:19,795
and seal the rift.

495
00:29:19,862 --> 00:29:22,331
And you and your master will
be trapped in this pit forever.

496
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:33,642
Well, at least I will have
the pleasure of your company.

497
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,635
General?

498
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:02,170
Mistress.

499
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:04,172
I'm so pleased to see you again.

500
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,044
It's time for you to play
the role I've trained you for.

501
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:10,646
Are you ready?

502
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:13,148
<i>You are going to have</i>

503
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:17,719
the depths of time to reflect
on the mistake you just made.

504
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:20,122
Your body may belong
to Denna now,

505
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,824
but your eternal soul

506
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:25,861
belongs to me.

507
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,943
More wine, general?

508
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:45,747
General Grix called us here
to negotiate a truce

509
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:48,417
not to cavort with whores.

510
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,385
Now, where is he?

511
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,455
He's right here.

512
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,326
The Seeker.

513
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:00,629
I prefer the title

514
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:04,566
"Lord Rahl."

515
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:08,070
Rahl or not, my soldiers
will not fall to their knees

516
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:11,139
before a man who has slaughtered
so many of their comrades.

517
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,908
They will if they want
to keep their heads.

518
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:21,550
Anyone else?

519
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,959
Grix was a thug,

520
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:32,594
but he had the right idea.

521
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:34,463
Swear your allegiance to me

522
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,897
and I will unite
your battalions

523
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,933
and save D'Hara from itself.

524
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,846
Warriors of D'Hara.

525
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:53,949
Hear me.

526
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,951
You knew me as the Seeker,

527
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:59,254
but my true name
is Richard Rahl,

528
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,289
son of Panis Rahl,

529
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:04,860
and rightful heir
to the throne of D'Hara.

530
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,863
Since the death of my brother,

531
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,866
chaos has gripped our lands.

532
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:13,668
While your generals send you
into battle against each other,

533
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:16,371
dark forces have risen up,

534
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:20,609
threatened your homes,
your families.

535
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:24,012
We must not
be divided any longer!

536
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,782
He's alive.

537
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:29,084
That's not our Richard.

538
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:32,020
Then why is the magic
of the Agiels back?

539
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:35,323
Because the Seeker's heart
is beating again.

540
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:37,292
Unlike a Confessor's,

541
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,929
a Rahl's magic comes from
his blood, not his spirit.

542
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:44,432
March with me into
the People's Palace,

543
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,700
and I promise you:

544
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,602
D'Hara will be restored

545
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,404
to its days of conquest
and glory.

546
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:55,744
March with me
to the People's Palace

547
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,412
and to victory!

548
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:04,386
<i>Master Rahl, guide us.</i>

549
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,087
<i>Master Rahl, teach us.</i>

550
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:07,255
<i>Master Rahl, protect us.</i>

551
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:09,524
<i>In your light we thrive</i>

552
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:11,793
<i>In your mercy we are sheltered</i>

553
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,862
Well done, my lord.

554
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,050
Only the prophets know
what dark spirits

555
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:28,985
Denna's placed
inside Richard.

556
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,120
Whoever it is,
he's fully in Denna's control.

557
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:32,622
Mord-Sith only wear white

558
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,424
when they've finished
breaking someone.

559
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:36,492
How do we get him back?

560
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,729
I'm not very familiar with
this kind of dark sorcery,

561
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,064
but I do know that this Richard

562
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:44,834
will have to die for the true
Seeker to live again.

563
00:33:44,902 --> 00:33:47,403
We'll find the sorcerer
who brought back Dennee,

564
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:48,871
force him to do the same
for Richard.

565
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,607
Where is this sorcerer?

566
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,842
He must still be at the palace.

567
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,310
You can get in.

568
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:55,311
They know your face.

569
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,947
I'll find him and confess him.

570
00:33:58,015 --> 00:33:59,716
I doubt Denna was planning
on letting you live

571
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:01,184
if you came back.
I'll go with her.

572
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,219
How will I explain
you to the guards?

573
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,121
I'm sure I'm not the first
old man they've seen

574
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:06,823
in the company of a pretty,
young courtesan.

575
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,491
And Richard?

576
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,360
We can't attack
an entire legion.

577
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:12,762
We'll track them until
they make camp for the night,

578
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,164
then slip in and find him.

579
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:16,866
Then what?

580
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:20,470
Kill Lord Rahl and simply
walk off with his body?

581
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,576
You sent for me, Mistress?

582
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:29,012
You're no longer
to address me as "Mistress."

583
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,381
And from now on you will answer

584
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:34,617
only to "Richard"
or "Lord Rahl."

585
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:36,252
Do you understand?

586
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,688
Of course, Mistr-- Denna.

587
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:42,725
The men have earned
a few hours' rest,

588
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:43,860
but I'm not tired.

589
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,531
Take off your clothes.

590
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,512
What are you doing here?

591
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,547
I was told to come back after
I'd killed the Mord-Sith.

592
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,282
She's dead?

593
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,018
The woman who revived me

594
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:11,888
said that she would help
me start a new life.

595
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,860
She did ask me
to give you something.

596
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:22,899
He's all yours.

597
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:34,544
Command me, Confessor.

598
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:37,680
You will restore
the Seeker to his body

599
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,449
and the woman
who belongs to this one.

600
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:42,785
I will do as you say, Confessor,

601
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,822
but this elixir is very rare.

602
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:47,990
There's only enough left

603
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:51,694
to cast the spell one more time.

604
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:53,629
I can only bring
one of you back.

605
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,420
Take your hands off him.

606
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:23,326
Kill her.

607
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:31,434
Careful.

608
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,636
You wouldn't want to get blood
over your nice white leather.

609
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,204
Guards!

610
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:53,422
Guards!

611
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,362
Follow me.

612
00:37:09,506 --> 00:37:11,474
Kahlan!

613
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,442
You aren't going to kill
the man you love.

614
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:16,245
He's not the man I love.

615
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:19,115
No!

616
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:22,318
Drop your weapon

617
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:33,062
Mistress?

618
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,497
Kill them both.

619
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,667
Stand down, all of you.

620
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:40,136
What do you think you're doing,
lieutenant?

621
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:41,838
It's no use, general.

622
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:43,306
He's been confessed by me.

623
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,575
Would one of you fools
run him through?

624
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:46,843
You can try to kill him,

625
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,511
but before he breaths
his last breath,

626
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:50,079
he'll detonate that Whisperer.

627
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:52,515
Every living thing within
a league of here will be dead.

628
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:58,988
She's bluffing.

629
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:01,624
Kill her.
General,

630
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:04,026
you can live to fight another
battle if you leave now.

631
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:06,996
Or you can listen to her
and throw all of our lives away.

632
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:10,499
Do as I say.

633
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:16,706
I don't take orders
from Mord-Sith.

634
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:22,845
Only from the Lord Rahl
and he's dead.

635
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:24,981
Order the battalion to withdraw.

636
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,887
Cara, not now.
We came for Richard.

637
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,572
May I speak with you?

638
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:58,810
I just want you to know

639
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,912
I regret
what I did in Valeria.

640
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,620
I can't accept your apology.

641
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:10,889
I needed to say it anyway.

642
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,174
No!

643
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:43,655
We will see each other again,
brother.

644
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:17,622
Richard?

645
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,110
I didn't think I was going
to see you again.

646
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:40,178
Any of you.

647
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,349
We should get moving.

648
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,917
Still a lot of D'Haran
soldiers in the area.

649
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,286
The compass.

650
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:49,287
It's gone.

651
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:50,588
Denna.

652
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,424
She can't have gone far.

653
00:40:56,862 --> 00:41:00,398
Lucinda,
I'm glad you're all right.

654
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:03,902
Actually, it's Dennee.

655
00:41:06,872 --> 00:41:07,972
It's true.

656
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:14,245
I'm glad you're with us.

657
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:20,018
But Lucinda, she lost her life
so I could have this body.

658
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:23,187
There was only enough magic
to bring you back.

659
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:26,157
We should find Denna
before the trail goes cold.

660
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:30,595
We will.

661
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:33,398
But first there's someone
else we need to see.

662
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:39,337
She says you're
welcome to stay with her

663
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:41,105
and raise the boy
as your own.

664
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:42,540
May the Spirits protect you.

665
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:44,776
You explained I'm not
really her daughter?

666
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,945
She said
the boy needs a mother.

667
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,349
He reminds me of my son.

668
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:54,118
I'm sure Lucinda
would be very grateful.

669
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:59,257
I'm not sure how I feel about
living another woman's life.

670
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:00,458
Maybe I should go with you,

671
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:02,226
help with your quest.

672
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:03,595
It's too dangerous.

673
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:05,396
I've already
lost you twice,

674
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:07,665
I don't know what
I'd do if I lost you again.

675
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,434
You'll be safer here.

676
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,902
No one will know who you are.

677
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,371
I've ordered him to stay

678
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:16,841
and protect you in case
anyone does threaten you.

679
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,511
When you need me,
you know where to find me.

680
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:25,016
I'm so happy to have you back,
little sister.

681
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:39,430
Now, let's find that compass.

682
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:48,172
Hyah!
