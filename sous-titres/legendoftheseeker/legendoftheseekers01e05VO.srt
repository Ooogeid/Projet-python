1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,999
They're definitely dragon corps.

2
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,409
Darken Rahl's personal errand boys.

3
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,663
And they never stray far
from their master.

4
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,531
Fortune has shined on us today,
my friends.

5
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:45,920
All we have to do is stay on their heels
and the mice will lead us to the cheese.

6
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:48,839
Are you ready
to face Darken Rahl, boy?

7
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,833
What figure did you have
in your head, peddler?

8
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:01,936
Twenty thousand pieces of gold,
and that's my best price.

9
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:05,201
For that much, I'll need to see
if the merchandise is genuine.

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,025
Nobody said anything
about services for free.

11
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,219
Well, I'm saying it now.

12
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,776
What do you think they're buying?

13
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,622
Magical weapon, torture device.

14
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:26,877
It's a boy!

15
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,549
We're no good to the child
if we're dead.

16
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,212
Sync: dmbmh & Kasius

17
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,351
Let's see if you're the real thing.

18
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:47,119
What did my wife make me for breakfast
the day I left on this expedition?

19
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,820
It's not the lumpy porridge and
the greasy eggs you're thinking about.

20
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,551
It's the black eye
she gave you the night before.

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,122
Tell me something about one of my men
that I don't know.

22
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,376
Take your helmets off.
He needs to see right into your eyes.

23
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,016
There's nothing to tell.

24
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,762
Not one of my men has something
in his head that I don't know about?

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,315
Not impressive.
We've come a long way for nothing.

26
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,911
- March.
- Tell the man what he wants to know.

27
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,060
He's thinking about the seeker.

28
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,305
- We're all thinking about the seeker.
- Not the way he is.

29
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,040
He's hoping the seeker
kills Darken Rahl.

30
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,086
He's planning to kill Darken Rahl
himself, if he ever gets him alone.

31
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:58,803
You want time alone with Lord Rahl?
I can arrange that, Masslar.

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,467
Lord Rahl is gonna be very happy.

33
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,817
- Do you know what he is?
- He can see what people are thinking.

34
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,856
The way you and I would read
a list of things to buy at the market.

35
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,278
He is a true listener.

36
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,992
In our time,
I never thought I'd see it.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,453
The last true listener
died 700 years ago.

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,320
- We have to get that boy away.
- Yes, but not yet.

39
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,173
- What?
- If we track them,

40
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:34,449
they'll lead us
straight to Darken Rahl.

41
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,210
They won't hurt him.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,076
- He's too precious to them.
- We can't let Rahl

43
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:42,512
get control of that type of power.
If he knew what people think...

44
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,391
If we follow them,
we can find Rahl and kill him.

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,359
- And the boy will be safe forever.
- You do what you want.

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,233
But I'm getting him
away from them now.

47
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,651
Young people.
Everything is black and white,

48
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,823
either-or,
free the boy, follow the boy,

49
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,782
maybe there's a way we can do both.

50
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,807
So no one will recognize you
as the Great Wizard,

51
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,575
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

52
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:31,478
- but how are we gonna save the boy?
- With this.

53
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:35,053
I've being saving her
for a rainy day

54
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,152
I say it's pouring at the moment,
wouldn't you?

55
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,140
Shadow people.

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,756
Stay back!

57
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:15,513
- To whom do I owe my thanks?
- Grannack the Great,

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,036
Wizard of the First Order.

59
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,233
I've been after those monsters
for days.

60
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,825
There's a rift to the underworld
somewhere in these parts.

61
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,840
Shadow people have been
escaping left and right.

62
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:30,500
Forgive me if I caught you
in the crossfire.

63
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,415
And whom do I have
the honor of addressing?

64
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,215
Captain Ashgar.

65
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,645
Dragon corps.
Now that's a bit of luck.

66
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,715
There aren't many who can afford
real talent nowadays.

67
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:46,484
I was hoping perhaps the house of Rahl
might see the value

68
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,045
in what I can provide

69
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,392
You want us to bring you
into the presence of Lord Rahl?

70
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,469
A great wizard needs a great patron.

71
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,975
There are many who would like nothing
more than to stand before Darken Rahl.

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,985
Some as friends,

73
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,978
some as spies.

74
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,514
Let's see which you are.

75
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:10,275
Kranthor,

76
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:12,533
bring out the listener.

77
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,285
He's gone!

78
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,376
- Find him!
- Put me down!

79
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,935
It's okay. We're friends.

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,394
We just wanna take you home.

81
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,786
If you run,
they'll just catch you again.

82
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,556
That's okay with me.
They're gonna give me my own room.

83
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:58,140
In a castle.

84
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,469
You just better hope
they don't catch you,

85
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,131
Seeker.

86
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,704
Killing you is
all they ever think about.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,717
So, what are you gonna do, sell me?

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,062
Or use me yourself?

89
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,480
I'll tell you right now,
that'll cost you.

90
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,658
Where do your parents live?

91
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,928
Just my father.
My mother died before they took me away.

92
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,772
- Before who took you away?
- Some man

93
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:27,988
- who used me to cheat at cards.
- We don't have time to talk.

94
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,565
We can't let Darken Rahl
get ahold of you.

95
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,918
Where was home?
Where did they take you from?

96
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,747
- Obregon woods.
- That's just over the Grey Hills.

97
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,292
{\If we walked all night, w}We could be there by morning,
then head straight back and follow Zedd.

98
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,601
Whoever took him
knows how to cover his tracks.

99
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:45,643
Take half the men and find him.

100
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,933
Take Ranick. He could track
a snowflake in a blizzard.

101
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,021
I'll face Lord Rahl.

102
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,070
The only thing he hates more than bad
news is having bad news kept from him.

103
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,475
Surely turning up with a wizard
of the First Order in tow

104
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,732
- will temper his wrath.
- His wrath isn't easily tempered.

105
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,740
Chain the traitor to the horse.
We march all night.

106
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,120
Don't take your eyes off the wizard.

107
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,350
Are we close?

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,620
I used to climb that tree.

109
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,528
That's my house.

110
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,236
That's not him.

111
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,366
Excuse me.
There was a man that used to live here.

112
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,080
He had a little boy
who was kidnapped.

113
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,998
- Do you know where we might find him?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

114
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,709
I moved in a long time
after he moved away.

115
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,294
All I heard was...

116
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:09,839
What?

117
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,710
What did you hear?

118
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,531
Not in front of the boy.

119
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:22,165
Renn,

120
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:24,021
what is it?

121
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,602
He heard that I wasn't kidnapped.

122
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,549
He heard that my father sold me.

123
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,696
For a thousand pieces of gold.

124
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,384
Maybe it's not true.

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,059
Maybe it's just a rumor he heard.

126
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,557
You know when you pick up a rock

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,377
and there's all these disgusting
bugs and worms

128
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:05,917
crawling around under it.

129
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,274
That's what looking
inside peoples' heads is like.

130
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,449
Why should my father
be any different?

131
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,368
I've talked to anybody I could find.

132
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,419
He has no family here.

133
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:31,873
We have to get to Zedd.

134
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,091
A chance like this,
to get close to Rahl...

135
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,380
- We're not leaving him with strangers.
- Of course we're not.

136
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,927
There's a place called Thandor.
It's a hidden valley,

137
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,145
magically hidden from all evil.

138
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,989
The sisters of light
protect children like him.

139
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,733
Children with gifts.

140
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,903
- How long will it take to get there?
- Three days. Maybe four.

141
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,090
We'll make it three.

142
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,789
You tell him, I'll pack up.

143
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,025
We have to race.

144
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,247
The trail Zedd's leaving for us,
we don't know how long it'll last.

145
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Renn!

146
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,235
Tell me, Captain Ashgar, how many houses
have you personally burned to the ground

147
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,184
with the residents still inside?

148
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,476
I'm under orders to deliver tradors'
life for questioning, Masslar,

149
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,320
But I'm warning you.

150
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,922
When your mother bounced you
on her knee, did she say,

151
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,246
"What a wonderful little boy
someday you'll grow up

152
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,243
"to burn the eyes out of innocent men
with red hot iron stakes."?

153
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,440
One-minute stop for water.

154
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,054
No water for the traitor.

155
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:04,631
Stop him!

156
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,945
If our wizard{\ of the first order}
is so eager to be helpful,

157
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,570
why is he standing there
with his hands at his side.

158
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,296
Beyond your powers,
Grannack the Great.

159
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,379
Patience, Captain. I'm gathering
the magical forces necessary

160
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,182
for a spell of this magnitude.

161
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,006
It seems I have a more valuable
and more reliable gift

162
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,105
for Lord Rahl than I first thought.

163
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,445
Six pieces of silver.

164
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:15,960
Six pieces of silver,

165
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:19,131
and two pieces of gold.

166
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,057
The rose.

167
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,349
The lion.

168
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,538
And the bull.

169
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:37,441
The lion.

170
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,447
The lion.

171
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,327
And the star.

172
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,868
What sort of trick{\ do you think}
you're playing, boy?

173
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,122
Let him go!

174
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,291
A flagon of ale for whoever
gets these people out of here.

175
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:55,873
You are coming with me.

176
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,629
- That was my money. I won it!
- No, you stole it.

177
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,225
- You cheated.
- I let you take me home,

178
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,071
But I'm not going to some orphanage
for weird children.

179
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:07,971
I'm my own boss now.
You're not telling me what to do.

180
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:12,058
You{\ have to} come with us so we can take you
to Thandor and get back to our friend.

181
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:16,313
This may be hard for you to comprehend,
{\*but }the fate of the world{\ just} might depend on it

182
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,699
All right, I'm sorry to have to do this.
But I can't let you run away again.

183
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,210
Don't!

184
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:32,994
- You will not bind his hands!
- I am not gonna hurt him.

185
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,332
- I'm just gonna make sure...
- You will not.

186
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,548
Okay, fine. How about this?

187
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,220
If you run away again,
I{\'m gonna} take you back to that tavern

188
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,624
tell that gambler
how you cheated him.

189
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,270
Why don't you tell him
why the rope upsets you so much?

190
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,420
Sorry it has to be cold,
but we have no time to get a fire going.

191
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,990
I'm not eating that.

192
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,845
Come on, it's not bad, really.

193
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,350
- I want pheasant with blackberry sauce.
- Don't we all.

194
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,852
That's what the prince of Aspasia
used to give to me.

195
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,090
Every night of the week
if I wanted it.

196
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,319
Or he could forget about knowing

197
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,950
which one of his wives was sleeping
with the captain of the guard.

198
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,155
The first pheasant
I see is all yours.

199
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,533
I saw a nest of pheasants
a mile back,

200
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,924
There were blackberries
growing all over.

201
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,576
- We don't have time.
- If you're in a hurry,

202
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,139
I'm not stopping you.

203
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,001
I'll just wait right here
for the D'Harans to find me.

204
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Listen,

205
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:05,630
we're not stopping to pick blackberries
and hunt pheasant.

206
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,052
Then I guess I'll have to tell her about
the secret you've been keeping from her

207
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,525
- I don't have any secrets from Kahlan.
- I'm a listener.

208
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:22,375
Do you think there's anything
you can hide from me?

209
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,078
How would you like her to know

210
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,276
what you think about
when you look at her?

211
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,920
Not bad. Could use salt.

212
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:41,416
That's enough. Come on.

213
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,522
I need to rest a little
after all that food.

214
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,137
It was extremely kind of Richard to go
to all the trouble of cooking you this.

215
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,016
Try to understand
how important it is for all of us

216
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,864
to keep moving.

217
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,617
- I'm not ready to start walking.
- That is enough!

218
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:08,026
- On your feet now!
- He wants to kill me. I saw it!

219
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,195
- He wants to kill me!
- He's not gonna kill you.

220
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,141
It was just something
that he thought.

221
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,700
People sometimes think those sort
of things when they're angry.

222
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,621
- And then they usually do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

223
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:23,708
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
You are standing up now.

224
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,303
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

225
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,747
You have to stop that!
We don't know who's in these woods.

226
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,302
Over there!

227
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,094
This way!

228
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:52,185
Don't count on them giving you
a nice room in a castle.

229
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,032
If they think you're friends with {\the seeker}us,
you're gonna die with the seeker.

230
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,479
- We have to run.
- No time for that.

231
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,370
We're staying {\right }here.

232
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,090
You're coming with me, listener.

233
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,387
The most anybody ever paid for me
was 20,000.

234
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,104
I'm not worth getting killed over.

235
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,706
Could you crush those up for me?

236
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you doing this?

237
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,117
Why did you save my life?

238
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,775
Can't you just look in our heads
and see the answer to that?

239
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,747
I see it. I just...

240
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,442
don't understand it.

241
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,157
Why do you wanna destroy Darken Rahl
if you aren't interested in his throne

242
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,068
or his gold.

243
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,095
Why are you the only people
in the world who are like that?

244
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,889
We're not.
We're just the first ones you've met.

245
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,827
This place you're taking me to.

246
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,630
What are the people there like?

247
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,866
They're as good and kind
as anyone I've ever known.

248
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,132
- Then it's the wrong place for me.
- Why do you say that?

249
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,250
Because I'm bad.

250
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,700
- No, you're not...
- You don't know anything about it.

251
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,837
About the things I've done.

252
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,245
When I was working
for the empress of Threnegar,

253
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,126
She wanted to know
if there was anybody in her palace

254
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:08,980
who was plotting against her.

255
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,979
I told her there were three people.

256
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,286
The lord chamberlain,

257
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,276
the grand vizier and...

258
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,004
one of her sons.

259
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,326
She put their heads on iron stakes
in front of the palace.

260
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,052
- That was not your fault.
- Yes, it was.

261
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,804
And that was only one time.

262
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,650
If you knew how many...

263
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,629
Nobody gave you a choice.

264
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,181
What happened to you
was just as bad.

265
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,358
What?

266
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,150
What happened?

267
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,558
Nothing.

268
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,226
It's not nothing. Kahlan,

269
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,800
what happened to you?

270
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,480
What I can do to people...

271
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,699
Bring them under my control.

272
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,366
My mother did that to my father.

273
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,451
Why?

274
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,483
She had to.

275
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,789
And when I was 5 years old,

276
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,772
and my sister was 3,

277
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,898
my mom died,

278
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,915
and my father was freed
from her hold on him.

279
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,060
So he came to get us.

280
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,558
To claim what was his.

281
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,444
He started making us use our powers

282
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,030
to get what he wanted out of people.

283
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,285
We made them do...

284
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,206
such terrible things.

285
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,670
And if we tried not to he would...

286
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:03,414
Tie you up. Bind your hands.

287
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,932
That's why you didn't want me...

288
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,721
Why didn't you just use
your power against him?

289
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,552
Because he was her father.

290
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:32,034
When I was 11,

291
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,527
another confessor found us.

292
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,666
She took us away from my father,
and brought us to Thandor.

293
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,847
The sisters of light became
more than parents to us.

294
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,584
They didn't just
save our lives, they...

295
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,818
They gave us our lives.

296
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,060
It's okay.

297
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,659
It's just an owl
complaining about something,

298
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:17,705
the way owls do.

299
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,820
Does it still hurt?

300
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,004
I would say no,
but you'd know I'd be lying.

301
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,306
It's my fault you got hurt.

302
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,894
Making you stop to pick blackberries.
Screaming like that.

303
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,815
Why don't you hate me?

304
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,850
You should see more I put my father
through when I was your age.

305
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,485
Why haven't you told her
what you feel about her?

306
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,440
It's complicated.

307
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,494
You'll understand
when you get older.

308
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,168
It's not that complicated.

309
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,589
You're just scared
she doesn't feel the same way.

310
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,950
But you don't have to be scared.

311
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:11,843
She feels the same way you do.

312
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,643
- Why doesn't she say anything?
- I don't know.

313
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,230
I mean, I know.
It just doesn't make sense.

314
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,657
Something about

315
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,569
she's afraid to hurt you
with her powers.

316
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,729
Why aren't you lying down?

317
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,706
I'm not tired.

318
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,417
You should be asleep too.

319
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
I can't.

320
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,334
Come on, Renn. Give it a try.

321
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,244
We have a long long walk tomorrow.

322
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,285
<i>White glows the lily</i>

323
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,480
<i>Red glows the rose</i>

324
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,610
<i>Here lies my laddie</i>

325
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,853
<i>Look how he grows</i>

326
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,107
Bear's been by here.

327
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,695
Two of them{\, by the looks of it}. See where they scratched
their backs on the tree?

328
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,754
- Do they come out during the day?
- Only to eat children.

329
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,261
Why do we have to go
to this Thandor place?

330
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,514
I could just stay with you.

331
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,456
You can't, Renn. It's too dangerous.

332
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,038
I'm not scared. Do you have any idea
how much I could help you?

333
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:52,193
Yes, you could.
But we can't get you any closer to Rahl.

334
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
Of course.

335
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,113
Because then I might help him,

336
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,662
and that wouldn't be
so good for you.

337
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:03,389
- That's only part of it.
- It's all right. I understand.

338
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,172
<i>When shadows long o'er take the day</i>

339
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,687
<i>And evil doth enslave us</i>

340
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,479
<i>When war and strife
and fear hold sway</i>

341
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,351
<i>The seeker then shall save us</i>

342
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:28,375
I wonder how you'll sound
with your tongue cut out.

343
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>When cities burn and kingdoms fall
The seeker then shall sound his call</i>

344
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,665
<i>When men call Darken Rahl their lord</i>

345
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:41,367
<i>The seeker then shall
raise his sword</i>

346
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,858
<i>Days are dark and hope is lost</i>

347
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,635
<i>and times grow ever weaker</i>

348
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,131
<i>Springtime dies beneath the frost</i>

349
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,866
<i>Because then shall come the seeker</i>

350
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:04,592
Change of plan.

351
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,884
When I stand before
Darken Rahl tomorrow,

352
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:12,740
I will tell him that I took it
upon myself to flay the traitor alive,

353
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,957
tied to a pole at the crossroad,

354
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,654
Where all the passersby can watch
the crows feast on his eyeballs

355
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,236
and learn from his example.

356
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,008
And my last sight in this life

357
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,300
will be a treasonous wizard
gloating over my demise.

358
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,261
What's your price? Huh?

359
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,549
Gar got your tongue?

360
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,683
Times are hard for all of us.

361
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Halt!

362
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,711
In the name
of the council of Obregon.

363
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,410
Dad.

364
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:07,665
I got word that you were
asking for me at the old house.

365
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,579
I could hardly believe it. We rode
the horses half to death catching up.

366
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,667
We know that you sold him.

367
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,754
That was a rumor started
by the people who took him.

368
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,353
It was a lie.

369
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,127
There's a confessor here,

370
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,709
you're not taking the boy{\ anywhere}
until you answer to her.

371
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,297
Tell them

372
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,850
Look in my eyes and tell them
I've been looking for you, every day,

373
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:32,353
every night, for five long years

374
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,720
He's telling the truth.

375
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:48,035
Whoever you are, thank you
for bringing my son to me.

376
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,204
Your son is in great danger.

377
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,145
He needs help with his gift.

378
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:55,208
He should be brought to the sisters
of light until he's a little older.

379
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,545
He's my father. I'm going with him.

380
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,923
We should be going.
We have a long journey ahead of us.

381
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:19,275
Thank you, councilor

382
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,815
We should catch up with Zedd.

383
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,389
Prompt delivery of goods.

384
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,137
That's the way Darken Rahl
likes to do business.

385
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,598
Actually, you did me a favor.

386
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,646
I was planning to work
for the D'Harans anyway.

387
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,631
So thanks, dad.

388
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:59,773
I married your mother,
but I'm not your father.

389
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,901
No son of mine
would be a freak like you.

390
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:08,111
I would've sold you back
to those people you were with,

391
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:12,142
but nowadays,
nobody pays better than Darken Rahl.

392
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,811
He would've paid
three times more for me.

393
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,737
You sold me too cheap.

394
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:23,924
Specially outfitted
for the fistener.

395
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:26,234
Is there anything I can get you?

396
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,472
Pheasant with blackberry sauce.

397
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,905
Get the boy what he wants.
Then we race to the meeting point.

398
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,951
Lord Rahl is getting impatient.

399
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:40,725
What are you thinking?

400
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,984
If Renn was here
you wouldn't have to ask.

401
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:46,708
I don't have to ask.
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

402
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,549
We shouldn't have let Renn go.

403
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,970
He read his father's thoughts. If it was
wrong he wouldn't gone with him.

404
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:55,269
I'm not a listener or a confessor,
I can't tell when people are lying,

405
00:31:55,394 --> 00:31:58,665
but something in my gut is telling me
that man was hiding something.

406
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:02,411
Richard, are you sure
this isn't just because Renn

407
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,802
got into your heart?

408
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:07,209
Like he got into mine?

409
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,360
Maybe.

410
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:12,812
But, I can't let it go.

411
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:32,196
Stop!

412
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:36,793
Why?

413
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,331
He's under a powerful enchantment.

414
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:43,335
Whoever kills him
will come to terrible harm.

415
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:45,463
Possibly death.

416
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:48,707
Argoth will be honored
to take that risk.

417
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:51,564
Proceed!

418
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,114
Shoot it down! Kill it!

419
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,802
You did that.

420
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:20,496
Me?

421
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,209
I told you he was
under an enchantment.

422
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:28,282
Astonishing magic and a great wizard
in the same place at the same time.

423
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:30,360
Coincidence, do you think?

424
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:35,017
But who am I to judge
the truth of such matters.

425
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,883
We'll leave that to Darken Rahl.

426
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:39,882
Bind his hands.

427
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:42,097
He can't do magic without his hands.

428
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,012
- Where's Renn?
- That's no concern of yours.

429
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,672
Tell me where he is.

430
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:13,091
- Did you sell him?
- To the D'Harans?

431
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,802
He was only my stepson.

432
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,002
- And that's an excuse?
- Don't.

433
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:20,473
He's not worth it. Just take the money.
That's all he cares about.

434
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,537
- Which way did they go?
- South.

435
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:30,367
If you ever show your face to him again,
I will roast you like a pig on a spit

436
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:35,441
Richard, look!

437
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,526
Zedd's headed the same way as Renn.

438
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,177
Welcome back, listener.

439
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,100
- Seems you've had quite an adventure.
- What do you need me to do?

440
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:05,912
I need you to tell me who he is,

441
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,283
what he wants, and most importantly,

442
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:10,424
who is he working with.

443
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:25,737
You'd better tell the truth.

444
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,163
Yes,

445
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,043
he's a spy.

446
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,707
I suspected as much.

447
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,909
What he wants
is to kill Darken Rahl.

448
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:39,173
That I could have guessed.

449
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:46,961
But what you couldn't have guessed
is who he's working with.

450
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,571
- And that would be?
- Him.

451
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:51,939
What? That's a lie.

452
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:54,572
I swear, I've never seen
the wizard before.

453
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:57,373
Do you also swear
that you don't have a flask of spirits

454
00:35:57,498 --> 00:36:00,073
- tucked into your left boot, either?
- Spirits?

455
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:01,992
On duty? All right.

456
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:04,929
Give me my 10 lashes,
but I swear to you on my mother,

457
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:08,632
- I've never met the wizard.
- He didn't need to meet him.

458
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,375
It was all organized by him!

459
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,755
Calgor has been my friend
since childhood.

460
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,014
I know him and trust him
like a brother.

461
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:28,111
Well, ask your friend
what he was doing with your wife

462
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,507
while you were on maneuvers
last month.

463
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:36,400
That won't do you any good.

464
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:38,534
Unless you do the same

465
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:41,239
to him, and him, and him.

466
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,557
They're all in on the wizard's plot.

467
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,141
Arrest them all!

468
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:53,691
If you could free two fingers,
I'd be able to...

469
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,176
Hurry, Renn!

470
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:02,941
Look out!

471
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:00,483
If you saw what
your father was thinking,

472
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:02,202
why did you go with him?

473
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,907
I saw that he was going
to kill you both if I didn't.

474
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,243
I saw that he had
more men on their way.

475
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:10,989
Men with big knives.

476
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,577
And then I saw that you were
their friend.

477
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,462
And whose tracks are those?

478
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,006
Fox.

479
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,276
Silver, by the size of the prints.

480
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,172
- Excellent!
- Okay, enough tracking for today.

481
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:45,667
Time for history.

482
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:48,754
Tell me
the first wizards of Aydindril,

483
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,285
starting with Elenath.

484
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,204
Leave him be.

485
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:56,583
Give the boy too many lessons,
and he won't learn anything.

486
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,897
As if you ever let up on me
for one second.

487
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,671
We're here.

488
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:11,639
We're where?

489
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,065
Thandor.

490
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,640
Welcome, Renn.

491
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:04,042
We've all been looking forward
to meeting you.

492
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,910
- How did you?
- Henry.

493
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:09,156
Henry always knows what's coming,
long before it gets here.

494
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:17,456
We have to say goodbye now.

495
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,610
I don't want to.

496
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,586
I wanna stay with you.

497
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,254
We'll come back.

498
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,374
When the Midlands are free.

499
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:35,091
Tell him what you feel about him.

500
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,577
It'll be okay.

501
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,137
I'm sorry I kicked you
where I kicked you.

502
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,237
It's closing now.

503
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:52,512
Remember, moss grows
on the north side of the tree,

504
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:55,563
and cows lie down
when it's going to rain,

505
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,371
and you're gonna be all right

506
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,900
no matter what.

507
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,263
Go.

508
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,956
Well, if we ever get to be parents,
I guess we'll have had some practice.

509
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:37,824
Get away.

510
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,265
That's how you treat
a friend of mine?

511
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,697
Thank you, wizard.

512
00:41:49,327 --> 00:41:52,476
- I'm sorry I doubted you.
- You had every reason to.

513
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:56,216
I hope you enjoyed your flight,
because you won't have another.

514
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:59,082
That's a spell that only works
one time in a thousand.

515
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,225
You were lucky.

516
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,563
Long life to the seeker.

517
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,201
Long life to you, sir.

518
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,344
I'll join you in your fight
against Rahl,

519
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,472
wherever I am, however I can.

520
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,947
But right now,
I must make sure my family is safe.

521
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:17,117
What I can give you right now
is something I heard at the fort.

522
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:20,704
Darken Rahl just sent 200 men
to a city called Kelabra,

523
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,087
on a mission of great importance.

524
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:28,128
To Kelabra, then.

525
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,035
There's just one problem.

526
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:35,625
Kelabra was destroyed
in the eruption of Mount Mariah

527
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,220
2000 years ago,

528
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:40,514
and buried under millions
of tons of rock.
