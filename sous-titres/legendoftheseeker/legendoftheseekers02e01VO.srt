1
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,122
Bring him down!

2
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,456
Never forget this day, Rachel.

3
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,722
Tell your grandchildren
that you were there...

4
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,088
...when word came that
the great tyrant Darken Rahl...

5
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:25,355
...was gone forever.

6
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:26,722
Where did he go?

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,823
Thanks to the Seeker,
that monster is dead...

8
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:31,789
...and rotting for all eternity
in the Underworld.

9
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,088
Darken Rahl.

10
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,088
<i>Kneel before the Keeper.</i>

11
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,322
Forgive me, Master.

12
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,022
I have failed you.

13
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:01,022
<i>No. You have succeeded.</i>

14
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:03,722
<i>Exactly as I intended.</i>

15
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,155
My Lord?

16
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:08,222
<i>And now you will help me
expand my dominion...</i>

17
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,456
<i>...to the World Above.</i>

18
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,689
Yes, Keeper.

19
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:16,689
But I must warn you.

20
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:18,988
There is one who will
stand in your way.

21
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,656
As he stood in mine.

22
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:25,889
<i>There is no escape from death.</i>

23
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:29,222
<i>Even the Seeker
will belong to me.</i>

24
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,522
To the Seeker.

25
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:35,456
To the Seeker!

26
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:43,222
* When shadows long
O'er take the day *

27
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,955
* And evil doth enslave us *

28
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,355
This is flattering,

29
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:49,756
...but we should
get on the road soon.

30
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,289
If we leave now,

31
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,422
...we can put in six leagues
before the moon goes down.

32
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,856
And offend our hosts?

33
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:58,155
* Kingdoms fall
The Seeker then shall *

34
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:00,155
The tyrant's only
been dead a week.

35
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,988
Savor each victory, Richard.

36
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,556
As though it were
a juicy leg of mutton.

37
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:06,689
You never know when
it'll be your last.

38
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,322
Well, that's encouraging.

39
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,155
That was lovely.

40
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,823
Rachel.

41
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,722
Come.

42
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,322
Sit, child.

43
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,189
Are you going to stay here
with us?

44
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:25,556
It's nice here.

45
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,656
I wish we could.

46
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,988
But Richard and I need to see
Kahlan safely to Aydindril.

47
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,556
Why are you going there?

48
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:36,889
That's where
the Mother Confessor presides.

49
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:39,422
The Midlands under
the rule of law and justice.

50
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,122
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

51
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,389
Are you going to marry Richard?

52
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:45,955
Rachel!

53
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:47,155
Uh, it's all right.

54
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:48,889
Um...

55
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,189
No, we're not
getting married.

56
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,189
Don't you love each other?

57
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,789
Yes.

58
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:01,456
But my duties
as a Confessor,

59
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:03,622
...my powers,

60
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,988
...keep me from being able...

61
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,955
...to be a wife to Richard.

62
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,222
That's not fair.

63
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,022
It's awfully warm in here,
isn't it?

64
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:16,055
How about a special treat
to cool you off?

65
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,189
Yes, please.

66
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,022
Do you like apple cider?

67
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,988
There you go, my dear.

68
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,556
Everybody stop!

69
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,988
The creature can only
see you if you move.

70
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,722
Martha!

71
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,189
Rachel. Stop.

72
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:32,522
Hey, you. Over here.

73
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,155
Come on.

74
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:05,389
Right here, you bastard!

75
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,889
We're wasting time, Cara.

76
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,689
You're disturbing my bath,
Triana.

77
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,656
While you're washing
your hair,

78
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:58,155
...D'Hara is going to pieces.

79
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:01,389
We should go to
the People's Palace now.

80
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,055
And do what when
we get there?

81
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,489
Loot the wine cellar?

82
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:10,791
We swear our allegiance
to Lord Rahl.

83
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,780
Lord Rahl is dead.

84
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:15,923
If he were the last
of his bloodline,

85
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,289
...then our Agiels would
have lost their power.

86
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:37,534
If and when the new Lord Rahl
should claim the throne,

87
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,988
...we'll decide if he's worthy
of our services.

88
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:44,022
Until then,

89
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:46,088
...who better to bring order
to the territories...

90
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,489
...than the Mord-Sith?

91
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,556
I've called for a meeting...

92
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,222
...of all our sisters
at the Temple of Jandralyn.

93
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,856
We leave today.

94
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,222
When did you
become queen?

95
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,556
I must have missed
the coronation.

96
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,689
I demand
an honorable death.

97
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:22,789
It's my right
as a Mord-Sith.

98
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,456
You deserve no honor.

99
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,589
You will stay alive,
and serve me.

100
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,722
Does anybody else
have a problem?

101
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,856
Tracks came from down here.

102
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,589
What in the name of the Spirits?

103
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:05,023
It's as I feared.

104
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,522
The creatures escaped
from the Underworld.

105
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,188
It's a screeling.

106
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,555
Like the nursery rhyme.

107
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,389
<i>The screelings are loose,</i>

108
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,222
<i>The Keeper may win,</i>

109
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,903
<i>His assassins have come
To rip off your skin.</i>

110
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,489
If I remember right,
the poem says...

111
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:21,422
...the only way to kill it
is to hack it into pieces.

112
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:23,489
Richard tried hacking it
with the Sword of Truth.

113
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,155
It didn't even seem
to hurt the creature.

114
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,089
If we can't kill it,
we'll find it and trap it.

115
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,756
Our problems are far greater
than one nasty monster.

116
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:32,989
This crack in the earth,

117
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:35,188
...it's a tear in the veil
that separates the Underworld...

118
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,656
...from the World of the Living.

119
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:38,920
As long as it's open,

120
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,322
...there's no way to prevent
the Keeper of the Underworld,

121
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:42,989
...the great enemy
of all that walks,

122
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,056
...breathes and grows
in the light,

123
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,589
...from sending his minions...

124
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,989
...to bring death
to every living thing.

125
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:52,455
I fear the screeling
is but the vanguard.

126
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,056
How could this
have happened?

127
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:56,789
In all my years
as a Wizard,

128
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,355
I have only known
one form of magic...

129
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:01,056
...strong enough
to tear the veil.

130
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,756
The Power of Orden.

131
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,522
This happened when
I killed Rahl.

132
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,589
When the Boxes of Orden
exploded.

133
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,922
Wizard's Second Rule:

134
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:16,656
The greatest harm can come
from the best intentions.

135
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,056
Well, if I did this,
I'll find a way to undo it.

136
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:22,023
The only way I know of
to close the rift...

137
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,889
...is the way the Creator
sealed the Underworld...

138
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,389
...at the beginning of time.

139
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:28,322
The Stone of Tears.

140
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,450
He who possesses the Stone...

141
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,389
...would be able
to repair the veil.

142
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,789
Then we'll find it.

143
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,922
The Stone has been lost
for centuries beyond count.

144
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,440
Many have given their lives
searching for it.

145
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,386
If anyone can find it,
the Seeker can.

146
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,422
Kahlan, I share your faith
in Richard.

147
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,455
But the veil is delicate.

148
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,722
In the time it takes
to find one tiny Stone...

149
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,355
...amid all the rocks
and mountains of creation,

150
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:56,389
...cracks like this
could appear anywhere,

151
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:59,555
...spreading and splintering
in all directions.

152
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:01,288
And then
there would be nothing...

153
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,989
...to prevent the Keeper
from waging war...

154
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,889
...on the World of the Living.

155
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,389
Seeker!

156
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,123
D'Harans soldiers
are in the town.

157
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,422
They're demanding
to see you.

158
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,489
Darken Rahl is dead.

159
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,822
The war is over.

160
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,956
Lay down your arms,
or you will feel my Sword.

161
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:45,489
We have not come to fight,
My Lord.

162
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,155
Master Rahl, guide us.

163
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,689
Master Rahl, protect us.

164
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,956
In your light, we thrive.

165
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,489
In your wisdom, we are humbled.

166
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:04,789
We live only to serve.

167
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:07,056
Our lives are yours.

168
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,355
I was born
into the service...

169
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,956
...of Darken Rahl's
father,

170
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,489
...Lord Panis Rahl.

171
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,155
Some called him a tyrant,

172
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,555
...but in his time
there was peace...

173
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:26,489
...and order throughout
the territories.

174
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,522
<i>He took pride
in his first-born son.</i>

175
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,555
<i>But as the boy grew older,</i>

176
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:35,288
<i>...the father came to see...</i>

177
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,989
<i>...the darkness
in his son's heart.</i>

178
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,089
<i>And his love...</i>

179
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:42,756
<i>...for the dark ways of sorcery.</i>

180
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,956
<i>The father began to fear
for the future of his kingdom.</i>

181
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,288
When he learned
of a Prophecy...

182
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,155
...that said he would
sire another son,

183
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:53,555
...one who would kill his
black-hearted older brother,

184
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:57,089
Panis set out to ensure
the truth of that Prophecy.

185
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,455
He fathered a child...

186
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:00,889
...with a young woman...

187
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:04,355
...whose bloodline was
as powerful as his own.

188
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,089
Tarralyn Zorander.

189
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,355
That's a lie.

190
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:10,756
My daughter would never...

191
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,756
...have lain with Panis Rahl.

192
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,188
Yes, Wizard.
Panis knew this too.

193
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,656
<i>Which is why he wooed Tarralyn...</i>

194
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:21,922
<i>...in the guise
of a young shepherd.</i>

195
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:25,389
<i>In this form,
he won her heart,</i>

196
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,689
<i>...and conceived
a child with her.</i>

197
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,123
But in his pride,

198
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,422
...my master made
a foolish mistake.

199
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,023
He boasted to Darken Rahl...

200
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,489
...that the son prophesied
to kill him would soon be born.

201
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,155
<i>In a rage,</i>

202
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,722
<i>...Darken Rahl
slew his own father...</i>

203
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,589
<i>...and commanded me
to dispose of the body.</i>

204
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:56,222
<i>But I convinced Panis Rahl's
most faithful Mord-Sith...</i>

205
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:59,056
<i>...to revive him
with the Breath of Life,</i>

206
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,389
<i>...then killed her
to protect the secret.</i>

207
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,389
While Panis
went into hiding,

208
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,355
...I dispatched a rider
to Tarralyn's father,

209
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,656
...to warn him that Darken Rahl
had ordered the death...

210
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,288
...of all first-born sons
of Brennidon,

211
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:18,756
...where the Prophecy said
the child would be born.

212
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,255
I never knew who sent me
that message.

213
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:31,389
And we never knew
if you received.

214
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,555
This is some sort of trap.

215
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:36,288
It's no trap, My Lord.

216
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:39,155
I have carried this secret
for 24 years,

217
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,288
...waiting for the day that
the Prophecy might be fulfilled,

218
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,656
...so that I could pledge
my loyalty to you...

219
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:48,023
...and to escort you
back to the People's Palace...

220
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,589
...to assume your rightful place
on the throne.

221
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,123
If you do not believe me,

222
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:56,522
...order your Confessor to do what
she must to verify my words.

223
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,322
There's no need.

224
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,489
He's telling the truth.

225
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:09,822
Tighter.

226
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,056
Yes, Mistress.

227
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:15,722
Is there anything else
I can do to please you?

228
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,389
I'm sure there is.

229
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,489
When we have more time.

230
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:55,622
Lord Rahl.

231
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,222
Scrubbing the floors,
Triana?

232
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,155
I would've thought that
were beneath your station.

233
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:03,255
You're alive.

234
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,188
No, not alive.

235
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,555
But still your master.

236
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:14,288
And I need you to perform
a special task for me.

237
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:17,023
And for the one
I serve.

238
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,555
Lord Rahl serves no man.

239
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,422
Not a man, Triana.

240
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,056
But we all have
our masters.

241
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,589
Mine is
the Keeper of the Underworld.

242
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,689
And when he conquers all life,

243
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:35,856
...those who stood by him
will be rewarded.

244
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:39,288
If my Lord follows the Keeper,
then so do I.

245
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,222
But Cara has taken command.

246
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,188
Cara helped the Seeker
to kill me.

247
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,389
She cannot
be trusted.

248
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:50,622
Which is why before
you begin this special task...

249
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,722
...I have for you,

250
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:56,155
...you and your sisters
must destroy her.

251
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:59,656
How could I have been...

252
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,056
...so consumed by the acquisition...

253
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:02,589
...of magic and power
that I neglected...

254
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,922
...to protect
my own daughter?

255
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:05,856
Zedd, I'm sorry.

256
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,300
Listen to me,

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,122
...thinking of myself,
when you've just learned...

258
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:13,453
...that the great tyrant you fought
so hard to kill was your on brother.

259
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,222
No. He wasn't.

260
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,322
Richard, I know this is
hard to accept but--

261
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:19,889
Kahlan, I'm not challenging
the words...

262
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,222
...of the Mother Confessor here.

263
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,756
But blood isn't
what makes somebody family.

264
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,856
I didn't share blood with
George and Mary Cypher,

265
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,389
...but they'll always be
my parents.

266
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,856
Now Zedd,
do you have any idea...

267
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,689
...where we can pick up the trail
of the Stone of Tears?

268
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:34,289
If there is a clue,

269
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,522
...it's to be found
in the ancient volumes...

270
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,589
...at the Wizard's Keep
in Aydindril.

271
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,689
Go, find what you can.
Kahlan, stay here.

272
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,222
Call the people
of the town inside,

273
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,689
...board up every window
and doorway.

274
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:45,889
What about you?

275
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,322
The screeling
is still out there.

276
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,088
I'm gonna hunt it down
and kill it.

277
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,489
You say you and your men
will follow me?

278
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,568
To the death,
My Lord.

279
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:56,900
Maybe with a few more swords,

280
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:59,255
...we can hack this thing
to pieces.

281
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,289
And then we're going
to the People's Palace.

282
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,322
You're going to proclaim
yourself the new Lord Rahl?

283
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:09,088
You said it yourself.

284
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,255
Our problem is a lot bigger
than one monster.

285
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,422
With the veil torn,
the Keeper will wage war...

286
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,289
...on the World of the Living.

287
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,889
And if we have
to fight that war,

288
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,988
...we could use
an army behind us.

289
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:22,022
I must warn you to expect
violent opposition, My Lord.

290
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,122
What are you
talking about?

291
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,923
My men and I alone bear
the secret to your parentage.

292
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:30,823
Many D'Harans will not easily
accept your claim to the throne.

293
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:33,355
In order to win the allegiance
of the greatest number,

294
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,823
I recommend you
immediately execute...

295
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,489
...every member
of the Third Battalion.

296
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:42,322
I'm not gonna kill
my own men.

297
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:44,889
They are D'Harans,
My Lord.

298
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,988
If they are to follow you,
they must fear you.

299
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:49,988
I'll find a way
to deal with them.

300
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,622
Right now,
we're going to kill a screeling.

301
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:10,923
Wolves?

302
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,965
That's no wolf.

303
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:36,756
Since the custom
has been broken,

304
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,656
...we won't give her
an honorable death.

305
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,489
We will leave her,

306
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,055
...to that shrieking creature,

307
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,422
...or the townspeople.

308
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:49,522
Whoever gets her first.

309
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,222
The work of the screeling,
My Lord.

310
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,555
We'll find him
before he kills again.

311
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,156
What is that?

312
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,656
Rachel!

313
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,055
Martha!

314
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,588
Protect
your daughters.

315
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,622
Mother!

316
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,988
- Mama!
- Sarah!

317
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,712
No mercy!

318
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,055
Trimack.

319
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:42,724
Forgive me, Lord Rahl.

320
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,489
I have failed
to protect you.

321
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,856
Seeker?

322
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,955
Why are you doing
marching with these dogs?

323
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,556
Call off your men,
and I'll call off mine.

324
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:05,055
Put down your weapons!

325
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:06,155
Stand down!

326
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:13,055
I'm Morwyn Bryer,

327
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,823
...leader of the resistance
in this valley.

328
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:17,656
We got word the Dragon Corps
were marching on Ehrengard...

329
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:20,656
...and gathered as fast
as we could.

330
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:21,988
But they've already
left a trail...

331
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:23,823
...of slaughtered men,
women and children.

332
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,489
Those people were killed
by a screeling,

333
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:26,756
...escaped from
the Underworld.

334
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:29,550
A screeling?

335
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,223
These men are
helping me track it.

336
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,955
They say the Seeker is wise,

337
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:35,622
...but only a fool
would trust D'Harans.

338
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,955
You will address Lord Rahl
with respect.

339
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,689
Lord Rahl?
It's not what you think.

340
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,856
The Seeker has taken on the
title of his greatest enemy?

341
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:47,222
A title he was born to.
We fought to trade Rahls?

342
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,222
You fought for your freedom,
and you won it.

343
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,889
The war against
the D'Harans is over.

344
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,722
But we're fighting
a new war now,

345
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:55,222
...against an even
more powerful enemy.

346
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:56,823
And if we
stand together--

347
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:59,055
You expect us
to fight shoulder to shoulder...

348
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:00,656
...with the butchers
who massacred...

349
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,689
...our friends
and defiled our daughters?

350
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,022
Rebel coward!

351
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,656
Any man here who raises
a weapon against another...

352
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,622
...will die by my sword!

353
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:15,110
It's Ehrengard.

354
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:16,953
The screeling must have
gone back to the town.

355
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:18,456
Go.
Protect your families.

356
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:20,422
Let's move.

357
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,088
<i>We saved as many as we could,</i>

358
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:24,222
...but they got away
with seven girls.

359
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,931
Including Rachel.

360
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,254
We'll get them back.

361
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,756
We're going after
the Mord-Sith.

362
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,656
My Lord,

363
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,355
...we came here to escort...

364
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:43,355
...the new Lord Rahl
to the People's Palace,

365
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:45,389
...not save a few
little girls.

366
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,213
You know what will happen
to those girls.

367
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:50,255
Torture.

368
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,279
Death to those
who won't break.

369
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:53,756
That is how
they become Mord-Sith.

370
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,722
How it has always been.

371
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,422
So they can serve
the Lord Rahl.

372
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,522
And if you
truly were him,

373
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,823
...you would not pity them.

374
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,122
You would know that some day
you will need to use them.

375
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:07,988
That's not how things
are going to be anymore.

376
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:11,489
Maybe old Trimack
was wrong.

377
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,088
Maybe this man
is too soft-hearted...

378
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:15,656
...to lead D'Hara--

379
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,456
Anyone else wanna
question my orders?

380
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,766
The Mord-Sith temple
was abandoned, Lord Rahl.

381
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:37,979
We found this one
in a gully.

382
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:39,445
Cara.

383
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:40,545
Lord Rahl?

384
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:43,778
You've certainly come up
in the world.

385
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:48,645
Where are the children?
What children?

386
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,812
The girls your sisters
took from Ehrengard.

387
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:55,390
If any girls were taken,
my sisters must have done it...

388
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,678
...after they beat me
and left me to die.

389
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,011
I'll get the truth
out of her.

390
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:01,412
You can tell
she's lying?

391
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:05,612
Their training makes
the Mord-Sith hard to read.

392
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,845
But I'll find out.

393
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,412
She's the one who helped me
kill Darken Rahl.

394
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:18,879
Whatever she did,
she did to save her own skin.

395
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,412
Richard, we can't trust her.

396
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm not telling you
to trust her.

397
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,703
I'm telling you
to trust me.

398
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:35,407
You're going to help us
find your sisters.

399
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,345
If you help me kill them.

400
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,745
Don't be scared.

401
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:54,578
The Seeker and the Confessor
will save us.

402
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:55,879
I said no talking.

403
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,445
No.

404
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,512
It's my fault. Punish me.

405
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,734
Since you're so eager,

406
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,779
I don't see why we couldn't

407
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,678
...begin with your training
right now.

408
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,858
Triana. I got your message.

409
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,274
What's so important?

410
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,678
How about a treasonous
Dragon Corps squadron?

411
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,779
Escorting none other
than the Seeker...

412
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,745
...to the People's Palace.

413
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,512
To proclaim him
the new Lord Rahl.

414
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,278
I thought that might
interest you.

415
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,678
That way.

416
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,412
Wait.

417
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,712
If they went that way,

418
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,146
...they took the girls
to the Drowning Cave.

419
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,812
Drowning Cave?

420
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,678
During the rains
the river floods it.

421
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,478
Uncooperative trainees are left
there just before a storm.

422
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,400
Charming.

423
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,350
In the dry season,
you can get in,

424
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,792
...but only through
a high narrow canyon.

425
00:25:57,827 --> 00:26:00,972
But once you're in,
there's no other way out.

426
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:02,419
It's a trap.

427
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:03,812
And I'm sure it's just
a coincidence...

428
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,478
...that a squadron
of the Third Battalion...

429
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:09,011
...has been camped in the meadow
just south of the cave.

430
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:11,467
Richard, maybe this was
their plan all along.

431
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:12,879
Lure you into an ambush...

432
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,245
...because they knew you would do
anything to save the children.

433
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,712
Yes, the Seeker's
kind-heartedness...

434
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,978
...is legendary.

435
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,450
If water flows into the cave
it has to flow out somewhere.

436
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,000
There's an aquifer
that empties into the marsh.

437
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,720
But it's barely big enough
to crawl through,

438
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,559
...and anybody who tried
would be greeted...

439
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:35,400
...by Mord-Sith as soon as they
came through the other side.

440
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,263
We can draw most of the
Mord-Sith out of the cave...

441
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:38,955
...if we stage an attack
through the canyon.

442
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,178
Richard,
that's exactly what they want.

443
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,879
That's what we'll give them,

444
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:44,345
...while you go through the aquifer
and rescue the girls.

445
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:47,800
You'll show her the way.

446
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:49,678
Anybody who marches
into that canyon...

447
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:51,445
...will be outnumbered
and pinned down.

448
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,720
They'll be slaughtered.

449
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,750
Death means nothing to us,
Lord Rahl.

450
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,133
We will do
whatever you command.

451
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,544
Hello, Zeddicus.

452
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,245
What brings the great Shota
so far from Agaden Reach?

453
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:29,945
The great Zeddicus,
what else?

454
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:35,778
A personal visit
to an old friend?

455
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:42,578
If you're looking for answers,
I don't have any yet.

456
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,811
I'm on my way to Aydindril
in search of them.

457
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:46,645
I've already had a vision...

458
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:48,778
...of exactly what you will
discover in Aydindril.

459
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:53,212
A passage in
the Seventh Codex of Sandragon...

460
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,645
...will direct you
to the hiding place...

461
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:56,478
...of the Stone of Tears.

462
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,379
I couldn't have hoped
for better news.

463
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:03,312
Tell me what the passage says
so I can relay it to the Seeker.

464
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:06,511
Yes, we're all relying
on the Seeker.

465
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:10,611
But not Richard Rahl.

466
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,444
It is written in
the Halls of Prophecy...

467
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,945
...that Richard Rahl
will fail...

468
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:17,711
...in his quest
to defeat the Keeper.

469
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,078
Richard puts
no faith in Prophecy.

470
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:30,578
He will defeat the Keeper
just as he defeated Darken Rahl.

471
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,345
Yes, he did defeat
Darken Rahl...

472
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,379
...exactly as
the Prophecies predicted.

473
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:37,012
But now the Prophecy says
he will fail.

474
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,078
You can't pick or choose...

475
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:42,145
...which Prophecies you want
to believe in, Zeddicus.

476
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:48,811
So I should throw up my hands,
give up?

477
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,511
No,
the Prophecy is forked.

478
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:52,912
It can be avoided.

479
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:55,478
But if the World of the Living
is to be saved,

480
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,945
...you must name
a new Seeker.

481
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:04,544
What kind of trick is this?

482
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,945
Richard is the one,
true Seeker.

483
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:13,411
Are you speaking now
as a Wizard of the First Order?

484
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,511
Or as his grandfather?

485
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:19,545
Three signs will
come before you.

486
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:21,612
First,

487
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,545
Richard will deny
that which gives him power.

488
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:27,812
Second,
he will embrace the one in red.

489
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,850
And finally,
he will bear the mark...

490
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:33,420
...of the one who will
destroy all of life.

491
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,799
When you've seen
these three signs,

492
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
...you will know that
I have spoken the truth.

493
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,079
And if you do not then
do what must be done,

494
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,161
...the Keeper will win,

495
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:47,895
...and the World of the Living
will be devoured...

496
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:49,329
...by the Realm of Death.

497
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,389
Where is the Seeker?

498
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,129
Has your new Lord Rahl
abandoned you already?

499
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,096
Give us the girls,

500
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,697
...and we'll let you live.

501
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:31,996
It is you and your men
who will die here today.

502
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,096
Halt.

503
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,697
Traitors!

504
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:46,697
Slaughter them all!

505
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:49,697
For D'Hara
and Lord Rahl!

506
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,463
This way.

507
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,363
Give me your hand.

508
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:21,597
I don't know exactly
what you did...

509
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:22,829
...to make Richard trust you.

510
00:31:26,043 --> 00:31:28,563
But if this is
some sort of trick,

511
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,530
I will kill you.

512
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,829
Hello, sisters.

513
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:53,963
I've brought you a prize.

514
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,663
The Mother Confessor.

515
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:10,830
Kahlan. I knew you'd come.

516
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:12,663
We have to go. Fast.

517
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:15,197
Help me
get them out of here.

518
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:16,663
I didn't come
for the children.

519
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,729
This belongs to me.

520
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,564
Thank you, Seeker.

521
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,263
I shudder to think
what would have happened...

522
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,530
...if you weren't here.

523
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:12,963
You should thank these men too.

524
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,464
They fought together...

525
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,163
...to help save Rachel
and the other girls.

526
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,718
It would have been an honor
to die for Lord Rahl.

527
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:20,430
My men and I
fight for the Seeker.

528
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,297
Not Lord Rahl.

529
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,230
War is easy.

530
00:34:29,297 --> 00:34:32,030
It's peace
that will break your heart.

531
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,397
Zedd.
Why are you back so soon?

532
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:35,796
I ran into our
old friend Shota.

533
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:37,629
What did she want?

534
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:40,363
Zedd, is something wrong?

535
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,596
Hey!

536
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,996
You wanna rip
somebody's head off,

537
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:13,363
...take mine.

538
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:27,463
Unh! Zedd, now!

539
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:08,495
"Seek out the abbot
of the Cloister of Ulrich...

540
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:11,896
...for he keeps the secret of
the Stone close to his heart."

541
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,796
These are the words
written in Codex.

542
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:16,397
Ulrich is in the
opposite direction...

543
00:36:16,463 --> 00:36:17,896
...of the People's Palace.

544
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:20,330
I'm not going
to the People's Palace.

545
00:36:20,397 --> 00:36:21,424
But I thought--

546
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:22,929
I'm not claiming the throne.

547
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,450
You're denying that which
would give you power.

548
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:31,750
What's important right now
is finding the Stone of Tears...

549
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:32,700
...and closing the rift.

550
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:35,944
Richard, the Stone
is a very small object...

551
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:37,777
...in a very large world.

552
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,143
Think how much more ground...

553
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,743
...you could cover
with the armies of D'Hara...

554
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,210
...under your command.

555
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:44,076
Even if an army could help us,

556
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:46,710
...how many would I have to kill
to unite the D'Harans?

557
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:50,577
How long would it take while
the Keeper grows stronger?

558
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,643
And think of the thousands who
saw their brothers and sons die...

559
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,910
...fighting the House of Rahl.

560
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:57,643
Would they follow me
if I claim...

561
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,643
...the title of the tyrant
they despised?

562
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:04,477
Or would I become the same
enemy I'd just defeated?

563
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:06,944
You could
do things differently.

564
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:10,143
Today you convinced enemies
to fight side-by-side.

565
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,743
A few men.

566
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,677
Against other followers of Rahl
who still wanted to kill me.

567
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:16,043
If people want to follow me...

568
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,143
...because they believe
in what I'm fighting for,

569
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,928
I'll lead them.

570
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,063
But I'm not
crowning myself king.

571
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,910
I'm not Lord Rahl.

572
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:29,777
I'm Richard Cypher.

573
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:32,976
I'm the Seeker.

574
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,109
And you are
the Mother Confessor.

575
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,577
Zedd and I will see you
safely to Aydindril,

576
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:46,276
...and then we'll hunt
for the Stone.

577
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:48,922
And when it's over,
I'll come back for you.

578
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:52,822
Richard,
I don't like it.

579
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:56,176
The two of you alone?

580
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,376
Three.

581
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,009
A Mord-Sith
serves Lord Rahl.

582
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,210
You don't strike me
as a type of person...

583
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,677
...who likes to serve anybody.

584
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:10,777
And I'm not accepting
the title Lord Rahl.

585
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,076
If you're foolish enough...

586
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:15,510
...to turn down
the throne of D'Hara,

587
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,243
...then you need me all the more.

588
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,777
- All right.
- Richard.

589
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,677
Twice now she's proven herself
to me. I can use her.

590
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,543
We best say our goodbyes,

591
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,009
I've got a long journey.

592
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,459
Embracing the one in red.

593
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,880
What?

594
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,570
Nothing.

595
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,309
Aydindril.

596
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,555
Seventy leagues
over that ridge.

597
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:32,110
I've been thinking.

598
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:34,609
You said yourself the most
important thing right now...

599
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,377
...is finding the Stone of Tears.

600
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,377
I should be helping you
do that.

601
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:44,410
What about Aydindril?

602
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:49,609
I'll get there.

603
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:51,177
When all this is over.

604
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,609
But as long as
you're still the Seeker,

605
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,843
...you need your Confessor
by your side.

606
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:45,043
What do you want?

607
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,143
To give you fair warning.

608
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,143
We are brothers,
after all.

609
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,497
You're no brother to me.

610
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:57,810
You've already killed me once.

611
00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:59,710
You can't kill me again.

612
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,343
You believe you're fighting
for peace, for freedom.

613
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,248
But how many have you killed
in this fruitless quest already?

614
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,000
How many will
you kill tomorrow?

615
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:14,908
Everything you do trying
to defeat my master,

616
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,708
...only makes him stronger.

617
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,708
You believe you
are serving life, brother.

618
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,875
But the truth is,

619
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:27,408
...you are for the Keeper.

620
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,460
Richard.

621
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,808
You all right?

622
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,708
I'm fine.
Just a bad dream.

623
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:42,241
Well, it's over now.

624
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:55,908
What is this?

625
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:00,842
It's the Mark of the Keeper.

626
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:06,075
The mark of the one who
would destroy all life.
