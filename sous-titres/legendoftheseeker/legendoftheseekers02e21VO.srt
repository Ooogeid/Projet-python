(Cara)
I've known her for a long time.

18
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,987
You once swore to kill
the man you now serve.

19
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,622

Rahl is taking
the Stone of Tears northeast.

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,602
The Pillars of Creation
are to the south.

34
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,837
Rahl isn't taking the Stone
to the Pillars.

35
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:36,272
He has no intention of using it
to seal the veil.

36
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:39,007
Then where's
he taking it?

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

38
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:49,952
Why are we stopping?

39
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:55,121
Marianna, do you really fail to
grasp the import of the moment?

40
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:58,091
We are about to deliver
the Stone of Tears

41
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:00,059
to the Keeper.

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,497
And once he has it, the tear
in the veil can never be sealed,

43
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,699
and the World of the Living

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,202
will fall forever into darkness.

45
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:13,939
But before we proceed
into the rift,

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,843
let us offer a prayer
of gratitude to our master

47
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:21,045
for allowing us,
his humble servants,

48
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,881
a small part to play

49
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:27,017
in his glorious victory.

56
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:01,716
You betrayed the Keeper.

59
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:14,860
You have all
done very well.

60
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,094
Now, we should travel
with haste.

61
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:20,663
No doubt my intrepid brother
is already close behind.

62
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:23,065
I can stop him, My Lord.

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,834
Cara,

64
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:29,471
your loyalty and devotion
are touching.

65
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:32,672
But I'm afraid you are no match
for the Seeker.

66
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:35,174
You're forgetting
Richard's weakness.

67
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:39,278
Compassion.

68
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,616
He still cares for me.

69
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:45,653
When the moment comes, he won't
be able to finish me off.

70
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:48,922
And that's
when I'll kill him.

71
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:52,489
The Wizard's power
is useless against you,

72
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,457
but the Mother Confessor
is another story.

73
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,594
Her touch is deadly
to Mord-Sith.

74
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:01,897
We're not afraid
of the Confessor, My Lord.

75
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,701
(Cara)
The Seeker won't stop

76
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:09,503
until he recovers the Stone.

77
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:12,538
And he'll kill you
to get it.

78
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,807
Please.

79
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,108
Let us do this for you.

80
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:33,024
I am so glad you have returned
to our family, Cara.

Cara, don't do this.

86
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,553
You seem to have forgotten,
Richard.

87
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,555
Mord-Sith only take orders

88
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:11,156
from the true Lord Rahl.

00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,637
Zedd, no! She'll kill you!
Get out of here!

94
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,132
Dahlia!

95
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,167
( grunts )

96
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,010
The compass is useless.

97
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,311
Dahlia.
( whimpering )

98
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:11,713
Dahlia, you don't have long
to live.

99
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:15,982
If you're going to serve me,
you have to do it now.

100
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,083
Tell me where Rahl
is taking the Stone.

101
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,182
I'm sorry, mistress.

102
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,482
I don't know.

103
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,550
I beg of you,

104
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,485
forgive me.

105
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,326
Without the compass,
we might not find Rahl

106
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,895
or the Stone
before the solstice.

107
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,765
Maybe Cara knows
where he is.

108
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:53,268
But I'd have to confess her
to find out.

109
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,971
(Cara)
You know what you need to do,
Richard.

110
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:01,341
But we both know you don't
have the stomach for it.

111
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,516
( gasps )

112
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:15,185
She is in the grip
of an insidious magic,

113
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:18,688
as dark as any
I've felt before.

114
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,190
That's how Rahl turned her
against us.

115
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,661
Lord Rahl merely showed me
the error of my ways.

116
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,864
I was a fool
to ever follow you.

117
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,307
(Zedd)
We may have to accept the fact

118
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,943
that the Cara we know
is gone forever.

119
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,978
I don't believe that.

120
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,381
There has to be a way of undoing
whatever it was Rahl did to her.

121
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,083
There is one way,

122
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,217
but the results
are unpredictable.

123
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:55,988
It's a spell I learned years ago
in the Wizard's Keep,

124
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,723
but I've never dared use it.

125
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,357
It's called
the Spell of Undoing.

126
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,927
According
to the ancient texts,

127
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:07,164
it can erase even the most
pernicious forms of dark magic.

128
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:09,132
Do it.

129
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,301
Richard, this spell
hasn't been invoked in ages,

130
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,870
and for very good reason.

131
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:17,273
It could undo the magic
Darken Rahl inflicted on Cara,

132
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:19,641
but it could also affect her
in ways

133
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,743
I couldn't even begin
to predict.

134
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:25,512
It could even kill her.

135
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,815
And if it does,
we may lose any hope

136
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,817
of finding Rahl
and the Stone in time.

137
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,253
Cara's had everything
taken away from her.

138
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:36,321
Twice.

139
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:39,123
She would've gone to the ends
of the world for me.

140
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,458
I'm not giving up on her now.

141

Everyone's waiting.

149

What are we doing here?

151
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:17,536
I think Zedd's gotten into
the ambrosia

152
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,973
a little early.

154
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,153

In the eyes of the Creator,

161
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:06,653
you are now joined
as husband and wife.

162
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:11,490

you will be as one.

I need to speak
with the two of you.

168
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,272
Alone.

169
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,577
Zedd, you know anything
you can say to me

170
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:02,311
you can say in front
of my brother.

171
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,380
It's quite all right,
Richard.

172
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:08,250
I seem to be making
Zeddicus uncomfortable.

173
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,685
I shall attend to your guests.

175
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:19,159
Zedd, what's wrong?

176
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,193
What's wrong?

177
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,696
Five minutes ago,
we were standing in a forest

178
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,264
a thousand leagues from here,

179
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:28,500
and now suddenly
we're in the People's Palace.

180
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:29,567
And where's Cara?

181
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,802
Who's Cara?

182
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:33,704
Sharp tongue, red leather,

183
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:35,139
carries two Agiels.

184
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,607
A Mord-Sith.

185
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,909
She's been traveling with us
for nearly a year.

186
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,413
Zedd,

187
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,615
you and I have been
at the People's Palace

188
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,683
for the past year,

189
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,253
and Kahlan's been in Aydindril,
restoring the rule of law.

190
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,321
Maybe someone
spelled your memory.

191
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,491
No one spelled my memory.

192
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,160
I cast a spell on Cara.

193
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,363
But the spell seems
to have changed everything.

194
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:05,998
What changes?

195
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:07,599
Well, we weren't
at the People's Palace,

196
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,201
We were on a quest
to find the Stone of Tears.

197
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:13,905
Why would we be looking
for the Stone of Tears?

198
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,508
We need it
to repair the veil

199
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:20,009
between the Underworld
and the Land of the Living.

200
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,514
It was torn when the Boxes of
Orden were destroyed a year ago.

201
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:28,617
The Boxes.

202
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,318
They're intact.

203
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,486
I put them together
almost a year ago,

204
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,521
on that cliff
in West Granthia.

205
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,759
Then you have
the Power of Orden.

206
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:44,496
That's why Rahl
is no threat to you.

207
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:47,365
You bent him to your will.

208
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,634
Do you control everyone?

209
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:53,236
No, only those
who were a threat to me.

210
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:56,538
Rahl, the Mord-Sith,
the Third Battalion.

211
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,540
It was just
as you predicted, Zedd.

212
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,675
Orden was tempered
by my Confessor's touch.

213
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:06,746
So Richard has been able to use
his power wisely and justly.

214
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,816
And Orden, in turn,

215
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,351
tempered confession.

216
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,486
So Kahlan and I
can be together.

217
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,591
From my perspective,
none of this happened.

218
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,759
Well, maybe if you tell us
how you remember it,

219
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,094
we can figure out
what's going on.

220
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,030
I remember West Granthia.

221
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:28,898
You put the Boxes together.

222
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,234
But we were attacked
by the Mord-Sith.

223
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,237
<i>Cara led the assault.</i>

224
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,339
( Agiel whining )

225
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,007
No!

226
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:42,076
<i>But at the last moment,</i>
<i>she betrayed her sisters.</i>

227
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:51,317
No!

228
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,652
<i>Rahl grabbed</i>
<i>the Sword of Truth...</i>

229
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:59,958
<i>and used it</i>
<i>to split the Boxes apart.</i>

230
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,361
( yelling )

231
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:08,633
And Rahl and the Boxes
were destroyed.

232
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:09,901
(Richard)
Zedd,

233
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:12,366
there was no Mord-Sith
who betrayed her sisters.

234
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,135
And the Boxes obviously
didn't explode.

235
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:19,604
<i>Kahlan confessed me</i>
<i>the moment I assembled them.</i>

236
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,314
<i>Rahl did try to stop us,</i>

237
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:31,048
<i>but he was too late.</i>

238
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,216
No!

239
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,354
Stop.

240
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,692
Drop your weapons.

241
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,129
On your knees,
all of you.

242
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,965
Yes, My Lord.

243
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:58,506
Richard,
you've done it.

244
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:06,912
Why would the absence
of one Mord-Sith

245
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,447
make such a difference?

246
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:13,284
Cara was Darken Rahl's most able
and trusted Sister of the Agiel.

247
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:16,053
Maybe without her
to lead the attack,

248
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,487
they couldn't find us in time.

249
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:20,256
That would have given you
the extra moments you needed

250
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:21,524
to acquire
the Power of Orden.

251
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:24,326
So then what happened
with this Cara?

252
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:28,496
The spell I cast
may have killed her

253
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:31,966
or erased her
from existence itself.

254
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,735
If this spell was as powerful
as it seems,

255
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,970
maybe it didn't kill her.

256
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,572
Maybe it just undid
all the Mord-Sith magic

257
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,140
that was ever inflicted
on her.

258
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:44,342
Then it wouldn't be just Rahl's
sorcery that was undone,

259
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:47,478
but the magic used
to break her as a child.

260
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,613
She never would have become
a Mord-Sith at all.

261
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,782
She wouldn't have been on
the cliff that night to attack.

262
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,884
Then if Cara's not dead
and she's not Mord-Sith,

263
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,519
then where is she?

264
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,721
Sorry to bother you,
Richard.

265
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,090
But your guests
are asking for you.

266
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:02,224
We'll be right there.

267
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:03,659
I want you to do something
for me.

268
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,194
Anything.

269
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,962
I need you to find
a young woman.

270
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,569
Her name is Cara Mason.

271
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,872
She would have been born
in the village of Stowecroft,

272
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,507
25, 26 summers ago.

273
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,076
I will send a rider to find out
if she still lives there,

274
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,612
and if not,
where she might have gone.

275
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,317
Richard,

276
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,251
I realize with
the Power of Orden

277
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,220
you can make Rahl
do whatever you want,

278
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,522
but are you sure it wouldn't
have been more prudent

279
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:42,424
for you to kill him
as the Prophecy foretold?

280
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,026
Zedd, you know
I don't believe in Prophecy.

281
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,496
And as you can see, my brother
is more useful to me alive.

282
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,032
He's a trusted advisor
and a close friend.

283
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,667
Friend?

284
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,836
He's not the same man he was
before I used my power on him.

285
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:57,838
It's a new day in D'Hara, Zedd.

286
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,908
I want people to know their
ruler isn't vengeful or cruel,

287
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,443
that I believe everyone
can do good.

288
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:08,113
I admire your generosity,
Richard,

289
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:10,882
but the spell may have
affected history

290
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,017
in ways we haven't
discovered yet.

291
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:16,586
And there will be plenty of time
to look into that.

292
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,720
But we' at a wedding.

293
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,922
Enjoy the party.

294
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:23,692
It's time for me to dance
with my lovely wife.

295
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,566
( sighs )

296
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,101
( <i>ominous theme playing</i>

297
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:42,406
( wind gusts )

298
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,116
(Keeper) <i>Sister Marianna.</i>
( gasps )

299
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,651
<i>Kneel before the Keeper.</i>

300
00:18:56,554 --> 00:19:00,255
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>for you to serve me.</i>

301
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:03,391
I've been waiting for this
moment all my life, master.

302
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,494
<i>Something has happened</i>
<i>beyond your reckoning.</i>

303
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,596
<i>The world has changed.</i>

304
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,135
<i>Victory has been</i>
<i>stolen from my grasp.</i>

305
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,405
I don't understand, master.

306
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,173
What victory do you speak of?

307
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:16,942
<i>The veil was torn.</i>

308
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:20,979
<i>My minions were waging war</i>
<i>on the Land of the Living.</i>

309
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,981
<i>But somehow the First Wizard</i>

310
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:26,217
<i>has restored harmony</i>
<i>between death and life.</i>

311
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:29,153
<i>You must upset</i>
<i>the balance once again.</i>

312
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:32,356
Tell me what I must do.

313
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,024
<i>Leave the Palace</i>
<i>of the Prophets at once</i>

314
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:36,292
<i>and find the sister</i>
<i>of the Seeker,</i>

315
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:40,093
<i>the pristinely ungifted one,</i>
<i>Jennsen Rahl.</i>

316
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,896
will find her, Keeper,
but how will this serve you?

317
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,363
<i>Her blood is the key.</i>

318
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:48,864
<i>It will allow you to do</i>
<i>what must be done</i>

319
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,798
<i>in order to tear the veil again</i>

320
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,837
<i>and ensure my victory</i>
<i>over life.</i>

321
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:02,248
( <i>tender theme playing</i> )

322
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,577
Good morning,
Your Highness.

323
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,845
( chuckles )

324
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't think I'm ever going
to get used to that.

325
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,848
You should try "Lord Rahl".

326
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,683
Mm.

327
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,489
I can think of something
more appropriate.

328
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:31,725
How about "dad"?

329
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:32,926
What?

330
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,197
It's only been three days.
How could you know?

331
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:40,933
A Confessor knows.

332
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:42,200
( exhales heavily )

333
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,677
I didn't think it was possible
to be this happy.

334
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,416
( knocking on door )

335
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,953
Zedd.
Zedd.

336
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:08,355
Perfect timing, as usual.

337
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,434
Jennsen.

338
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:25,937
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just got word.

339
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:28,005
My friend Sean.

340
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:29,807
He passed away.

341
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:32,009
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jennsen.

342
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,912
Sean's last wish was that
I take care of his daughter.

343
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:38,714
I'd like to bring Eryn here
to live with us at the Palace.

344
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,417
Of course. I'll go with you.
We'll bring her back together.

345
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:44,853
Richard, you just got married.

346
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,118
And you have an empire
to take care of.

347
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,820
I'll be fine.

348
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:51,421
I'll send Commander Trimack
with you.

349
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:59,395
I've inspected
the palace defenses

350
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:00,863
and found them
woefully inadequate.

351
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,231
With your permission,

352
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,966
I'd like to strengthen
the magical barriers

353
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,000
around the perimeter.

354
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:07,202
Zedd, I have the Power of Orden.

355
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,003
I don't think anyone's
planning to attack us.

356
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:10,638
For all we know,
there are people out there

357
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,973
who still mean you harm.

358
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:13,408
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

359
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,910
go ahead,
fortify the barriers.

360
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,848
I realize this may seem
like a waste of time

361
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,182
to someone with your power,

362
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:24,218
but there's an ache
in my bones, my boy.

363
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,854
Something is wrong here.

364
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:29,456
The world is not supposed
to be like this.

365
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:33,827
Zedd, the world
you told us about,

366
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:36,228
with the rifts
opening everywhere

367
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,796
and the Keeper
on the verge of winning?

368
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:41,266
Maybe that's the world that
should never have been.

369
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,834
Life's good now.

370
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:45,471
Maybe when you cast that spell,

371
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:48,143
you put things back the way
they're supposed to be.

372
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:51,245
( footsteps approaching )

373
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,247
Richard, our rider
has returned from Stowecroft.

374
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,815
There is indeed a young woman
named Cara Mason living there.

375
00:22:57,816 --> 00:22:58,883
She's a schoolteacher

376
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,017
and a mother
of two young children.

377
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:02,685
She's also a widow.

378
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,153
She lost her husband
during the war.

379
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:08,923
Zedd, I'm sorry
about her husband,

380
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:10,324
but from what you told us

381
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:13,560
Cara was broken
not just once but twice.

382
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:17,062
It sounds like she has
a better life in this world

383
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,430
than she did in the other one.

384
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,365
( laughing )

385
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,603
Sam.

386
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,072
Play nicely with your sister
or you can go inside.

387
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,574
(Leo)
Excuse me, ma'am?

388
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,608
Hey.

389
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:39,546
You really shouldn't sneak
up on someone like that.

390
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:41,481
I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,383
My name is Leo Dane.
I'm just passing through

392
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,185
on my way home to Archer's Peak.

393
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:48,653
I was wondering
if you had some chores

394
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:49,687
that might need doing.

395
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:51,455
I'm a skilled blacksmith.

396
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:54,057
I can also do carpentry.

397
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,761
Thank you, but I can't
afford to hire any help.

398
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,629
Sam, go inside.

399
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,799
Now.

400
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,869
On my way up the path, I noticed
your horse was favoring a leg.

401
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,471
He sprung a heel.

402
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:10,572
If you don't re-shoe him,
he'll go lame.

403
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:13,874
I'd be happy to take
care of it for you.

404
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,542
You don't have to pay me.

405
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,947
Well, if you're going
to shoe the horse,

406
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,949
I suppose the least
I can do is offer you a meal.

407
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:27,018
Sounds like a fair trade.

408

Where have they taken Jennsen?

417
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,097
I'll tell you nothing.

418
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,698
You will tell Lord Rahl.

419
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,663
Tell me where
they've taken Jennsen.

420
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:25,998
To the Caves of Andros, My Lord.

421
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,233
Why?

422
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,701
What do they want with her?

423
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:32,736
Forgive me, My Lord,
I don't know.

424
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,975
(Zedd)
This is exactly
the sort of thing

425
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:42,376
I was afraid would happen.

426
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:44,813
The Keeper exists
outside time and place.

427
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:46,549
He must be aware
that the world has changed.

428
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,619
The Sisters of the Dark
could be using Jennsen somehow

429
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,887
to re-establish his dominion.

430
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:55,189
I'm going to find her.

431
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,357
(Rahl)
You're not going alone.

432
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:59,292
She's my sister as well.

433
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,526
Richard, this could be a trap.

434
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:01,994
These Sisters of the Dark

435
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,796
are subject to Orden
just like anyone else.

436
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,798
And they can't use their
magic against Mord-Sith.

437
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,867
I'll take some of them with us.

438
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,202
You'll take me too.

439
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,436
No, Zedd.

440
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,104
I need you to stay here
and look after Kahlan.

441
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,976
She's my wife now
and she's with child.

442
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:23,312
I'm depending on you.

443
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,117
I'll be back soon.

My brother will come for you.

I'm planning on it.

449
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,581
Sister, our han is the Keeper's
most sacred gift to us.

450

If we drink this serum,
we'll lose our powers forever.

Yes, but the blood
of the pristinely ungifted one

452
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:11,358
will also make us immune
to all forms of magic,

453
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,562
including the barriers
protecting the People's Palace.

454
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:19,332
Our han is a small
sacrifice to pay

455
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,867
to ensure the Keeper's victory.

456
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,870

The three of us will
infiltrate the Palace

460
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,218
and separate
the Boxes of Orden.

461
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:48,320
The rest of you will wait here
for Richard Rahl to arrive

462
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,422
and when the magic
of Orden has left him,

463
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:52,823
you will kill him.

464
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:57,260
Once we have acquired the Boxes
and the Sword of Truth,

465
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,763
we will be able to deliver
the Keeper a great victory.

And the pristinely
ungifted one?

467
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,332
What should we do with her?

468
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,068
She's of no further use to us.

00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,904

for the south entrance.

will protect us?

I know what you're planning.

529
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:31,183
This Sword is the only weapon
in all Creation powerful enough

530
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,853
to destroy the Boxes of Orden.

531
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:37,593
And if they are destroyed,
the veil will be torn,

532
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:40,695
and the Keeper will be able
to send his minions

533
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:42,563
into the World of the Living.

534
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:43,830
(Marianna)
Give us the Sword

535
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:47,333
and the Keeper will reward
you for your devotion.

536
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:52,537
I can imagine a far
greater reward.

537
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,872
The Boxes, if you please.

538
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,570
Kill him.

539
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,273
(Rahl)
Behind you.

540
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:09,644
( grunts )

541
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,082
( gasping )

542
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,180
Bring him.

543
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:22,617
You bent me to your will.

544
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:25,350
Now I shall bend you to mine.

545
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:28,483
No!
( Agiel whining )

546
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:32,122
( thunder rumbling )

547
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,379
Kneel before me.

548
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:05,148
Yes, My Lord.

549
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:07,083
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

550
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,564
Your Highness, the Third Battalion

551
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,265
is trying to take the palace.

552
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,328
It's not safe for you here.

553
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:26,362
I want you and three
of your most loyal men,

554
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:29,430
soldiers not
controlled by Orden.

555
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:32,997
We're going to find my husband.

556
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,100
( birds chirping )

557
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:38,136
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

558
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:47,375
It's worse than I imagined.

559
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,175
Rahl has the Boxes, the Sword,
and the Power of Orden.

560
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:53,644
He's controlling Richard.

561
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:54,778
We have to free him.

562
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:57,546
The only way to do that
is to kill Rahl,

563
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:59,680
but I can't blast him
with Wizard's Fire,

564
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,249
the Mord-Sith will deflect it.

565
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,050
And if Rahl so much as sees us,

566
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,853
he'll bend us to his will just
as surely as he did Richard.

567
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,891
Oh, Zedd.
We have to do something.

568
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:13,997
There is one thing I can try,

569
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:17,133
but you're not going to like it.

570
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,802
I can try to reverse
the Spell of Undoing.

571
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:21,536
Put the world back
the way it was.

572
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,006
Zedd, I know things are bad,
but...

573
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,107
do you really want
to go back to an existence

574
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,176
where the dead walk
among the living?

575
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:32,645
The Keeper is on the brink
of victory.

576
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,748
Even in this world the Keeper
is bent on destroying

577
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:36,915
the Land of the Living.

578
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,816
And he is not going to stop.

579
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,519
And with Richard
enslaved to Rahl,

580
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,921
how will we defeat the Keeper?

581
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:46,490
At least in the other world
we had Richard on our side

582
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:50,892
and with Richard we still
had a fighting chance.

583
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:53,327
And our child?

584
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,598
What kind of a life
would she have in a world

585
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,334
where her parents
are enslaved to Darken Rahl?

586
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:07,507
Kahlan,
I know this isn't easy.

587
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,843
I know how much you
want to be with Richard,

588
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:12,812
but your life
together here is over.

589
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,980
If you truly want to save him,

590
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:17,349
we have to try
to put things back.

591
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,988
Richard may not be your
husband in the other world,

592
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,757
but he still loves you dearly.

593
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,696
What do you need
to reverse the spell?

594
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:36,266
We have to find Cara

595
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:38,801
and pray that Darken Rahl
doesn't get to her first.

596
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:40,735
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

597
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:57,418
We've searched everywhere,
My Lord.

598
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:59,152
Kahlan and the First Wizard
must have fled.

599
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:00,720
No doubt they learned

600
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,589
I was taking up residence
in the palace again.

601
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,494
If the Sisters of the Dark
are to be believed,

602
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,161
then the Keeper is convinced

603
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,663
that your Wizard cast a spell
that changed the world.

604
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:15,697
What do you know of this?

605
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:18,466
Zedd cast the spell
on Cara Mason,

606
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,969
the woman I asked you
to find in Stowecroft.

607
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,872
Perhaps Zeddicus decided
the world he came from

608
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:28,174
is preferable to one in which
I rule with the magic of Orden.

609
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:33,111
He may try to undo
what was done to this Cara.

610
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:34,245
Get me a Journey Book.

611
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:35,579
Yes, My Lord.

00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,551
Orders from the People's Palace.

615
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:47,487
We're to proceed
to Stowecroft right away.

616
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:50,490
We're to find a schoolteacher.

617
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:52,558
Her name is Cara.

618
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,463
Cara Mason?
You know her?

619
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,167
A long time ago,
when we were children,

620
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:06,305
before I joined my true family.

621
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:14,547
What else does it say, mistress?

622
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:17,184
Our orders are to kill her.

( <i>soft theme playing</i> )

00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:27,089
I've fixed the hole
in the roof,

painted the window trim,
swept the chimney,

626

and, uh, chopped enough
firewood to last two winters.

Anyone ever tell you
you're a real taskmaster?

I suppose you'll
be moving on now.

I guess so.

630

Do you know where
you're going next?

631
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,641
Uh, Rivermore is a few
leagues west,

632
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:56,845
I'll look for work there.

I'm sure you'll
find someone there

who'll be grateful
for your help.

going to stay longer,

something else

It brought Cara and Leo
together again in this world.

But when you reverse the spell
and make Cara a Mord-Sith,

657
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,849
he'll be dead again?

658

anything to anyone.

I wish there was another way,
but there isn't.

And the Cara I know would give
up this life in a heartbeat

she'd be saving Richard.
