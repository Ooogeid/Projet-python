00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,603
<i>Previously on</i> Legend of the Seeker

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:06,364
He is the first true Seeker
in the last thousand years.

3
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:09,638
- He has a destiny.
- Who are you to decide a man's destiny?

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:13,350
- It's not me. It's the Prophecy.
- Prophecy be damned.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,366
So, it doesn't matter Darken Rahl
is growing more powerful everyday?

6
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:19,786
That people in the Midlands are losing
their freedom, dying by the thousands?

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,950
Stop. What are you talking about?

8
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:26,562
- And what's a Seeker?
- A Seeker is a hero who arises

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,074
in a time of trouble and suffering.

10
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,116
This is the Sword of Truth.

11
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:33,827
In anyone else's hands,
this is just a piece of steel.

12
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:35,565
But in a Seeker's hands,

13
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,848
bestows the power to fight evil.

14
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:40,376
And with it,
you will kill Darken Rahl.

15
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:47,778
Let it be known
throughout the three territories,

16
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:50,645
that whoever brings me the Seeker

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,703
will be rewarded beyond imagining.

18
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:10,903
Any sign of him?

19
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,700
Only a burned-out campfire.

20
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,265
Did you follow the tracks
leading away from it?

21
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,622
- No, they were too well-covered.
- So you found nothing, then?

22
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,029
Just this worthless trinket,

23
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:23,075
caught in some underbrush.

24
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:24,854
So much for the bounty.

25
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:41,653
It's his.

26
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,898
Sync: Kasius

27
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,009
There he is!

28
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:50,614
Grab him!

29
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,826
You think you can steal food
from Lord Rahl's army?

30
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,495
- I didn't steal anything.
- Liar.

31
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,539
My men found the food in your barn.

32
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,585
We were starving.

33
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:07,129
Then where's the rest
of your band of thieves?

34
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,544
I'm the only one.
There's no one else.

35
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,739
How can I help you today, sir?

36
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:35,522
I need a map.

37
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,042
A map?

38
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,438
I've got many maps.

39
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,915
How about a map
to the Ruins of Kelabra?

40
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,959
How about the Twin Barrier Peaks?

41
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:49,565
Falls of the White Plume?
It's very popular.

42
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:52,879
I need a map to track someone.

43
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,033
A map to track someone?

44
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,642
I'm not sure a map like that
actually exists.

45
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:04,608
Course if it did,

46
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,322
it'd be very costly.

47
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:19,206
I'd need something that belonged
to the person you wanted to track.

48
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,338
Who'd you say
that pendant belonged to again?

49
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,341
- He's getting away.
- Whose fault is that?

50
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,694
- "Wait for my signal. Flush him out."
- I waited. He didn't.

51
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,848
Did I get it?

52
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,949
So much for dinner.

53
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,766
Wizard of the First Order.

54
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,355
Really?

55
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:58,926
I was hungry.
It was getting away.

56
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,215
You torched the only game
we've seen in two days.

57
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:05,432
Food used to be plentiful around here.{\in these parts.}
But the D'Harans have been over-hunting{\ to feed their armies}.

58
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,077
Too bad that elk
got away from us yesterday.

59
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:11,188
Don't remind me, Zedd. I lost
my father's pendant chasing after it.

60
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,982
I'm sorry.
I know it meant a lot to you.

61
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,564
Wait. Kahlan, no!

62
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:30,165
- Hold still. I'll burn the ropes.
- And end up like that rabbit?

63
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:34,879
Hurry, Zedd.

64
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,714
- Do it now.
- Don't move.

65
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,808
The Sword.

66
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,081
I didn't agree to fight a Wizard.

67
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:16,073
Cowards!

68
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:33,617
I almost had him.

69
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,147
Well, at least you got his money.

70
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:40,453
He'll be paying for dinner.

71
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:46,575
What's that?

72
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,079
It's a map.

73
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,200
It's moving.

74
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,168
It appears to have stopped.

75
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,740
What's that light?

76
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,220
I think it's you.

77
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,990
A map that knows where I am?

78
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,815
Cartogromancy is

79
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:22,070
a rare and powerful magic.

80
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:25,238
Few know of its existence,
much less its practice.

81
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,382
- Could Darken Rahl have made it?
- If Rahl had a way of tracking you,

82
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:32,704
he would have sent the entire
D'Haran army. You'd be dead already.

83
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,534
- That's comforting.
- Luckily, the map is in our hands now.

84
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:38,543
Well, it could be useful.

85
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:40,766
If we got split up,
you'd know where to find me.

86
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,262
Like those highwaymen did.

87
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:44,856
Why would they have such a thing?
Where would they get it?

88
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:46,544
They weren't highwaymen.

89
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,220
They were bounty hunters.

90
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,962
"A thousand gold pieces for the Seeker."

91
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,783
If Rahl's offering that kind of money,

92
00:07:57,903 --> 00:08:00,541
bounty hunters won't be
the only ones looking for you.

93
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,431
I'm telling you, it's him.

94
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,111
You're right.

95
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,281
Let's go.

96
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,932
It's him. The Seeker. He's mine.

97
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,661
We don't want any trouble.

98
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:20,574
Trouble it is.

99
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,358
Run! Now!

100
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,154
Thank you for your help.

101
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,954
Good to know not everyone
in this town is against us.

102
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,931
Are you really the Seeker?

103
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:49,854
Then I need your help.

104
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,994
My little brother Liam and I
were attacked by a Shadrin.

105
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,329
- It took him.
- A Shadrin?

106
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,731
One of the most feared creatures
in the Midlands.

107
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,373
Few who have seen it
have lived to describe it.

108
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:05,088
It happened so fast.
All I saw were claws and teeth.

109
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,608
I thought the Shadrin was a myth.

110
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,879
Did a myth do this to me?

111
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:13,828
I couldn't fight it off.
I wasn't strong enough.

112
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:16,901
And none of those cowards in the tavern
would help me.

113
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,810
The Shadrin hunt during the day.

114
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,813
They keep their prey alive
until nightfall,

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,665
then they feed.

116
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,014
Then there's still time.

117
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,936
Please, you have to help him.
He's just a boy.

118
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:33,034
- Where did this thing attack you?
- I can take you there.

119
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,830
What about the people trying
to collect the bounty on your head?

120
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:42,566
You mean the ones trying to capture me
when she stepped in?

121
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:45,045
We can take care of ourselves.
Lilly's brother can't.

122
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:56,264
You got my message.

123
00:09:56,506 --> 00:10:00,056
What makes you think I'd be
so interested in one of your maps?

124
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,235
Because this one

125
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,524
will lead you to the Seeker.

126
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:09,085
You can be the one to claim the bounty.

127
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,053
It'll cost you.

128
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,315
Great, I can buy a new quill.

129
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,242
There you go. Careful.

130
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,258
That's one of a kind.

131
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,042
This is where it attacked us.

132
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,794
Liam had skinned his knee.
He was crying

133
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:52,862
- when it just came and took him.
- The Shadrin are nearly blind.

134
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:55,741
They hunt by sound.
It must have been drawn by the cries.

135
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:59,007
Let's see if we can pick up its trail
and follow it back to the nest.

136
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,998
In the stories I've heard,
the Shadrin build their nests in caves.

137
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,502
There are some caves up ahead.

138
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:09,046
- Don't have much time before sundown.
- You're right. We better hurry.

139
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,186
My cart threw a wheel. I could use
some help getting it back on.

140
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:30,067
Sorry. But we have to help a boy who's
in danger. We'll come back if we can.

141
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,201
- Zedd, get her out of here!
- Richard!

142
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,046
Another one.

143
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,060
Where did you get this?

144
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,214
You'd better answer the Confessor.

145
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,140
Sebastian,

146
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,797
- the mapmaker in South Caston.
- If he's selling these maps,

147
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,608
it's only a matter of time
before we're ambushed by{\ more of} his customers.

148
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:09,778
You can't risk helping me.
You need to keep moving.

149
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,962
- The Seeker is too important.
- We're going to find your brother.

150
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,101
You go after Lilly's brother.

151
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,449
And I'll find this mapmaker.

152
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,054
This will take me to the Seeker?

153
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,714
It's a one-of-a-kind item.

154
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:29,384
As my best customer,
I wanted to give you first chance at it.

155
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:35,961
Happy hunting.

156
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:42,824
Back so soon?

157
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:44,797
I need another map.

158
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,538
- I can't.
- Why not?

159
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:50,249
I'm out of ink.

160
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:52,865
But if you have something else

161
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:56,130
that belonged to the Seeker,
we can make it work.

162
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,215
You had plenty of ink when I left here.

163
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,387
You made more maps,
didn't you, you weasel?

164
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,159
Who'd you sell them to?

165
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,641
I just sold the last one.

166
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,394
To the man who just left.
He has markings on his face.

167
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,313
If you leave now, you can catch him.

168
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,630
Richard, look at this.

169
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,644
We're not far from the map's border.

170
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:31,941
If we move beyond it, anyone who has
one of these won't be able to track you.

171
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:35,211
We could double back to the north
and cross the river.

172
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:38,421
What about Lilly?
The Shadrin's in the other direction.

173
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,883
You have a bigger destiny
than helping one boy.

174
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,600
Especially one
that might already be dead.

175
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:50,501
It's only a matter of time

176
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:53,971
before someone finds you
and turns you in for the bounty.

177
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,357
How are we to hunt Darken
if we're being hunted ourselves?

178
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,652
And running away is going to help?

179
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,405
- You'll be alive.
- By sacrificing Lilly's brother.

180
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,117
We've all made sacrifices.

181
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,663
I lost my sister trying to find you.
I don't regret that decision.

182
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,905
I've sworn to protect you with my life.

183
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,295
Even from yourself.

184
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:21,237
The caves are just up ahead.

185
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,017
Is something wrong?

186
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,055
No, we're coming.

187
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:45,383
It hunts by sound.

188
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:54,907
Lilly.

189
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:57,802
Liam!

190
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:05,995
We're closed.

191
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,679
Not yet you're not.

192
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,768
I've hear you're selling maps
to track the Seeker.

193
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,787
I don't know what you're talking about.

194
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:21,907
But...

195
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,526
maybe I can interest you

196
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:25,779
in a map of the Ruins of Kelabra?

197
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,539
I don't really know
where you got that,

198
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:36,790
old man.

199
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,051
You're going to tell me
how you made this,

200
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,963
how many you made,
and who you sold them to.

201
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:54,232
A bounty hunter. He had a pendant.
He said it belonged to the Seeker.

202
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:57,101
- I used it to make the map.
- How many did you make?

203
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,232
One.

204
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,133
Three. I just sold the last one.

205
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:11,301
And did you sell any to the D'Harans?

206
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,375
Course not.

207
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,796
They don't buy maps.

208
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,620
They take 'em.

209
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,961
I loathe the D'Harans.

210
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,741
And yet you would help them
by aiding those

211
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,883
who would capture the Seeker
for Darken Rahl?

212
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:32,261
Where was the Seeker
when we were suffering under Lord Rahl?

213
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,990
You know,
I used to be in the service of kings?

214
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,960
Then the D'Harans moved in.

215
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:39,185
I gotta provide for my family.

216
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:43,025
To do that, I make maps.

217
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,895
Well, now you're gonna make one for me.

218
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,237
I need to find the bounty hunter
who bought the last map.

219
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,073
I can't do it.

220
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,740
Gotta have something
that belonged to him.

221
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,911
- Something he valued greatly.
- He paid you, didn't he?

222
00:17:57,902 --> 00:18:00,957
What could be more valuable
to a bounty hunter than his money?

223
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,623
- I left her back in the cave.
- You trapped her with that beast?

224
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,911
Please.
Everyone knows the Shadrin's a myth.

225
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:46,077
This ought to lead you
to the bounty hunter.

226
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,397
If you leave now, you can catch him.

227
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,807
I'll be leaving.

228
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:55,815
But if you make any more maps
that track the Seeker,

229
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,311
I'll be back.

230
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,995
Why are you doing this?
I was trying to help you.

231
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,963
That's right,
because you're the Seeker?

232
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,213
I don't believe that fairy tale.

233
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,783
But if the D'Harans do,
and they're willing to pay,

234
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,363
all the better for me.

235
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:37,877
{\Honestly, }I don't see what they're so afraid of.

236
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,530
- They're afraid of the Prophecy.
- Right.

237
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,884
You're gonna defeat Darken Rahl
and save everyone in the Midlands.

238
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:48,512
- {\Right now, y}You're the only thing stopping me.
- And look how hard that was.

239
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:51,057
The D'Harans don't need to send an army.

240
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:54,069
All it takes is a few tears
and an ample bosom.

241
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:09,806
Hand over the map

242
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,076
and I'll let you live.

243
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:15,563
How about this? You walk away

244
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:17,918
and I won't kill you.

245
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,306
You can keep your half.

246
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:55,114
Damn.

247
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:59,582
You didn't think the Seeker
was gonna stay in one place, did you?

248
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,183
This is your lucky day.

249
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:39,700
You see him?

250
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:41,482
That's the Seeker.

251
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,148
And you get to be the hero
who goes back to your captain

252
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,318
and tells him that I've got him.

253
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,024
If he wants the Seeker,
he can meet me at Demon Rock.

254
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:51,494
But tell him I don't want the bounty.

255
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,758
I want something else.

256
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:10,487
So tell me, what's worth more to you
than the bounty on the Seeker?

257
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:11,891
My brother.

258
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,615
So I guess the Shadrin didn't take him.

259
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,898
No, worse.
He was arrested by the D'Harans.

260
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:21,568
They were gonna execute him
for stealing.

261
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,053
- Did he do it?
- No. I did.

262
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,369
He just confessed to protect me.

263
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,466
- So you're a thief.
- What choice do I have?

264
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,561
The only food around here is
what you can poach from the D'Harans.

265
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:36,096
It's either steal or starve,
and I am not gonna starve.

266
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:41,274
My brother is all I have left.
I will not let the D'Harans kill him.

267
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:44,711
Don't you see?
I'm on your side.

268
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,816
If you had told me the truth,
I would have helped your brother.

269
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:50,195
Maybe when you thought
he was an innocent boy.

270
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:53,281
With everyone trying to collect
a bounty on you, if I had asked you

271
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:56,096
to ride into a D'Haran garrison
to help a thief,

272
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,494
would you have said yes?

273
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:16,553
I thought you might want some food.

274
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,970
I know you're hungry.

275
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,553
I'm sorry I hit you before.

276
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,133
I just had to put on a good show
in front of my men.

277
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:39,779
It's okay. Take it.

278
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:41,818
No one will know.

279
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:50,204
Thank you.

280
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:57,993
Fool.

281
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,671
We hang thieves.

282
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:02,891
We don't fatten them up.

283
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,891
Unshackle me.

284
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,622
We can go back for Kahlan,
and then we can all rescue your brother.

285
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:30,586
What guarantee do I have you won't
take off the second I unshackle you?

286
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:35,040
I give you my word as the Seeker.

287
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:38,094
That would mean something
if I believed in the Seeker.

288
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:10,584
- The Seeker is mine.
- Don't be a fool.

289
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,420
There's no guarantee he's gonna stay
on one half of the map.

290
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,336
- What are you suggesting?
- We work together.

291
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,301
We've already split the map.
Let's split the bounty.

292
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,415
Two against one

293
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:23,571
is better odds.

294
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:27,768
You agreed to that a little too quickly.
How do I know

295
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,844
- you're not trying to trick me?
- You suggested it a little too quickly.

296
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:33,162
How do I know
you're not trying to trick me?

297
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:34,372
All right.

298
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:37,152
The longer we argue,
the more time the Seeker has to escape.

299
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,589
We're just gonna have
to trust each other.

300
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,635
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine. How about you?

301
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,309
Next time,
when I tell you we can't help someone,

302
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,687
don't trust them. Trust me.

303
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,427
- She was very convincing.
- Yes, she was.

304
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:44,239
I'm so sorry I got you into all this.

305
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,566
Apology accepted.

306
00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:01,774
Move.

307
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,386
On the ground, Confessor.

308
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:10,764
{\You think w}We could get something for her too?

309
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,459
Once we collect on the Seeker,
there'll be plenty for both of us.

310
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,008
Until he double-crosses you.

311
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:20,775
Who are you?

312
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:23,463
Someone who knows this man
a lot better than you do.

313
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,822
- I've never seen this woman before.
- We can share the bounty.

314
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,931
And whatever else
you might be interested in.

315
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,595
Don't listen to her.

316
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:37,524
What kind of deal are we talking about?

317
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,334
I knew you'd stab me in the back.

318
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,308
I won't be so gentle.

319
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,759
Where do you think you're going?

320
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,317
That takes care of all three maps.

321
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,713
Even so,
there's still a bounty on your head.

322
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,553
- We should get going.
- What are we gonna do about her?

323
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,323
You may as well kill me.

324
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,786
If I don't deliver the Seeker
to the D'Harans,

325
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:18,856
my brother's as good as dead.

326
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,085
What are you doing?

327
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:27,444
Keeping my promise.
I'm going to save her brother.

328
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:32,679
Have you learned nothing?
She tried to feed me to a Shadrin.

329
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:36,475
- She thought it was a myth.
- She tried to sell you to the D'Harans.

330
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:40,148
- She was trying to save her brother.
- And you believe her?

331
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,230
Everything out of her mouth
has been a lie.

332
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,604
- Tell me you don't trust this woman.
- No.

333
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:50,073
But I do trust Richard.

334
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:54,493
And the people must know that the Seeker
will stand and fight for them.

335
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:58,513
- What has she done to deserve our help?
- How do we decide who deserves it{\our help}?

336
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,712
It should be enough that she needs it.

337
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,986
Don't be naive.

338
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:04,538
- This isn't Westland.
- Exactly.

339
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,694
Darken Rahl has forced
people of the Midlands

340
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,383
to do anything to just survive.

341
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:11,094
Including serving you
up to the D'Harans.

342
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:13,661
People like her

343
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:17,942
- are only looking out for themselves.
- If the Seeker's just out for himself,

344
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,851
what chance do they have?

345
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:26,535
I know where the Seeker is.

346
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:29,237
- Why haven't you brought him to me?
- He's been captured.

347
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,607
- By whom?
- A woman has him.

348
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:35,575
- A woman?
- Yes. But she doesn't want the bounty.

349
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:39,330
What does she want?

350
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:51,591
Two patrols along the perimeter.
Four sentries at the main gate.

351
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:55,361
- A few dozen D'Harans inside.
- I think this can work.

352
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,828
It's a smart plan, Richard.
But it all depends on trusting Lilly.

353
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:04,816
If she's lying to us,
you'll be captured and killed,

354
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,689
and Darken Rahl will win.

355
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,078
- What is it you want?
- You're holding a prisoner named Liam.

356
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:26,126
You release him,
you can have the Seeker.

357
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,629
- Where is the Seeker?
- This map will take you there.

358
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,425
If you hurry, you can get the Confessor
and the Wizard as well.

359
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:35,585
But if you want it,
I want to see my brother.

360
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:38,597
Very well.

361
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,124
Take her to her brother.

362
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,111
We had an agreement!

363
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,797
We had an agreement!

364
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,661
You bastards!

365
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:17,685
- What have they done to you?
- I'm all right.

366
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,370
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get you out.

367
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:24,252
All I wanted was you to be safe.

368
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,270
I couldn't just stand by
and let them execute you.

369
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:29,020
So now what?

370
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:31,568
We both die.

371
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,362
Not today.

372
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:43,123
I want every available man ready.

373
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:46,464
- We're going after the Seeker.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,061
The Seeker's up ahead.

375
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,213
It's this way.

376
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:48,054
Come on. Let's go.

377
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,509
Come on, men.

378
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:31,380
The Seeker's in here.

379
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:45,570
It's not the Seeker.

380
00:38:50,102 --> 00:38:51,544
We've been tricked.

381
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,805
Guess the D'Harans believed
you gave them the right map.

382
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:20,657
It wasn't that hard convincing them.
I'm a devious, conniving woman.

383
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,117
I want to thank you
for saving my brother.

384
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:32,042
- Despite the fact that I lied to you.
- And tried to sell me to the D'Harans

385
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:35,042
- and kill my friends.
- Those are just what you know.

386
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,658
You did all this just to help us.

387
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:40,673
He's the Seeker.

388
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,847
Richard, we should get moving.

389
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:47,095
Well, if you ever come back this way,
maybe we'll see each other again.

390
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:48,951
You'd better hope not.

391
00:40:00,213 --> 00:40:03,445
The D'Harans have no intention
of paying the bounty on the Seeker.

392
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:07,735
Anyone who tries to collect will find
themselves inside a D'Haran prison cell.

393
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,582
Besides, the Seeker's on our side.

394
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:14,557
He's fighting for us.
The least we can do is help him out.

395
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,823
- How did you do that?
- It's called additive magic.

396
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:52,202
Try to hold on to it this time.

397
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:59,001
It's the only thing
I have of my father's.

398
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:02,235
I'm not letting it
out of my sight again.

399
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:12,264
I just want you to know that I really
appreciate you looking out for me.

400
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,474
Well, if you'd listened to me,

401
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,826
that boy would have been executed.

402
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:23,227
You saved him.

403
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:30,076
After living under Rahl for so long,
people have forgotten what a hero is.

404
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,258
But you stood up and fought for them.

405
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,676
Word will spread.

406
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:41,626
The people will know
that the Seeker has returned.

407
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:47,514
We should get going soon.

408
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,519
Come on. What's the hurry?

409
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,938
If you're gonna rescue every damsel
in distress, there's no time to waste.
