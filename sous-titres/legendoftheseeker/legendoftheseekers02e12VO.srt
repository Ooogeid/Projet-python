4
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:55,726
Good morning to you, sir.

5
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:58,332
What may I interest you
in today?

6
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,173
How about a rare map

7
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,810
of the Thelusian Plains? Hm?

8
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,517
Or perhaps an elixir

9
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:09,457
known to restore stoutness

10
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,059
to the aging gentleman?

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,832
I'm not buying.

12
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:18,975
I'm selling.
Hm.

13
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:22,315
These items are from my family's
personal collection.

14
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,886
Then I'm sure they have
sentimental value to you, sir,

15
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:28,860
but they are
of no interest to me.

16
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,029
Uh, forgive me.

17
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,965
I should have introduced myself.

18
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,872
Thaddicus Zorander, son of
the great Carracticus Zorander

19
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:38,009
and brother of the only living
Wizard of the First Order

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,982
in all the Midlands,
Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.

21
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,334
After you.

22
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:00,245
A wizard demonstrates
the full majesty of his powers,

23
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,650
and those dearest to him can't
even manage an "ooh" or an "ah?"

24
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:06,220
Thanks for moving
the tree, Zedd.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,430
Please, wait!

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,341
Are you the Seeker?

27
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,544
Yes.
Thank the Spirits.

28
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,114
The constable in Dewith told me
you were headed this way.

29
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,551
It's all right. Catch your
breath. Come on, sit down.

30
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:29,586
What happened?

31
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:30,954
Two days ago,

32
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,957
men kidnapped my husband.

33
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,627
They took other people
from our village too.

34
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:36,628
Who were these men?

35
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,963
I don't know.

36
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:39,899
We were in the field,
bringing in the harvest.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,668
They came with swords and clubs

38
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,170
and grabbed as many
as they could

39
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,239
and rode off with them
in a wagon.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,243
Maybe you haven't heard,
but the Seeker is on a quest.

41
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,880
Perhaps this constable
of yours can help you.

42
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,250
Cara.
The constable can't help us.

43
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,719
He's got his hands full fighting
the banelings.

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,254
Banelings?

45
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:00,624
There seem to more of them
in our valley every day.

46
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,361
Could banelings have abducted
these people for some reason?

47
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,731
Banelings don't kidnap people,
they kill them.

48
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:09,402
Yes, but they have to do it
every single day to stay alive.

49
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,903
Maybe they're stocking up
on victims.

50
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:13,507
If you take us to where
your husband was grabbed,

51
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,909
we can pick up the trail
of the wagon.

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,910
That will take days.

53
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,779
We'll get back to looking
for the Stone of Tears.

54
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,016
Right now,
this woman needs our help.

55
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:28,155
Worthless.

56
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,430
Rancid.

57
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,004
"Shadow Water."

58
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,712
Shadow Water.

59
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:53,786
Shadow Water.

60
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:56,222
Hm. No.

61
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,324
Well, the contents
are worthless,

62
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,326
but the bottle
has a certain appeal.

63
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,095
I can always use a little cruet
for my potions.

64
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:04,097
I can give you, say,
10 farthings.

65
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:05,299
If it was worthless,

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,803
you wouldn't offer me
even 10 farthings.

67
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,307
And my father wouldn't have
saved so much of it.

68
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,042
There's hardly two spoonfuls.
Do you think I'm a fool?

69
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:16,210
I had a feeling this
was the cream of the crop,

70
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,877
so I only brought a sample.

71
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,344
There's more?

72
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,512
My father saved 50 jars.

73
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,646
Where are they?

74
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,981
First tell me why
it's so valuable.

75
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,486
If I tell you, you might decide
you don't need me anymore.

76
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,154
How much will you pay?

77
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,655
One gold piece per jar.

78
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:34,889
Then you think you
can charge

79
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,357
your customers
considerably more.

80
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,525
All right.

81
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:40,259
Two gold pieces a jar.

82
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,729
I have a better idea.

83
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,897
We'll be partners.

84
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,002
Are those the men?

85
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:52,102
Yes.

86
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,337
But there's no one in the wagon.

87
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:54,939
Where's my husband?

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,542
Stay here while we find out.

89
00:04:58,543 --> 00:04:59,910
Stop right there!

90
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,078
What happened to the people
who were in this wagon?

91
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:04,879
Get rid of them.

92
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,644
Cara, the driver!

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,226
Kahlan!

94
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,128
I'm all right.

95
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,963
Tell me what you did
with the captives.

96
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,131
All right!

97
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:45,767
We handed them over
to another driver.

98
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,535
He's taking them to a farmhouse

99
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,704
on the old forest road
in Gurdoone.

100
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:53,673
But they'll be dead long
before anyone finds them.

101
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:25,564
Rahl!

102
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:34,470
Darken Rahl!

103
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,371
Cara.

104
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,607
How delightful.

105
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,342
I knew it was only a matter
of time

106
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:45,544
before your misguided loyalty
to the Seeker got you killed.

107
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,045
I want the deal.

108
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:49,914
I beg your pardon?

109
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,215
You heard me.

110
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:55,152
I'm willing to kill for you.

111
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:58,655
Make me a baneling.

112
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,669
So...

113
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,271
you want to be a baneling.

114
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:14,307
Send me back,
and I'll serve the Keeper.

115
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:18,743
And miss out on the pleasure

116
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,945
of tormenting you
for an eternity?

117
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:24,347
I'm only one soul.

118
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,383
Think of all the others
I could provide for you.

119
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:32,853
Yes, you always
had a nose for blood, Cara.

120
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:35,355
But perhaps you're forgetting
the fact that you betrayed me,

121
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:38,024
that you helped
the Seeker to kill me.

122
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,726
And now you want me to trust you

123
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,995
to uphold your end of a bargain?

124
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:46,898
If I don't honor the agreement,

125
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,169
you can call me back here

126
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,238
to face the Keeper's wrath.

127
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,172
True.

128
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,343
But if I give you a second life,

129
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:02,814
you will just go back
to helping Richard.

130
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:07,319
He and I aren't exactly
on friendly terms.

131
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,257
You know I kill people
to protect Richard.

132
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:14,293
Many.

133
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:17,164
What does it matter why I do it,

134
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,466
as long as I do it?

135
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:22,099
Yes, the Seeker
and his merry band

136
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,967
are some of the Keeper's
finest suppliers of souls.

137
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:27,804
But you delude yourself

138
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:32,041
into believing you're killing
to defeat evil.

139
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:35,945
My banelings have
to kill every day.

140
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:39,648
What happens when you run out
of bad people?

141
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,883
I don't think the Seeker
would appreciate

142
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:43,351
you killing the good ones.

143
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,819
That will be my problem.

144
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,321
It certainly will.

145
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,125
Do you understand the rules?

146
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,894
If I keep killing, I stay alive.

147
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,728
Only living people.
No banelings.

148
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,098
Their souls already belong
to the Keeper.

149
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,566
And you can't get ahead.

150
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,435
Ahead?
I'm sure it's occurred to you

151
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:06,835
that you could kill six or seven

152
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:10,005
irredeemable miscreants

153
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:13,275
and stay healthy
for a week at a time.

154
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,410
But it doesn't work that way.

155
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:17,878
Every time you kill,

156
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,115
the clock begins to tick again.

157
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,316
And don't think
because you're Mord-Sith

158
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,218
you will have
a special advantage.

159
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,286
As a baneling,

160
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,423
you will no longer
have the Breath of Life.

161
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,025
You won't be able
to kill someone,

162
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,693
only to revive them.

163
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:36,796
I understand.

164
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,364
Now send me back.

165
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,371
Patience

166
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:49,676
never was one of your
strong suits, Cara.

167
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,914
Do we have a deal

168
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,982
or not?

169
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:08,724
You couldn't
at least stay alive long enough

170
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,125
for me to come back
and kill you.

171
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:20,632
Why do you have to burn them?

172
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,933
If we destroy their bodies,

173
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:23,167
they can't become banelings.

174
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,836
Cara, are you all right?

175
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,070
I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

176
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,105
Your neck.

177
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,342
It's the driver's blood.

178
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,743
I had to kill him.

179
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:43,112
But not before he told me where
the kidnapped people were taken.

180
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:45,847
A farmhouse near Gurdoone.

181
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:46,948
Did he say why?

182
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,750
No.

183
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,152
Just that they
wouldn't survive long.

184
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:59,558
<i>My banelings have</i>
<i>to kill every day.</i>

185
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:04,128
What about him?

186
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,364
I confessed him.

187
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,599
He was only paid
to help round up the captives.

188
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,467
And they were loaded
into another wagon.

189
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,435
He didn't know where they
were going, or why.

190
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:15,271
Then he's of no use to us.

191
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,039
I'll kill him.

192
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,874
Cara, we're not going
to execute him.

193
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,510
The driver said we wouldn't find
the captives alive.

194
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,878
If that's true,

195
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,846
he helped kill them.

196
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,281
He deserves to die for that.

197
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,319
Go home. Find honest work.

198
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,586
And never take up arms again

199
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,121
unless it's to protect
an innocent life.

200
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,991
Yes, mistress.

201
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:46,563
Now let's find out
what's happening in Gurdoone.

202
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,671
Who's next?

203
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,605
I am. Please, hurry.

204
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,706
I don't have much time before
the Keeper calls me back.

205
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,541
You should have come
to me sooner.

206
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,110
It took all day
to get the money.

207
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:46,179
She's weak.

208
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,680
Get her a small one.

209
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,052
No.

210
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:57,288
No! Please!

211
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,455
No!

212
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:59,456
Please don't!

213
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,795
May the Creator forgive me.

214
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,434
No! Please don't!

215
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:35,050
<i>Only living people, Cara.</i>
<i>No banelings.</i>

216
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,152
<i>Their souls already belong</i>
<i>to the Keeper.</i>

217
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,123
Richard, behind you!

218
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,577
Quickly.

219
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,847
Let's get these people out
of here.

220
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,249
Thank you.

221
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,285
Come on.

222
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:21,522
What were all
you banelings doing here?

223
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,258
Buying people to kill.

224
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:26,828
She'll be a rotting corpse soon.

225
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,630
Take her away,
so these people

226
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:30,232
don't have to see any more
death.

227
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:38,272
Gavin!

228
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,045
Bless you, Seeker.

229
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:59,256
How long do you think
you can fool your friends?

230
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,593
I tried to hide it too.

231
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:05,295
But you can't stop
the skin from rotting.

232
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:06,963
Or ignore the hunger.

233
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:08,697
Quiet.
Or what?

234
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,833
You'll kill me?

235
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:14,502
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

236
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:17,037
After all, you're one of us.

237
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:19,272
I'm nothing like you.

238
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:21,941
I took the Keeper's bargain

239
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,176
because there was no one else

240
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:26,045
to care for my sick daughter.

241
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:27,414
Why did you do it?

242
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:29,983
Everybody has a reason.

243
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,885
And when you have to kill,

244
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:35,488
it's good to remind yourself
why you're doing it.

245
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,123
Tell me.

246
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:42,792
I did it to stay alive
to protect the Seeker.

247
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,829
There might be a way you
don't have to keep killing.

248
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,701
What way?

249
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:57,770
Only ten gold pieces buys you
a soul-saving sip

250
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,506
of the remarkable remedy,
the complete cure,

251
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,708
the magical
malady-destroying mouthful

252
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,210
which will ever-after eradicate

253
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,778
the appalling affliction

254
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,813
which perennially plagues you,

255
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:12,182
you, you and you.

256
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,199
Get out of the way!

257
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,201
Give me one!

258
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:40,640
We're gonna be rich,
partner.

259
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,919
There's a rumor that a magic
peddler in South Caston

260
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,854
has been selling a cure
for a few days now.

261
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,356
It's not far.

262
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:49,457
I can take her.

263
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,558
We'll all go.

264
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,826
Richard, if this magic peddler

265
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,094
is who I think it is,
we've dealt with him before.

266
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,962
He's not to be trusted.

267
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,264
Maybe we shouldn't delay
the search for the Stone,

268
00:17:58,265 --> 00:17:59,264
based on a rumor.

269
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:01,099
If this cure is real,

270
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,501
and we can get it
to the banelings,

271
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,035
they won't have to kill anymore.

272
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,137
We don't know how long it will
to take to find the Stone,

273
00:18:06,138 --> 00:18:08,972
but we would be saving a lot
of lives in the meantime.

274
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:11,742
Let's go.
It's too late for me.

275
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:14,578
I've only got
a few heartbeats left.

276
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,947
I'm glad it's over.

277
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,281
If you hadn't come along,

278
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:21,384
I never would
have stopped killing.

279
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:24,286
But an eternity
in the Underworld,

280
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,254
it's better
than living like this.

281
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:41,300
Please. Please, ju--
Just be patient.

282
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,936
Move.

283
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,204
You know what I want.

284
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,405
Yes. Of course, sir.

285
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:48,274
Right away. I'll--
I'll just be a moment.

286
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,942
We're running out
of Shadow Water.

287
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:52,743
What? No, we're not.

288
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:58,880
How did you--?

289
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,582
Simple.
Added a little plain water,

290
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,283
tripled our supply.
But--

291
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,118
We were getting
four doses a jar.

292
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,652
Now we're getting 12.

293
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,321
What if the cure
doesn't work watered down?

294
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:08,689
The banelings won't be happy.

295
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,692
Of course it'll work.

296
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,264
It's still glowing, isn't it?

297
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,567
Get out there.

298
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,506
You know who
I was before I died?

299
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:26,673
No, sir.

300
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,641
Captain of a D'Haran squadron.

301
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,510
You don't make
a man like me wait.

302
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,012
Time's too precious
when you work for the Keeper.

303
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,346
We're terribly sorry, sir.

304
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,381
Here you are.

305
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,922
I'll tell my friends about this.

306
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,998
Why are we stopping?

307
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,401
We've been on the road less
than two hours.

308
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,803
Even the Seeker needs
his sleep.

309
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,906
You don't look well, Cara.

310
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,441
You could do with
some rest too.

311
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:09,675
I'm just hungry.

312
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,678
I'm going hunting.

313
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,212
Now?

314
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,380
We've got some apples.

315
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,348
I want meat.

316
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,882
Okay,
I'll come with you.

317
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,117
No.

318
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,718
Zedd's right.

319
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,186
You need some rest.

320
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:27,456
Besides, I'm a better hunter
on my own anyway.

321
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:51,510
Is somebody there?

322
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,982
I don't have anything
for you tonight.

323
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:02,985
Come back tomorrow,
and I might have a fresh supply.

324
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:07,955
I can't wait till tomorrow.

325
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,901
You deserve worse than this.

326
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,343
<i>Every time you kill,</i>

327
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:33,212
<i>the clock begins to tick again.</i>

328
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,329
I was about
to come looking for you.

329
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,165
It took me a while
to find some prey.

330
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,533
Well, even without sleep,

331
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,669
you look much
better this morning.

332
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,403
I just needed a good meal.

333
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,810
Hey. What are you doing?

334
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,345
Closing up. We've only got
a few drops of the cure left.

335
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,114
There's not enough
to keep watering it down.

336
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:23,383
Then we'll mix plain water
with something else.

337
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,252
Sorcerer's gypsum
will make it glow.

338
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:28,621
But it won't cure anybody.

339
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:31,323
Then we'll just tell 'em
it takes a few days to work.

340
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,690
And when they realize?

341
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:35,025
By the time anybody's the wiser,

342
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,861
we'll be long gone,
with a fortune in our pockets.

343
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,095
But it doesn't seem right.

344
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,396
We'd be cheating people.

345
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,665
Well, they're not people really.

346
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,967
Banelings.

347
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,274
You swindled me!

348
00:22:57,312 --> 00:23:00,914
You said I'd be cured, but after
half a day, the hunger was back.

349
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,415
And look at my face!

350
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,884
Sir, the dose we gave you
was watered down.

351
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,186
But we have a few drops
of the pure liquid left.

352
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:08,720
It will cure you permanently.

353
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,222
You can have it.
No charge.

354
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,190
I'll take my cure the old way.

355
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,091
By sending your soul
to the Keeper.

356
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,062
Let him go!

357
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:41,349
Hello, Sebastian.

358
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,550
Wizard!

359
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,984
When I heard a magic peddler

360
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:47,287
in South Caston was selling
a remedy for banelings,

361
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,688
I knew it had to be you.

362
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:50,523
And by the looks of them,

363
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:51,858
I see I was also right

364
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,226
that your so-called cure
is a sham.

365
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:57,796
No. No, I assure you,
the cure is quite real.

366
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:02,167
But it wasn't my idea.

367
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,702
I was helping out a friend.

368
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:14,275
Hello, brother.

369
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:30,650
Lord Rahl.

370
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:34,554
I'm puzzled I didn't see
you sooner, Eagan.

371
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,590
Yesterday you failed
to deliver me a soul.

372
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,024
You broke the covenant.

373
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,659
And yet, somehow,

374
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,528
you managed to remain among
the living.

375
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,530
How, I wonder?

376
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,631
I--

377
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:49,768
I bought a cure.

378
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,770
A cure?

379
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,205
For being a baneling.

380
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,606
They called it Shadow Water.

381
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:56,974
But it didn't last.

382
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:01,210
The secret of the source of
Shadow Water died decades ago,

383
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:05,279
along with the Wizard
Carracticus Zorander.

384
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,181
It didn't work anyway, my Lord.

385
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,718
Oh, it worked.

386
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,853
You're not the only baneling
who's stopped killing

387
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:16,256
for the Keeper
in the past few days.

388
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,058
But tell me.

389
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,227
How is it that you
come to be dead again?

390
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,163
The Seeker ran me through.

391
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:27,498
The Seeker? Where?

392
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:31,435
In the shop where they
were selling the cure.

393
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:35,171
Then the Seeker knows
of its existence.

394
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:39,408
Tell me, the Mord-Sith who's
with him, did she drink it?

395
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:42,178
I don't think
they have any left.

396
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,415
If not, then the Seeker will
be searching for the source.

397
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:49,918
And he travels
with the son of Carracticus.

398
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,787
They will find it.

399
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:53,855
Send me back again, My Lord,
and I'll stop them.

400
00:25:55,657 --> 00:26:00,094
I'm afraid it's much too late
for you, Eagan.

401
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:10,269
Now give me one good reason
I shouldn't incinerate you too.

402
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,770
Who are you to question me?

403
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,238
You said you were
going to come back

404
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,206
after Darken Rahl was defeated,
but you didn't.

405
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,441
Maybe you haven't heard, but
the Keeper of the Underworld

406
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,475
is waging war
on the Land of the Living.

407
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:21,976
I know all about it.
And I was trying to do my part,

408
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:23,377
by curing banelings.

409
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,646
Where did you find
this cure anyway?

410
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:28,413
I was planting a new row
of squash in the back garden.

411
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:29,547
My spade struck the crate.

412
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,480
Father must have buried it there
a long time ago.

413
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:35,183
Father.

414
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:37,652
Was it Shadow Water?

415
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:39,620
You knew about it?

416
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:42,422
There was a rumor, when I was
training to be a Wizard,

417
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:45,289
that Father had found the source
and was experimenting with it.

418
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,190
Using it to bring the dead
back to life.

419
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,958
But that kind of dark magic
is taboo for a Wizard.

420
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,460
I was upset.

421
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:54,495
I went to him,
he said it was a lie

422
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:57,530
concocted by his enemies
to discredit him.

423
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,031
And I believed him.

424
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,101
Is there more?
Only a few drops.

425
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,803
I don't know if there's
even enough to cure anyone.

426
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:06,871
Can you make more?

427
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,306
It can't be conjured.

428
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,740
Only found.

429
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,811
If I remember correctly...

430
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:20,015
you have an apparatus

431
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:23,217
that makes magical maps.

432
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:25,686
I was making a map
a few months ago,

433
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,853
and suddenly it jammed.

434
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,389
It hasn't worked since.

435
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:33,993
It's not broken, it's spelled.

436
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,828
No doubt by
a dissatisfied customer.

437
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,964
Harlan. I warned him
that map would take him

438
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,499
through the Forest
of the Greel Mites.

439
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,166
He blamed me for the rash.

440
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,901
Spiteful old conjurer.

441
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,708
Good as new.

442
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,064
The source.

443
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:24,632
We should be able
to get there

444
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:25,833
in two days, maybe three.

445
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,901
Three days?

446
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,369
We got lucky.

447
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,169
It could have been
a lot farther.

448
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:33,738
I want to go with you.

449
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,839
So you can bottle
the water and sell it?

450
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,309
You're right, Zedd, I've been
selfish and short-sighted,

451
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,711
but this cure could make
a big difference.

452
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,479
You already have a quest.

453
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,213
You don't have time
to pass out Shadow Water

454
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:48,482
to banelings across
the Midlands. But I do.

455
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:50,217
Please, brother.

456
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:52,685
Give me a chance
to do something good

457
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:56,122
and maybe the world will
remember both sons

458
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,023
of the great
Carracticus Zorander.

459
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,549
Having an early breakfast,
I see.

460
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,318
What do you want?

461
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,418
I'm hungry.

462
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,720
We don't feed beggars.

463
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,022
Your mother must have neglected
to teach you manners.

464
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:45,326
Or maybe she didn't
have any herself.

465
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,027
I'm going to enjoy killing you.

466
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:50,530
Unfortunately for you...

467
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,467
I'm already dead.

468
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:57,268
She's a baneling!

469
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:20,022
Now throw his body on that fire,
or I kill you too.

470
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,593
How are you enjoying working
for me again?

471
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,561
I serve Richard.

472
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,497
What a hard-headed girl
you always were.

473
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:59,133
But your first obligation
is to me now.

474
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,170
And I believe you still owe me
a soul for today.

475
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,438
I know the rules.

476
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:07,273
Then why are you just
sitting here by the fire,

477
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:09,642
when your time
is nearly running out?

478
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:15,514
Don't tell me you've given up
on being a baneling already?

479
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:21,285
It's harder than you thought
it would be, isn't it?

480
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:24,521
You were lucky to find a nasty
D'Haran to kill last night,

481
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:26,423
but...

482
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:29,292
now, here you are,

483
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:31,260
leagues from the nearest town

484
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:33,562
with nobody to kill.

485
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:37,365
Except them.

486
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,802
Well, I knew this would happen.

487
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,538
But I am prepared
to offer you a way out.

488
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:50,910
Tell me where
the Shadow Water source is,

489
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,145
and you will never have
to kill again.

490
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:57,482
I don't have
to tell you anything.

491
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,785
That's not part

492
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,354
of our agreement.

493
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,057
Very well.

494
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,960
But you are going to
have to kill one of them.

495
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:14,096
You really should give old
Thaddicus a thought.

496
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:17,265
He hasn't amounted
to much in life.

497
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:20,101
He never was any good to anyone.

498
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,007
Thaddicus.

499
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:11,645
Help me get some firewood.

500
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:12,980
But it's not even light yet.

501
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,581
It will be soon.

502
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:16,416
And the others
will want breakfast.

503
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,757
We're going
to get some more wood.

504
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:35,761
That dried birch
will burn well.

505
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,102
<i>He never was any good</i>
<i>to anyone.</i>

506
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:03,279
<i>Give me a chance</i>
<i>to do something good.</i>

507
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,748
<i>Maybe the world will remember</i>
<i>both sons</i>

508
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:08,451
<i>of the great</i>
<i>Carracticus Zorander.</i>

509
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:11,456
What's wrong?

510
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,272
You-- Help! Zedd, help!

511
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,439
Help!

512
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,374
I'm not going to hurt you.

513
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,676
What happened?
She's a baneling!

514
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:37,250
Cara.

515
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,951
When?

516
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:42,154
Three days ago.

517
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:43,455
I've already killed twice.

518
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:47,892
You died in the fight
with that driver.

519
00:34:47,893 --> 00:34:49,126
Rahl offered you the deal.

520
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:51,895
I asked him
to make me a baneling.

521
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:52,996
Why?

522
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,632
I had to get back,

523
00:34:56,633 --> 00:35:01,002
to tell you where the kidnappers
had taken the captives.

524
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:07,737
And I had to protect you.

525
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,406
You, Richard.

526
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,778
But I'm no use to you like this.

527
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,682
I almost killed Thaddicus.

528
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,151
I was looking at the map.

529
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,819
There's a faster way
to the source,

530
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,755
a canyon pass.

531
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,322
We'll get you the Shadow Water.

532
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,955
Even if it was only
a thousand paces,

533
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:29,356
I won't make it.

534
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,993
Please, go.

535
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:35,895
I don't want you
to see me like this.

536
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:41,267
Is there anything you can do?

537
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:45,836
Banelings are created
with dark magic.

538
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:51,575
I have no power to help you.

539
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:52,775
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:03,084
May the Creator watch over you.

541
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:17,294
Thank you.

542
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:20,129
For what?

543
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,831
You could have killed me
to save yourself.

544
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:24,133
But you didn't.

545
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:31,472
Thaddicus!
No.

546
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:33,274
Thaddicus, why?

547
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:39,878
Give him the Breath of Life!

548
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:42,881
I lost that power
when I became a baneling.

549
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:45,250
If you drank from the source,
you'd get that power back. Zedd?

550
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:46,852
It stands to reason.

551
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:48,086
Cara and I will run.

552
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:52,023
You follow with Thaddicus
as fast as you can.

553
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:55,454
Welcome to your eternal reward,

554
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,256
Thaddicus.

555
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:00,458
I'll take the deal.

556
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,593
Make me a baneling.

557
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:06,195
So that you can find
the Shadow Water,

558
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,898
cure yourself, and cheat me?

559
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:10,533
I don't know
what you're talking about.

560
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:12,868
You think I don't know you've
been traveling with the Seeker

561
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,436
searching for the source?

562
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:18,771
Tell me where is it, Thaddicus.

563
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,173
I don't know.

564
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:25,777
Oh, but I think you do.

565
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:29,749
And I think you will tell me.

566
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:41,528
Come on. It should be on
the other side of this ridge.

567
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:49,169
Tell me where the source is
before I do my worst.

568
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,973
In a grove.

569
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,541
In the Valley of Echoes!

570
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,275
May the Creator forgive me!

571
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:04,014
Oh, I'm afraid the Creator

572
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,948
can't do you any good here,
Thaddicus.

573
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,725
There it is.

574
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,833
No!

575
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:01,572
I've got some.

576
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,584
I don't know how much longer
we can drag him.

577
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:18,168
He's growing colder.

578
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,561
If too much time passes,

579
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,578
the Breath of Life won't work.

580
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:23,528
I'm here!

581
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:47,102
Thank the Spirits.

582
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:49,943
How?

583
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:53,286
You saved Cara's life,
so she returned the favor.

584
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,545
You should
have let me stay dead.

585
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:59,037
What are you talking about?

586
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:01,289
I told Darken Rahl the location
of the source.

587
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,831
I was too weak.

588
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:06,840
I couldn't stand the pain.

589
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:09,850
Few could withstand the torments
of the Underworld, Thaddicus.

590
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:13,127
But even fewer would sacrifice
their life for another.

591
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:16,627
Why did you?

592
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,836
I nearly killed you.

593
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,262
But you didn't.

594
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:24,004
And when I saw you dying
I realized

595
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,679
I'm just an old man.

596
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,996
I've never done anything
for anyone but myself.

597
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,980
But you're important.

598
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:34,847
You help people. You--
You protect the Seeker.

599
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:38,817
Your life is much more valuable
than mine.

600
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:42,820
Thaddicus,

601
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:45,731
your life is valuable
to me, brother.

602
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:54,828
I'm grateful

603
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,897
to both of you
for helping me save Thaddicus.

604
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:01,148
It wasn't just Thaddicus
we wanted to save.

605
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:06,898
Still.

606
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,640
You must think I'm a monster.

607
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:11,457
For taking the deal.

608
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,399
If I was faced
with the same choice--

609
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,683
Eternity in the Underworld

610
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:19,758
or come back, help Richard,

611
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:20,984
be with him.

612
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:25,309
--I might have made
the same decision.

613
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,664
I guess this
is where we part company.

614
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:38,541
After we've found the Stone
of Tears, I'll come see you.

615
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,835
I promise.

616
00:41:50,982 --> 00:41:52,030
Thank you.

617
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:05,029
I wonder what he'll do now.

618
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,704
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

619
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:11,015
and purchase a jar
of genuine soil

620
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:12,833
from the hallowed
and enchanted ground

621
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:16,740
that once bordered the renowned
source of Shadow Water.

622
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,299
This unrivaled and efficacious
loam has been known

623
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,415
to cure boils and warts,
snuff out colds,

624
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:26,507
and, yes,
it will even re-grow hair.

625
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,429
You, sir,
for a mere five shillings,

626
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,516
can reclaim the flowing locks
of your youth.

627
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:32,186
Allow me to demonstrate.

628
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:33,222
Oh.

629
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:35,491
Just give it a couple of days.

630
00:42:35,492 --> 00:42:37,993
You'll be astounded
by the results.
