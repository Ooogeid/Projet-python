1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,765
on Legend of the Seeker...

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,073
<i>A tear in the veil that separates
the Underworld</i>

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,342
<i>from the world of the living.
</i> Happened when I killed Rahl.

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:11,145
Only way to close the rift is the way
the Creator sealed the Underworld.

5
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,780
The Stone of Tears. We'll find it.

6
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,148
<i>He is a True Listener.</i>

7
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,883
<i>Can see what people are thinking?</i>

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:18,752
<i>An ancient scroll instructs
the bearer</i>

9
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:21,422
<i>of the Stone of Tears how to use it.</i>

10
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>Kahlan, she has the scroll!</i>

11
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,425
If you do as I ask,

12
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,393
I will hand you the
scroll personally.

13
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,362
<i>Suddenly you want to defeat the Keeper?</i>

14
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,797
<i>I want to live again.</i>

15
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:32,299
<i>I think you'll find it interesting
reading.</i>

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,334
I know I did.

17
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,235
<i>The instructions inscribed</i>

18
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,172
will only appear in the
glow cast by a Night Wisp.

19
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:39,907
<i>Well, I guess we know which way
we're headed.</i>

20
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:41,342
<i>So does Rahl.</i>

21
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:46,146
<i>Richard Cypher, you are the
true Seeker.</i>

24
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:22,349
<i>Why do you run from me,
Darken Rahl?</i>

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,118
Not from you, master.

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,653
For you.

27
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:28,322
<i>You belong in the Underworld</i>
<i>at my side.</i>

28
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,525
Master, I only returned
to the land of the living

29
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,661
to learn something of
the greatest importance.

30
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:37,731
Something that will help
us defeat the Seeker.

31
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:40,634
<i>And what is it that you learned?</i>

32
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:43,671
The Scroll of Valdaire,
now in the Seeker's possession,

33
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,839
can only be read by the
light of a Night Wisp.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,675
This is why I have remained.

35
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,310
To destroy the creatures.

36
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,913
Once I've eradicated
all the Night Wisps,

37
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:55,482
Richard Cypher will have no
means of reading the scroll.

38
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,351
And without the knowledge
contained within it,

39
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:00,654
even if he should find
the Stone of Tears,

40
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:03,757
he will not be able to use it
to seal the tear in the veil.

41
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:06,727
The land of the living
will be destroyed

42
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,329
and your victory will be complete.

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,365
<i>Very well, Darken Rahl,</i>

44
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,701
<i>but as soon as the Night Wisps</i>
<i>are annihilated,</i>

45
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:15,669
<i>you will kill yourself</i>
<i>and return to me.</i>

46
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,605
As you wish, master.

47
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,575
<i>If you do not, I will know</i>
<i>you have betrayed me.</i>

48
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,812
<i>You will be hunted</i>
<i>down and ripped</i>

49
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:27,548
<i>from the world of life to suffer
eternal torment</i>

50
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:28,916
<i>in the depths of the Underworld.</i>

51
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:37,925
A nightmare, My Lord?

52
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,727
No.

53
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:40,828
A warning.

54
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:45,999
It's still hours till first light.

55
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,803
Perhaps you could sleep better if

56
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,339
I eased your mind.

57
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,977
We've already wasted enough time.

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,714
Where are we going, My Lord?

59
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,916
Not "we."

60
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,319
If my plan goes as anticipated,

61
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,156
I need you to perform another task.

62
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,970
Tell me your name, so I can have
it carved on your headstone.

63
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,741
I am your master, Darken Rahl.

64
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,510
And the time for games is over.

65
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:32,012
Darken Rahl is dead.

66
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,847
He was killed by the
Seeker months ago.

67
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:37,985
It's not my death you
should be concerned about.

68
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,463
Gather the rest of your squad.

69
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:52,099
I have a mission for you.

70
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,201
You know, we've been
traveling for two days

71
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,669
without rest or food.

72
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,238
I don't know how much longer
Zedd can keep this up.

73
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,474
My ears work better than my legs.

74
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:03,010
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

75
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,912
We're almost there.
The Forest of the Night Wisps

76
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:08,015
is just beyond that next rise.

77
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,586
It's snow.

78
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,427
It's not snow.

79
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,962
It's ash.

80
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:22,896
Kahlan!

81
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,473
The Night Wisps.

82
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,606
They're all dead.

83
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,375
Maybe some of them escaped.

84
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:44,611
Even if they did,
where would they go?

85
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,081
Kahlan, if there's another
Night Wisp alive in the world,

86
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,283
we'll find it.

87
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,118
Good thing we don't have
anything else to do,

88
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,986
like find the Stone of Tears.

89
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:56,323
Without the scroll, we won't
know what to do with the Stone.

90
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:57,557
It'll be useless.

91
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,462
Shh.

92
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,830
Quiet. Did you hear that?

93
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,234
One must have survived.

94
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,203
Careful.

95
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,806
Don't scare it off.

96
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,589
Are you looking for this?

97
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,567
Give me the Scroll of Valdaire...

98
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,773
or the last Night Wisp dies.

99
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,141
I wonder if you can throw
a Wizard's web faster

100
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,877
than I can crush my
little friend here.

101
00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,962
They're very delicate, you know.

102
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,364
Zedd.

103
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,666
What do you want with the scroll?

104
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,935
The same as you, dear brother.

105
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,169
To save the world.

106
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,172
I've already betrayed
the Keeper to do so.

107
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:12,908
He expected me to annihilate
every last Night Wisp

108
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,644
and then return to the Underworld.

109
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,980
But I have no intention
of going back.

110
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,684
I'm going to join your little quest

111
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,553
and when you find
the Stone of Tears,

112
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:25,855
you will give it to me,

113
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,824
and I will follow the
instructions on the scroll

114
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,593
and heal the rift.

115
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:34,230
So you can be hailed
as the world's savior.

116
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,565
Yes.

117
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,300
The Keeper is impatient.

118
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,070
He wants the world of life
snuffed out, and quickly.

119
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:43,172
Which is why you must
give me the scroll now

120
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,773
so I can prevent
that from happening.

121
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:47,943
Don't you realize you've
already doomed the world

122
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,778
by destroying the Night Wisps?

123
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,047
Do you really think
I'm so short-sighted?

124
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:54,984
The Night Wisps are the most
vital link in the chain of life.

125
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:58,888
Their demise would bring
about a cascade of extinction

126
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,923
that would eventually
result in the death

127
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:04,293
of everything that
lives and breathes.

128
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:08,964
Which is why I saved
this particular Wisp.

129
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,132
It's with young.

130
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:14,537
It can give birth
and life can go on,

131
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:17,907
if you honor my simple request,

132
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:19,975
and give me the scroll.

133
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:23,779
Let him crush it.
We'll find another one.

134
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,314
That's my Mord-Sith.

135
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:28,651
No sentimental attachment.

136
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:30,819
But if I know my brother,

137
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,923
he's not willing to risk
the fate of the world

138
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,991
on such a slim chance.

139
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,760
What do you say?

140
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,128
Since we're on the same side now,

141
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,329
we may as well be partners.

142
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,464
How do I know you won't
kill the Night Wisp

143
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:44,533
as soon as I hand you the scroll?

144
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,169
Well, you can be certain that
I will kill it if you do not.

145
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,243
She's awfully quiet.

146
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:16,298
Now, it seems that I
am the only living soul

147
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,603
who knows what to do
with the Stone of Tears.

148
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:30,112
No!

149
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,182
Now, is that any way
to treat the newest

150
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,984
member of your merry band?

151
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,986
Relax, brother.

152
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,688
I have the knowledge,
you have the compass.

153
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,992
Together let's save the world.

154
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:51,133
Now, let's find that Stone.

155
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,435
The Night Wisps only give birth

156
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,471
in the grottoes of the
northern foothills.

157
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:58,307
If I don't take her there,
she and her babies will die.

158
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:00,776
You'll have to go
through Gar territory.

159
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,111
Cara, go with her.

160
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,880
The compass is taking us northeast.

161
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:07,349
We'll travel together
as far as Elmswood Pass.

162
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,486
Then you and Kahlan will take
the Night Wisp to the grottoes.

163
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:13,822
We'll continue on our
search for the Stone.

164
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,658
Bind him.

165
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,595
I want the "newest member ofur
merry band" on a short leash.

166
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,104
What if the Prophecy
is coming true?

167
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:30,406
What do you mean?

168
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,608
"Should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

169
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:36,645
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of the light."

170
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,080
What if Rahl is the
enemy of the light?

171
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,584
I'm not going to
give him the Stone.

172
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,886
Then how?

173
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:47,423
I have an idea.

174
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:53,162
I can't help but notice the
Wizard has disappeared.

175
00:10:53,163 --> 00:10:54,496
How disappointing.

176
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,999
I was looking forward to
enjoying his renowned wit.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,535
Well, you'll have
to settle for mine.

178
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:02,371
I know it must be very
frustrating for you, brother.

179
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,473
I wonder how you're
planning to do it.

180
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:05,607
Do what?

181
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,843
Learn the instructions
on the scroll.

182
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:10,913
Let's see, if I were you,
what would I do?

183
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,614
Well, you can't confess me,

184
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,283
you know my soul is
immune to Confession,

185
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:16,819
and if you thought
Cara could break me,

186
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,487
you would have had her
torture me by now.

187
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:21,457
Oh, wait, I just
thought of something.

188
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,393
Perhaps you sent the
Wizard to get a Listener

189
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,495
to read my thoughts.

190
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,399
We're here.

191
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,668
This is Elmswood Pass.

192
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,046
I guess this is where
we say goodbye.

193
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:46,915
Can we speed this up?

194
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,450
She loves you, you love her,

195
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,786
I should protect her
as if she were you.

196
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:52,054
Have I missed anything?

197
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,890
We could be halfway
there by the time

198
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,425
you two finish your goodbyes.

199
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,698
We'll catch up once the
Night Wisp is safe.

200
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:03,899
Be careful.

201
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,103
You too.

202
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:20,983
It must be difficult being
so close to the Confessor,

203
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:23,886
but unable to bed her.

204
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:28,657
No wonder you invited Cara
along on your little quest.

205
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,793
The Mord-Sith have a long history

206
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:33,429
of serving the House of Rahl

207
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,063
in every way.

208
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:37,666
And as I recall,

209
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:41,003
Cara was always so eager to please.
Careful, brother.

210
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:42,471
You wouldn't want to do anything

211
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,039
that may cause me
to lose my memory.

212
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,043
You're right.

213
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:58,086
Keeper, hear our prayer.

214
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,756
We live only to serve you.

215
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:02,758
For it is you who will take us--

216
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:18,574
<i>Sister Marianna.</i>

217
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:19,842
Keeper...

218
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,879
you've heard our prayers.

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,949
<i>The prayers of foolish girls</i>
<i>do not concern me.</i>

220
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,017
Master, why are you angry?

221
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,053
We are your loyal servants.

222
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:35,457
<i>My most loyal servant of all, Darken Rahl,
has betrayed me.</i>

223
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,593
How can that be?

224
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:40,095
<i>He was to destroy the Night Wisps,</i>

225
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:43,632
<i>then kill himself and return</i>
<i>to the Underworld.</i>

226
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,301
<i>I've received the souls of thousands
of Night Wisps,</i>

227
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:49,671
<i>but Rahl's soul did not follow.</i>

228
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,540
What do you ask of us?

229
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:56,411
<i>Find him wherever he is and
send him back to me.</i>

230
00:13:56,412 --> 00:14:00,916
How I have missed the
simple pleasures of life.

231
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,451
Enjoy them while you can.

232
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:06,388
Someday, whether it's
in a week or 50 years,

233
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,125
you'll be dead again and you'll
have to face the Keeper's wrath.

234
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,894
Oh, you're mistaken.

235
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:13,395
When the veil is repaired

236
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,597
and the natural order of
the Underworld restored,

237
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:18,033
I will bask in the Creator's light

238
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,702
along with you and
the Mother Confessor.

239
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,138
You've killed countless
innocent people.

240
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,706
How could you possibly believe

241
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,742
the Creator is going to reward you?

242
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,477
When I seal the rift,

243
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:30,612
not only will I be
protecting those alive today,

244
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:33,882
I'll be ensuring the lives
of future generations.

245
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,717
Surely, such a noble act

246
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:38,120
will tip the scale
of deeds in my favor.

247
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:43,058
The only reason you want to save
the world is to save yourself.

248
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,162
Well, you've had quite a
run at being the hero.

249
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:49,498
Isn't it time you shared the
glory with someone else?

250
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,673
I told you I'm on your side.

251
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,611
I always knew we'd make
a great team, brother.

252
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,742
Welcome, Wizard.

253
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:28,110
What brings you to Thandor?

254
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:31,180
I've come to see an old friend.

255
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,916
Zedd!

256
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:37,419
Look how big you've
grown in just a year.

257
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,321
You're almost as tall as I am.

258
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,257
No one's as tall as you.

259
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,526
What's this?

260
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:49,031
The Sisters of the Light have
you wearing a Rada'han now?

261
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,599
Suppressing his
ability to read minds

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,835
gives him a chance at
a normal childhood.

263
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,136
Renn's come a long way

264
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:57,206
since you entrusted him
to our care, Wizard.

265
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,607
I'm glad to hear it.

266
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,676
I would never ask to
take him away from you

267
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,978
unless it was a matter
of great urgency.

268
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:07,149
You want him to help the Seeker.

269
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,284
Yes.

270
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,519
You know the Sisters of the Light

271
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,456
believe the Seeker is
prophesied to help the Keeper.

272
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:17,026
I can't allow Renn to go with you.

273
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,928
The Seeker saved me.

274
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,996
I want to help him if I can.

275
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:24,099
I think the boy's wishes are clear.

276
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,137
Very well.

277
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:31,473
I'll get the key to the Rada'han.

278
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,776
Where are we going?

279
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,250
Renn, I need you to listen closely.

280
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,052
The Sisters aren't going to let me

281
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,220
take you out of here
without a fight.

282
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,256
I don't understand.

283
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,924
Sister Everleen--

284
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:52,528
She's coming back,
but not with a key.

285
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,230
What do you want me to do?

286
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,833
On my word, stay low.

287
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,571
Ready?

288
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:05,841
Now!

289
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,216
I'll take that key now.

290
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,888
I know how lonely it can be.

291
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,324
My sister and I are
the last of our kind.

292
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:26,428
When we find the Stone of Tears,

293
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,796
and the world is safe,

294
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,198
I'd love to have a baby,

295
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,135
but for me it's complicated.

296
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,770
Yes,

297
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,440
because my heart
belongs to Richard.

298
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,275
If I were to take him as my mate,

299
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,811
my magic would destroy him.

300
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,249
Well, when you put it like that,

301
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,651
I guess it would be
easier to be a Night Wisp.

302
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:53,655
Can you please stop
that incessant babbling?

303
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:57,159
Night Wisps are the
most fragile beings

304
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,460
the Creator has ever made.

305
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:02,898
Without constant companionship
they will perish.

306
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,567
So if you give me
one moment of peace

307
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:07,336
that thing's going to die?

308
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,672
It might.

309
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:14,977
I don't even know if my talking
to her is going to be enough.

310
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,912
She's so delicate.

311
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:19,114
Not only is she with young,

312
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,849
but she's lost her entire family.

313
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,787
She would be a lot
stronger if she had them

314
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,488
to accompany her to
the birthing ground.

315
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,824
How do you even know
what it's saying?

316
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:33,162
It'a magical language.

317
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:35,130
If you listen closely,

318
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,900
eventually you'll understand it.

319
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,273
It's a bit ironic, isn't it?

320
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,574
The man who killed me

321
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,443
going to such lengths
to keep me alive.

322
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:49,511
The cut isn't deep. It'll heal.

323
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:53,615
Your brotherly
affection is touching.

324
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:56,518
Who do you think you're
fooling with this ruse?

325
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,688
You're always so quick to think
the worst of me, brother.

326
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:02,858
You had the man who
raised me murdered.

327
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:06,695
And now you've nearly destroyed
an entire race of creatures,

328
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,264
all so you could get the
glory for saving the world.

329
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,135
And you wonder why
I think the worst?

330
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:16,472
You're right, of course.

331
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:20,075
But I assure you,
my sentiment was genuine.

332
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:22,611
It is nice being in the
company of one's family.

333
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,680
Is that why you murdered
your own father?

334
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,148
You have no idea what it was like

335
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:28,217
growing up in the House of Rahl.

336
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:29,451
For most people

337
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:31,653
it is a joy to learn
you're to have a sibling,

338
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:35,023
but imagine how I felt when
our father boasted to me

339
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:39,795
that my own baby brother
would be the one to kill me.

340
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,331
<i>We were unable to kill him, master.</i>

341
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>Darken Rahl is one man.</i>

342
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,903
<i>In the body he has now,
he possesses no magic.</i>

343
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,606
<i>And yet you allowed him to slip</i>
<i>through your fingers?</i>

344
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,608
Master, he was not alone.

345
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,042
The Seeker was with him.

346
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,444
<i>The Seeker?</i>

347
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:58,413
If not for him, Darken Rahl
would be groveling before you

348
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,649
in the Underworld
at this very moment.

349
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,484
<i>This is quite unexpected.</i>

350
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:04,786
<i>And quite fortunate.</i>

351
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:05,988
Master?

352
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,489
<i>Now that the brothers are together,</i>

353
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,491
<i>I can destroy them both.</i>

354
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:13,295
We thought the Seeker was
more valuable alive than dead.

355
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:15,397
Prophecy says he will
deliver the Stone

356
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:16,932
to the enemy of the light.

357
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,001
<i>That "enemy of the light" could
be his own brother,</i>

358
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:21,170
<i>Darken Rahl,</i>

359
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:24,206
<i>whom I can no longer trust</i>
<i>to do my will.</i>

360
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:26,308
They can't have gotten far.

361
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,709
We'll leave immediately.

362
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,546
<i>No. You have already failed me once.</i>

363
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:34,016
<i>This task will require someone</i>
<i>much more powerful than you.</i>

364
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:36,818
<i>A man of extraordinary strength,</i>

365
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:40,522
<i>and with an uncommon disregard
for life.</i>

366
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:51,433
Faster, you dogs!

367
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,552
Don't kill me.

368
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,287
As you wish.

369
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:14,623
We'll let him do it.

370
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:31,073
Who are you?

371
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,941
Servants of the Keeper.

372
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:35,244
And what does the
Keeper want with me?

373
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:39,114
You've earned his favor with
the thousands you've killed.

374
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:42,751
And now he has a task for you.

375
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,032
What is it?

376
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:00,269
We've crossed into Gar territory.

377
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,037
Get your Agiels ready.

378
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,444
Why do Gars bother to feed
on something so small?

379
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:11,380
They absorb the Night Wisps' han.

380
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,849
It allows them to hunt in the dark.

381
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,354
Quick, in here.

382
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,333
It knows we're here.

383
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:27,234
You want this?

384
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:43,584
I can't understand a
single thing you're saying.

385
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,086
I'm sorry Kahlan's not
here to talk to you,

386
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,888
but she had to draw the Gars away,

387
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,791
so would you please stop serenading

388
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:54,194
every creature in the forest?

389
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:59,066
Finally.

390
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:05,839
Let's keep moving.

391
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:10,644
What's wrong?

392
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,917
The dacra's magic must
have tainted my blood.

393
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:26,827
Zedd will be back soon.
He'll heal you.

394
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,163
How is that funny?

395
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,232
Before our encounter

396
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,434
in the Forest of the Night Wisps,

397
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:38,171
I knew you wouldn't be content
to let the secrets of the scroll

398
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,774
remain locked in my
mind so I planned ahead.

399
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,876
What did you do?

400
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:48,849
In case you sent your
Wizard to find a Listener,

401
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,018
I ordered my Mord-Sith
to track him.

402
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,887
Once Zedd's found a Listener,

403
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,289
Garen will kill them both.

404
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,659
Apparently,
I've sealed my own fate,

405
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,762
as well as the fate of the world.

406
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,336
Oh, Renn.

407
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,872
Enjoy youth while it lasts.

408
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:14,174
Before you know it,
time sneaks up on you

409
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:18,745
and you have aches in places you
didn't even know you had places.

410
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,415
Do an old man a favor.

411
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:25,285
Pass me that long
branch over there.

412
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:28,755
It'll make a nice walking stick.

413
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,360
I would think a Wizard of
the First Order would know

414
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,095
he can't use magic on a Mord-Sith.

415
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,699
I have no intention of using magic.

416
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,744
You're going to need
more than a walking cane

417
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,245
to defeat me, old man.

418
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,601
Well, Wisp, it's just you and me,

419
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:17,804
and we have a long way to go, so...

420
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:21,675
what do you want to talk about?

421
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:24,578
Huh?

422
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,847
Mm.

423
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:31,151
This would be so much
easier if you used words

424
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:33,120
instead of chirping.

425
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:38,558
I'll bet you wish Kahlan
was here instead of me.

426
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,596
The truth is,
you're lucky I'm here.

427
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:44,331
Kahlan couldn't have run all night

428
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:48,235
and got you safely out of
Gar territory like I did.

429
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:54,107
I'm faster than she is and
I have more endurance.

430
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:56,209
I'm also better in a fight.

431
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,212
If it weren't for me,
everyone on this quest

432
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,114
would be Shadrin food by now.

433
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:04,417
I'm not boasting.

434
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,520
I'm simply--

435
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,490
Wait.

436
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,660
Did you just say I was boasting?

437
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,601
I can understand you.

438
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,170
Say something else.

439
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,107
Kahlan is close?

440
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,542
Where?

441
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:41,488
Did you throw the
Gars off our tracks?

442
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,191
Yes, but I twisted my ankle.

443
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:46,226
Don't worry. She'll live.

444
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:49,529
You can understand her.

445
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,997
It wasn't that hard,

446
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,499
once it started speaking clearly.

447
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,235
Here, you take her.

448
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:06,112
Cara, her light is getting weaker.

449
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,881
We don't have much time.

450
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:10,851
With my ankle I won't be
able to move fast enough.

451
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,187
It's up to you to get her
to the birthing ground.

452
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:22,963
For years you faithfully
served Darken Rahl

453
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:24,764
as leader of the Dragon Corps.

454
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,300
Half the Midlands was
conquered under my command.

455
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,535
And how did Rahl

456
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,670
reward such fealty?

457
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:34,207
He had me thrown into the
Prison Mines of Mearog

458
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,909
when he feared his men

459
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,478
were growing more
loyal to me than him.

460
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,213
You've suffered for so long,

461
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:43,717
but now the Keeper offers you
a chance to kill Darken Rahl

462
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,887
and take the revenge
that has eluded you.

463
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,789
And what does the
Keeper ask in return?

464
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:52,959
He wants you to
sacrifice your arm...

465
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,231
so that he can give you his.

466
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:05,505
But you must be willing to
pay the price for such power.

467
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,920
Make me an instrument
of the Keeper.

468
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:44,783
You're wrong.

469
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:47,318
They don't care for me,
they only value me

470
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,623
because...I'm effective.

471
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,892
Richard only keeps me
because he needs me.

472
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,961
Kahlan puts up with
me because of Richard.

473
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:59,731
And Zedd...

474
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,634
Zedd would probably torch me
with Wizard's Fire if he could.

475
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,338
That's absurd.

476
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:10,642
I'm not afraid of
getting close to them.

477
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:11,810
I do not love them.

478
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:16,414
I don't.

479
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:19,083
I am not afraid to say it.

480
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:23,087
Mord-Sith are afraid of nothing.

481
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:26,057
Stop nagging.

482
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,859
You remind me of Kahlan.

483
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,929
All right.

484
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,499
I love Richard.

485
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,303
It's a Mord-Sith's duty
to love the Lord Rahl.

486
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:43,208
What does it matter how I
feel about Zedd and Kahlan?

487
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:48,947
Fine. I care for them too.

488
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,283
A little. There.

489
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,886
I said it.

490
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,988
Are you happy now?

491
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:00,592
Wisp?

492
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:02,427
Wisp?

493
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:11,069
What's wrong?

494
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,938
What do you mean you're dying?

495
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,844
You used all your strength
to save your babies.

496
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:26,484
Hold on, Wisp, I'm going to get
you to the birthing ground.

497
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:34,826
This is useless. We will
never find a healer in time.

498
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,795
Are you telling me the greatest
tyrant the world has ever known

499
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:40,031
is going to be done in by
a scratch from a dacra?

500
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,433
It's tragic, isn't it?

501
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:43,468
Don't give up!

502
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:46,104
I am not going to make it.

503
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:54,178
Then, before you die, tell me
what was written on the scroll.

504
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,813
No.

505
00:32:55,814 --> 00:32:58,983
You want to save the world?
This is your chance.

506
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:02,020
When I die,
the Keeper has assured me

507
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,690
I will suffer eternal torment,

508
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:08,393
but if I can tell him

509
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:10,161
that I didn't reveal
the scroll's secrets,

510
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:12,997
perhaps I can escape that fate.

511
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:15,600
And what makes you think the
Keeper will be merciful?

512
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,402
Oh, a lifetime of service

513
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:20,872
should forgive a
momentary transgression.

514
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,607
Lifetime of service?

515
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:27,045
What I'm about to tell you,

516
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,648
I have never revealed
to a single living soul.

517
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:34,619
At a young age I reached
the limits of my powers...

518
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,956
but I wasn't satisfied.

519
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:42,226
I discovered an ancient
volume which promised...

520
00:33:43,762 --> 00:33:47,465
to give me unlimited power,

521
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,601
but at a terrible price.

522
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:52,503
What are you talking about?

523
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:55,206
When you killed me, dear Richard,

524
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,142
it was not the first time I died.

525
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:03,548
I followed the book's instructions,

526
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:04,916
I took my own life.

527
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,684
Once in thUnderworld,

528
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:09,754
I communed with the Keeper
and I made him an offer.

529
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:15,159
If he would grant me the
power to rule the world,

530
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,128
each day I would kill for him.

531
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,700
I would send him an
endless supply of souls.

532
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:23,868
You were a baneling?

533
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,305
The very first.

534
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:35,246
All the death and destruction
you wrought was for the Keeper?

535
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:38,516
Yes.

536
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:43,721
But he deceived me.

537
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:46,224
He only returned me to
the land of the living

538
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:47,458
because he knew one day

539
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,127
you could use the power
of Orden to kill me.

540
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,463
And my death would tear a hole

541
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:56,300
in the veil between the two worlds.

542
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:59,170
It was all part of his plan.

543
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:03,307
But you have a chance
to stop him. Now.

544
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:06,978
I'll make sure that everyone
knows how you died heroically.

545
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,181
That your last act
was saving the world.

546
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:12,517
Just tell me what
was on the scroll.

547
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,591
Richard...

548
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:26,130
Behind you.

549
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,591
Rahl!

550
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,160
You can't die!

551
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:29,372
We made it.

552
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:34,277
Wisp?

553
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:37,980
Wisp?

554
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:18,421
I'm sorry I failed you.

555
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:51,187
The babies survived.

556
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,964
No! Come on!

557
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,433
You have to hold on.
You have to fight!

558
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,071
Richard.

559
00:39:09,072 --> 00:39:10,806
Zedd, hurry, he's dying!

560
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,778
You don't know how happy I am

561
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,781
to see that you
escaped death, Wizard.

562
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:54,116
I wish I could say
the same for you.

563
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:01,390
It seems I will get to
enjoy that wit after all.

564
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:10,366
And you must be the Listener.

565
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,206
You have to take the Stone of Tears

566
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,608
to the Pillars of Creation,

567
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:21,077
on the day of the summer solstice.

568
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,045
That's less than a
fortnight from now.

569
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,981
If we don't make it there
with the Stone by then,

570
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:26,482
we'll have to wait another year.

571
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:30,553
By that time,
the Keeper will have won.

572
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,221
Does he know what we
have to do with the Stone

573
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,155
once we get it there?

574
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,462
You have to place it in
the center of the Pillars.

575
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:44,800
The light of noonday sun
will pass through the Stone

576
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,902
and repair the tear in the veil.

577
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,839
Thank you, Renn.

578
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,008
I was going to tell you.

579
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:54,844
He might have.

580
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:58,314
His mind is so full
of confusing thoughts,

581
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:01,250
I can't tell for sure.

582
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:17,733
Did you make it?

583
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:26,575
I wish you could have been there.

584
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:34,850
It was the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

585
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,895
Now that we know what
to do with the Stone,

586
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:47,697
we don't need Rahl anymore.

587
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:49,231
We can't kill him.

588
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,966
He'll tell the Keeper
where we're headed.

589
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,234
What do you have in mind?

590
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:55,204
We take him with us.

591
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:58,140
He's not going  like
being our prisoner.

592
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,209
I won't give him a choice.

593
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,644
What about me?

594
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:06,015
You don't think I should
go back to Thandor...

595
00:42:06,016 --> 00:42:09,852
No, but Kahlan has a
sister who loves children.

596
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:13,622
How do you feel about
being an older brother?

597
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:18,227
No!

598
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,176
I'm sure I'll see you again,
brother.

599
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,412
I'm sure you will.
