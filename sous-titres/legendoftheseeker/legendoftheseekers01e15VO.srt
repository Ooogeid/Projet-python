1
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:07,787
Why have you been unable
to locate the third Box of Orden

2
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,053
or the Wizard Zeddicus?

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,388
The tracer cloud
our sorcerers sent out

4
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:17,937
has been unsuccessful
in finding either, My Lord.

5
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:20,186
But we are redoubling our efforts.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,396
The Wizard will not evade us
much longer.

7
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:27,301
Lord Rahl,
think of what you've accomplished

8
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:29,414
even without all three boxes.

9
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:33,240
You've conquered two territories
and the resistance will soon be crushed.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,120
I don't want to crush them,
Egremont.

11
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:45,547
The Seeker
has poisoned the minds of the people

12
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,591
with this misguided notion
that I want to do them harm,

13
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,885
when all I want to do
is bring them peace.

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,207
At least My Lord
can take comfort in the news

15
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:59,058
that the Seeker
no longer stands in our way.

16
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,933
Tell me, Egremont,

17
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:11,023
do you really believe
the Seeker is dead?

18
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,281
You're alive.
Thank the Spirits.

19
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:18,279
Messengers have been spreading word
that you abandoned your quest,

20
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:21,254
fled back across the Boundary,
and died there.

21
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,667
We want him to believe that so he'll let
his guard down, stop hunting me,

22
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,420
- at least for a while.
- We knew we could trust you.

23
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,797
Of course. Anything for the Seeker.

24
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,727
We're heading
for the Keep of Edraan.

25
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:35,302
- Can you take us there?
- The Keep of Edraan?

26
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:38,347
That's a place most people
would do anything to avoid.

27
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:40,964
We don't have that luxury.

28
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:46,022
My family was abducted in Hartland,
sent there as prisoners.

29
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:50,192
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- They won't be prisoners much longer.

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,038
It won't be easy getting in.

31
00:01:57,163 --> 00:02:00,453
Won't be easy for those D'Haran bastards
to keep me out.

32
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,413
We could take that patrol,
storm the place.

33
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:04,457
Easy, Chase.

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,627
We don't wanna rattle the hive
until we deal with the hornets inside.

35
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,713
What exactly goes on in there?

36
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:13,226
No one really knows.

37
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,957
That's why I had you
assigned here, Bram.

38
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,838
So you could witness
Giller's twisted alchemy for yourself.

39
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,591
I'd hoped your accounts of what went
on here were exaggerated, Uncle.

40
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,522
- But that woman...
- That woman was one of the lucky ones.

41
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,047
At least she died.

42
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,949
And the more
Rahl pushes Giller for results,

43
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:07,674
the more sadistic
his experiments become.

44
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,098
For too long, I've sat idly by

45
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,488
while Rahl has waged his war
in the name of peace.

46
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,662
And now I'm supposed to watch
as he has his Wizard

47
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,287
butcher defenseless women
and children?

48
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,513
Lord Rahl must have his reasons.

49
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,141
If Giller succeeds,

50
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,461
Rahl will no longer need
the Boxes of Orden to control us all.

51
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,730
We'll all be enslaved to his will.

52
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,322
Captain Ericon.

53
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,062
Inform Lord Rahl that we are

54
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:46,725
making progress

55
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,727
despite today's

56
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,355
disappointment.

57
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:52,574
Yes, Wizard.

58
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:58,673
We're running out of places
to bury Giller's disappointments.

59
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:01,687
You're right.

60
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:03,242
This is madness.

61
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,696
But defying Rahl is just as insane.

62
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:10,612
If we don't act soon, defying Rahl
will no longer be an option.

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Lord Rahl,

64
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,901
word from Edraan.

65
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:34,440
It appears Wizard Giller
might have more success

66
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,442
if he had the proper motivation.

67
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:38,625
Send a reply.

68
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:41,697
My dear Giller...

69
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:47,911
What is it?

70
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,586
When the Constellation of Pirion
aligns,

71
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:53,334
Lord Rahl will arrive at the Keep.

72
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:56,212
He's coming to oversee Giller's work

73
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,102
personally.

74
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,642
And when he gets here,

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
we're going to kill him.

76
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,073
Command me, Confessor.

77
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:41,095
The prisoners ar a dungeon
just below the Keep.

78
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:44,051
Is my family among them?
Are they all right?

79
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,263
I don't know. There are many women
and children held inside.

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,610
The only time
I've seen the prisoners

81
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,725
is when their bodies
are taken out to be buried.

82
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,817
- If anything's happened...
- We're going to get them out.

83
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,161
Some of my men in the resistance

84
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,532
intercepted a shipment
of Dragon's Breath last week.

85
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,867
You think we could blast our way
into the Keep?

86
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,953
There's enough to blast it
back to D'Hara.

87
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,206
- We might end up killing the prisoners.
- Then how?

88
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,667
The Keep doesn't even have windows.

89
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,003
Without windows, how is it lit?

90
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,047
Oil lamps
fed through pipes from a cistern.

91
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:26,802
Cutting off the flow of oil
would plunge the Keep into darkness.

92
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:31,261
Can't stop us freeing the prisoners
if they can't see us doing it.

93
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:40,098
Some of my men are ready to act.
But we need you.

94
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,345
You grew up with Rahl.
You're his oldest friend.

95
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,090
The abuses inflicted upon me
were not acts of friendship.

96
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,648
Rahl trusts you.

97
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,597
And when he arrives,
he'll grant you a private audience.

98
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:52,096
He clearly has a special place
in his heart for you.

99
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,346
- Rahl has no heart.
- Of course he does.

100
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,832
And when he embraces you,
you'll plunge your dagger into it.

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,660
That's suicide.

102
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,971
Rahl's guards
will be just outside the door.

103
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,839
My men and I will kill the guards
while you're inside.

104
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,325
- What about Giller?
- We'll kill the Wizard,

105
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,553
blame him for the assassination.
No one will question it.

106
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,139
Remember, Giller once swore allegiance
to the Confessors.

107
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,800
And now.

108
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,533
Keep the entrance covered.

109
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:48,752
Think of your son.

110
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:53,261
When he comes of age,
he will be conscripted.

111
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:57,544
Are you willing to sacrifice him
for this pointless, brutal war?

112
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:03,841
I'm not.

113
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,035
I'm with you, Uncle.

114
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,739
Emma? Laura?

115
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,947
Who's there?

116
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,941
- Thank the Spirits, I've found you.
- Chase? I don't believe it.

117
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:48,232
Father.

118
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,617
We're going to get you out of here.
All of you.

119
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:58,537
But you have to follow our footsteps
and stay very quiet.

120
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,957
I want that leak repaired.

121
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:06,879
We're trying to relight the lamps.

122
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,199
Check the dungeon.

123
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,223
They've gone. All of them.

124
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,230
Lord Rahl arrives tomorrow.

125
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,067
I can try to delay his visit,
but if we have nothing to show him,

126
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,612
our blood will be used
as ink for his Journey Book.

127
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,114
The prisoners can't have gone far.

128
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,159
Then find them.

129
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,025
We can rest here for a moment.

130
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:52,033
I missed you all so much.

131
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,247
Every day I prayed to see you again.

132
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,874
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

133
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,539
Nothing could stop me
from finding you.

134
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,589
Father, what's wrong?

135
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,033


136
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,895
His heartbeat's weak.

137
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,794
And he's burning up.

138
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,082
But he's still alive.

139
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,828
It's the Wizard's doing.

140
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:08,250
He performed dark magic on my mother
and many of the others.

141
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,691
Did I do this to Chase?

142
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:12,931
I don't know.

143
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:15,966
All I did was kiss him.

144
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:19,803
- This Wizard, do you know his name?
- They call him Giller.

145
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,506
- You've heard of him?
- He used to serve the Confessors,

146
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,352
until he sold his services to Rahl.

147
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:29,688
What did he do to you?

148
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:39,990
What is that?

149
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:43,076
Some kind of magic.
I've never seen it before.

150
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,531
Please.

151
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,125
You've got to help my husband.

152
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,112
There's a healer
half a day's ride to the east.

153
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:57,591
That's heading right back
towards the D'Harans.

154
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,166
We have to risk it.

155
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,106
Chase could die without help.

156
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,997
Track close to the river.
The prisoners will need a water source.

157
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,937
If you're opposed
to Giller's experiments,

158
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:35,396
shouldn't we let the prisoners
remain free?

159
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,525
Without those prisoners, Rahl will have
no reason to journey to Edraan.

160
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:43,011
Our plan depends on their recapture.

161
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,456
Maybe you shouldn't touch him...

162
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,774
at least until we know exactly
what Giller did to you.

163
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,764
I prayed to the Spirits every day
that I'd see Chase again

164
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,041
and now I can't even comfort him?

165
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,717
I know how hard this is, Emma.

166
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,453
Is there anything we can do?

167
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,708
Hopefully this healer
will be able to help Chase.

168
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:16,336
And will he be able to do
anything for me?

169
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,331
Will I be able to hold the man
that I love again?

170
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,869
To kiss him again?

171
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,910
- Stop.
- What is it?

172
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,766
We're not alone.

173
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,392
Are you sure?

174
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,475
Get them out of here.
The D'Harans are close.

175
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,287
Get them!

176
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:23,320
The Seeker.

177
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,822
We're on your side!

178
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,226
You fools.

179
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,668
You just killed the man
who was gonna kill Darken Rahl.

180
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:45,258
Lord Rahl, we've received word
from the Wizard Giller.

181
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:48,217
He wishes you to delay your journey
to the Keep.

182
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,042
He would like more time.

183
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,765
He's had enough time.

184
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,226
Tell him I'll be arriving
as planned.

185
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,778
Rahl's coming here?

186
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:00,903
Tonight.

187
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,765
When the Constellation of Pirion
reaches full alignment,

188
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,445
Rahl will arrive at the Keep.

189
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:09,618
Where he would have been greeted
by my nephew with a dagger to his chest.

190
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,990
I believe he's telling the truth.

191
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,217
What's so important
that would cause Rahl to come?

192
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,291
Rahl thinks Giller
is on the verge of succeeding.

193
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:19,584
At what?

194
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:21,355
Making a Confessor.

195
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,174
That's what he was trying to do
with Emma.

196
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,643
A Confessor's power comes from love.

197
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,596
When Emma kissed Chase,
she unleashed it.

198
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,140
But she didn't Confess Chase.
She nearly killed him.

199
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,894
Giller hasn't succeeded in creating
a Confessor, only aberrations.

200
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:39,813
How is that possible?

201
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:42,576
Giller's uncovered the ancient magic

202
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,568
that was used to create
the first Confessor.

203
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:46,565
The Shurkia?

204
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,219
The Shurkia are magical tools
of immense power.

205
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,704
Rahl has grown
increasingly impatient.

206
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:59,624
If he cannot have the three Boxes,
he wants the power of a Confessor.

207
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,377
And now that Giller has the Shurkia,

208
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,212
Rahl will soon have that power.

209
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,591
He'll be able to bend anyone to his will
with a single touch.

210
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,809
And his dominion over this world
will be complete.

211
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:15,765
Because when Rahl arrives,
I'll be waiting for him.

212
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,107
You can get me inside the Keep.
And I'll kill him.

213
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,250
And you would fulfill the Prophecy.

214
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,572
You won't be able to get near him.
He's too well-guarded.

215
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,779
The one man who could have gotten
close enough to kill him

216
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:35,104
was my nephew.

217
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,913
And our best chance died with him.

218
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:44,163
Maybe we don't have
to get close to Rahl to kill him.

219
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,965
Devlin said the resistance
had captured some Dragon's Breath.

220
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:50,592
Enough to bring down the Keep.

221
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,386
You two can smuggle
the Dragon's Breath inside.

222
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,678
And once Rahl arrives,
we destroy the Keep

223
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,398
along with Rahl, Giller and the magic
used to create the Confessors.

224
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,951
We need Giller alive.

225
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,151
If he used the Shurkia
to put magic into Emma,

226
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,965
he might be the only one
who can take it out.

227
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,008
Well, if we can get you inside

228
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,574
close enough to Confess Giller,

229
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,202
then we can get him out
before we turn the Keep into rubble.

230
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,403
There's only one problem:

231
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,248
Giller ordered me not to return
without the escaped prisoners.

232
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:27,108
If Giller wants prisoners,
we'll just have to give him some.

233
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,477
While we're gone,

234
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,862
Devlin will try to find a healer
and come back for Chase.

235
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,487
I'm coming with you.

236
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:49,985
One prisoner won't fool Giller.

237
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,195
You need a prisoner that he knows.

238
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,651
I'm coming too.

239
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,868
You can't go back there.

240
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:00,662
We have to.

241
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,249
It's the only way.

242
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:09,254
You can't trust that D'Haran
with the lives of my family.

243
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:16,803
- Kahlan will be there to protect them.
- Richard, please.

244
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:22,329
You risked everything
to save this family.

245
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,311
Now it's our turn.

246
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,850
I've brought you your prisoners.

247
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:38,839
Where are the rest of them?

248
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,619
They scattered like rats.
But my men will find them.

249
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:46,124
I don't remember this one.

250
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,170
What's your name?

251
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,936
Your powers won't work on me,

252
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:08,521
Confessor.

253
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,761
Are you all right?

254
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,280
- Take him.
- I'm sorry.

255
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:21,743
I didn't know she was a Confessor.
She must have infiltrated the prisoners.

256
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:24,037
Or she Confessed you.

257
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:26,026
If I were Confessed,

258
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,500
I'd be defending her life right now.

259
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:39,676
Your incompetence has provided me
with an unexpected opportunity.

260
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,972
With a living Confessor, there will be
no more failed experiments.

261
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:46,776
I can finally give Lord Rahl
what he truly wants.

262
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,882
You're only gonna hurt yourself.

263
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,636
I couldn't have my creations
turning against me,

264
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,347
so I devised an elixir

265
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,891
to protect me
from the Confessor's touch.

266
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:30,854
- That's impossible.
- Not with the Shurkia.

267
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:35,228
We'd assumed
they'd been lost forever, but...

268
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:39,339
The shepherd boy chased of one his flock
into the caves of Caddock

269
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:43,900
and uncovered the secret resting place
of the greatest tools in all of alchemy.

270
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:48,516
When word reached me
of this incredible find...

271
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,957
I had to have them for myself.

272
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,018
With the Shurkia,

273
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,299
I've been able to combine magic
in ways I never imagined.

274
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,337
To do things
not done for 3000 years.

275
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,762
Wondrous things.

276
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,626
Like creating a protection
from your Confessor power.

277
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,775
A power
I'll soon be able to harness.

278
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,979
And then, at last,

279
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:15,922
Confessors will be just a memory.

280
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:21,613
You're playing with ancient powers
that you don't understand.

281
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,276
I've seen your creations.

282
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,327
Prisoners infected with dark magic.

283
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,373
That will soon change.

284
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,297
Thanks to those D'Haran butchers,

285
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,167
I've only been able study
the bodies of dead Confessors.

286
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:35,831
But now,

287
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,495
But now, I can use the Shurkia
to harvest your powers

288
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,087
and bestow them on Lord Rahl.

289
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,184
Where are the others?
Where's Kahlan?

290
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,460
- Giller has them.
- What?

291
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:55,980
The Wizard was unaffected
by the Confessor's touch.

292
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,773
- That's impossible.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

293
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,235
It's more of Giller's magic.

294
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:04,022
Your friends are his prisoners now.

295
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,098
- We have to get them out of there.
- That's suicide.

296
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:10,203
The constellation has almost aligned.
Rahl will be here at any moment.

297
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:13,331
- Which is why we have to go now.
- It's too late for that.

298
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,751
- The charges are being set.
- We have to stop it.

299
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:22,470
You are the Seeker.
It is your destiny to kill Darken Rahl.

300
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,648
I won't sacrifice my friends
to do it.

301
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,773
I already sacrificed my nephew
and my men.

302
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,948
Are their lives worth any less?

303
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,921
The Confessor
would want you to do it.

304
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,771
You know she would.

305
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:36,428
Get out of my way.

306
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,336
It is time, My Lord.

307
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,108
I'm so glad you're here, My Lord.

308
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,835
I have something very special
to show you.

309
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:14,412
The Seeker lives.

310
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:21,379
A captured Confessor
is quite a prize, Giller.

311
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,985
Yes, My Lord.

312
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,629
So your elixir works.

313
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,209
Her magic had no effect on me.

314
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,347
You have made more progress
than I thought, Giller.

315
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,851
And you're certain the Shurkia
can harvest the Confessor's powers?

316
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:42,529
Soon her powers will be yours,
My Lord.

317
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,396
The Seeker is alive

318
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,157
and inside the Keep.

319
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,837
We have to get out of here.

320
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,395
But I was supposed to set off
the Dragon's Breath.

321
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,597
- Kahlan told me...
- Kahlan's been captured.

322
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:18,122
She's still here.

323
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,393
We just saved her life.

324
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:25,787
And apparently...

325
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:29,443
you just saved mine.

326
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:41,205
Twice now I've been told
you were dead.

327
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:43,495
Yet here you are.

328
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,554
This is quite an honor.

329
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,429
It's not every day
I get to meet the Seeker.

330
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:00,683
It's not every day
I get to fulfill the Prophecy.

331
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:50,883
It'll take more than Prophecy
to defeat me.

332
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,272
I know how this must pain you both

333
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,348
greatly.

334
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,645
Seeing the one you love
in such misery.

335
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,520
Almost as painful
as sharing an undying love

336
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,235
which you can never consummate.

337
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,294
And what would you know about love?

338
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,820
Except that you will never feel it

339
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,539
from anyone.

340
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:24,573
It's such a pity
you never had a potion

341
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,165
such as this...

342
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:36,710
so that you could feel the soft touch
of your lover's caress.

343
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:39,634
Her tender,

344
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,737
passionate embrace.

345
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:54,208
Being unable to express your love
for each other.

346
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,658
Such a fate is unimaginable.

347
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,630
But when we're finished...

348
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:11,821
your touch will no longer be a threat
to anyone.

349
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:50,890
You have carried the burden
of your powers for so long, Kahlan.

350
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,670
I'm going to lift that burden...

351
00:30:57,244 --> 00:30:58,689
and take it upon myself.

352
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,916
I won't need my powers
to see through your lies.

353
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,738
Kahlan,
if you can really see the truth,

354
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:10,778
you would know that all I want to do
is end my people's suffering.

355
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:19,751
And when I have
the power of Confession,

356
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:22,171
there will be no more war,
no more strife.

357
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,063
Only harmony

358
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,393
and true, lasting peace.

359
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:33,403
You won't succeed.

360
00:31:36,985 --> 00:31:38,454
The people will rise up.

361
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,579
I may be dead, but another Seeker
will take my place and destroy you.

362
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,830
Why kill you

363
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:54,185
when I can turn the Seeker
into a devoted servant?

364
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,403
You'll be the first one I Confess.

365
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,922
- What is it, Giller?
- I don't know, My Lord.

366
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:04,273
The Blood Rage.

367
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:05,789
Run, My Lord!

368
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:17,687
Kill her.

369
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:35,899
Kill him.

370
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:56,095
Kill him.

371
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,126
Release the Seeker.

372
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:19,908
It's me.

373
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:45,267
Are you all right?

374
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,146
- Yeah, I think so.
- What was that?

375
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:57,905
We have to get Emma and Laura
out of here.

376
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,152
Come on.

377
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,019
It's Giller's potion.

378
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,190
There's only one left.

379
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,101
You realize
what we could do with this.

380
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:59,591
The magic was destroyed,
so we can't undo what was done to Emma.

381
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:03,995
This potion will allow you
to be with her without fear for touch.

382
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:08,431
Thank you.

383
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,583
I can never thank you enough.

384
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,379
I'm just happy to see you all together
as a family again.

385
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:22,845
I heard what Darken Rahl said.

386
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:28,166
So I know what you gave up
when you gave the potion to Chase.

387
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:32,768
But maybe someday

388
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:35,771
you'll find a way to be together.

389
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,491
I don't know how to thank you.

390
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:50,661
You should know by now
you don't have to.

391
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:53,216
Darken Rahl knows you're alive now.

392
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:54,748
You're gonna need me with you.

393
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,134
Go with Devlin.

394
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:02,047
The resistance could use your help.

395
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:05,676
And this will give you a chance
to be a husband and a father again.

396
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,844
When the time comes,
I'll know where to find you.

397
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,395
It was a honor to fight
alongside the Seeker.

398
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,230
The honor was all mine.

399
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,570
Some friends of ours passed me
a message for you

400
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:22,943
when I went to get the healer.
From a Ruben Rybnik.

401
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,634
"The weather has not improved.

402
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:34,763
"When it does, I'll seek the company
of dear friends in the woods tomorrow."

403
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:41,809
I have news, My Lord.

404
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:50,776
Our sorcerers have discovered
that the Wizard Zeddicus

405
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:54,101
is using an obscuring spell
to mask our tracer cloud.

406
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:58,165
No more excuses, Egremont.

407
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:01,804
Find the Wizard,
and bring me the Box.

408
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,654
"The weather has not improved."

409
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,297
Zedd must not have been able to get away
from Rahl's tracer cloud.

410
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:14,959
"When it does,

411
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,934
"I'll seek the comfort of dear friends
in the woods tomorrow."

412
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:22,711
Well, he wants us to meet him
in a forest, but where?

413
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:27,244
And it must be close
if he expects us to join him tomorrow.

414
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:30,502
Maybe it's not about when but where.

415
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,984
The Morrow Woods.

416
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:35,895
Where's that?

417
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:37,820
In D'Hara.

418
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:40,520
We have a long journey ahead of us.

419
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:43,191
We can stop if you're tired.

420
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,579
You must be exhausted
after what Giller's magic did to you.

421
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:49,321
I'm not so sure
it was just Giller's magic.

422
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:52,407
What do you mean?

423
00:40:56,444 --> 00:40:58,326
There's a legend of an ancient magic

424
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:01,041
possessed only
by the most powerful Confessors.

425
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:04,836
It's an uncontrollable force

426
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:07,237
known as Con Dar.

427
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:09,841
The Blood Rage.

428
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:12,908
Why did it happen?

429
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,310
Maybe it was because of something
that Giller did to me.

430
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,319
Or maybe it was because of you.

431
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:30,008
I was so afraid

432
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:32,831
that you would become Rahl's slave

433
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:35,222
and your mission would fail.

434
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,869
I couldn't let that happen.

435
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:42,801
Whatever you did, whatever it was,
you saved us both.

436
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:47,963
If you hadn't tried to save me,
Darken Rahl would be dead right now.

437
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:52,584
You had the chance to kill him,

438
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:56,138
but you risked everything for something
that can never be.

439
00:41:57,987 --> 00:42:01,237
Rahl was wrong
when he said our fate was unimaginable.

440
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:02,936
The only unimaginable fate

441
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:05,767
is one without you.

442
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:16,736
And he was wrong
about something else too.

443
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,203
I will fulfill the Prophecy.

444
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:24,833
I'm going to kill Rahl.

445
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,132
And I'm going to do it
with you by my side.
