1
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,195
That spell.

2
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:25,895
It's awakening the dark spirits
that guard this place.

3
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,745
It's a wolf.

4
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:34,190
The Wizard who sold me this scroll
swore it was a spell of opening,

5
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:37,110
- not awakening.
- Maybe the spirits are already awake.

6
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,135
Stop thinking about spirits,

7
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,667
and think about the treasure
that's inside.

8
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:46,128
Gold idols with emeralds
and ruby eyes,

9
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:49,465
a scabbard encrusted
with moon diamonds.

10
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,485
Open it, then. And hurry.

11
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:35,865
Follow me.

12
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,255
Don't be a fool.

13
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:46,975
It's not real.

14
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,895
Let's get those statues.

15
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,385
Idris!

16
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:27,565
Hold the door!

17
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,655
Open the door!

18
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:39,785
Who are you?

19
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,374
1x13 - <i>Revenant</i>

20
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,985
"The Seeker's last battle
had been won,

21
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,598
"but the Seeker
was mortally wounded.

22
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:05,184
"The Confessor knew
that she, too, was dying.

23
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:09,165
"But she had no thought for herself,
only for him."

24
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:17,845
Kieran...

25
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,125
My quest is finished.

26
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,925
And now, Viviane...

27
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:27,885
I am dying.

28
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,544
We die together,

29
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:34,255
as it should be.

30
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:45,685
"Their deaths were witnessed
only by the great Wizard Amfortas.

31
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,195
"He picked up the Sword,
knowing he must keep it hidden

32
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,445
"until the rise of a new Seeker

33
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,184
"who might also be asked to die

34
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,295
"for a glorious cause."

35
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:05,745
It's too bad they couldn't have lived
to see the world they'd saved.

36
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:13,845
But they died
knowing they fulfilled their destiny.

37
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,055
And...

38
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,009
at least they died together.

39
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,679
Soon we'll arrive
at the Crypt of Tavol'Rang,

40
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,223
and you'll see
where the ancient Seeker lies buried.

41
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,860
And there we'll hide
the Box of Orden,

42
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,595
where Darken Rahl
will never find it.

43
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,110
Are you sure the Box of Orn
will be safe there?

44
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:36,405
The outer door is sealed by magic,

45
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:40,446
and I have the only key
to the inner crypt, where Kieran lies.

46
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,935
It's fitting that he will,
for one last time,

47
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:46,645
help protect the world against evil.

48
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:56,725
What is it?

49
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,595
I was thinking.

50
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,145
My quest will end
with the death of Darken Rahl.

51
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,435
Are you worried you won't succeed?

52
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:11,915
No, it's not that.

53
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:13,955
Then what?

54
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,105
The Prophecy says
I will defeat Rahl.

55
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,185
It doesn't say
what will happen to us.

56
00:05:58,895 --> 00:05:59,895
This way.

57
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,435
Hey, look.

58
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,735
It's the story from the book.

59
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,628
It's the Sword of Truth.

60
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,905
It's hard to believe
this is the same sword.

61
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:34,977
It's more than just a story.

62
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,365
This is it.

63
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,865
The inner crypt where Kieran lies.

64
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:16,715
Would have liked to have known him.

65
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:20,773
Ancient Seeker,

66
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,692
you once defeated those
who would enslave the Midlands.

67
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,361
We ask you to keep this box safe

68
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,315
and aid us once again.

69
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,741
Take the box, Richard.

70
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,005
Place it inside with Kieran.

71
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,464
Where are his remains?

72
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,730
There's nothing here.
No bones, no burial cloth.

73
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,205
I don't derstand.

74
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:54,515
This key has been held only by Wizards
since the day Kieran was buried.

75
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,585
Something's not right.

76
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:07,055
Zedd. The door.

77
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,955
It's sealed itself.

78
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,937
We have sprung some sort of magical trap
when we opened the sarcophagus.

79
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,608
We need to find another way out.

80
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,778
Wandering around blindly
may get us into even worse trouble.

81
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:53,385
Worse than being trapped alive
in an ancient tomb?

82
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,525
What was that?

83
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,125
Maybe this wasn't some magical trap.

84
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:06,086
Maybe we're not alone in here.

85
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,305
Someone's crying.

86
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,275
Richard, be careful.

87
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,725
Who's there?

88
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,833
Apparently, it's not as hard to get in
as it is to get out.

89
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:48,895
Stop!

90
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:00,945
Where are you?

91
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,885
Kahlan, wait!

92
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,065
Stay where you are.

93
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,595
Wait for me.

94
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,245
I'm right here.

95
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,465
Then who was I following?

96
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,445
Who are you?

97
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:42,935
What do you want?

98
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,075
Don't follow her.

99
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,575
She's crying.

100
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,085
She needs help.

101
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,165
How did she...?

102
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,565
She's not of our realm, Richard.

103
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:09,965
She's a spirit.

104
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,547
I thought spirits spent eternity
in the underworld.

105
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,695
Most spirits are content
in the underworld,

106
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,985
reunited with the people
they loved in life.

107
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:23,557
But sometimes
they have unfinished business.

108
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,185
She was wearing a Confessor's dress.

109
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,646
Maybe she was Viviane's spirit?

110
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:33,608
Viviane helped Kieran
complete his quest. She died with him.

111
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,685
What unfinished business
would she have?

112
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,215
Maybe she's trying to tell us.

113
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,455
There's a door here.

114
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:52,210
- Maybe she tries to show us a way out.
- Can you open it?

115
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,927
Stop!
Don't open it!

116
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,475
Stay back.

117
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,010
You don't know what you're doing.

118
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,564
The door must not be opened!

119
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:27,905
Who are you?

120
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,855
Why did you attack us?

121
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,583
I came to steal treasure.

122
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:35,003
I didn't believe
the tales of evil spirits

123
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,475
until I found myself
possessed by one.

124
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,980
- That light that left you...
- It was a spirit

125
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,845
who has owned me
for five long years.

126
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:49,726
He forced me to attack you
to keep you from opening the door.

127
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:50,977
Why?

128
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:55,357
This place is full of great evil.

129
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,192
Get out.

130
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,611
Get out while you still can.

131
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:10,122
We are dealing
with more than one spirit.

132
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:11,770
One led us to this door,

133
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,595
the other tried to kill us
to keep us from opening it.

134
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,965
It could be a way out.

135
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,735
Restless spirits are unpredictable.

136
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:22,800
I've heard stories of the spirits
of mothers, lonely for their children,

137
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:26,510
- leading them to their deaths.
- But Viviane was a Confessor.

138
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,920
Even as a spirit,
she'd never harm a Seeker.

139
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:30,745
We should open the door.

140
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,053
I don't know.

141
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,397
What choice do we have?
There's no other way out.

142
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:31,155
It's an ancient language.

143
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,095
The same as
The Book of Counted Shadows.

144
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,305
It says...

145
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,178
"Here lies Kieran,

146
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,035
"the True Seeker."

147
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,710
Why would his body be hidden away
in a plain casket

148
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,593
when a sacred crypt
was built just for him?

149
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,304
We don't know for certain
that his body is even in there.

150
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,005
Let's find out.

151
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:55,115
Richard, don't.
You don't know what's in there.

152
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,375
Someone's cut off his head.

153
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,283
Why?

154
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,505
This is a Wizard's spell.

155
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:14,990
These magical bindings

156
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,333
keep the spirit from moving to its final
resting place in the underworld.

157
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,127
So he's never been reunited
with his family? His loved ones?

158
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,600
That must be why Viviane walks here.

159
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,340
That's why she was crying.

160
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,490
Because her Seeker is trapped here.

161
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:29,960
She can't be with him.

162
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:33,473
She's been waiting for a thousand years
to be reunited with him.

163
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,118
We may wait wither
for the next thousand years,

164
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:37,644
if we don't find a way out.

165
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,689
I think this is our way out.

166
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:46,196
Maybe Viviane trapped us here
because she wanted us to help Kieran.

167
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,534
And maybe, once Kieran's free,

168
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,240
she'll free us too.

169
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,785
Undoing another Wizard's magic
is a violation.

170
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,094
So is beheading a Seeker.

171
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,457
Kieran gave up everything
for his quest.

172
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,836
His spirit should be with his father,
his mother, his Confessor.

173
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,353
The people he loved,
not trapped here alone in the dark.

174
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:13,340
I agree, it's terrible. But Wizards
don't do things like this lightly.

175
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,141
Who knows what will happen
if we unbind him?

176
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:18,268
We can't leave him like this.

177
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,216
Alone.

178
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,395
Think of everything he's sacrificed.

179
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,684
I sincerely hope I don't end up
regretting this.

180
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,271
As I destroy these bindings,

181
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,716
so shall the spirits be free.

182
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:45,075
As this cloth is consumed by flame,

183
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:51,645
so shall the bindings release.

184
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,880
Can you hear me, boy?

185
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,750
I'm fine.

186
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,144
Are you sure you're not hurt?

187
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,268
Then let's see if that door is open.

188
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:48,393
Not yet.

189
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,166
Kieran's spirit is free,
but his body is still hidden.

190
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,789
Like something shameful.

191
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,905
We need to return him to the crypt.

192
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:05,917
When the road you walk is dark,
may you always see the light ahead.

193
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,745
May you always remember
that you do not walk alone.

194
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,420
Now that Kieran is laid to rest,

195
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,146
let us hope

196
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,235
our task here is done.

197
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,793
Lead the way.

198
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,446
What are you doing?

199
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,245
It's not Richard anymore.

200
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,206
It's Kieran.

201
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:49,711
Fight this.

202
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,753
Fight this spirit
that possesses you.

203
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,999
He can't hear you anymore.

204
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,639
Richard freed your spirit,
and this is how you repay him?

205
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:03,926
I'm taking back

206
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:07,029
what that Wizard Amfortas
stole from me a thousand years ago.

207
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,690
What are you talking about?

208
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:15,820
He didn't understand the bond

209
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:18,364
between Confessor

210
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:19,991
and Seeker.

211
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,207
And he betrayed me.

212
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,667
Viviane must leave us.

213
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,462
- Why?
- There is too much between you.

214
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:34,005
I see it in your eyes.

215
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,675
- You love her.
- We've done nothing wrong.

216
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:39,236
Yet.

217
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,554
I have watched the two of you
growing closer.

218
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,305
Viviane has become a distraction.

219
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:46,893
And it's putting your quest
in jeopardy.

220
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,564
I swear I will remain true
to my quest.

221
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,484
But you must swear
you won't send her away.

222
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,655
Swear it.

223
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:03,515
I swear.

224
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,839
But Amfortas lied to me.

225
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,709
Just as you lied to him.

226
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,587
I'm a Confessor.

227
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,420
I can see that you did love Viviane.

228
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,883
What if I did?

229
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,639
My feelings for Viviane

230
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:24,463
weren't going to keep me
from my quest.

231
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,806
But Amfortas wouldn't trust me.

232
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,842
Viviane. Wait.

233
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,609
- Where are you going?
- Amfortas

234
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:39,946
thinks it's too dangerous for me
to stay at your side.

235
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,055
How could he?

236
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,534
He swore he wouldn't send you away.

237
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,714
He says you think more of me
than you do of your quest.

238
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:52,003
- We belong to each other.
- We never can.

239
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,585
And you know why.

240
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,932
Because your love would enslave me?

241
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,039
There's no harm you could do to me.

242
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,536
I would already do
anything that you ask,

243
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,035
because I am already yours
to command.

244
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:32,144
She gave in to her passion,

245
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,848
and you were Confessed.

246
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:37,602
She violated her most sacred duty:

247
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,492
to protect the Seeker.

248
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:46,217
Our love only strengthened our bond.

249
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:49,782
But Amfortas thought as you did,

250
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,714
and was determined to destroy us.

251
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,939
What you did was wrong.

252
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,778
What you're doing now is wrong.

253
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,300
You have to release this Seeker.

254
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,390
Release him?

255
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,284
Why would I do that?

256
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:11,232
What good does it do you
to possess his body

257
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:13,156
when Viviane is only a spirit,

258
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,459
waiting for you to join her
in the underworld?

259
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:24,513
Stay back.

260
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,170
You won't do anything to hurt me.

261
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,526
You hurt me, you hurt your Seeker.

262
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,077
I have no intention of joining Viviane
in the underworld.

263
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:52,639
I have a body now.

264
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:05,800
Once I finish with this Grace,

265
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,376
Viviane will have a body too.

266
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:11,483
Yours.

267
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,009
Stay back, creature,

268
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:51,099
or I'll blast you back to
whatever dark hole you came from.

269
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,806
If you do that,

270
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,479
you, your Seeker and your Confessor

271
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:59,270
will be trapped in this tomb
for all eternity.

272
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,566
Who are you?

273
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:05,735
I am the spirit of Amfortas,

274
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,238
Wizard to Kieran.

275
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,407
Though your Seeker killed this body,

276
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:15,036
I've used an ancient spell of awakening
to occupy it once more.

277
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,803
But I only have a thousand heartbeats
before it dies again.

278
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:21,042
So listen to me.

279
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,295
- Can you open this door?
- Not until you listen to me.

280
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:28,382
I'm the one that tried to stop you
from unbinding Kieran's body.

281
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:30,613
Why?

282
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,969
Because the story you know of Kieran

283
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:34,909
is a lie.

284
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,173
How did you come
to learn this magic?

285
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,859
Maybe you don't know
as much about Seekers as you thought.

286
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:50,488
One thousand years ago,

287
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,854
Kieran and Viviane did the worst thing
a Seeker and a Confessor could do.

288
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:58,824
They consummated their love?

289
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:02,066
And it ruined Kieran.

290
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:06,211
He let Count Alrawn, his greatest foe,
slip through his fingers

291
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,589
because he thought only
of protecting Viviane.

292
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,762
I need to protect my Seeker.

293
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:11,986
My Confessor.

294
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,757
- Now open this door!
- You must listen to me!

295
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:19,881
I went to Viviane and made it clear

296
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:23,063
she had a terrible decision to make.

297
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:25,575
He is unsure in battle.

298
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,849
He thinks of nothing but you.

299
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:30,111
You must release him.

300
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:34,866
You know what you're asking?

301
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,987
There's only one way
to release a Confessed man.

302
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,570
The Seeker
cannot fulfill his destiny

303
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:48,129
as long as you are alive.

304
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,625
And she defied you.

305
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,672
The Seeker remained Confessed

306
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,978
and failed his quest because of it.

307
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,917
Viviane knew her duty.

308
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:14,649
Viviane, where are you?

309
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,465
Viviane, what have you done?

310
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,436
What I had to, Kieran.

311
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:33,296
I will wait for you

312
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,075
in the underworld.

313
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:42,656
You can't leave me.

314
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,909
You have betrayed me, Amfortas.

315
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:02,828
I will never stop loving Viviane.

316
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,055
Or hating you.

317
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,905
I have never seen a look
full of such loathing.

318
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:11,963
But we had a quest to complete.

319
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:16,095
I thought once Kieran
was no longer under Viviane's control,

320
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,345
his grief would fade
and he would come back to himself.

321
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,684
But he didn't.

322
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,332
A normal man,

323
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:26,852
freed from his Confessor, would return
to his former as if nothing happened.

324
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,313
But a Seeker and a Confessor

325
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:31,659
have a special bond.

326
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:34,819
It's stronger
than even I could fathom.

327
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,114
And even Viviane's death
couldn't break it.

328
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,426
It was as if Kieran's soul
had been torn from him,

329
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,869
leaving nothing but anger and hate.

330
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:48,338
- When he took up the Sword again...
- The Sword of Truth feeds on rage.

331
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,259
It made his anger grow.

332
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:54,534
It overtook him.

333
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,899
It drove him mad.

334
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:04,911
These people weren't soldiers!

335
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:07,436
You have betrayed innocents!

336
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:09,395
This world has no innocents.

337
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,843
You have betrayed your quest.

338
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,151
You have tarnished
the name of Seeker!

339
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,653
And you took everything from me.

340
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,997
Viviane and I won't be kept apart.

341
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,853
Even if you kill me,
you won't stop me.

342
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:31,923
I must.

343
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:34,462
I will.

344
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:46,110
I feared Kieran's vow,

345
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,712
that he wouldn't rest even in death.

346
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:54,638
I realize he might prey
on the spirits of the underworld,

347
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,894
destroying the peace
they'd found in life.

348
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,363
So I had to bind his spirit.

349
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,995
If you had allowed his spirit
to reunite with Viviane's,

350
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,744
then Kieran would have found peace
and none of this would be happening.

351
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,222
If you hadn't unbound Kieran,

352
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:12,214
Kieran wouldn't be trying
to reunite with Viviane now,

353
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:13,542
in the flesh.

354
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:57,753
My love.

355
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:05,154
He's using Kahlan's body
as a vessel.

356
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,768
Richard will be Confessed.

357
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,832
He'll become a monster,

358
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,608
just like Kieran.

359
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,762
Finally, what the Wizard stole from us
is ours forever.

360
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:26,848
I have enough power left to cast a spell
that will keep him here,

361
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,118
in the crypt forever.

362
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,443
You can't do that.

363
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:34,821
Without the Seeker,
Darken Rahl will conquer the world.

364
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,447
- Thousands will die.
- And how many will die

365
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:39,899
if Kieran's wrath is unleashed
upon the world again?

366
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:43,466
Then let me into the tomb, I will drive
Kieran's spirit from Richard's body.

367
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:47,518
And if you cannot?

368
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,187
Are you willing to kill your Seeker?

369
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,071
This is wrong.

370
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:08,879
We can't do this.

371
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,832
We sacrificed our love once.

372
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:14,981
We deserve to be happy.
Together.

373
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,446
You said you would wait for me,
and you did.

374
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:24,882
We're finally together.

375
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,857
We can't throw this chance away.

376
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:31,013
Richard is more
than just the Seeker to me.

377
00:31:31,453 --> 00:31:32,953
As was Kieran to me.

378
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,610
I loved him.

379
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:36,557
Protected him. Taught him.

380
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:38,312
So I hesitated.

381
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:43,059
Cause I loved him, that hesitation led
not only to the loss of innocent lives,

382
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,294
it led to the loss
of Kieran's soul too.

383
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,873
You led a Wizard to my hiding place,
where Amfortas had bound me.

384
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:54,277
Why would you do that,
if you didn't want us to be together?

385
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:57,172
I only did that
so that he would free your spirit

386
00:31:57,907 --> 00:32:00,217
so we could be together
in the underworld.

387
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,633
Our love is beyond flesh.

388
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,752
That is a lie

389
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,870
that the Wizard told us,
so we would be content

390
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,576
live without something
everyone else takes for granted.

391
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:14,049
But this Confessor, this Seeker,

392
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:15,882
they have a destiny too.

393
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:18,727
A destiny that is destroying them
just as it did us.

394
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,023
They love each other.

395
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:24,905
I know you can f

396
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,267
This will be a way

397
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,725
for them to be together too.

398
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,447
I've wanted to touch you
for so long.

399
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:40,958
And I've missed you.

400
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:42,354
So much.

401
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,878
This is all that matters.

402
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,839
We're all that matters.

403
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:54,763
If you tell me you don't love me,
I will release you.

404
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,969
Tell me you don't love me.

405
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,407
That you don't want me.

406
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,999
I can't tell you that.

407
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:27,272
The door to the outside world
is open.

408
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,235
If you aren't willing to do your duty,
Wizard, then leave.

409
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,436
I will do my duty as First Wizard.

410
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,228
Now let me in!

411
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:40,790
You said you could open it.

412
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:43,724
This body is weakening.
I'm not strong enough.

413
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,279
Maybe

414
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:47,728
if you join me...

415
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,630
Remember what happened to Kieran.

416
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:17,883
Death is not the worst fate
that can befall a Seeker.

417
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,046
Stay away, Wizard.

418
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:40,030
Your Seeker and Confessor are gone.

419
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,593
Stop!
What are you doing?

420
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,955
This time, the story is going to end
the way it's supposed to.

421
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,670
I won't let you kill him.

422
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,715
Don't make this Seeker lose everything
for a love that is not even his.

423
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:01,001
And what about my love for Kieran?

424
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:04,513
Go back to the underworld,
and let Kieran follow you there.

425
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:09,026
I trusted Amfortas, and I've waited
in the underworld for a thousand years.

426
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,186
- Alone.
- That won't happen this time.

427
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:15,190
You'll bind him again,
and we'll never be together.

428
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,346
I left him once.

429
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,648
I'll never leave him again.

430
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,420
Amfortas was right about one thing.

431
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,672
A Confessor can be replaced.
The Seeker cannot.

432
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:43,974
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'll do anything to protect the Seeker

433
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:46,151
including killing his Confessor.

434
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,656
I will drive Viviane from this body,
and I will bind her spirit

435
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,394
so that you will never meet again,
in this world or the next.

436
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:53,645
Please.

437
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,939
Then leave Richard's body,

438
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,275
and I will allow Viviane to follow you
to the underworld.

439
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,907
- Why should I believe you?
- Because I am not Amfortas.

440
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:07,784
I believe a Seeker and a Confessor
belong together.

441
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:10,208
In the underworld,

442
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,957
you and Viviane can exist in peace.

443
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:15,626
But you can't be together here.

444
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:19,429
Your only choice is to trust me,
Seeker.

445
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:31,683
Then this time, Viviane,

446
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,062
it is I who will be waiting for you
in the underworld.

447
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,342
You're free, Viviane.

448
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,213
Go find him.

449
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:03,924
Thank you.

450
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:51,553
Well, obviously, we can't leave the box
in this cursed place.

451
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:56,773
The story of Viviane and Kieran,
the one that's in the book,

452
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,156
it's been handed down
for a thousand years,

453
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:00,633
passed off as truth.

454
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,816
Maybe it was a necessary lie.

455
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:04,234
People need a hero.

456
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,862
So the legend can be preserved,
no matter what the truth is?

457
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:10,073
I won't judge Amfortas
for changing the story.

458
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:13,415
It's a great responsibility
to name a Seeker.

459
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:16,580
One mistake can send him
spiraling into darkness.

460
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:20,250
When Kieran possessed me,
I sensed that darkness.

461
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:25,093
And there was something else.
Something I've never felt before.

462
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:26,708
A power.

463
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:29,509
- Magical power.
- Kieran had magic,

464
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:32,888
- strong enough to draw a Grace.
- How could he do that?

465
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:46,647
It's Rahl.

466
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:50,582
- I don't understand.
- It's a tracer cloud.

467
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,818
Powerful magic.

468
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:54,659
He's tracking us.

469
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,370
I don't think it's us
he's focused on.

470
00:40:58,499 --> 00:40:59,956
It's the Box of Orden.

471
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,257
I'll cast a spell of obscuring.

472
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,056
Following the box
won't be such an easy task for him now.

473
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,202
Where will we take it?

474
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,647
Not we. I.

475
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,274
You can't go off on your own.

476
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:30,499
I won't allow the box to be the beacon
that leads Rahl to Richard.

477
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:37,536
I'll rejoin you once I hide it.

478
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:38,995
Where?

479
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,998
It's safer if only I
know the answer to that.

480
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:44,835
I'll find you
once the box is hidden.

481
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,171
I don't need to tell you both,

482
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:50,048
be careful.

483
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:03,895
I don't like it
when Zedd goes off by himself.

484
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,941
He's willing to take the risk
for the sake of your quest.

485
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,778
In the crypt,
he was ready to sacrifice you.

486
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,521
He was just doing what he had to,

487
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,474
to keep us from becoming
like Viviane and Kieran.

488
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:20,888
That won't happen.

489
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:24,051
They probably thought
the same thing.

490
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,460
But in that moment of weakness,
they lost everything.

491
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:30,046
Well, we're stronger than they were.

492
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,139
I hope you're right.

493
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:36,992
Love isn't something to fear.

494
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:40,982
For me it is.
