1
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,207
Mistress Denna.

2
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,026
General Nass.

3
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,782
I wish I could say
this was a pleasure.

4
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,075
The Seeker has been tracking me,

5
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:39,063
trying to get his hands
on the Box of Orden.

6
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:40,834
He must be stopped.

7
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,545
You command
an entire legion, General.

8
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,110
Surely you can kill one man.

9
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:49,334
I have received new orders.

10
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:52,432
You are to capture the Seeker.
And train him.

11
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,530
I thought Lord Rahl
wanted the Seeker dead.

12
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,892
Lord Rahl's plans have changed.

13
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,984
1x08 - <i>Denna</i>

14
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:09,525
Sync: Kasius

15
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,055
Wait.

16
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,151
We're being followed.

17
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,327
Are you sure?

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,379
You can't help him.

19
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:32,249
Or yourself.

20
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,037
Why?

21
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:46,652
Kahlan, wake up.

22
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,782
It was just a dream.
Everything's fine.

23
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:53,952
It was just a dream.

24
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:00,643
I killed you.

25
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,205
Good thing it was just a dream.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,020
What if it wasn't?

27
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,749
What are you talking about?
What else could it be?

28
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,122
A premonition.

29
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,635
- You're not going to kill me.
- But the Prophecy...

30
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:20,473
- Shota said I would betray you.
- You know what Zedd thinks of her.

31
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:24,331
- We can't trust her. She's a witch.
- A very powerful witch.

32
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,009
One who knows what's written
on the halls of Prophecy:

33
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,859
"The One in White
will betray the Seeker."

34
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:37,290
You could never do
anything to betray me, ever.

35
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:40,065
It goes against
everything you believe in.

36
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,869
I'm a danger to you.

37
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,261
I know we haven't known
each other long,

38
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,404
but in my whole life,

39
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:54,214
there's no one
that I've trusted more,

40
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:57,373
cared about more.

41
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,673
I...

42
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:11,390
You what?

43
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,600
- This isn't right.
- Why not?

44
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,865
You don't understand.

45
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,534
You're right, I don't.

46
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,696
This?

47
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,394
This can never be.

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,659
There are two roads to Briamont.
We should approach from the south.

49
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:15,484
I'm not coming with you.

50
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,780
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,303
It's too dangerous for me
to be near Richard.

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,431
Is this because of what that she-devil
Shota told you about some Prophecy?

53
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,935
I know you think Prophecy
can be averted. You tried to do it

54
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,715
when you took Richard into Hartland.

55
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,024
But it didn't work, did it?

56
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:39,687
Forget what I believe.
You can't abandon Richard.

57
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:41,835
I'm not abandoning him,

58
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,713
- I'm protecting him.
- From what exactly?

59
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,715
You were right.

60
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,544
I do have feelings for him.

61
00:04:58,093 --> 00:04:59,393
Last night, I...

62
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:03,219
I almost lost control
of those feelings.

63
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:07,128
If I hadn't stopped myself,

64
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,909
Richard would've been lost forever.

65
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:13,729
- The Prophecy would've been fulfilled.
- But you did stop yourself.

66
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,868
Maybe next time I won't be able to.

67
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,610
You're stronger than that.
You'd never let that happen.

68
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,238
Not on purpose, no.

69
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,076
But how am I to know
how the Prophecy will come to pass?

70
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,860
I could betray him
because of a spell or a trick.

71
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,138
All I know is the Prophecy
cannot be avoided.

72
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:40,407
All I know is that the Seeker
needs his Confessor.

73
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:41,757
I've thought of that.

74
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:46,471
Most Confessors have gone into hiding
since Rahl's been hunting us.

75
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,479
A Confessor I know
has taken refuge in a settlement

76
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,309
a couple days from here.

77
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,313
You took an oath.

78
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,523
I know. But there are other ways
that I can help Richard.

79
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,809
I'm not giving up on him
or his mission.

80
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,780
But I can't stay by his side.

81
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,033
Your feelings for Richard
are what make you afraid, child.

82
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:12,920
And I can't imagine how hard it must

83
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,082
never to have
what ordinary young people have.

84
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,529
But Richard is strong too.

85
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:21,291
And if you tell him the truth,
he'll understand.

86
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,633
And you'll find a way
through this maze, together.

87
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,286
I know Richard.

88
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,813
If he knows how I feel about him,
he won't let it go.

89
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,238
He'll follow me,

90
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,758
try to convince me
that there's a future for us,

91
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,270
but there isn't.

92
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,616
That's why he can never know
how I feel about him.

93
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,654
Promise me.

94
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,157
What's going on?

95
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,394
You can't go. I need you.
Zedd needs you.

96
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,405
Every minute I stay,
I'm a danger to you.

97
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,497
I'd be dead right now
if it weren't for you.

98
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:00,339
You may be dead soon,
or worse, if I stay.

99
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,214
Worse than dead?
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:10,069
This has something to do
with what happened last night.

101
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:14,641
Confessors may be good at reading people
but you're not good at lying.

102
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm sorry I kissed you.
I won't don't it again if it upset you.

103
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,276
But you kissed me back.

104
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:27,714
That was a mistake.

105
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,356
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have the same feelings for me

106
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,744
that I have for you.

107
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,857
I don't have any feelings for you.

108
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,103
And I never will.

109
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,757
- How could you just let her go?
- What would you have me do?

110
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,846
- Spin a wizard's web around her?
- You could've at least taken my side.

111
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,396
There's something
you're not telling me.

112
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,460
Lesson 18, Seeker:

113
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:04,552
Keep to the path ahead,
not the road behind.

114
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,245
Richard, behind you!

115
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:27,736
Mord-Sith.

116
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:32,900
Richard, we can't fight them.
We have to leave now!

117
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,847
Don't use the Sword!

118
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,007
Get the old man.

119
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,686
We've lost the Wizard.

120
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,465
We have what we came for.

121
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,671
You may call me Mistress Denna.

122
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,075
Are you tired?

123
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,578
Tell me where my friend is.

124
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,414
When you're asked a question,
you'll answer.

125
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:46,697
Are you tired?

126
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:49,135
Would you like to sleep?

127
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,216
I'm not even gonna close my eyes
till I get out of this place.

128
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,461
Then you'll be a very weary boy.

129
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,429
Because what I have planned

130
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,980
is going to make you beg me
for the respite of a warm bed.

131
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,686
Tell me where my friend is.

132
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,493
The Wizard is dead.
I killed him myself.

133
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,960
You're lying.

134
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,790
You've never encountered
a Mord-Sith before, have you?

135
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:29,005
We can capture and control

136
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:31,838
any form of magic
that's directed at us.

137
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,294
That's why your friend

138
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:37,232
tried to warn you
not to use your Sword.

139
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,962
I turned its power against you.

140
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:45,193
And then, I burned your friend
to the ground

141
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:47,585
with his own Wizard's Fire.

142
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,377
Does it upset you to learn this?

143
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:56,898
Not really.

144
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:00,033
The old man
was getting on my nerves anyway.

145
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,677
Now who's the liar?

146
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,867
Those belonged to the other men
I've trained.

147
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,823
It's an honor to add the Sword of Truth
to my collection.

148
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,473
I wouldn't grow too fond of it
if I were you.

149
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:23,286
It's just that sort
of rebellious attitude

150
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,601
that's made you something
of a problem for Lord Rahl.

151
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,521
Rahl's days are numbered.

152
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,400
He was going to kill you,

153
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,655
but now, in his wisdom, he sees
that this would only make you a martyr.

154
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,270
Perhaps turn even more people
to your misguided cause.

155
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,124
So instead, he's given me the honor

156
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,831
of training you.

157
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,403
No one's gonna train me.

158
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,833
Did you not feel my Agiel?

159
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,774
The harder you fight,

160
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,684
the more painful
its magic will become.

161
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:07,453
And after I've finished
training you with it,

162
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,424
you'll do anything to please me.

163
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:12,467
Anything.

164
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:17,005
And nothing will please me more

165
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:19,359
than to see the Seeker,

166
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:23,464
stand at the gates
of the People's Palace,

167
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,886
and there, before the multitudes,

168
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,106
take the hand of Lord Rahl

169
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,466
and pledge his undying love

170
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,088
and fealty to him.

171
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,639
I'm going to take that Sword,

172
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,803
and I'm going to kill him with it.

173
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:46,222
After I kill you.

174
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,466
I do enjoy a challenge.

175
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,661
Shall we begin?

176
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,815
What is your business here?

177
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,580
I'm looking for a friend.
She lives in the village.

178
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,624
This "friend," who is she?

179
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:16,332
My friend is very fond
of white roses?

180
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,110
You're a friend of Lara's.

181
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:23,801
- Welcome.
- It's an honor to be asked,

182
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:27,823
but I don't know if I'm ready
to be Confessor to the Seeker.

183
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,977
I have faith in you, Lara.
You can do this.

184
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,504
I've made so many friends here.

185
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,817
The villagers, the past few years,
they've come to depend on me

186
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,703
to guide them in their affairs,
keep order.

187
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,739
I will give them
whatever help they need.

188
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,999
Then I would be honored
to serve the Seeker.

189
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,216
Saved some rainwater.

190
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,547
I'm Benedict.

191
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,171
Why are they keeping you prisoner?

192
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:44,716
My daughter.

193
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,719
I was asleep in my bed

194
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,608
when those D'Haran animals broke in.

195
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,674
They took me
and my youngest, Mariel.

196
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:57,839
- She's only 8.
- She's here?

197
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,524
She's in another temple.

198
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:03,012
She's undergoing the Trials.

199
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,864
If she lives through them,
they'll turn her into a Mord-Sith.

200
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:11,952
- But she's only a child.
- That's how they create these monsters.

201
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,971
They kidnap young girls
from their families,

202
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,248
punish them mercilessly

203
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:21,473
until there's not a shred of kindness
left in them.

204
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,138
Then they teach them dark magic

205
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,540
and how to use it to torture,

206
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,063
in the service of Darken Rahl.

207
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,766
My daughter's final test
will be to kill me.

208
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,230
To prove she's one of them.

209
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,485
Maybe we both can't escape.

210
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:52,200
But if I can keep them busy,
you might have a chance.

211
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,339
You don't even know me.

212
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,746
Why would you do this?

213
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:02,772
Why did you give me your water
when you had so little?

214
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:06,098
I know how difficult this is.

215
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:10,802
It's not easy for me, either.
I consider all of you family.

216
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,378
But the Seeker needs my help.

217
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,731
Kahlan has come to take care of you.

218
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:22,239
You will all honor and obey her,
as if she were me.

219
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,953
We will do as you say, My Lady.

220
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,663
Why are these people
kneeling before you?

221
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:42,584
You must tell the truth.

222
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,588
Have you used your power
to confess them?

223
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,479
I have confessed them all.

224
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:02,960
You turned them into slaves.

225
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:05,685
And commanded them
to ignore their fears.

226
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,808
They drove the D'Harans
out of the village.

227
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:12,051
I gave them a purpose,
strength to defend their homes,

228
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:14,658
- rebuild their lives.
- And become your obedient servants.

229
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,619
I didn't do this for myself.
I did it to help them.

230
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:20,797
Are you sure?

231
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:24,319
No part of you enjoys
making these people worship you?

232
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,752
Do anything that you ask?

233
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,016
This man, Raph,

234
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,465
have you taken him as your lover?

235
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:34,135
And how many have you confessed?

236
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,271
That is different.

237
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:40,705
I've confessed enemies in battle,
to protect the Seeker and his mission.

238
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,480
And only when it was
absolutely necessary.

239
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:47,148
Who are you to tell me
what I did wasn't necessary?

240
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,526
I did what I thought was right.

241
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,370
These people are safe now,
they're happy.

242
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,741
- Lara!
- It's all right. He's a friend.

243
00:17:57,595 --> 00:18:00,328
- What is it? What happened?
- Richard's been captured

244
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,094
by the Mord-Sith.

245
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,395
Get up!

246
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:20,974
Run!

247
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,004
Go!

248
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,248
What are you waiting for?

249
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:38,408
Mistress.

250
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,290
You didn't really think Benedict
would leave us, did you?

251
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,165
We're practically family.

252
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,699
I would never betray you, Mistress.

253
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,903
I told him
everything you said I should.

254
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:53,631
So everything you told me
about your daughter was a lie?

255
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:55,818
That's all true.

256
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,571
But now after being here with us
these past few months,

257
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,915
Benedict realizes
what an honor it is

258
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,142
to have his daughter chosen
to be Mord-Sith.

259
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,936
- Don't you, Benedict?
- Yes, Mistress.

260
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,812
You planned this?

261
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:10,064
Why?

262
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,943
To show you the futility
of trying to resist me.

263
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,582
You surprise me, Seeker.

264
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,350
You could have run, might have
even made it to the main gate.

265
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,707
But you gave up
your one chance at freedom,

266
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:37,153
all for a child you'd never met.

267
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,385
Why?

268
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:42,965
To keep her from becoming like you.

269
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:48,895
Mord-Sith will torture him
within an inch of his life.

270
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,037
And when they're done,
he'll do whatever they command:

271
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:53,328
lie, murder.

272
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,863
They could turn him
into a pawn of Darken Rahl.

273
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,362
Richard will resist.

274
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,822
He'll fight the pain, yes.

275
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,200
But their Agiels can break any man.

276
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,327
Not even Richard
can hold out against them.

277
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,746
I couldn't even try to defend him.

278
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,692
They would've taken my powers
and turned them against me.

279
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,110
And without my magic,
I'm just an old man in a robe.

280
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,297
There must be a way to save him.

281
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,315
I followed the Mord-Sith
back to their temple.

282
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:22,862
There are dozens of D'Haran guards.
We don't have the men

283
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:25,431
- to overwhelm their defenses.
- I can get you the men.

284
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:29,435
- Absolutely not.
- What do you mean, no?

285
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,475
She's confessed
everyone in the village.

286
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,484
What?

287
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:38,069
You heard what the Mord-Sith
will do to the Seeker.

288
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:42,464
- We'll save him some other way.
- What other way is there?

289
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:46,036
You asked me to take up your mission
to protect the Seeker.

290
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,311
- That's what I'm offering to do.
- You're offering.

291
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,090
Not the people
you'd be ordering into battle.

292
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:53,815
They'd have no choice.

293
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,900
If we have any chance
of saving Richard,

294
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,813
we have to go now.

295
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,690
I know what you're doing.
Trying to use your mind to escape.

296
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,367
Everybody tries it.

297
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,109
But it won't work.

298
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,363
Because even your thoughts
belong to me.

299
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,575
Can you tell what I'm thinking now?

300
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:35,305
If I...

301
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:39,421
touch you here with the Agiel,

302
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,671
your heart will stop.

303
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,245
Now tell me,

304
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,524
who were you with?

305
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,877
Rahl wants me alive,

306
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:52,001
you said so yourself.

307
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,276
If you kill me,

308
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,991
imagine what he'd do to you.

309
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,939
It's called the Breath of Life.

310
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,716
It's used to revive those
who die during training.

311
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:48,688
I was dead?

312
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,427
For a few minutes.

313
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,776
You were nearly a permanent resident
of the underworld.

314
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:58,527
Now you know

315
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:01,756
not even death
will end your torture.

316
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:07,620
The Agiel

317
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,349
is so much more than a weapon.

318
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,020
When I stopped your heart with it,

319
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:15,992
it left a part of me

320
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,362
here.

321
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,801
Our hearts,

322
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:23,264
our minds are becoming one.

323
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,775
Soon your only thought will be,

324
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,699
"How can I please my mistress?"

325
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:35,495
Then everything will be
so much easier for you.

326
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:38,916
I won't have to hurt you anymore.

327
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,910
Would you like that?

328
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,121
But first, you have to tell me,

329
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:50,452
who were you thinking of?

330
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,738
Her name is Kahlan.

331
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,008
Kahlan

332
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:01,522
Amnell.

333
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,736
You're in love with her.

334
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,205
Has she confessed you?

335
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,598
Is that why you love her?

336
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,248
Kahlan would never do
anything to hurt me.

337
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:24,253
And she would never need magic
to make me love her.

338
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:27,105
She didn't tell you.

339
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:29,948
Tell me what?

340
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,720
If you and Kahlan
were to be together,

341
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,347
even once,

342
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,641
her power would be unleashed.

343
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:41,372
It would overwhelm you
and destroy your soul.

344
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,765
You would be her slave forever.

345
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,694
That's not true.

346
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:53,241
You never wondered
why she didn't return your feelings?

347
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:56,890
A noble, brave young man
like the Seeker,

348
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,289
so pleasing to the eye of any woman?

349
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:10,190
<i>This isn't right.
This can never be.</i>

350
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:16,055
I can't believe your Wizard friend
never warned you.

351
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:19,547
<i>None of that, boy.</i>

352
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:22,019
<i>It can never be.
Not with her.</i>

353
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,359
I don't want to see you
suffer anymore.

354
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,600
I have other duties to attend today,

355
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:39,115
so Constance will be training you.

356
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,247
And she's very brutal.

357
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,276
So I want you

358
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,086
to create a refuge in your mind,

359
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:48,283
as you did before.

360
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:52,087
But you told me
not to think of Kahlan.

361
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,857
I want you to think of me.

362
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:34,338
I did what you told me.

363
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,384
I wasn't with her.

364
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:38,342
I was with you.

365
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:40,572
You did well.

366
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,223
But there's still a part of you
that's defiant.

367
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,626
You're thinking,

368
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,868
if you grab my Agiel,

369
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:01,895
you might be able
to fight your way out.

370
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:04,547
Go ahead.

371
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:06,247
Pick it up.

372
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,040
After withstanding so much,

373
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,819
I won't deny you the chance.

374
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,207
I just wanted you to understand

375
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:33,614
that an Agiel causes constant pain
to anyone who it touches,

376
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,764
even the person who wields it.

377
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,363
Well, if it hurts you...

378
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:47,106
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,532
Don't be.

380
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:53,026
Pain is the one experience common
to every living thing.

381
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:55,194
It unites us.

382
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,882
Mord-Sith are taught to use pain,

383
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,951
to channel it,

384
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:02,591
control it,

385
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,266
just as you are learning.

386
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,742
The Mord-Sith and the D'Harans
are fearsome.

387
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:15,822
But their swords and dark magic
cannot break the love that bonds us.

388
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,729
The battle tonight will be ours.

389
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:22,135
We will free the Seeker.

390
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,310
We will do as you bid, My Lady.

391
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:28,093
I can't let these people
be slaughtered.

392
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:31,751
They'll fight without fear.
The advantage is ours.

393
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,036
You're ordering them into battle

394
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:36,881
against trained D'Haran soldiers
and Mord-Sith.

395
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,623
Because they have no fear doesn't mean
they won't be outmatched and killed.

396
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:44,388
When that happens, any hope
of saving Richard dies with them.

397
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,974
How else do we get Richard out?

398
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,780
If I can find a way to talk
to Richard, get through to him,

399
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:54,005
remind him that he's the Seeker,

400
00:28:54,437 --> 00:28:58,235
- maybe we can find a way out, together.
- And what if he's already broken?

401
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:02,198
Maybe I can get close enough to kill
the Mord-Sith who's been training him,

402
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,658
break her hold over him.

403
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:07,434
One hour.

404
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:09,205
That's all I ask.

405
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,030
If I don't come back by then...

406
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:18,881
May the Spirits protect you, child.

407
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:32,144
Mistress Denna, would you allow
Constance to train me tomorrow?

408
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:38,536
Why are you asking for Constance!?

409
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,825
You prefer her touch to mine?

410
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:47,731
Obviously I've been too easy on you!

411
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:52,302
Why do you ask for her?
Answer me.

412
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,643
Because it hurts you
to use the Agiel.

413
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,046
I don't want you to suffer any more
because of me.

414
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:14,187
I've never known
anyone like you, Seeker.

415
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:21,109
There's someone at the main gate.

416
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:23,654
Send them away!

417
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:25,661
It's a Confessor.

418
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:39,031
You must be Kahlan.

419
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:42,163
Richard's told me all about you.

420
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,298
Apparently he was in love with you.

421
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:47,136
But not anymore.

422
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,102
I can see why.

423
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,850
You're not quite as impressive
as I'd imagined.

424
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:57,219
I have a hundred men
in the hills ready for battle.

425
00:30:57,344 --> 00:30:59,441
They're preparing
to strike this temple.

426
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,549
My scouts tell me that there are
only two dozen men in the hills.

427
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,488
And they're not fighters,

428
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:08,031
they're common villagers.

429
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:12,453
They're not common at all.
Every one of them has been confessed.

430
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,581
They'll fight to the death
to save the Seeker.

431
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,871
If they attack, many will die.

432
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,294
Maybe even you.

433
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,494
I want to avoid bloodshed.

434
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,627
I know how powerful you are.

435
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,278
All I ask is to talk
to the Seeker alone.

436
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,340
To say goodbye.

437
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,565
My scouts also observed

438
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,151
another Confessor on the hill.

439
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,112
And from what Richard
has told me about you,

440
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,066
you would never use your power
to enslave innocent villagers.

441
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:55,432
It must have been
the other Confessor.

442
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,672
So all I need to do is kill her,

443
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,419
and the spell on her followers
would be broken.

444
00:32:30,686 --> 00:32:32,895
You made a wise choice, Richard.

445
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:35,872
I'm very proud of you.

446
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,053
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:57,762 --> 00:33:01,762
I didn't want to hurt you, but
Denna's archers would have killed you.

448
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,856
We have to get you out of here.

449
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:07,067
I don't know if I can leave.

450
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,620
I'm losing myself to Denna.

451
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,698
I tried to fight,
but her magic is too strong.

452
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,437
Most of the time,
I can't even think.

453
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:18,871
I do anything she asks me to.

454
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:23,682
- You can resist her.
- She's going to make me stand with Rahl

455
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,707
and swear allegiance to him.

456
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:28,827
- You'd never do that.
- I might do worse.

457
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,183
I can't defy her,

458
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,011
especially when she's near me
with her Agiel.

459
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,297
If she orders me to kill you,

460
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,935
I might not be able to stop myself.

461
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:45,984
I know you.

462
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,720
You're strong enough.

463
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,107
There might be a way.

464
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,449
Tell me.

465
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:57,618
Confess me.

466
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:05,597
- Richard I can't confess you.
- You have to.

467
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,693
- I'd destroy everything that you are.
- Denna's already doing that.

468
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,229
If you confess me, I can fight her.

469
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,259
I'd rather be your slave than hers.

470
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,763
You can fight her without magic.
Look inside yourself.

471
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:19,013
I have.

472
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:23,018
But when I do,
I don't see myself anymore.

473
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:24,863
I only see her.

474
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,850
Please!

475
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:31,258
You have to!

476
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:34,356
Shota was right.

477
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:36,353
You have betrayed me.

478
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,492
I betrayed you by leaving.

479
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,121
If I'd have stayed with you,
none of this would've happened.

480
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:51,117
- How much longer?
- Patience.

481
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:54,179
We gave her what she asked for.
It's been an hour.

482
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:56,027
She's not coming back.

483
00:34:57,566 --> 00:35:00,116
I want you
to take your men to the left.

484
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:04,268
After them!

485
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,385
My Lady...
don't be afraid.

486
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,255
Where are you going?
The Seeker still needs our help!

487
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:36,966
The Confessor is dead.

488
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,845
Her poor slaves have been
freed from bondage.

489
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:43,015
There's nobody left
to fight for you.

490
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:45,600
Before you're executed,

491
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,657
you'll be trained by me.

492
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,742
Rest assured,
your training will be slow

493
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,757
and agonizing.

494
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:57,918
Of course,

495
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,702
Richard can save you this torment

496
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:03,625
by granting you a merciful death,

497
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:06,705
and proving to me, once and for all,

498
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:09,416
that his training is complete.

499
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:11,345
Kill her.

500
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:16,508
Do it now.

501
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,740
Do it now.

502
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,184
Kill her.

503
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,158
Richard, this isn't you.

504
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:47,579
- I can't.
- Then watch her suffer!

505
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,652
End her pain, Richard.

506
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:20,181
How did you...?

507
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:25,854
You taught me how to withstand pain.

508
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,618
We need to get you out of here.

509
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:18,291
There's something
that I need to tell you.

510
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,583
Denna told me.

511
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,090
Is it true?

512
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:32,044
Do you know what it was like

513
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,212
hearing it from her?

514
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,755
Why didn't you tell me?

515
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:45,708
I was afraid that if I told you
the truth, you'd become scared of me.

516
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:48,138
Your feelings would change.

517
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:52,225
Well, why would you care
if my feelings changed?

518
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,550
You told me you didn't share them.

519
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:00,077
Like you said...

520
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,709
I'm not a very good liar.

521
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,859
- So now what?
- I'm not sure.

522
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:16,628
But I do know

523
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,211
I'm not leaving your side again.

524
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:22,562
What about the Prophecy?

525
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:28,261
I can't think of any worse betrayal

526
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,987
than leaving you.

527
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:35,564
Maybe the Prophecy's been fulfilled.

528
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,027
But Richard...

529
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:42,655
your mission
is far more important than

530
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:44,793
any feelings we may have.

531
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:47,812
That's why we...

532
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,590
We can never act on them.

533
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:53,718
We can never let our guard down.

534
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,936
We have to bury them.

535
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,637
Can you do that?

536
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:07,637
If there's one thing
I learned from Denna...

537
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,639
it's how to suffer in silence.

538
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:26,827
Mistress!
