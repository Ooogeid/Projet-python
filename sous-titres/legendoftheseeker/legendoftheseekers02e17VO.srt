00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:28,270
(Monk)
Your friendship and service
over these many years

7
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,239
have been a blessing to me,
Matthew.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,675
I shall miss you.

9
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,577
My Lord, I fear the Keeper.

10
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:38,013
Your faith in the Creator
will protect you.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,350
( gasping )

12
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:46,422
Farewell, old friend.

( <i>melancholic theme playing</i> )

14
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:55,030
My Lord, it won't be
safe here for long.

15
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,699
Matthew was loyal,
but not strong.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,235
He will not withstand
the torments of the Underworld.

17
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,572
He will reveal our hiding place
to Darken Rahl.

18
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:06,709
We always knew that one day
we might be discovered.

19
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:12,514
And if that day is today...

20
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,850
let it be today.

21
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,355
(Rahl)
Welcome to the Underworld,
Matthew.

22
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:22,024
It's so wonderful to see you
again after all these years.

23
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,792
You always were

24
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,029
one of my father's
favorite servants.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,633
So tell me,
where is the old man now?

26
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,102
You killed your father
years ago.

27
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,170
He must be here,
in the Underworld.

28
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,574
Yes, I did kill my father
years ago.

29
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:40,242
So imagine my surprise

30
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:42,444
when I myself arrived
in the Underworld

31
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,047
and discovered
that he was not here.

32
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:52,588
But then I remembered
that many of his retinue

33
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:55,858
fled the palace
shortly after I killed him.

34
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,095
I can only conclude that you
somehow revived my father

35
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,697
and then spirited him away.

36
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:04,133
I...

37
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,068
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:16,478
Father once left me
in your charge. Do you remember?

39
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,114
It was the day
we found my pet kitten

40
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,383
dead in the gardens.

41
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:25,988
When you saw those maggots
squirming out of its eyes

42
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,357
you almost fainted.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,396
( screams )

44
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,632
Now, where is my father?

45
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,867
( <i>eerie theme playing</i> )

46
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,275
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

47
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:51,780
Hello, Thaddicus.

48
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,649
What do you want?

49
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,419
What I want is what I believe
you want as well.

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,155
To bring death to the man
who murdered your father.

51
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,858
The man who murdered my father
was your father,

52
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,126
and you killed him years ago.

53
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,829
Somehow my father
cheated death,

54
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,966
just as he cheated everything
and everyone in life.

55
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:14,103
Now I have finally discovered
where he has hidden himself

56
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:16,138
all these years.

57
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,240
Unfortunately, as I am a spirit,

58
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,743
I myself cannot kill him again,

59
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:24,613
but I thought you might want to.

60
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:28,450
Even if I did want

61
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,119
to ram a dagger into
that bastard's heart,

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
why are you coming to me?

63
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:34,523
I'm not powerful enough to-to
kill someone like Panis Rahl.

64
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:38,560
No, but your brother is.

65
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,230
Well, why don't you go to him?

66
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,365
Because the great Zeddicus
will not listen to anything

67
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,900
that comes from me,

68
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:49,371
but maybe if he were
to hear it from family...

69
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,306
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

70
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,476
(Richard)
This is the longest the compass

71
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:56,278
has ever pointed
in one direction.

72
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,447
Who would ever have dreamed
that the Seeker

73
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,549
could go 12 days
without stopping

74
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,919
to save helpless children
or distressed farm animals.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,522
Perhaps it's a sign that we're
nearing the Stone of Tears.

76
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:07,723
(Cara)
And then what?

77
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,458
We use the Stone to close
the tear in the veil.

78
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,692
But how?

79
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,032
Hm.
My point exactly.

80
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,201
For three months

81
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:22,237
we've been going after
this mysterious Stone,

82
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,806
but none of us
has the slightest clue

83
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:27,643
what we're actually supposed
to do with it once we find it.

84
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,614
Richard has succeeded
at every task laid before him.

85
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,883
When the time comes,
I believe fate

86
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:36,752
will provide him
with the answer.

87
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,353
( bushes rustling )

88
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:43,592
( sighs )

89
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,861
Thaddicus.

90
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:48,730
Good to see you too, brother.

91
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,299
How did you find us?

92
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,303
Our old friend Sebastian
made me one of his maps.

93
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:57,172
Charged me for it too,
the scoundrel.

94
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,210
I need to speak with you.

95
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,011
Alone.

96
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,280
For 24 years no one's seen
hide nor hair of Panis Rahl

97
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:06,982
and now you know
precisely where he is?

98
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:10,285
Oh, of course, how could
an old fool like Thaddicus

99
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,587
know anything so important?

100
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:14,456
Uh, let me tell you, Zedd,
I'm a man of the world.

101
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:17,025
I travel, I trade,
I meet people, I hear things.

102
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,127
You've never been able
to deceive me, Thaddicus,

103
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,729
so don't try now.

104
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,165
How did you learn
about Panis?

105
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,601
Darken Rahl appeared to me.

106
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:28,070
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

107
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:30,472
And you take that demon
at his word?

108
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,507
For all we know, he might
be trying to lure me away

109
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,142
from Richard
for some nefarious purpose.

110
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:35,177
I don't think so.

111
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,979
He wants Panis dead
as much as we do

112
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,382
and this might be our only
chance to avenge Father's death.

113
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,654
Even if you're right,

114
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,789
Richard may be close to finding
the Stone of Tears.

115
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,857
I can't leave his side.

116
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:52,261
Zedd, we swore an oath.

117
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,997
(Young Zedd)
<i>Father?</i>

118
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,865
Thaddicus?

119

( sobbing )

120
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,636
( <i>melancholy theme playing</i> )

121
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:14,583
Where have you been
all these months?

122
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,385
You were supposed to be here.

123
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:19,321
You could have protected him.

124
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:22,057
What happened?

125
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,259
He was murdered.

126
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,928
By Panis Rahl.

127
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:29,164
No.

128
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:30,599
No, that's impossible.

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Are you calling me a liar?

130
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,568
I saw it with my own eyes.

131
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,405
Saw what exactly?

132
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:39,141
I came home to see you
and Father arguing.

133
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:40,943
You said it yourself.
I haven't been home.

134
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,946
If for once you'd listen to me
you'd understand!

135
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:48,283
<i>You and Father were arguing.</i>

136
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,686
<i>I couldn't hear what</i>
<i>you were arguing about, I--</i>

137
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:54,923
<i>I didn't want to intrude.</i>

138
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:59,361
<i>And then suddenly</i>
<i>you drew a knife</i>

139
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:02,164
<i>and began stabbing Father.</i>

140
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:03,632
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,900
I would never stab Father!

142
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,635
Then shut your mouth
and listen!

143
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:12,507
I should have tried to stop it.

144
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,710
I should have tried
to help Father.

145
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:18,213
<i>I couldn't.</i>

146
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:21,950
<i>But then I saw it--</i>
<i>It wasn't you.</i>

147
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,753
<i>It was Panis Rahl.</i>

148
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:28,423
<i>Only he'd disguised</i>
<i>himself as you.</i>

149
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,826
Father died...

150
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,463
thinking I killed him?

151
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:35,764
Zedd...

152
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:40,669
swear that no matter
what happens,

153
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,905
no mattew how far apart
life takes us,

154
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:47,609
we will never rest
until we drive this dagger

155
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,277
into Panis Rahl's heart.

156
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,918
We promised each other, Zedd.

157
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,654
Yes.

158
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:01,289
Yes, and we owe it to Father.

159
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,226
But Panis is too dangerous.

160
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:06,461
I'll go alone.

161
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,764
Please, Zedd.

162
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,099
While Father was being killed,

163
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,201
I just stood there
like a trembling lamb

164
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,636
and did nothing.

165
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:18,173
Don't make me do nothing now.

166
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,175
You're leaving? Why?

167
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,010
It's a family matter.

168
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,111
Zedd, I'm family.

169
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:25,313
If something's wrong,
I want to help.

170
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:28,583
Nothing's wrong that Thaddicus
and I can't manage on our own.

171
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,154
I'll catch up with you as soon
as we settle our business.

172
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,856
Business. What business?

173
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:37,826
It's nothing
to concern yourself with.

(Thaddicus)
Sorry you had to leave Richard.

177
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,951
It isn't that.
Richard is well-protected

178
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,019
by Kahlan and Cara.
I was just thinking

179
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,588
that none of this
would be necessary

180
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,122
if only I'd listened
to Father.

181
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,691
( crying )

182
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,564
Darken Rahl,
future lord of D'Hara!

183
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:11,734
He has your eyes,
my lord.

184
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:14,003
Zedd.

185
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,176
You have been
such a loyal friend.

186
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,178
And you've already done
more for me

187
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,114
than any man has a right to ask,

188
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:28,784
but would you do me the great
service of teaching my son,

189
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,620
just as your father taught me?

190
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,490
I would be honored.

191
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,264
Now relax, my friend,
and enjoy yourself.

192
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,165
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

193
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:08,024
What are you doing here, Father?

194
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:13,262
The great Wizard,
Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander,

195
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:16,265
bought for the price
of a harlot.

196
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,468
I haven't been bought
by anybody.

197
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,870
Panis is my friend.

198
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:25,241
Oh, yes, Panis Rahl was a great
friend of mine as well,

199
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:28,978
until I refused
to teach him magic.

200
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,981
Then he set about finding
a new friend.

201
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,983
In your day, Father,

202
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,953
D'Hara was a land
of gentle farm folk.

203
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:39,956
Now it is darkened
by the smoke of war.

204
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:43,059
Magic is necessary
to protect all of us

205
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,494
and most especially our king.

206
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:49,231
So it's true.
You have taught Panis magic.

207
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,935
I'm only teaching him
to use the magic

208
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:55,338
that already runs
in his bloodline.

209
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,708
There is a reason why the magic
in the Rahl bloodline

210
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,143
has been dormant
since they assumed the throne.

211
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,279
Our ancestors
made sure of it.

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,881
Because no king
should ever possess

213
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,483
both earthly and magical powers.

214
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,720
Together they create
an unstoppable force

215
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,489
that can only produce tyranny.

216
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,592
Panis will not be able
to resist the temptation

217
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,062
to dominate everything
and everyone in this world.

218
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,330
But he trusts me.

219
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,466
I will be able
to teach him

220
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,869
to use his magic
wisely and justly.

221
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,772
Zeddicus, you know nothing
of this family,

222
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,175
or what it will become if you
continue to do their bidding.

223
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:37,713
So now you have the power
to see into the future?

224
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,785
Come home with me now,
Zeddicus.

225
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,220
Before it's too late.

226
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:50,526
My place is here, Father.

227
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,395
I'm not going anywhere.

228
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,265
( guests chattering )

229
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,802
Carracticus.

230
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,705
My old teacher.

231
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:06,142
I've missed you.

232
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,811
Oh, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

233
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,147
but on the occasion
of the birth of my son,

234
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,484
can't we put that aside and
share a drink like old friends?

235
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:20,189
You may have seduced my son

236
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,124
into believing your lies...

237
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,462
but I know
exactly what you are.

238
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,965
And I will do whatever it takes

239
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:34,703
to end the tyranny
of the House of Rahl.

240
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,240
(Zedd)
<i>Father was right about</i>
<i>the future of the Rahl dynasty.</i>

241
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,542
If I'd listened to him,

242
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:41,544
I would have been home
the night he was murdered.

243
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,646
I would have been
able to stop Panis.

244
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,183
You had important business
the night he died.

245
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,051
That's what I told you then...

246
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:52,354
<i>but it wasn't true.</i>

247
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,290
Bad news?

248
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,159
From my father.

249
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,894
What does he say?

250
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:04,066
He apologizes
for barging into the palace

251
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,570
and disrupting
your celebration.

252
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,241
Then he begs me to come home.

253
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:15,878
Says he wants to me peace.

254
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,315
The times have passed
your father by, Zeddicus.

255
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:20,783
He was once a great man,

256
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,686
but now he's just
holding you back.

257
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,622
Yes.

258
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:32,294
But he is still my father.

259
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,763
And he does love me.

260
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,268
If he wants to make peace,

261
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,071
maybe I should hear
what he has to say.

262
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,207
You're right.

263
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,143
A man should make peace
with his father.

264
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,944
Go to him.

265
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,045
Be with him.

266
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,148
And while you're there,

267
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,483
tell him I would also
like to make peace with him.

268
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,087
I'll return as soon as I can.

269
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,788
Have a safe journey.

270
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,728
I'll tell Princess Ariana
you can see her next time.

271
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:08,497
Princess Ariana is here?

272
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:12,234
Yes. That's what I was
coming to tell you.

273
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:16,438
Apparently, she grew quite
fond of you on her last visit.

274
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,475
As I did of her.

275
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,510
Doubly unfortunate, then,

276
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,179
that she's only here
for one night.

277
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,149
Perhaps she's worth
a short delay.

278

<i>My important business</i>

279
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,888
was bedding a a young beauty.

280
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,457
I was so blinded
by lust for power,

281
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,792
as well as for Princess Ariana,

282
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,696
that I-- I didn't see
how Panis was deceiving me.

283
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,131
Well, brother,

284
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,934

a chance to pay him back.

If Zedd doesn't want
to be found, we won't find him.

I just wish
he'd ask for our help.

289
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,381
Richard, whatever business
Zedd's attending to,

290
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,218
it's clearly private.
We have to respect that.

291
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:06,722
He'll catch up with us
when he's ready.

Just the person
I've been looking for.

299
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:43,425
The Creator herself
must have brought us together.

300
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:44,660
Why is that?

301
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,363
So that I can--
I can join you on your quest.

302
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,166
I'm letting my enthusiasm
get the better of me.

303
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,468
Forgive me.

As difficult as it will be

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,348
to succeed without you,

309

But thank you for your interest.

No, no, no. No, you-- You--
You don't understand.

312

After a lifetime of scholarship,

313
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:19,528
I have finally made a discovery
of vital importance.

314
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,932
Hidden inside
the Winding Wall of Valdaire

315
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,868
is an ancient scroll.

316
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,773
It instructs the bearer
of the Stone of Tears

317
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,708
how to use it

318
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,677
to seal the rift
to the Underworld.

319
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:38,280
Seeker, without my help,

320
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,581
you will never find the scroll,

321
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,351
your quest will fail,

322
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:47,189
and the world of the living
will come to an end.

( <i>dramic theme playing</i> )

324
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,793
Am I the only one who
finds it a little suspicious

325
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,995
that we were just
asking ourselves

326
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:00,930
what we should do
when we find the Stone,

327
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,333
and suddenly
a mysterious man shows up

328
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,835
saying he knows where
the instructions are?

329
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,071
Zedd did say,
when it was time,

330
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,606
fate would provide
Richard the answer.

331
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,875
Maybe this is how.

332
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,480
We appreciate your help,

333
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,549
but if you told us
where this wall is,

334
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,950
we could find the scroll
ourselves.

335
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,120
Well, I wish that were possible,
but it's not.

336
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,123
Long ago, the Order of Ulrich

337
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:29,859
was assigned to protect
the scroll.

338
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,495
One of the monks sealed it

339
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,799
inside the Winding Wall
for safekeeping.

340
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,367
He spelled the niche

341
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:42,038
so that it could only be opened
using a secret code.

342
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,308
But the key to the code
was lost,

343
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,976
seemingly forever.

344
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:49,012
Until now.

345
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,482
Using fragments
of the monk's papers,

346
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:56,152
I have painstakingly
created this lexicon.

347
00:17:56,153 --> 00:18:00,623
And with this,
I have deciphered the code.

348
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:02,325
Well, then you can
teach it to me.

349
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:04,127
We haven't the time.

350
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,329
The Keeper's forces

351
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,332
grow stronger every day.

352
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,902
Seeker, I-I am aware of the fact
that I am now an old man,

353
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:15,371
and I do not wish
to burden you,

354
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:20,009
but you need this
and you need me.

355
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:24,080
(Thaddicus whispering ):
Let's go.

356
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,349
Calm down.

357
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,984
What do you mean,
"calm down"?

358
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,319
Panis is in there.

359
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,653
Yes, and he's guarded.

360
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:32,655
(Thaddicus)
They're just monks.

361
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,693
( clattering )

362
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:41,397
Armed monks who protected
the evil tyrant

363
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,734
all these years.

364
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:47,337
Stay close behind me.

365
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:52,308
( monks screaming )

00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,484
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

367
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,526
Now, let's find Panis.

368
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:15,331
( grunts )

369
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:23,273
Did you think you could
hide forever, Panis?

370
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,474
( grunts )

371
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,042
That's for our Father.

372
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,453
It's not him.

373
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:39,355
What are you talking about?

374
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:49,699
He used the magic I taught him
to trick me again.

375
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,341
How are we going to find
Panis now?

376
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,410
We'll search
the monastery.

377
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:03,846
There must be some clue
as to where he was going.

378
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,883
(Rahl)
Let me save you
the trouble, Wizard.

379
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:11,554
After everything
you've done,

380
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,589
all the death and destruction
you've caused,

381
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,158
you think I'd listen
to a word you'd say?

382
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,961
For once our interests
are aligned,

383
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,662
yet all you can do
is dwell on the past?

384
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:21,798
Really, Zeddicus,
that's rather petty of you.

385
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,701
If our interests were aligned,
you wouldn't have led us here

386
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:26,336
to murder the wrong man.

387
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:30,273
Oh, I had no idea my father
was gone from this place.

388
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,408
As I am unable to walk
among the living,

389
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:34,944
I can only know what I am told
by the recently dead.

390
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:39,248
Fortunately, your vengeful
rampage has provided me

391
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,217
with a fresh supply of souls.

392
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,019
I've already tortured one
into telling me

393
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,521
where my father went.

394
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:49,225
We'll take no more
direction from you!

395
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:51,060
Then you won't want
to know that Panis

396
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:54,197
has disguised himself
as a kindly, old scholar,

397
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:56,933
and that he has gone
to find his other son,

398
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:59,936
my brother, your grandson.

399
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,405
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

400
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,408
(Richard)
Did you ever doubt

401
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,477
that you would learn
the secret code to Valdaire?

402
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,113
No. No. My only doubt

403
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:12,582
was that I'd live
long enough to find you,

404
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,051
but when I last checked,
my heart was still beating.

405
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,919
( both chuckling )

406
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:22,091
How about you, Richard?

407
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,926
Do you ever have any doubts

408
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,628
about the success
of your own quest?

409
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,997
Sometimes.

410
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:32,602
You have already saved the world
from Darken Rahl.

411
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:36,839
And by doing that, I opened up
a rift to the Underworld.

412
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,541
And now things
are worse than before.

413
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,210
Richard.

414
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,513
You succeeded once.

415
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:46,582
You will succeed again.

416
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:51,587
I hope you're right.

417
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,326
Think of it this way.

418
00:21:57,327 --> 00:22:01,998
How many men
get to save the world

419
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,567
with the woman they love
by their side twice?

420
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:10,740
Sounds like something
my father would say.

421
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:14,911
He must have been a wise man.

422
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:19,315
What about you, Horace?

423
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,750
Do you have a family?

424
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:25,488
Two sons.

425
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:27,790
Are they scholars too?

426
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,928
No, no.

427
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,164
No, they took
very different paths.

428
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:36,732
Do you get to see them often?

429
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,139
One of them is dead.

430
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,175
I'm sorry for your loss.

431
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,210
Oh, don't be.

432
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:49,812
He led a tragic life.

433
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,415
What about your other son?

434
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:04,827
He and I...

435
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,262
we're not close.

436
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:11,100
But I couldn't be
more proud of him.

437
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,174
Horace, wake up.

438
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,676
Oh. Oh, I've overslept.
I am so sorry.

439
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,411
I'm ready to go.

It's all right, Horace.

( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

451
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:56,679
Zedd, there must be a mistake.
This man is a scholar.

452
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,614
He's taking us to a place
where we can find out

453
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,750
what we're supposed to do
with the Stone of Tears.

454
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:03,719
He can disguise himself
however he wants.

455
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,689
There's no mistake.
He's Panis Rahl!

456

That can't be.

457
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:13,930
Zedd is telling the truth,
Richard.

458
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:17,233
I am a scholar,

459
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,835
but I am also Panis Rahl,

460
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,070
your father.

( <i>dramatic theme swells</i> )

Give me one reason

why I shouldn't
let Zedd kill you right now.

I know how this must appear,

465
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,684
but everything I have told you,

466
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,786
except for my name, is true.

467
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,707
Twenty-four years ago,

468
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,677
I renounced my former life.

469
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:49,148
I took the oaths
of the Order of Ulrich.

470
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:51,150
Since then,

471
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:56,555
I have led an austere life
of prayer and study.

472
00:24:56,556 --> 00:25:00,359
I sought not only to uncover
the secrets of Valdaire,

473
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,795
but also to atone

474
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:05,564
for my many and terrible sins.

475
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:07,467
Don't listen to his lies,
Richard.

476
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:10,471
(Panis)
I am not lying.

477
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:12,573
If I had come to you
in the guise of a man

478
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,908
that the world only knows
the worst side of,

479
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,576
you'd never have
trusted me.

480
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,378
Forty years ago,

481
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,347
he charmed me into
teaching him the magic

482
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,648
he used to kill my father

483
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,850
and now he's
to trick you, Richard.

484
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:28,224
I did use the magic Zedd taught
me to kill his father.

485
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:34,328
And that was just a
terrible mistake.

486
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:40,201
I have been doing pepenance
for it ever since.

487
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:42,404
But at the time

488
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,574
I thought I had no choice.

489
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:48,711
Before you allow him to kill me,

490
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:51,682
and thus end all chances
of finding the scroll,

491
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:56,985
allow me tell you
what happened and why.

492

If you have something to say,
say it.

00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,125

All those years ago,

494
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:06,162
there was was an awful set
that I kept from you, Zedd.

495
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:12,231
( crying )

496
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:14,903
Your son's illness
is not natural, My Lord.

497
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:17,104
The fever has been caused

498
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:18,105
by a terrible curse

499
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,405
cast from afar.

500
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:21,640
A curse?

501
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:25,945
Yes. And one that could only
have been sent by a Wizard.

502
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:28,347
Carracticus.

503
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:31,984
Send for Zeddicus.

504
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:34,787
He may be able to save your son.

505
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,456
No.

506
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:41,894
Let him die.

00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:45,564
(Panis)
<i>I let the disease</i>
<i>run its course</i>

508
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:49,301
and the child soon expired.

509
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:54,740
But I had a Mord-Sith
revive him,

510
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:58,811
and my son was soon alive
and healthy again.

511
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,213
My father may have been
a difficult man,

512
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:02,448
but he was no baby-killer!

513
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:04,984
(Panis)
That's what I thought.

514
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:08,053
But who else could have done it?

515
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:11,123
I decided I would
ask him myself,

516
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:14,426
but knowing that he would
never tell me the truth,

517
00:27:14,427 --> 00:27:18,063
I decided to disguise
myself as you.

518
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:23,936
Zeddicus.

519
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:25,471
Oh. I'm so glad
you've come.

520
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:30,342
Did you cast a curse upon
Panis Rahl's infant son?

521
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:33,279
Is he dead?

522
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,448
No. By luck, he survived.

523
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:38,751
How could you do
such a monstrous thing?

524
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:41,053
I'm sorry that I had to do it,

525
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:43,122
but I'm even sorrier
that I failed.

526
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:45,257
Have you lost your mind?

527
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:55,301
The great witch Shota
came to me with a prophecy

528
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:59,004
that Darken Rahl would grow up
to kill his own father

529
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:03,275
and become the most brutal
tyrant the world has ever known.

530
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,413
Now the baby's life
has been threatened.

531
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,882
Panis will spare no effort
to protect him.

532
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,920
Everything depends
on you now, Zeddicus.

533
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:18,157
You're the only one
who can get close enough.

534
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:20,860
You must go back
to the palace

535
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:23,495
and, horrible as it sounds,

536
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,564
you must kill Darken Rahl.

537
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:29,535
I'm not going to kill him.

538
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:30,669
I'm going to kill you!

539
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,504

<i>to protect my family.</i>

544
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,393
I knew you would come
looking for vengeance.

545
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:57,763
I sealed myself
in my palace with my son.

546
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:00,599
That's just a story you
made up to justify your crime.

547
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,201
The real reason
you killed my father

548
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:03,969
is because you feared him.

549
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,605
He was the only man
strong enough

550
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:08,307
to end the tyranny
of the House of Rahl.

551
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:10,476
Oh, Zedd,
if it had been about power

552
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:12,111
I would have found
some way to kill you.

553
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:14,213
But I didn't.

554
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:16,081
Why?

555
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:19,285
Because, old friend,
I loved you.

556
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:24,957
And I love you still.

557
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:30,296
Killing your father
was a terrible mistake.

558
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,332
He was right.

559
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,967
I should have killed my son.

560
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:37,169
If I had done so,
I would have spared the world

561
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,239
all the-the pain and the misery

562
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,408
and the evil that
he has brought into it.

563
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:50,416
Zedd, you know how hard it was
for me to become a father.

564
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:55,654
I could not sacrifice
my first-born son.

565
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,893
But I decided
I would correct my mistake

566
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:03,729
by siring a child

567
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,731
who would destroy Darken Rahl.

568
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,040
That child was you, Richard.

569
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,210
Now, I beg you, son,

570
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:20,579
please,

571
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,982

Your Sisters slumber
so peacefully

576
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,740
while the Keeper wages war.

577
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:52,177
Say the word
and I'll rouse them.

578
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:55,947
The Mother Confessor
and the Seeker

579
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:58,617
are on their way
to the Winding Wall of Valdaire

580
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:01,520
in search of an ancient scroll.

581
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:02,754
You and your Sisters

582
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,656
are to get there
before they arrive.

583
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:07,559
Lie in wait,
but do not attack

584
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,662
until the Seeker
finds the scroll.

585
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:14,266
Once he has it,
I want you to steal it.

586
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,768
Why do you want this scroll?

587
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,703
It contains
secret instructions

588
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:20,705
for the bearer
of the Stone of Tears.

589
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,674
If the Seeker
has this scroll,

590
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:24,709
he will defeat the Keeper.

591
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,613
Then I will get the scroll
and destroy it.

592
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:30,316
No. Once you've
taken the scroll,

593
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:34,356
it is the Keeper's wish that
you protect it with your life.

594
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:37,726
When you've gotten it safely
away from the Seeker,

595
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:41,095
I will come and tell you
what to do with it next.

596
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,503
Oh. Yes, one more thing.

597
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:51,105
There is an aged scholar
traveling with the Seeker

598
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:53,506
I've sent the wizard Zorander
to kill him

599
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:56,908
but if for some reason
the Seeker prevents

600
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,077
the Wizard from killing
this old man,

601
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:02,547
I want you to make
sure that he dies.

602
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,085
My sisters and I
will leave no survivors.

603
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:09,220
Consider it a victory

604
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:12,691
if you manage to kill
the old man and get the scroll.

605
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:16,461

to pay for the crime

of killing your father.

May the taking of my life
bring you some measure of peace.

have been carrying
the same burden of remorse.

If either of us
had listened to Father,

none of this evil would
have ever come to pass.

not the tearing of the veil.

Why didn't you ever tell me that

Maybe because all of the evil
we've been fighting for so long

is my fault.

Because you wouldn't
listen to your father?

Or anyone.

686
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:58,130
The first lesson my father
ever taught me

687
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,567
was that a Wizard commits
his greatest crime

688
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,437

to do the work of the Keeper.

have tried for years,

lies not with the queen

707
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:28,120
( speaking in ancient tongue )

708
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,461
( gasps )

709
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:39,598
You will beget a son.

710
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:45,104
I unleashed the greatest evil
the world has ever known.

711
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:53,112
Without me,
there'd be no Darken Rahl.

712
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:58,984
Zedd,
if you hadn't helped Panis,

713
00:41:58,985 --> 00:42:00,920
I wouldn't have
been born either.

714
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:03,856
Still.

715
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:06,692
I can never forgive myself.

716
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:13,933
I know what it's like to doubt
yourself at every turn,

717
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:17,536
but I've realized that
if I stop and question

718
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,505
every decision I make
I'll never get anywhere.

719
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:27,646
All we can do is make
the best choices we can

720
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,950
and keep putting one foot
in front of the other.
