1
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:08,743
I tracked it for days.
It's my trophy.

2
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:11,417
I ran the animal to the ground
and watched it die.

3
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,921
- The trophy is mine.
- He's lying, Confessor.

4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,358
He only wounded the creature.
It was my arrow that killed it.

5
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,697
I can see that neither of you is sure
whose arrow truly killed the creature.

6
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,867
So I can't fairly award the trophy
to either of you.

7
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,758
Is there someone you both know
who could use the health and good luck

8
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,652
such a trophy would bring?

9
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:43,739
Gethin's wife has been ill.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,922
Then give the trophy to Gethin,
and forgive each other for this feud.

11
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:51,969
Yes, Confessor. Thank you.

12
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,893
As you both agreed to abide
by the covenant of the Confessor,

13
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,686
- I will now hear your dispute.
- There are more people here now

14
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,793
than there were when we got here.

15
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,705
Patience, Richard.

16
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,692
This valley hasn't seen a Confessor
in years.

17
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,033
Do you have any idea
how much bad blood can flow

18
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,364
when people have no one
to settle their disputes?

19
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,090
- How does she know{\who's telling} the truth?
- A Confessor has power

20
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:18,862
beyond her magic.
She often senses the truth

21
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,394
without using her touch.
She can ferret out lies

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,916
and heal the rifts
that come from keeping secrets.

23
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:25,979
And everybody just does
what she says?

24
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:29,554
A Confessor is the highest
moral authority in the Midlands.

25
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,875
People abide by her judgments.

26
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,485
We are heading out on a hunt.

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,493
Probably no more than a day's ride.
We'd be honored to have your company.

28
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,210
- What are you hunting?
- Worthy prey. A 14-point buck.

29
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,059
- Richard can't.
- What?

30
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,309
Excuse us.

31
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,479
You can't just ride off on your own.

32
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:50,066
Back in Hartland, I was on my own
all the time, sometimes for days.

33
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:53,570
That was before you were the Seeker.
Before Darken Rahl wanted to kill you.

34
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,365
- Gavin and Matthias will be with me.
- It's not safe.

35
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,018
Lesson number 15:

36
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,363
"In honoring what others most honor,
the Seeker shall win their hearts."

37
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:05,356
Hunting is their most honored tradition.

38
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,418
When it's convenient,
you remember your lessons.

39
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,505
- Kahlan will be busy for days.
- Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

40
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,218
It is you.

41
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,297
I heard there was a wizard
in the camp,

42
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,682
but I hardly dared to imagine.

43
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:24,060
You promised

44
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,509
you would never forget that night
at the Fire Springs.

45
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,133
Sylvia!

46
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,558
If I recall,

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,343
- it was more than one night.
- So we're agreed, then.

48
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,034
You'll spend time with your friend,
I'll go hunting.

49
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,162
- Which way are you going?
- The stag was seen heading east.

50
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:48,334
Remember! Not everyone in the Midlands
is friendly. Be careful.

51
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,481
You too.

52
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,921
This is one crafty stag.

53
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,065
- Now he's turn west.
- Then let's go west.

54
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,601
I thought we were leagues
from the nearest town.

55
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:27,330
The stag has led us further
than I thought. That's Brennidon

56
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,730
Brennidon?

57
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,541
You know it?

58
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:33,827
I was born there.

59
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,965
I'm surprised Zedd didn't tell me
we were close by.

60
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,843
You weren't.
He didn't expect us to be riding west.

61
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,817
- How long since you've been there?
- Not since I was a baby.

62
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:48,233
I wonder which house was mine,

63
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:52,356
- where my parents lived.
- Do your parents still live there?

64
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,317
- I don't know.
- Don't you wanna find out?

65
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,366
I told Zedd I'd stay with you.

66
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
But

67
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,456
it wouldn't hurt to take a look around
for an hour or so.

68
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,549
And maybe we'll have taken the stag
by the time you catch up with us.

69
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:14,674
All right.

70
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,011
A terrible sight, isn't it?

71
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:43,072
Who are they?

72
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,409
The firstborn sons of Brennidon,

73
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,678
murdered by Darken Rahl's men
to avert a prophecy.

74
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,382
The Prophecy of the Seeker.

75
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,009
You know of it?

76
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,063
I've heard the story.

77
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:07,994
You've heard of it?

78
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:09,907
It's not just a story.

79
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:13,876
All these children were murdered
because of it,

80
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,690
the Seeker among them.

81
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:20,401
And when he died,

82
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:23,202
so did Brennidon's future.

83
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,460
Maybe the Seeker's out there
somewhere,

84
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,328
ready to rise up
and defeat Darken Rahl.

85
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,144
Twenty-three years have gone by

86
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:38,966
and Rahl is advancing
through the Midlands.

87
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,692
No Seeker has surfaced.

88
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:48,314
So if he lives, he's a coward,

89
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:52,096
and our children
have died for nothing.

90
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,512
Sync: Kasius

91
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,074
Papers, please.
All right, clear.

92
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,308
Come on, who's next?

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,169
You. Where's your pass?

94
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,129
Pass?

95
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,284
No pass, no entry.

96
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:13,042
This young woman

97
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,675
has been preaching heresy.

98
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,812
Gathering her friends, telling them
that Lord Rahl is not our true leader.

99
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:24,732
We all know the consequences
of defying Lord Rahl.

100
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,670
For the past 20 years, you have chosen
to live by certain standards.

101
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:33,619
Allowing those of us from the patrol
to protect you.

102
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,043
This girl

103
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,874
thinks she knows better
than the town elders.

104
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,332
We must cast rebels out publicly
so Lord Rahl knows

105
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:44,465
we'll never defy him again.

106
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:52,584
May your rebellious spirit
wander the underworld for all time.

107
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:58,184
You can't kill her
just for speaking her mind.

108
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,978
Who are you?
Show me your papers.

109
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:01,857
Just let her go.

110
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,591
- This doesn't have to be a fight.
- Take him.

111
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,254
The Sword of Truth.

112
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:15,203
It's the Seeker!

113
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:20,606
Arrest him!

114
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:29,935
Run, hide yourself!

115
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,084
Alert the sentries!
Close the gates!

116
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,029
Split into two.
Go around the other side.

117
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,992
I want to help you.

118
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,938
Follow me.

119
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,375
The Seeker went this way.

120
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,870
Thank you for helping me.

121
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,102
Look at you.

122
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:49,962
You know me?

123
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,046
I held you in my arms
the night you were born,

124
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,613
and then the Wizard took you away.

125
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:06,764
Are you saying...

126
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:08,981
you're my mother?

127
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:26,123
If you surrender the army,
it's going to upset the townspeople.

128
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,638
We had an agreement.
If we submitted to Darken Rahl's rule,

129
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,960
Brennidon would be
free of your forces.

130
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:34,289
The agreement was not
for your benefit.

131
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,261
Lord Rahl felt occupying the town might
discourage the Seeker from returning.

132
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:41,415
Your part of the bargain was
to deliver him to us if he come back.

133
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,104
I alerted you as soon as...

134
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:46,353
You alerted me only after the Seeker
had slipped through your fingers.

135
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,481
Now I have no choice
but to bring in my own forces.

136
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,968
Give us some time.
The Seeker is within the city walls.

137
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,664
He could not have escaped.

138
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:58,239
We're searching every house{\ in Brennidon}.
He will be {\in your hands}here before nightfall.

139
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,285
He'd better be.

140
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,267
I called you Owen,

141
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,568
after your father.

142
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:13,254
- My father?
- He passed away. Not long after.

143
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:19,289
Did the Wizard give you
to good people?

144
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:22,601
- Very good people.
- I can see they've raised a fine man.

145
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,348
What you did to save that girl...

146
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,351
They were gonna kill her.

147
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:30,855
- And everyone was just going to{\ stand around and} watch?
- People are terrified of Darken Rahl.

148
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,194
I don't understand. Rahl didn't kill
the children of this town

149
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,312
- because you defied his edicts...
- Rahl gave a warning

150
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:40,846
before the massacre.

151
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:45,036
He asked the town elders to identify
which child was the Seeker,

152
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,408
turn him over.

153
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:49,879
They refused.

154
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,097
So Rahl massacred all the children.

155
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,135
And now people are scared
that if they anger Rahl,

156
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,680
even in the slightest way,
he'll send his assassins back.

157
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,287
So you let these patrols control
everything you do and say?

158
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:11,241
Many of us think that it's wrong
to give up our freedom to appease Rahl,

159
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:14,358
but you saw what happens
to the people that speak out.

160
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:17,614
But now,

161
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,362
the Seeker is back,

162
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,698
ready to fulfill his destiny.

163
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,028
And maybe, now that you're here,

164
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:32,541
the rest of us will find the strength
to stand with you.

165
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,591
Mom.
They're saying the Seeker is in town.

166
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,289
- But the Seeker was killed.
- No, Mark, he wasn't.

167
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,431
This is Richard.

168
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,062
He's the Seeker.

169
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,083
I'm your brother.

170
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,583
I'm glad you're back, Zedd.

171
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,552
I'm afraid I won't be staying,
my dear.

172
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:15,102
Of course. You've always had
some higher calling to follow.

173
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:19,608
This search for a mythical creature,
that hunt for a lost spell.

174
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,263
At least your excuses for leaving were
always more interesting than most men's.

175
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:31,100
- But this time, your duty lies here.
- What do you mean?

176
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:37,858
Allard?

177
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:45,885
I want you to meet Allard.

178
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,544
Your son.

179
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:55,332
My mother never said
my father was a great Wizard.

180
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,293
I'm not your father.

181
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:03,132
Of course you are.
He's got your coloring.

182
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,553
Your eyes.
Every time I look at him, I see you.

183
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,158
You must be under an illusion spell.

184
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,798
It's your duty as his father to train
and teach him the ways of the world.

185
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,772
He's a grown man.

186
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,148
- Who you abandoned.
- He's no child of mine!

187
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:20,969
I took precautions.

188
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,651
Magical precautions.

189
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,405
Maybe I should wait outside.

190
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:30,086
You were in the throes of passion.

191
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:33,116
By the time you'd even thought
of taking precautions...

192
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,231
He's not my son!

193
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,335
- And I'll prove it.
- How?

194
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:42,491
Confess us.

195
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:45,549
About what?

196
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,693
It's a matter of...

197
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:51,866
paternity.

198
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:55,267
You told me my brother was dead.

199
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:58,060
Everyone needed to think he was dead

200
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,839
until he could fulfill his destiny
as the Seeker.

201
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,573
If anyone knew he'd survived,
Darken Rahl would have pursued him

202
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:05,600
- to the edge of the world.
- If they find him,

203
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:08,554
they'll execute all of us.
They're searching the houses now.

204
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,679
He's right.

205
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,976
- I have to leave.
- I don't want you to go.

206
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:15,243
I go back, I'll find my friends,
tell them what happened in Brennidon.

207
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:18,458
- We'll find a way to help you.
- Come on, keep searching!

208
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:22,753
You know the patrols, Mark.
Couldn't you get one of them to help us?

209
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,436
I could hide him until nightfall,

210
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,693
maybe ask the gatekeeper.
I might be able to get him

211
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,006
- to look the other way.
- This one!

212
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,421
You won't find anything here.

213
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,491
Down here!

214
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,677
This place has been empty for years.

215
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,607
No one comes here.

216
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,047
You'll be safe in the cellar.

217
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,571
Thanks for your help.

218
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,325
I'm not trying to help you.

219
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:25,774
Mark! Don't do this!

220
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:42,132
Please, you have to come.
I've caught the Seeker.

221
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,685
- This way.
- How could a boy like you capture him?

222
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,025
- He defeated my best men.
- So I tricked him.

223
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,464
I can take you there.

224
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,369
Well, where is he?

225
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,179
There's no possibility of anyone else
being Allard's father?

226
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:42,727
There was another man, Steffan,
but I only saw him once.

227
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:45,944
Vixen.
This Steffan must be the father.

228
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,566
Or it could be you.
It's your turn.

229
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,445
Are you Allard's father?

230
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,664
I used protection.

231
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:00,577
Magical protection.

232
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,870
- And this magic, could it have failed?
- Never.

233
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:06,667
It's my own spell.
It's foolproof.

234
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:08,877
And you used it every time?

235
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,607
You're honor bound to tell
a Confessor the truth.

236
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,681
Not in front of her.

237
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:24,593
Leave us.

238
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,901
Was there an occasion
when you didn't use your magic?

239
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,282
Unless you're completely truthful,

240
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,993
unless you confess
whatever it is that you're hiding,

241
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:43,913
I can't absolve you
of your responsibility to Allard.

242
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:51,879
We'll gather more men.
We'll search the houses again.

243
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,756
Whoever hid him will hide him again.

244
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,091
Nobody in Brennidon would dare.

245
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,844
Someone hid him 23 years ago.

246
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,030
Think, Andrew.

247
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,624
Who would feel such loyalty
to the Seeker?

248
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:08,562
His mother, perhaps?

249
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,482
But we don't know
who the Seeker's mother is.

250
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,630
We can find out.

251
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,704
You there.

252
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,184
- Where are you going?
- The Seeker may have escaped.

253
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,207
I have orders to search
outside the gate.

254
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:32,464
We've received new orders. Patrols are
to gather the mothers of the firstborn

255
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,578
and take them to the town square.

256
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:39,613
- The mothers?
- To force the Seeker out of hiding.

257
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,385
I helped you! Leave her alone!

258
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,407
Zedd is not Allard's father.

259
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:10,040
- But he was hiding something...
- But that didn't concern your dispute.

260
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,127
This is my final judgment.

261
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,755
Yes, Confessor.

262
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:25,013
I'm sorry, Zedd. I really hoped
that you were Allard's father.

263
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:29,236
I thought he might be
happier with you.

264
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,440
Why?
He doesn't even know me.

265
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,643
Wizards are strong.

266
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,944
Their strength comes from their minds,
not their bodies.

267
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:43,736
She doesn't want to say is,

268
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,375
but I'm hopeless as a hunter.

269
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:50,539
That's not true.
As a child, you were fearless.

270
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,553
Did something happen
to make you fearful?

271
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,920
What was it?

272
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:02,128
- A boar hunt.
- You never went on a boar hunt.

273
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,403
I was only 8.

274
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,971
You'd have said I was too young.

275
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,961
But I went with Rolant and Merrick.

276
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,020
I got caught between them
and the boar, and...

277
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:19,753
I was so scared.

278
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,916
You didn't lose your skills.

279
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,575
- You were just frightened.
- It doesn't matter.

280
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,117
If I'm asked on a hunt,

281
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:31,852
I can't.

282
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,965
I think I can help you.

283
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:43,378
Hurry, there. Don't delay.
Move along.

284
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:45,916
Brigid!

285
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,980
The D'Harans. They've come back.

286
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,242
What I want is simple.

287
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:37,018
Give the Seeker to me.

288
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:44,219
Then everyone can go back
to their lives.

289
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:54,110
What happened here 23 years ago
was a tragedy.

290
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:57,843
But it was necessary
for the greater good.

291
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:06,258
He speaks the truth.

292
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:14,389
I think we've all seen
that Darken Rahl will do anything

293
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:16,422
to bring peace to the Midlands.

294
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:17,831
See?

295
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,537
This woman is wise.

296
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:22,205
Listen to her.

297
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:25,378
What was Lord Rahl to do?

298
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:29,493
Face the Seeker as a grown man

299
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,401
who could defend himself
and carry out the Prophecy?

300
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,364
He had to kill our children!

301
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,479
The Seeker stood up
to the patrols this morning.

302
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:44,710
He saved a girl's life.

303
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,550
No one else
has had the courage to do that.

304
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:52,298
If we betray the Seeker
because we are afraid,

305
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,541
then the children of Brennidon
died for nothing!

306
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:02,773
Silence her!

307
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,900
I'm the one you're looking for!

308
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:08,253
I am the Seeker's mother!

309
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:12,379
- But I will never help you find him.
- Arrest her!

310
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,165
She's protecting me.
The Seeker is my son.

311
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:20,939
Not hers.

312
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:24,739
He's my son.

313
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,714
No, I am the Seeker's mother!

314
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,684
No, he's my son!

315
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:43,502
Arrest them all!

316
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,889
The Seeker has until sunrise

317
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:53,529
to turn himself in.

318
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,573
If he does not,
I will kill one of these women.

319
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,227
And I will kill another

320
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,350
for every hour
that the Seeker is not found!

321
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:29,569
Don't call for the patrol.
Just listen to me.

322
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:36,080
- I need your help.
- My mother was arrested because of you.

323
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,077
- Why would I help you?
- To save her.

324
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:43,331
There only way to do that
is to turn yourself in.

325
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:45,808
And then what?

326
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:48,421
You go back to your life?

327
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:52,312
Your mother comes home
and everything returns to normal?

328
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,636
You heard what your mother said
back in the town square.

329
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,015
Your mother wants
a better life for you.

330
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:03,283
She wants the people of Brennidon
to stand up for themselves.

331
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,812
If I turn myself in,

332
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,399
her sacrifice means nothing.

333
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,685
The only thing the D'Harans care about
is the Seeker.

334
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,529
- Once you're gone...
- Then the D'Harans will go too?

335
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,438
I'd never even heard of the D'Harans

336
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,457
until they killed my father.

337
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:48,355
And I have another brother,

338
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:51,128
back in Hartland. Michael.

339
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,154
I love him.
But the D'Harans turned him against me.

340
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,469
So now I know exactly
what they're capable of.

341
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:02,101
And I know that giving in
won't stop them.

342
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,877
What do you want me to do?

343
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,381
After he escaped from the cellar,
I searched for him everywhere.

344
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:22,390
I couldn't let him
destroy Brennidon.

345
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:29,152
You've done well.

346
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,611
You have what you wanted.

347
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:33,441
Now let the women go.

348
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,446
And why should I do that?

349
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,863
- They've all defied Lord Rahl.
- Please.

350
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:43,576
They were only trying to protect me.
I truly am the Seeker's mother.

351
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,746
Maybe. Or maybe
you're just protecting the others.

352
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,583
Either way, they all defied Lord Rahl
and must be punished.

353
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,585
She's telling the truth.

354
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,339
She is the Seeker's mother.

355
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:02,107
And she's the one
who's tried to hide him from you.

356
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:04,754
How do you know this, boy?

357
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,980
Because she's my mother too.

358
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,028
You would betray your own mother?

359
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,157
She betrayed Brennidon.

360
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,160
She's not my mother anymore.

361
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,115
These other women,

362
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,036
they were just being foolish,

363
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,344
trying to help a misguided friend.

364
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,600
You're a very capable young man.

365
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,831
And to show the people of this town
that Lord Rahl is merciful,

366
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,552
I will release the other women.
You, however,

367
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,861
will die alongside your son.

368
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,955
Lord Rahl will be pleased
by your loyalty.

369
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,078
- You will be rewarded.
- There's only one thing I want.

370
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,539
To be there when you kill him.

371
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:15,509
You'll have a place of honor.
At my side.

372
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,253
Open the gates, spread the word.

373
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,760
I want everyone in Brennidon and
the outlying countryside in attendance.

374
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,161
I will kill the Seeker at midday.

375
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,421
I want you

376
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,354
to summon the fear
that you've held for so long.

377
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,426
Bring it to the surface.

378
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,276
Concentrate on the flames.

379
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,992
That's good, Allard.

380
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,970
Now think about
how helpless you felt

381
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:53,666
when the boar attacked you.

382
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,429
Feed your fear to the fire.

383
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:01,435
The fire consumes your fear.

384
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,813
That's good, Allard.

385
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,098
And with the flames,

386
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:24,790
so goes your fear.

387
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,244
Are you sure it worked?

388
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:35,363
You question the magic
of a Wizard of the first order?

389
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:36,875
Of course not.

390
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:40,951
I was right to come to you.

391
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,094
What kind of spell was that?

392
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,852
It wasn't a spell.
I made it up.

393
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,249
Allard couldn't let go of his fear

394
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,471
until I made him
think magic had driven it out.

395
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,852
He may not believe it himself,

396
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:01,817
but he believes in the power
of a great Wizard.

397
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,711
You're a crafty old devil, Zedd.

398
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,735
I'm sorry I had to make you tell me
something you didn't want to.

399
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:13,475
I've kept that secret buried
for 20 years.

400
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,550
I'd like it to remain buried.

401
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,267
And by your honor as a Confessor,
you must never tell Richard.

402
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,022
No matter what happens,

403
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,473
I'm so glad that I got to see you.

404
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,300
- We're going to get out of here.
- I don't think so.

405
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,151
I have a plan.
Mark's agreed to help me.

406
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,871
I've told him exactly
what he needs to do.

407
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,824
Mark betrayed you.
He betrayed both of us.

408
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:56,956
Mark needs to be at the platform
at the execution.

409
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,701
But his eyes, they were so cold.

410
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:06,224
His whole life, he's listened
to what the patrols preach.

411
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:08,699
He thinks he's keeping
Brennidon safe.

412
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,162
Until now, I...

413
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,806
I didn't realize what growing up
in this town had done to him.

414
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:16,536
Listen to me.

415
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,973
What Mark did was a trick.

416
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:22,799
And Mark would do anything
to save you.

417
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,947
This is a horrible thing
for a mother to say about her own child,

418
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:32,450
but I don't know
if he's strong enough.

419
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:39,248
What if instead of tricking the D'Haran,
he was really tricking you?

420
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:50,973
Rabbits?

421
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:54,309
Where's that stag?
I'm hungry for venison.

422
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,258
It was craftier than we thought.
There were only two of us tracking it.

423
00:32:58,383 --> 00:33:01,347
- We'll get it next time.
- Only two? Where's Richard?

424
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:04,731
He's not back? He must have decided
to stay longer in Brennidon.

425
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:08,777
Brennidon?

426
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,372
You said you were traveling east.

427
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,701
Brennidon's west, leagues from here.

428
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,661
Well, the stag turned west...

429
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:20,349
You said
Richard was just going hunting.

430
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:22,786
Darken Rahl knows
the Seeker is from Brennidon.

431
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:25,920
He could have men waiting there for him.
Why didn't you warn him?

432
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,649
He's the most stubborn man I've {\ever }met.
If I told him we were near Brennidon,

433
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,982
no amount of cajoling
would have convinced him not to go.

434
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:34,737
Brennidon is the last place
he should be.

435
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,004
Why is there such a crowd?

436
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,750
- What goes on here, friend?
- The D'Harans have captured the Seeker.

437
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,253
He dies at midday.

438
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,508
Make room! Make room!

439
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,149
You will watch your son die,

440
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,903
as you should have 23 years ago.

441
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,584
And then you will die
for your treachery.

442
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:50,321
The legend of the Seeker
seems to be greater than the man.

443
00:34:53,044 --> 00:34:55,672
That legend will live on
if you kill me.

444
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:01,669
I am going to kill you, Seeker...

445
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:07,344
with your own sword.

446
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:19,366
Now, Seeker, the Prophecy,
at last, is averted.

447
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,658
Now!

448
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,810
You were wrong, D'Haran.

449
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,800
The Prophecy was not averted.

450
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:15,612
I would never truly betray you.

451
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,816
You were supposed to stay
with the hunters.

452
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:30,627
What were you thinking? You promised
you wouldn't go off on your own.

453
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,640
I didn't intend to.
But if I hadn't have come here,

454
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,728
I wouldn't have found my mother.

455
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:40,078
Your mother is alive?

456
00:38:58,076 --> 00:38:59,600
I knew that if you turned up,

457
00:39:00,183 --> 00:39:02,047
I would have to tell the truth.

458
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:09,137
I'm sorry.

459
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,581
I will always love you like a son,

460
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:17,688
but I'm not really your mother.

461
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:29,727
I did hold you as a baby,
the night you were born.

462
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,966
I was the midwife at your birth.

463
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,686
I was there when Zedd took you
from your mother's arms.

464
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:43,838
Why did you pretend?

465
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:49,593
When you asked me if I was your mother,
I didn't mean to say yes.

466
00:39:51,328 --> 00:39:52,941
But it was suddenly

467
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:56,077
as if I was looking
at my own lost son...

468
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,186
Owen.

469
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,355
The D'Harans killed him.

470
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:05,687
He was 3.

471
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:08,998
I'm so sorry.

472
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:13,020
I couldn't bear to think
about his death.

473
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,870
I imagined that he was the one
that had survived.

474
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,493
So when I saw you
in the square, it was...

475
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,944
It was like my Owen had returned.

476
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:26,734
At least now,
I know that he didn't die for nothing.

477
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:32,138
What about my real mother...?

478
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,476
She was very ill for a while,
but she lived.

479
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,603
And then one day, she disappeared.

480
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:43,314
I never saw her again.

481
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:47,276
I think she went to look for you.

482
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:58,079
The D'Harans may return, Mark.
And I won't be here to help.

483
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:00,956
If the D'Harans return,
they'll get a fight.

484
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:05,556
You've taught us
to stand up for ourselves. Besides,

485
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:09,758
you're the Seeker. You've got bigger
things to do than look after one town.

486
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,731
- Take care of your mother.
- You know I will.

487
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:37,035
- You were right.
- About what?

488
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,833
Insisting on the lessons.
The training.

489
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,811
I know I've been pushing you...

490
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:43,586
And now I understand why.

491
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,752
What I saw in Brennidon made me realize
what I'm facing.

492
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,259
And I'm going to do
whatever it takes to be ready.

493
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,998
And now that I know
that my mother is alive...

494
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:55,497
When all this is over,
I'm going to find her.

495
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:58,059
And someday,
I'm gonna have a family again.

496
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:07,941
Why don't you tell him?

497
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:11,246
Because if Richard knew,
he would risk his own safety for mine.

498
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:13,113
And his life is far more important.

499
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:17,074
Nobody hopes more than I
that we find Richard's mother.

500
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:21,571
And there's nothing I want more
than to tell him the truth.

501
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,669
And someday, when all this is over;

502
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:27,669
then we will have stories to tell.

503
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,869
But until then, he cannot know

504
00:42:31,994 --> 00:42:33,670
that I'm his grandfather.
