1
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:09,154
I'll carry you pack all day long
if you gave me ten minutes.

2
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,033
Are you alright?

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,987
Have heart, Zedd.

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,154
Richard, it's me, Michael.

5
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:26,692
How did you...?

6
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,679
How did I get here?

7
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:33,230
Some guards found you at the bottom
of the cliff and carried you home.

8
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,305
You've been out for two days.

9
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,013
That's not true.

10
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:41,005
Where's Zedd? Where's Kahlan?
How'd I get through the Boundary?

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,085
You should be lying down,
you had quite a fall.

12
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,105
This is some kind of trick,
isn't it?

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,542
Well, it's not going to work.
I know it wasn't Kahlan who killed Dad.

14
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,385
I know it was Fane.
And you helped him!

15
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,136
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:56,215
I'm talking about Dad

17
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:58,388
dying, right outside that door!

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,565
I tried to stop the bleeding,
but it was too late.

19
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:05,468
Dad?

20
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,028
I felt the life go out of him.

21
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:15,992
We saw the smoke.

22
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,536
What happened?

23
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:20,597
He's dead.

24
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,673
You accused me,

25
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,301
your own brother.

26
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,595
Did the witch make you do this?

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,766
- Michael, you can't possibly believe...
- I don't know what to believe.

28
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:43,269
It was Rannsyn Fane.

29
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,855
He's with Chase, looking for you.

30
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,924
You're not going anywhere.
Take him.

31
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,406
Stay back!

32
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,367
Witchcraft.

33
00:01:58,882 --> 00:01:59,869
Fane was right.

34
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,791
You would've had me arrested,
and who knows who else,

35
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,887
- if I hadn't gotten away.
- I'm calling a healer.

36
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,691
- You must've hit your head...
- Tell me what you did to them,

37
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,572
- or I swear, I will beat it out of you!
- Richard.

38
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,223
Son. You're up and about.

39
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,060
- Dad?
- Thank the Spirits.

40
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,694
1x12 - <i>Home</i>

41
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:36,994
It wasn't a dream.

42
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,156
I've been gone for months.

43
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,181
I've fought battles, I've...

44
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:43,898
I've killed people.

45
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,080
I fell asleep in the forest
with Zedd and Kahlan, and then...

46
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,104
I know what happened.

47
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:57,174
Darken Rahl used some kind of magic

48
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,219
to wind the clock
back to the day I met Kahlan.

49
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:01,967
- To right before it all began.
- Who's Kahlan?

50
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,492
She's a Confessor.

51
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:07,722
She came through the Boundary,
with the Book of Counted Shadows.

52
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,774
But the D'Harans were after her.

53
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:14,777
They were hunting her
like an animal.

54
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,191
They chased her
all the way across the Midlands,

55
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,692
and through the Boundary,

56
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,183
trying to kill her.

57
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,868
I had to help her.

58
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,258
They cornered her
on the edge of Dead Man's Cliff.

59
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:38,509
Stay back.

60
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,952
Shoot her.

61
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,179
Leave her alone.

62
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,852
You're making a mistake, boy.

63
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,588
This girl is dangerous.

64
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,335
Four men against one woman?

65
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,560
I think she's the one in danger.

66
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,780
- And go home.
- I'm not going any...

67
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:06,064
Easy.

68
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,080
Do not let her grasp you.

69
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,967
They were scared of her.

70
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,296
She used magic against them.

71
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,524
But using her power made her weak.

72
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,175
Fane would've killed her
if I hadn't been there.

73
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,163
It's over for you,

74
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:47,715
Confessor.

75
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,124
We were at the edge of the cliff...

76
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,059
The fall should've killed him.

77
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:12,879
But when I looked over,

78
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,322
he was gone.

79
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,890
He fell a hundred feet
and walked away.

80
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:27,153
Whoever thought my son
would have such a vivid imagination?

81
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,591
Not so much as a mosquito
has ever crossed the Boundary.

82
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,083
- Everybody knows it's impenetrable.
- Well, then everybody is wrong.

83
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,336
I need to talk to Zedd.

84
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,297
What, the crazy old man
who talks to his chickens?

85
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,717
Why would you wanna talk to him?

86
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,176
Don't try to stop me.

87
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:06,194
Something terrible's happened.

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,413
Darken Rahl did
some kind of spell that sent me

89
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:10,751
back to the day I first came here.
But I know everything.

90
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:12,705
- I know I'm the Seeker...
- Slow down.

91
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:18,297
You're Richard Cypher, aren't you?
George's boy.

92
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:21,609
Grown up to be a fine figure
of a young man, don't you think, Clara?

93
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,508
Zedd, I know who you are.

94
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:28,873
You brought me here from the Midlands.
You've always been watching over me.

95
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,391
He fell off Dead Man's Bluff
and hit his head.

96
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:36,017
- It's gotten him all mixed-up.
- Zedd, tell them it's true.

97
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,639
Tell them you're a Wizard.

98
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:40,941
That's a new one.

99
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,528
Imagine,
someone taking me for a Wizard.

100
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:47,893
He's pretending

101
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,574
because he doesn't trust you.
But it's true.

102
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,937
I got bit by some kind of vine
Kahlan brought through the Boundary.

103
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:56,083
It made me sick,
I fell off my horse,

104
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:59,184
and when I came to I was right there,
on that bed.

105
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:02,688
You healed me with magic.

106
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:21,523
His fever's broken.

107
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:24,443
Now take me to the Seeker.

108
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,811
He's here.

109
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,207
It turned out I was the person
she came all this way looking for.

110
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,332
Him?

111
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,119
- But...
- What?

112
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:37,289
Not good enough?
You wanted a Seeker, there he is.

113
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:40,751
If he's not up to your standards,
well, that's fine by me.

114
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,586
- Find yourself another.
- Seeker?

115
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,519
What are you talking about?

116
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,512
You never told him?

117
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,342
You were supposed to train him,

118
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:57,908
prepare him.

119
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,312
What have you been doing
for the last 20 years?

120
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,922
Letting him catch worms,

121
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,838
steal apples, skin his knees,

122
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,766
find out
what makes his heart beat faster.

123
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,482
My sister gave her life
to make sure that I got here,

124
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,874
to make sure that I put the Book
in the Seeker's hands.

125
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,302
And he's catching worms?

126
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,834
Never knew a great man
who didn't have dirt under his nails.

127
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,803
While he's getting his nails dirty,

128
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:23,740
did it ever occur to you
to give him the slightest inkling

129
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:27,339
that he is the first true Seeker
in the last thousand years?

130
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,258
He has a destiny.

131
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,469
Who are you
to decide a man's destiny?

132
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,596
It's not me.
It's the Prophecy...

133
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,099
- Prophecy be damned!
- Stop.

134
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,062
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,687
And what's a Seeker?

136
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,566
And then you told me
it was my destiny to kill Darken Rahl,

137
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,902
the leader of the D'Harans.
And then you gave me the Sword of Truth.

138
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,029
Sword of Truth?

139
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,041
Which was right over there.

140
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:58,550
It was invisible.
You pulled it out of the air.

141
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:01,915
We'd give all our toes and feathers

142
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:05,252
if our lives could be
only that exciting, wouldn't we, Clara?

143
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:13,043
I can't believe
I could've dreamed all that.

144
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,785
I'm not dead, Richard.

145
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,745
I'm right here.

146
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,036
And I'm not going anywhere.

147
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,640
But if all this is real,

148
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,425
and everything that happened
was a dream,

149
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:44,883
then there's no Kahlan.

150
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,006
- She doesn't exist.
- Yes, I do. Richard, I'm right here.

151
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,800
She's just something I dreamed.

152
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,623
Richard, you're dreaming now.

153
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,250
Wake up.

154
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,610
What is it?

155
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:03,519
He's talking in his sleep.

156
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,236
How could all that
have just been a dream?

157
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,007
I can't wake him.

158
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,153
You won't be able to.

159
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,154
- What do you mean?
- The Three Stars of Amberlis

160
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,190
appear within the circle
of the crescent moon

161
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,327
once every 119 years.

162
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,201
And when they do,

163
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,791
it becomes possible to cast
the Spell of the Lying Moon.

164
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:28,666
- What kind of spell is that?
- Powerful magic

165
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,946
that causes the victim
to fall into a dream

166
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,254
where he believes he is among friends
when he is among enemies.

167
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:36,689
And in that dream,

168
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:40,064
a man will reveal secrets
that in his waking life

169
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,016
he would only share
with those he trusts most.

170
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,769
Who would have done this to Richard?
And why?

171
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:50,182
Only one Wizard in the world besides me
is capable of working this magic,

172
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,636
and that Wizard
works for Darken Rahl.

173
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,461
- We've to get him out of the moonlight.
- It's too late.

174
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,200
- The spell has already taken hold.
- Well, can't you undo it?

175
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:01,994
I can try.

176
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:05,741
What's going to happen to him?

177
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:12,379
Do you see how one star is beginning
to disappear behind the moon?

178
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,495
If we can't get him out
before all three stars have gone,

179
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,119
we may never get him out.

180
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,934
There's nobody called Kahlan.

181
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,575
And Zedd isn't a Wizard.

182
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,340
- We need to get him to a healer.
- The boy doesn't need a healer.

183
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:35,465
He just needs a little time.

184
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,064
I only wish I had the powers
you dreamed up for me,

185
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,223
but I do know
a few little healing tricks,

186
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:47,069
and one of them is that there's no cure
for the frightening grip of a nightmare

187
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:49,244
like telling it
to a friendly listener.

188
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:52,294
And there's no one friendlier
than Clara.

189
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,408
So tell us,

190
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,593
did you take up this sword?

191
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:59,667
 Did you defeat
this dastardly Rannsyn Fane?

192
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,197
Come, Richard.

193
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,142
At the very least,
it'll make a good story.

194
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:09,898
It doesn't feel like a story.

195
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,647
I know, but tell it anyway.

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,191
I promise you, it'll do you good.

197
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,323
Go on, son.

198
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,645
After I rode home,

199
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,037
after...

200
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,849
Dad died in the burning house,

201
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,552
I came after Fane,

202
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:33,895
but he got away.

203
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,390
He was heading for the Boundary.

204
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,651
We raced after him,

205
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,688
I fought him.

206
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,726
We had to stop him.

207
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,604
He had the Book of Counted Shadows.

208
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,743
If Rahl got the Book,
it would give him the secrets of power.

209
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,237
I don't know
how I was able to fight like that.

210
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:28,682
It was like I was getting
some kind of power from the Sword.

211
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,652
I felt rage,

212
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,279
anger, like I'd never felt before.

213
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,699
I was the bringer of death.

214
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,689
It was the first time
I ever killed anybody.

215
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,755
But not the last.

216
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,479
You did it.

217
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:24,758
You are the Seeker.

218
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,990
Fascinating! Incomparable!

219
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:31,609
Magical swords, magical vines.

220
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,810
I admit I've always had a fondness
for this sort of tale.

221
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,108
What other wondrous objects
did you come upon?

222
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,581
This isn't funny to me.

223
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,457
Forgive me. Forgive me.

224
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,475
I've just gotten
so caught up in the story.

225
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,446
Please, keep going.

226
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,598
Give a little pleasure
to a lonely old man.

227
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,560
Well, there were
a lot of magical objects.

228
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:57,772
But

229
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,133
nothing was amazing
as the magical people.

230
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,097
I met a boy

231
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,653
who could see people's thoughts,
like he was reading a book.

232
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,873
Now, there's a trick
I'd like to have up my sleeve.

233
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,958
Tell us about him.

234
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,761
Well, we had to save him
from the D'Harans,

235
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,606
so Darken Rahl
couldn't get control of his powers.

236
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,119
It's okay. We're friends.

237
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,369
We just wanna take you home.

238
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,310
But he didn't exactly
wanna be saved.

239
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,430
He was used to getting his own way.

240
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,268
I want pheasant
with blackberry sauce.

241
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,479
Well, the first pheasant I see
is all yours.

242
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,843
I saw a nest of pheasants
a mile back,

243
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,901
- and there were blackberries all over.
- No, we don't have time.

244
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,946
If you're in a hurry,
I'm not stopping you.

245
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,324
I'll just wait right here
for the D'Harans to find me.

246
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:52,676
Listen,

247
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,954
we're not stopping to pick blackberries
and hunt pheasant.

248
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,794
Then I guess I'll have to tell her

249
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,377
about the secret
you've been keeping from her.

250
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,056
- I don't have any secrets from Kahlan.
- I'm a Listener.

251
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,618
Do you think there's anything
you can hide from me?

252
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:14,317
How would you like her to know

253
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,641
what you think about
when you look at her?

254
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:21,017
I blush to think of what thoughts
the little monster may have glimpsed.

255
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,242
He wasn't so bad.

256
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,314
Once the D'Harans attacked,
and he saw what they were really about,

257
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,266
he started to trust us.

258
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
It's okay.

259
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:32,566
Just an owl

260
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,618
complaining about something,

261
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,662
the way owls do.

262
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:40,397
Does it still hurt?

263
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,306
I would say no,

264
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,413
but you'd know I'd be lying.

265
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,470
Why haven't you told her
what you feel about her?

266
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,529
It's complicated.

267
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,730
You'll understand
when you get older.

268
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:06,269
It's not that complicated.

269
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,944
You're just scared
she doesn't feel the same way.

270
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,649
But you don't have to be scared.

271
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,869
She feels the same way you do.

272
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,430
I don't wanna talk about this
anymore.

273
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:39,057
Richard, come back!
You need to...

274
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,418
... rest yourself and stay calm.

275
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:45,397
A blow to the head
can be a dangerous thing.

276
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,047
Be careful, Lord Rahl.

277
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,631
If you push him too hard,
you could shatter the spell.

278
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:56,968
I will push him
as hard as I have to,

279
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,005
until he tells me

280
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,093
where he has hidden
the third Box of Orden.

281
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,017
The deeper the spell takes him,
the more the fever will rage.

282
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,861
Richard, your father and brother...

283
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,345
... are worried sick about you.

284
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:37,392
Come back.

285
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,835
What is it, boy?

286
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,622
You can talk to me.

287
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,608
I can't believe Kahlan's not real.

288
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,321
How could I just imagine
feeling that way about somebody?

289
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,763
We all have our little fantasies.

290
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,312
I'd like to be alone right now.

291
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:10,537
I'm not getting anywhere.

292
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:15,955
The idiot's gone
and fallen in love with his Confessor.

293
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,109
She's all he can think about.

294
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,461
Now,
why can't I just reach into his mind

295
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,663
and see where he hid the box?

296
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,625
Childhood memories are easy,
Lord Rahl.

297
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,997
But a secret as important to the Seeker
as where he has hidden the box

298
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,987
is sure to be locked away
where even the Magic of Amberlis

299
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:37,801
has to work hard to find it.

300
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,200
As for his love of his Confessor,

301
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,056
he's a young man like any other.

302
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,488
Surely there's a girl
he left behind,

303
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,686
some fresh-faced
maiden of the forest

304
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,012
who can draw his thoughts
away from Kahlan Amnell.

305
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:07,409
Anna.

306
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,875
- What are you doing here? How did...?
- I came as soon as I heard.

307
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,951
South Haven to Hartland in two days.

308
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,130
Let somebody try to beat that.

309
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,533
Do you hate me?

310
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,536
For moving away, for never writing?

311
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,694
I was angry for a long time,

312
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,146
but I could never hate you, Anna.

313
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,819
Only Richard Cypher
would be crazy enough

314
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:40,649
to go running around the edge
of Dead Man's Cliff.

315
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,825
- What were you thinking?
- I was helping somebody.

316
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,036
- The woman in the white dress?
- You saw her too?

317
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,757
I went to your house.

318
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,417
Your brother and your father
told me about your dream.

319
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,794
Tell me what happened
in this other place.

320
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:06,629
For a dream to be that real,
there must be something important in it.

321
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,903
Something you can learn from it.

322
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,602
Do you remember
when that little black dog you had

323
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,936
that got swept away
in the big flood?

324
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:19,964
Arrow.

325
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:22,926
We were what,

326
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,407
7 years old?

327
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,880
You ran away, nobody could find you.

328
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,620
I was hiding in your cellar.

329
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,552
- Because you didn't want anyone...
- ... to see you cry.

330
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,384
You stayed there all day,
you told me

331
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,753
all about Arrow's
great heroic deeds.

332
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:40,778
And then you went home,
and nobody ever saw a tear on your face.

333
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:43,023
Except me.

334
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:49,495
Talk to me, Richard. Get it out.
Tell me everything.

335
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,644
Tell me the worst,
scariest thing that happened.

336
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,105
It was one scary thing
after another.

337
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:57,717
Like what?

338
00:21:58,643 --> 00:21:59,643
Well,

339
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:02,800
nothing was scarier
than the Mord-Sith.

340
00:22:14,254 --> 00:22:16,209
No one's going to train me.

341
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,453
Did you not feel my Agiel?

342
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,907
The harder you fight,

343
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,297
the more painful
its magic will become.

344
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,725
And after I've finished
training you with it,

345
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:35,808
you'll do anything to please me.

346
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,091
Anything.

347
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,527
And nothing will please me more

348
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,703
than to see the Seeker

349
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,642
stand at the gates
of the People's Palace,

350
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:51,286
and there, before the multitudes,

351
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:53,699
take the hand of Lord Rahl

352
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,727
and pledge undying love

353
00:22:57,232 --> 00:22:58,827
and fealty to him.

354
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:04,719
I'm going to take that sword

355
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,184
and I'm going to kill him with it...

356
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:11,965
after I kill you.

357
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,863
I do enjoy a challenge.

358
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,166
Shall we begin?

359
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,106
Nothing in a dream
could hurt like that.

360
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:27,238
Nothing in a dream
could leave a scar.

361
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,628
Anna, it left a scar, right here.

362
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:44,081
Just keep telling it, Richard.

363
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:45,590
Keep getting it out.

364
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,884
How did you escape
from that horrible place?

365
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,081
Kahlan tried to save me.

366
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:52,263
- Who's Kahlan?
- The woman in white.

367
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,371
I don't even know how long
I'd been in that dungeon.

368
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,618
I was completely
under Denna's power.

369
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,637
Do it now.

370
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:05,206
Kill her.

371
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,615
- I can't.
- Then watch her suffer.

372
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,868
End her pain, Richard.

373
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:23,878
But she wouldn't give up.

374
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,867
She was testing me,

375
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:28,939
tormenting me.

376
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:36,803
But something

377
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:38,505
stopped me.

378
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,019
I was so close.

379
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,566
I can't explain it.

380
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,540
Any magic you use against a Mord-Sith
comes back at you,

381
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:44,435
10 times stronger,

382
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:47,350
with more pain
that you can possibly imagine.

383
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,016
How did you...?

384
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:10,504
You taught me how to withstand pain.

385
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,005
That's quite a dream.

386
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:28,144
You almost died for this Kahlan.

387
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:30,421
Not as many times
as she almost died for me.

388
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:32,755
Did she look like me?

389
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,509
Richard, going with my parents
when they moved to South Haven

390
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,226
was the stupidest thing I ever did.

391
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:47,188
You were 19, you could have stayed.
Why didn't you?

392
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,931
All our lives,
from when we were 5 years old,

393
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,778
it was always: "Richard and Anna
were born for each other.

394
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:56,113
"What are you going to wear
to the wedding?"

395
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,533
You were the only man
I'd ever kissed.

396
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,178
It took hearing
you'd fallen off that cliff

397
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,341
and almost died for me to realize

398
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:09,021
that you're the only man
I ever want to kiss.

399
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,583
I'm sorry,

400
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:15,192
but I don't have magical powers

401
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,582
and I'm not much good
in a knife fight,

402
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,789
but I love you, Richard.

403
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,403
Am I too late?

404
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:29,188
- Do you still care for me?
- Yes, I care for you, Anna.

405
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:30,956
"Anna"?

406
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:33,757
Who's Anna?

407
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,762
I will always care for you but...

408
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:48,624
You're home, Richard.

409
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,754
You're home, with me.

410
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,805
And I'm never leaving you again.

411
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,301
He's in my hands.

412
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,312
- And now to find the box.
- Not yet, Lord Rahl.

413
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,647
If you move too fast,

414
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,753
if he suspects the truth...

415
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,630
- and he is the Seeker of Truth,
after all -

416
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:18,691
the spell will shatter.

417
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:21,765
Keep pulling him in.

418
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,375
So,

419
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:34,337
what happened
with this woman in white?

420
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,055
Did you marry her?

421
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,020
Well, that's good.

422
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:43,220
I wouldn't want you marrying
somebody else, not even in a dream.

423
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:45,888
Actually, I did marry somebody else.

424
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:49,304
Well, not really.

425
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,117
It's complicated.

426
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,831
A powerful witch put a spell on me
that made everybody who looked at me

427
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:57,443
think I was somebody else.

428
00:28:58,524 --> 00:28:59,624
Even Kahlan.

429
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:01,687
What are you doing?

430
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,066
Put down Richard's sword, Gryff.

431
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:10,617
The Sword of Truth is not a toy.

432
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,541
What's going on?

433
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:14,989
How did Gryff get his hands
on your sword, Richard?

434
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,254
No harm done.

435
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:20,216
The Sword of Truth
belongs in the hands of the Seeker.

436
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,218
This is insane. It's me, Richard.

437
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:25,971
Bronwyn is a very lucky girl.
You'll make a fine husband.

438
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,595
I think we should get moving.

439
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,764
To Lord Rahl.

440
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,941
They thought I was Gryff,
the son of a wealthy merchant,

441
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,336
betrothed to girl named Bronwyn.

442
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:43,500
If these things are uncomfortable,
we can take them off.

443
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:45,072
What's wrong with you?

444
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:48,285
You know tradition doesn't allow it.
It stays on until morning.

445
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,998
After we've spent our first night
together as man and wife.

446
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:56,409
There are a lot of things
I want to say,

447
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,384
but first let me start
by wishing my little sister

448
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,466
and her new husband

449
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,385
many, many children. And...

450
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,763
We should get started on that
right away.

451
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:12,103
So in your dream
did you actually...?

452
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:15,637
I had to get out of there.

453
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,379
Zedd and Kahlan were on their way
to the ancient ruined city of Kelabra,

454
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,610
where Darken Rahl
was massing hundreds of men.

455
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:25,072
What was Rahl looking for
in the ruins?

456
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:27,363
Did you ever find out?

457
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:31,245
And it turned out to be more important
than we could ever have imagined.

458
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,831
It was the second Box of Orden.

459
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,832
Just as I feared.

460
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,095
Rahl is trying to find out
where the box is.

461
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:40,466
Don't say any more.

462
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:42,396
You see,

463
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:46,959
each one of these boxes
contained unbelievably powerful magic.

464
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:50,389
Rahl had the first box.
He found the second in Kelabra.

465
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:54,393
All through the dream, Zedd and Kahlan
kept telling me if he got all three,

466
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,104
he would have the power
to enslave the world.

467
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:00,104
We had to get to the third box
before Rahl did.

468
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:04,392
What did I tell you, Lord Rahl?
Your patience has been rewarded.

469
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:08,908
Where was it, Richard?

470
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,994
Where was the third Box of Orden?

471
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,919
The box was
in the treasure room of Tamarang,

472
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:17,672
the most heavily guarded castle
in the Midlands.

473
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,437
The only way in was for Zedd
to enter a competition

474
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:26,290
to be an entertainer
at Princess Violet's birthday party.

475
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,896
Greetings, Your Highness.

476
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:32,425
But apparently Princess Violet
was very hard to please.

477
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,443
Hello, Princess Violet.

478
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,275
I'm Mr. Stocking.

479
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,183
Happy Birthday.

480
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:43,612
Guards!

481
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:47,146
Throw this idiot off the grounds
before I chop off his head.

482
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,616
Forgive me, Your Magnificence,
for disappointing you.

483
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,744
Where you going without me?

484
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,038
What do you mean?

485
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,333
I lost the job because of you,
you worthless, stinking rag.

486
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,087
First you blame me for losing the job,
now you blame me for being stinky.

487
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,957
Something sure smells around here,

488
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,550
but it isn't me.

489
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:11,451
You're hired.

490
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,098
Ruben Rybnik,

491
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,546
Grand Puppeteer,

492
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:20,881
at Her Majesty's service.

493
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:24,600
Once Zedd was inside the castle,

494
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:27,739
he managed to steal the key
to the treasure room.

495
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,911
He used his magic
to turn an ordinary spice box

496
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,803
into a perfect copy
of the third Box of Orden.

497
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,626
But that wasn't
the end of the story.

498
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,895
What are you doing in here?

499
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,605
Forgive me, princess.

500
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,858
My curiosity overcame me.

501
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,971
How stupid do you think I am?

502
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:57,075
You have two seconds
to tell me what's going on

503
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,372
before I scream my head off
and wake up the whole castle.

504
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,119
You may want to look in the mirror
before you make good on that threat.

505
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,075
My face! My beautiful face.
What have you done to me?

506
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,245
Change me back right now,
or I'll chop your head off.

507
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:21,999
How will you get rid of the warts
if you chop my head off?

508
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:28,230
It's called a Tattletale Curse,
Your Celestial Highness.

509
00:33:28,854 --> 00:33:32,366
I can take it away, but
if you ever even think of telling on me,

510
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:33,890
the warts will reappear.

511
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:35,262
Forever.

512
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:45,272
Zedd gave the box
to Violet's poor servant girl, Rachel.

513
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:48,484
You're now the most
important person in the world.

514
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,128
- Where is it?
- She had to hide the box from Violet.

515
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:54,073
- What are you doing in here?
- Violet had very sharp eyes.

516
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:56,116
Do you have something
behind your back?

517
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,489
If they caught Rachel, they would
have boiled her alive in molten lead.

518
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,794
Even if she was a little girl, she was
one of the bravest people I've ever met.

519
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:24,603
I finally had the third Box of Orden
in my hands.

520
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:26,605
What did you do with it

521
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,940
once you had it?

522
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,727
We were heading for a place where Zedd
thought he could hide it away safe,

523
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,321
when we passed through a forest
crawling with D'Haran soldiers.

524
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:40,494
I broke away from the others,
and found a place to bury the box.

525
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:44,164
Just for a little while,
until things quieted down.

526
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:46,083
He's going to tell them where it is.

527
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,804
- Where could you possibly bury it...
- ... that would be safe enough

528
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,535
- for something so precious?
- I hid it under a tree

529
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,200
a few leagues west of Trollsbridge.

530
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,572
Send the Dragon Corps
to Trollsbridge.

531
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:09,088
Under a tree?

532
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,452
Doesn't sound terribly safe to me.

533
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,555
What kind of tree was it?

534
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,852
What does it matter
what kind of tree?

535
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,069
I was just wondering

536
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:26,163
if they have the same kind of trees
in dreamland as they do here.

537
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,730
Do they have

538
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,200
wayward pine,

539
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,742
alghars,

540
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,092
- wanderer's elm?
- How do you know about alghars?

541
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:39,845
They only grow in the Midlands,
not here.

542
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:47,019
There were alghars in the story books
my mother used to read me.

543
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,146
Your mother must have read them
to you too.

544
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:52,001
Maybe that's how
they got into your dream.

545
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,774
So it was an alghar?

546
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,867
I know this is crazy,

547
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:05,685
but back there in my dream,
or whatever it was,

548
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:10,334
the fate of the world depended
on nobody knowing where that box is...

549
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,429
I don't know, it just feels wrong
to tell anyone where it is.

550
00:36:16,894 --> 00:36:18,258
Richard, I love you.

551
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,721
I've always loved you.
I want to make a life with you.

552
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,931
I know that now.

553
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:26,498
Now that I almost lost you.

554
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:29,973
If you don't trust me enough
to tell me

555
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,439
- something that happened to you in a...
- ... dream,

556
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,025
then what did it all mean?

557
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,516
All the years we were together,

558
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,656
all the times
we talked about our future...

559
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:43,484
... thinking up names
for our children...

560
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,285
Was that all a lie?

561
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,962
No, Anna, it wasn't a lie.

562
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:56,581
These memories, these phantoms
you think are so real,

563
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:58,549
they're not just something
from a dream.

564
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:02,049
- They're bad spirits...
- ... trying to drag you into the dark,

565
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,358
they won't let go of you
unless you show them

566
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:05,889
you don't believe their lies.

567
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:07,687
Say the word.

568
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,100
Say the name of the tree
the box was buried under.

569
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,981
Break the chains, Richard.

570
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,539
Break the chains!

571
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:18,840
- Send the bad spirits back...
- ... where they came from.

572
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,424
I'm here, Richard, I'm right here.

573
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,493
- Come back to me.
- It's no use.

574
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,363
The Spell of the Lying Moon
is impenetrable.

575
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:33,834
I can get through.

576
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:35,687
I know that I can.

577
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,184
Richard, it's me, Kahlan.

578
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,133
Don't listen
to what they're telling you.

579
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:44,578
Remember all the things
we've been through.

580
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:46,210
Think of me.

581
00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:50,032
I'm right here.

582
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:53,107
I need you, Richard.

583
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,731
I need you here with me.

584
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,295
That night, in the forest,

585
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,070
I never wanted that kiss to end.

586
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:14,666
The next day,
when you stopped me on the path...

587
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,813
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have the same feelings

588
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:21,715
that I have for you.

589
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:25,403
I don't have any feelings for you.

590
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,261
And I never will.

591
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,050
But that was a lie.

592
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:33,143
This is the truth:

593
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,162
I love you, Richard.

594
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,273
I love you, Richard.

595
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,913
I love you, Richard.

596
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:42,152
I love you
and I never want to lose you again.

597
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:46,227
Tell me.

598
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:49,888
Break the chains.

599
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,863
Richard, come back.

600
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,961
It's a kind of tree
that doesn't grow near here.

601
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:02,611
Please, come back to me.

602
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:06,473
I love you.

603
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:08,929
I love you, Richard.

604
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:13,094
- You'd like it, it blossoms...
- It blossoms in the spring?

605
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,402
You are the Seeker.

606
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,299
Whatever lies they're telling you,

607
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,597
use your inner power.

608
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,493
The power to see the truth.

609
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:33,578
What's wrong?

610
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:37,350
See it.

611
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,327
See the truth.

612
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,573
You're scaring me, Richard.

613
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:47,134
Why are you looking at me like that?

614
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,509
We need to dig up the box. Fast!

615
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,461
Cast the spell again.

616
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,027
I'm not finished.

617
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:06,922
I'm afraid you are, my lord.

618
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,056
It's too late.

619
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:36,294
You've been awfully quiet.

620
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,620
I've just been thinking.

621
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,056
If you really exist

622
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,428
and if Zedd's really a Wizard, and not
the chicken man of Blackthorn Hill...

623
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:48,971
then my dad really is dead.

624
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,878
So how did you know it was a trick?

625
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:00,268
What brought you out of it?

626
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,683
As real as it was in every way,

627
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,995
nothing in my life
has been more real than you.

628
00:41:10,158 --> 00:41:12,807
And right when I was about to tell Anna
where the box was,

629
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,767
I suddenly, absolutely,
knew you existed.

630
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,934
I knew it, because I felt...

631
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,647
I felt your love for me.
