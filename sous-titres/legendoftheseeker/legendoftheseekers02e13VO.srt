1
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:25,022
Fear not,
Sister Portia.

2
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,457
The Keeper
of the Underworld

3
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,492
will reward you
for your sacrifice.

4
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:31,295
I have no fear.

5
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,430
I long only for his embrace.

6
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,065
It will soon be yours.

7
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:40,604

9
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:48,913
( all chanting
in ancient tongue )

10
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,390
Now.

13
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,870
Sister Nicci?

14
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:19,376
You've brought me back.

15
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,478
The Mother Confessor
still walks,

16
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,181
and only your han
is strong enough to kill her.

17
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:27,651
I think I know
a way to find her.

18
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,620
(Richard)
How about some rosemary?

19
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,626
Ooh, good.

20
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,328
What would your mothers say?

21
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,264
About our ability to create
ambrosial delights

22
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,833
from roots and herbs
scavenged from the wilderness?

23
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,970
No, about two strong men
fussing over the fire

24
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,471
while a woman chops wood
for them.

25
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,341
(Zedd)
On a good team,
each member performs

26
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:51,842
in accordance
with their abilities,

27
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,411
and judging by your recent
attempts to produce

28
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:57,014
something approximating
corn cake,

29
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,949
it might be best for you
to stick to chopping.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,654

36
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,031
Richard, wait!

37
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:14,965
Hyah!

(Richard)
Kahlan!

41
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,317
They flew over that ridge.
I can't see which way they went.

42
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,119
Gars are hungry beasts.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,254
Only trained ones save
their prey until later.

44
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:39,757
And the only trained Gars
in the Midlands

45
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:41,992
are the personal pets
of the Margrave of Rothenberg,

46
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,228
the richest man
in all the territories.

47
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,563
Rothenberg is days
from here,

48
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,699
Kahlan could be dead
by the time we get there.

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,834
If the Margrave had ordered
his Gars to kill her,

50
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,202
she'd be dead already.

51
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,071
He must want her alive
for some reason.

52
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,706
Well, let's go before
he changes his mind.

53
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,074
I must warn you.

54
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,677
The ancient Lords of Rothenberg
had a powerful spell

55
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:02,413
of protection cast
on the walls of their realm.

56
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:05,249
Within those walls,
no magic has any power.

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,217
Not my wizardry,
not Cara's Agiels--

58
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,286
Not Kahlan's confessor power.

59
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:10,354
Hyah!

60
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,624
(Margrave)
Herald.

61
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,426
Margrave?

62
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:18,195
Do you know
who this woman is?

63
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:21,231
Yes, Your Majesty.

64
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:24,134
I saw her once, sitting
in judgment in Aydindril.

65
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:27,705
She is Kahlan Amnell,
the Confessor.

66
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,306
Send word to our friend
that we're ready

67
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,475
to complete
our agreement.

68
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,143
(Kahlan)
What agreement?

69
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,611
Who are you talking about?

70
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:37,548
You'll find out soon enough.

71
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,317
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

72
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,152
Take her to the dungeon.

73
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,954
( grunting )

74
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,059
You're a fool if you think

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,694
the Seeker isn't
going to find me.

76
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,162
He'll never get here in time.

77
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:53,630

78
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,966
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

79
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,842

84
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,923
Nobody has ever escaped
the Margrave's dungeon.

85
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,529
There's always a way out.

86
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,564
You don't know the Margrave.

87
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,199
I take it you do.

88
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:31,935
I'm his wife.

89
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,710
What are you doing
in his dungeon?

90
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:41,612
My husband has grown
tired of me,

91
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,213
and wishes to marry another.

92
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,782
But the Law
of Right and Good

93
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,417
forbids anyone to break
their marriage vows

94
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,121
so he has
sentenced me to death.

95
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,891
On what grounds?

96
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,093
He needs none.

97
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,761
According to the law,

98
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,130
the Margrave's word
is final and absolute.

99
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,634
I'm Kahlan Amnell,
the Mother Confessor,

100
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,369
and the only laws
in the Midlands

101
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,638
are the ones
that I enforce.

102
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,040
I've never heard of this
Law of Right and Good.

103
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,944
But I swear to you on
the Creator and all the Spirits

104
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:15,679
that I am going
to get us out of here.

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,980
No.

106
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,183
When the Margrave chooses
his new bride,

107
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,885
his executioner is going
to take me to the block.

108
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,155
And I must accept that.

109
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,393
( chanting in ancient tongue )

110
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,167
Sister Nicci.

111
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,769
You spent
your life praying

112
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,604
to be united
with the Keeper.

113
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,607
And now here you are,
back in the world of the living.

114
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:46,977
My sisters
brought me back

115
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,279
so I could do what you
and your minions

116
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,782
failed to do,
time and again:

117
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:53,951
capture the Mother Confessor.

118
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,886
If you have
the Mother Confessor,

119
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,623
then why are you not laying
her lifeless body at my feet?

120
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,059
I sent word to the Margrave
of Rothenberg,

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,628
asking him to send
his Gars for her.

122
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,230
She's at the Margrave's dungeon,

123
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,599
a place where the Seeker
and his friends

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,802
will be unable
to use magic to rescue her.

125
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,405
Very clever.

126
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:17,841
So clever, in fact,
that I'm left wondering

127
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,944
what you might possibly
need from me.

128
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:24,848
In exchange for turning
the Mother Confessor over to me,

129
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,717
the Margrave wants a guarantee,

130
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,887
signed in the Keeper's blood,

131
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,755
that when the Keeper
puts an end to all life,

132
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:35,759
he and his court will be granted
eternal immunity from death.

133
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,094
Do you think the Keeper

134
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,230
is interested
in almost winning?

135
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:44,601
Remember the Prophecy,
Darken Rahl.

136
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,937
As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

137
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:50,107
the Keeper is doomed to fail.

138
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,708
A handful of lives
isn't many to spare,

139
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,343
in exchange for millions.

140
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:58,448
I will convey your message
to the Keeper,

141
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,885
and persuade him
to accept your terms.

142
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,690
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

143
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,155
We could tunnel under
the ramparts there.

144
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,957
They don't look more
than 20 hands thick.

145
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,426
(Zedd)
We have no time
for tunneling.

146
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:18,895
There's almost
no time at all.

147
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,397
With the help
of a listening spell,

148
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,033
I've done some eavesdropping
outside the walls.

149
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,935
There's a rumor that
the Margrave has struck a deal

150
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:27,370
with the Sisters
of the Dark.

151
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,973
What kind of deal?

152
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:32,108
Eternal life for the Margrave
and his court,

153
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,943
in exchange
for Kahlan's head.

154
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,547
We have to get in there.

155
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:40,283
We can get over the wall.

156
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,685
And once we're inside?

157
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,019
It'd be
three against hundreds,

158
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,288
with no magic
at our disposal.

159
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,557
I believe
there's another way.

160
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:50,160
Apparently, the Margrave
is about to choose a new bride,

161
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,428
to share with him
the eternity

162
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,164
he is purchasing
with Kahlan's life.

163
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,066
Every high-born beauty
in the Midlands

164
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,434
has been competing
to be chosen

165
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,269
but the Margrave
has narrowed the selection

166
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,338
to the Countess of Dunstable
and the Princess of Thryce.

167
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,008
They'll both be arriving
at the palace tomorrow morning,

168
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,776
where the Margrave--
Why are you telling us

169
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,478
the local gossip,
when Kahlan is going to be

170
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,013
handed over to
the Sisters of the Dark?

171
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,615
Because the Margrave has known
the countess for years,

172
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:16,386
but he knows the princess only
by her glowing reputation.

173
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:18,722
He has never actually
laid eyes on her.

174
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:21,725
If the princess
and her retinue

175
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,493
happened to be intercepted
on their way,

176
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,328
we could arrive
at the palace in their place,

177
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:27,564
and be welcomed
with open arms.

178
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,599
All we'd need is a princess.

179
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Hm.

180
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,110
Oh, no. Mm-mm.

181
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,277
Cara, it could work.

182
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,313
I'm no princess.
(Zedd) No, you're not.

183
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,048
Especially not this princess,

184
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,617
who is renowned
for her delicacy, her charm,

185
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,620
and most especially
her virtue.

186
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,422
But the impossibility
of the task

187
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,657
must not prevent us
from undertaking it.

188
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,994
( all chattering )

189
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,463
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

190
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,240
Her Serene Highness,

191
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:13,076
Princess Lorelyn of Thryce.

192
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:16,746
I think we should dig
the tunnel.

193
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,482
Prince Roderick,

194
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:22,452
renowned for his golden locks,
and his prowess.

195
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,254
He doesn't look
like much of a fighter.

196
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:25,622
Not that kind of prowess.

197
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,657
His reputation is not
the only thing

198
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:29,025
that precedes him
into the room.

199
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,660
If the stories are true,

200
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,762
he's won the favors
of a thousand women.

201
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,931
Wives have been known
to poison their husbands

202
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,467
for a chance to be
number 1001.

203
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,536
And I shall impersonate

204
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,938
the princess' beloved aunt,

205
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:45,375
the Dowager Duchess
of Thryce.

206
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,977
Zedd, I thought you couldn't use
magic to change our appearance.

207
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,280
The spell would dissolve
once we passed the gates.

208
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,682
I don't need magic
to perpetrate the illusion,

209
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,418
just a little color on my cheeks
and my skills as a thespian.

210
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,223
Now, to find a quiet place
where our royal friends

211
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,726
can take a nice
long magical nap.

212
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:07,564
<i>( suspenseful theme playing )</i>

213
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,399
What's that?

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,701
Chamomile, quince
and a touch of saffron.

215
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:15,138
My mother's recipe for putting
a little gold in her tresses.

216
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,640
Should work
just as well on you.

217
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,910
Would that your transformation
were as simple.

218
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,580
You must
unlearn everything

219
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,748
you know and believe.

220
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:28,551
To begin with,
you must never look any man

221
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,320
in the palace directly
in the eye.

222
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:33,389
You must never speak
your mind on any subject,

223
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,959
but always
defer to the opinion

224
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,161
of your
masculine betters.

225
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,395
There's no such thing.

226
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,564
Exactly the attitude

227
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,634
you must abandon.

228
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:45,902
Most challenging of all,

229
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,270
when in the Margrave's
presence,

230
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,073
a lady must always,
without exception,

231
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,775
speak in rhyming
dactylic tetrameter.

232
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,911
In what?

233
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,512
A poetic meter,

234
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:59,415
in which each line
consists of four groups

235
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,117
of three-syllable phrases
with the accent

236
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,352
on the first syllable,

237
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,587
and the first syllable
of the fourth phrase

238
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,390
of each line must rhyme
with the corresponding syllable

239
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,659
on the line before it.
Hm?

240
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,764
I passionately wish
I were.

241
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:18,434
I shall demonstrate
by example.

242
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,839
If the Margrave
were to ask you

243
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,809
"Hasn't the weather
been nice lately?"

244
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,244
You might answer,

245
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:31,547
"The night was a tumult
of thunder and storm,

246
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,651
but ever since then
it's been lovely and warm."

247
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,053
Care to try?

248
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:40,023
There is no way I'm going
to win this competition.

249
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,758
You don't have to win.

250
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,693
You just need to keep us
in the game long enough

251
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,296
for Richard to find
Kahlan and rescue her.

252

Drucilla, my friend,

268
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,720
is your father the count
feeling any better?

269
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,089
If at the Creator's feet
I did kneel,

270
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,458
and she were to grant me
the power to heal,

271
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,561
no greater balm
could my father desire,

272
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:29,465
than the wishes that issue
from you, my dear sire.

273
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,200
( crowd chattering )

274
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,704
No greater balm
could I desire,

275
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,640
than your grace
and charm in my home.

276
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:43,079
I have received
many glowing reports

277
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,414
of your beauty,
princess,

278
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,816
but even the most
glowing of all

279
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,586
failed to do justice
to your radiance.

280
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:57,226
I take it your journey
was pleasant and safe?

281
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,932
The journey was lovely.

282
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:13,776
With only one minus:

283
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:15,912
How long it took to travel

284
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:17,780
to the palace
of Your Highness.

285
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:18,848
( scoffs )

286
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,118
(Margrave)
I confess that I'm puzzled.

287
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,253
I heard that in the art
of meter and rhyme,

288
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,622
nobody surpasses
the Princess of Thryce.

289
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:32,428
( high-pitched )
If I may request
your permission to speak,

290
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:35,398
O great one, before whom
the mighty are meek.

291
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,233
By all means, duchess.

292
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:40,503
From the rigors of travel
the princess is weary,

293
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,607
her senses are dulled
and her vision is bleary,

294
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:48,010
but I can assure you
that when she has rested,

295
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,579
the best you have heard

296
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,648

297
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,250
I hope that's the case.

00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,287
If not, I'll soon be

to travel all this distance,

Why did you thank him?

312
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:43,955
Why did you
look down like that?

313
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,090
Because I'm no longer
the reigning monarch,

314
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:48,826
and by the Law of Right and Good
only the reigning monarch

315
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,362
can look into
the countenance of a man.

316
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:54,165
Arla, does the Law
of Right and Good

317
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,499
command you to die?

318
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,669
The law says that
if a woman disobeys her husband

319
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,871
she will wander forever
in the Underworld,

320
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,207
without family or friends,
utterly alone.

321
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,076
But if she dies
in accord with the law,

322
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:08,579
she will be reunited
with her loved ones,

323
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,247

we shall come at once.

a welcome breath

In order to comply
with the Margrave's request,

350
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,394
the princess must complete
her toilette.

dreamed of seeing

356
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:49,113
the wonders of the Palace
of Rothenberg.

357
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,482
Would it be all right
if I did some exploring?

358
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:54,685
(Herald). Give Prince Roderick
the royal tour.

359
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,754
And see that you stay
close by his side.

360
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,557
We wouldn't want our guest
losing his way.

361
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:07,531
And this is the very spot
that the Duke of Aspasia

362
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,301
was murdered in cold blood
by his mad nephew Hamling.

363
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,836
Fascinating.

364
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:15,072
You can see traces of his blood
on the keystone of that arch.

365
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:18,542
Oh, madam, you've dropped
your handkerchief.

366
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,614
I believe that was
an invitation, sir.

367
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,151
Of course, an invitation.

368
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:29,587
So the stories are true,
Your Highness?

369
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,689
A thousand conquests
to your name?

370
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,959
Well, who keeps count, really.
( chuckles )

371
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,928
Whatever the numbers may be,
perhaps you're in a position

372
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:40,731
to offer me some advice?

373
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:43,968
In, uh, a matter
of the heart.

374
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,138
Would the object
of your affection

375
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,874
happen be my aunt, sir?

376
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:55,246
I've been alone in this palace
for a long time.

377
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:58,549
I could put in a word
for you,

378
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,386
if you'll do me
a favor in return.

379
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:03,954
Anything, sir.

380
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,823
I'm building a dungeon
back in Thryce,

381
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,725
and I've heard
there's nothing equal

382
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,493
to the one
you've got here.

383
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:12,496
I'd love to have a look at it,
maybe get some ideas.

384
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,798
( sighs )

385
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,102
Alas, that is one favor
I am forbidden to grant.

386
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,671
You see, the entire north wing,
which houses the dungeon,

387
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,306
is off limits to visitors.

388
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,475
Well, unfortunately,
my aunt's petticoats

389
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,645
will be off limits to you, sir.

390
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,313
The stones for the dungeon

391
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,916
were dragged by oxen
from the quarry at Rivington.

392
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:35,319
These are the famous
Gates of Misery.

393
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,389
Each of the panels weighs
27 imperial tons.

394
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,792
My interest in the dungeon
isn't strictly architectural.

395
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,163
Of all the women whose delights
I have sampled,

396
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:48,632
the one I've wanted most...

397
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:52,536
( whispers )
...the Mother Confessor,

398
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:55,239
has always been
too dangerous to touch.

399
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,509
But now, if the rumors
are true,

400
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,377
she's within my reach,

401
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:02,179
in a place where
her magic has no power.

402
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,885
If you were to get me
passed those gates,

403
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:10,254
I would do more than put in
a word for you with my aunt.

404
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:13,757
I could virtually
assure you of success.

405
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,994
The only key to the dungeon

406
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:18,696
is in the Margrave's
personal possession.

407
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,464
And at the moment,
nobody is allowed

408
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:21,765
through the Gates
of Misery.

409
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,268
Not even the jailers
guarding the prisoners

410
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,738
in the cells will be allowed
out of the dungeon until--

411
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,373
Until what?

412
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:34,211
Forgive me, sir.

413
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,780
I believe it is time
we returned to the throne room.

414
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:44,922
Your palace is stunning,
O Margrave serene.

415
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,891
The gardens the loveliest
I've ever seen.

416
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,294
The lilies, the roses,
the hyacinths blue,

417
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,596
all gather their beauty

418
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:54,865
in tribute to you.

419
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:55,933
( crowd chuckles )

420
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,744
( gasps )

421
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,280
Clean that up at once!

422
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,982
Servants these days
are hopeless, my liege.

423
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:15,185
One feels in one's house
as if under siege.

424
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,553
(Margrave)
Too true, countess.

425
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,422
In my father's day,
people knew their place.

426
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:20,190
There was such a thing
as discipline.

427
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,562
When my servants drop things,
or grumble, or whine,

428
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:27,531
it's never too long before
they're back in line.

429
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,636
Tell me how you manage it,
princess.

430
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:35,005
Once, long ago,

431
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,574
I was training a slave,

432
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:39,543
who endeavored
most stubbornly

433
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:41,845
not to behave.

434
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,315
So I cut off a finger
or two with a knife,

435
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:47,284
and threatened to slaughter
his child and his wife.

436
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,987
Then I stripped him down naked,
and strapped to a horse,

437
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:52,189
I dragged him through miles
of bramble and gorse,

438
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,592
poured salt in the wounds
and rolled him in rubble,

439
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,829
and that was the last time
he gave any trouble.

440
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,498
Impressive.

441
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,301
I'll have to give it a try.

442
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:07,705
( crowd murmuring )

443
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,207
( women chattering )

444
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,744
( whispering )
The dungeon
isn't heavily guarded,

445
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:15,446
but only the Margrave
has the key.

446
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:18,315
( whispering )
There may be a way
to get it from him.

447
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:19,550
Have you noticed the way

448
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,085
the women in the palace
look at you?

449
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:22,686
Noticed?

450
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:24,254
I've already had three
handkerchiefs

451
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,357
and a garter belt
slipped into my pockets.

452
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,425
Why?

453
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:30,828
The Margrave's sister
Millicent may know where

454
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:32,796
her brother
keeps the key.

455
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,498
If you were to work
your charms on her--

456
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,968
Or should I say
Prince Roderick's charms.

457
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:40,871
--perhaps you could convince
her to get it for you.

458
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:42,806
Where is she?

459
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:43,941
Over there.

460
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:50,581
No, not that one.

461
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:51,715
The other one.

462
00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:56,653
<i>( quirky theme playing )</i>

463
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,025

00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,712
May the Spirits
be with me.

465
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,952
(Drucilla)
Oh, princess,

466
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:31,221
I'm filled with
much admiration.

467
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:35,993
You must show the Margrave
your lovely creation.

468
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:40,631
( crowd murmuring
and chuckling )

469
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,739
My humble attempt
could not ever compare

470
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,774
with something so elegant,

471
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:54,278
simple and spare,
so filled with the light

472
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,646
of the good and the true.

473
00:23:55,647 --> 00:24:00,050
Alas, what you see
is the best I can do.

474
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:01,518
( crowd applauds )

475
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:06,256
Perhaps the princess
has not yet recovered

476
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:07,758
from the rigors of travel?

477
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,895
When her mother was killed
in a fall from the saddle,

478
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:15,365
she was raised by her father
on the trail of battle.

479
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,434
While deficient,
perhaps,

480
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:18,769
in the making of lace,

481
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,905
she has mastered the arts
of the hunt and the chase.

482
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:24,842
The forests of Rothenberg,
so I am told,

483
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:28,245
are teaming with Shadrins
ferocious and bold.

484
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:30,681
Would it be asking
a favor too terribly blunt,

485
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:34,418
if I begged you to give us
the thrill of a hunt?

486
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:41,658
(Margrave)
A wife I could hunt with.

487
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,229
Now, that would be
something worth having.

488
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,700
Does the idea of a hunt sound
like fun to you, countess?

489
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,636
That which
amuses the Margrave,

490
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,671
of course, is to me,
of amusement,

491
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:57,875
the ultimate source.

492
00:24:57,876 --> 00:25:00,177
Then we shall have
a hunt this afternoon.

493
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:03,680
Herald, see to the arrangements.

494
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,616

495
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:06,783
Oh! Ha-ha!

496
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:11,388
( moaning )

497
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,490
You know what?

498
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:16,693
Bedchambers are so boring.

499
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:20,197
Have you ever sampled
the delights of love in chains?

500
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:22,132
Sounds exciting.

( laughs )

505
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:30,941
Then shall we continue
this in the dungeon?

506
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:32,209
I wish we could,

507
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,012
but only my brother
has the key.

508
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,013
Oh.

00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,214

510
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,515
Get it from him.

( chuckles )

512
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,084
Women are never allowed

513
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:42,986
to carry the keys
to anything.

514
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:44,187
But that's all right.

515
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:50,661
We'll make our
own chains right here.

Guards.

When you are presentable,
you will stand before me,

522
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:09,580

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,380
Brother, you're always
so mean and unfair.

532
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:43,618
If you care for my feelings,
his life you will spare.

533
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:46,454
After you've chosen a bride,
you'll be set.

534
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:49,323
You'll have a darling
to coddle and pet.

535
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:51,225
You'll have a plaything

536
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,227
that's yours for all time.

537
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:57,632

Why shouldn't I have
a plaything that's mine?

539
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,643
Out of the great love
I feel for my sister,

540
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:13,648
I will temper justice
with mercy.

541
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,217
Are you willing to marry
the woman you have defiled?

542
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,291
Not willing, sir.

543
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:26,427
Eager.

544
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,029
( crowd murmuring )

545
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,030
It is my greatest wish.

546
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:31,766
Then your wish is granted.

547
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,436
But until you
are properly wed,

548
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,605
my guards shall stay
with you wherever you go,

549
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,273
to make sure you don't
assault the virtue

550
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:41,709
of any more ladies
of this court.

551
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,645
And now to the hunt.

552
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:53,821
I'll never get
near the dungeon now.

553
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:56,724
I'm afraid there's
only one hope left to us.

554
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,659
For Cara to get close
enough to the Margrave

555
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,361
to steal the key.

556
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,596
You must
do exactly as I say.

557
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,798
When in the hunt,

558
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,533
a woman must never
take the lead,

559
00:28:05,534 --> 00:28:08,402
she must never--
Forget the lessons.

560
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:11,405
I've minced
and curtsied and rhymed,

561
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,641
and we still
don't have the key.

562
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,810
I'll get it my way.

563
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,079
Without your Agiels?

564
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,048
I don't need magic
to make a man beg for mercy.

565
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:24,952

My lady, forgive me
for being so forward,

569
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,739
but if your niece
should win,

570
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,173
then Rothenberg will
be your home

571
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,576
as well as mine
for a very long time.

572
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:51,645
It will be good
not to be alone

You're very forward indeed, sir.

I know I am below
your station,

576
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:03,324
but my influence
with the Margrave is great.

577
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,526
I could do much to advance
the cause of your princess

578
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:06,660
over that of her rival.

579
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:11,832

to share my interest in

Welcome to Rothenberg,
Sister Nicci.

You're just in time
to join our banquet.

618
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:14,722
I'm not here
for revelry, Margrave.

00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,991
I'm here to complete
our arrangement.

Our agreement,

But before Iend for her,
I need to see if the contract

reflects the terms
we agreed on.

00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,995

that the Margrave's special
visitor's arrived.

You know what that means,

Almost time to line up

Who wants to go first?

We can't wait any longer.

635
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:20,596
I can't do the thing
you're asking.

636
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:23,599
Any woman who took up arms
would die instantly,

637
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,000
and be damned
for eternity.

638
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,568
I've taken up arms all my life

639
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,003
and I haven't died.

640
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:31,640
I was taken from my people
in Nargoth when I was a child,

641
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:35,344
and raised in Rothenberg
to be the Margrave's wife.

642
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:37,145
If I die
as the law bids me to,

643
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:39,548
I'll be reunited
with my mother and father

644
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,850
in the Underworld.

645
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:46,355
If I die, the Keeper will
destroy all of life.

646
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:48,257
Do you understand that?

647
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,425
The Law of Right and Good
says that to a woman

648
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,327
understanding
is not given.

649
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:55,664
And who wrote
this Law of Right and Good?

650
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,733
A man?

651
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,434
No.

652
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,169
The Creator wrote the law.

653
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,671
In her own hand.

654
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,606
And what does the law
say about the Creator?

655
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,475
It is written:

656
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:07,910
"From the Source of Light

657
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,645
"flows all that is good,

658
00:33:09,646 --> 00:33:10,879
"all that is love,

659
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,648
and all that is peace."

660
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,252
So you believe that the source
of all that is good

661
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:19,288
would punish someone
for staying alive

662
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,658
so that she could hold
her mother in her arms again?

663
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,227
Do you believe that the Creator

664
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:28,130
wants all of life
to be destroyed?

665
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,334
I'm frightened.

00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:33,702

667
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,541
The Creator will
be with us,

668
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,277
every step of the way.

Who is this woman,

710
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,790
and why are you taking
directions from her?

711
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

712
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,661
( sneezes )

713
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,364
( high-pitched )
These drafty old halls
have given me a nasty cold.

714
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:18,033
I know you from somewhere.

715
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:19,801
I can't imagine
where, madam.

716
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,369
Let me see your face.

717
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,939
(Zedd)
Madam?

718
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,782
Maybe you don't remember me

719
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:36,451
because you're not the only one
whose appearance has changed

720
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:39,054
since the last time
we saw each other.

721
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:42,491
But how could I ever forget
the man who killed me?

722
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,027
This is no woman.

723
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:49,831
This is the Wizard,
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

724
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,633
Impossible.

725
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,903
( guests gasp )

726
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,671
The Seeker.

727
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,440
What?
(Nicci) Kill them both.

728
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,342
( guests gasp )

729
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,776
Take me to the dungeon.

730
00:37:01,777 --> 00:37:03,111
There's no need
for a weapon.

731
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,082
I will happily
show you the way.

732
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,384

Tell me where the key is,

738
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:44,496
or there's going
to be a royal decapitation.

739
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,667
It's sewn inside my vest.

<i>( tense theme playing )</i>

741
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,445
Dear Margrave, the sight
of your face makes me sick.

742
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,549
You decadent, pompous,
self-satisfied--

743

744
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,186
(Arla)
Help!

745
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,456
The Mother Confessor,
I think she stopped breathing!

746
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,392
If she dies on my watch,
I'll be the one on the block.

747
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,194
What happened?

748
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,729
She slashed her own throat.

749
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,932
She said she didn't want to give
the Margrave the satisfaction.

750
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,867
Dark Spirits on
the race of Confessors.

We have to go.

00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:10,249
I can't. The law.

759
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,818
But you fought them.
For you.

760
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,487
But your laws are not my laws.

761
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,623
I can't disobey my husband.

762
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,625
My life is in his hands.

00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,260
I can't leave you.

00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:22,461
You must.

765
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:24,163
So you can defeat the Keeper.

Your life is in your hands,
Arla.

767
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,803
Only yours.

You have no magic here.

Your Majesty, are you all right?

What happened?
Where is she?

787

The Royal Party of Thryce

788
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:14,773
was not the Royal
Party of Thryce.

789
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,642
They deceived us all.

790
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,844
They're gone.

791
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,048
And Sister Nicci?

792
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:25,784
Gone also, Margrave.

793
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,354
Well, if I'm not going
to live forever,

794
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,323
I'll spend my years
with a beautiful wife.

795
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:32,991
Summon Countess Drucilla.

796
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,928
And let it be known I've chosen
her to be my bride.

797
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,997
Alas, when she
discovered that eternity

798
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,767
was not part
of the marriage contract,

799
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:44,269
she departed.

800
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,139
Then bring the queen
from the dungeon.

801
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,807
Tell her
all has been forgiven.

802
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,509
It's better to have
an old reliable mare

803
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,211
than no horse at all,
wouldn't you say?

805
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,282
Unfortunately,
the queen has escaped.

But don't despair,
Your Majesty.

us close to Nargoth.

you get home safe.

To Nargoth, then.

you may never
need another Agiel.

And had you done
this a year ago,

And if you're going
to wear a hem that short,

825
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:42,961
you should get rid
of the stockings

826
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,529
