<i>Richard Cypher,
you are the true seeker.</i>

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,654
<i>GIRL:
Kahlan.</i>

4
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:42,895
Kahlan Amnell.

5
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Soon you'll be the last
of your kind.

6
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:55,162
What's wrong?

7
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:58,162
Nothing.
It was just a bad dream.

8
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:59,621
Tell me about it.

9
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,020
I was in a desert.

10
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,663
There was a bird

11
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:08,363
and a blind girl.

12
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:11,829
A Starless Blackbird of Caska.

13
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:13,895
I'm trying to sleep here.

14
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,221
That wasn't any ordinary dream.
That was a message.

15
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,563
It belongs
to a Dream Caster.

16
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:23,162
A magical clan of nomads living
in a desert far away from here.

17
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:27,762
Every generation, a blackbird
befriends a small child.

18
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,829
That child is then recognized
as the high priestess

19
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,363
and has the power to send dreams
on the wings of birds.

20
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,096
The girl in my dream,

21
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,429
she told me soon I would
be the last of my kind.

22
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:41,962
It could be a warning

23
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,096
that the line of Confessors
is in danger.

24
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,096
I have to go to Valeria,

25
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,630
make sure my sister's safe.

26
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:51,196
Valeria? That's hundreds
of leagues from here.

27
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,129
RICHARD:
You can't travel alone.

28
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:55,096
I'll go with you.

29
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:58,396
I thought there was nothing
more important than taking him

30
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:02,229
and this magic rune to Pamorah
to find the Stone of Tears.

31
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,630
Zedd, you go on
with Cara and Flynn.

32
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,496
We'll catch up with you
as soon as we can.

33
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:07,887
It's a waste of time.

34
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:11,187
Why do you say that?

35
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,020
The Confessors living
on Valeria are dead.

36
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,129
When Darken Rahl found out

37
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,096
there was a male Confessor
living on Valeria,

38
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,062
he ordered us
to bring him the child,

39
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,996
but when we
stormed the island

40
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,621
the mother sacrificed the baby
so we couldn't take it.

41
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:31,630
And the mother?

42
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,829
She was eliminated.
KAHLAN: My sister?

43
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,096
Dennee is dead?

44
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,895
There was no pain.

45
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,688
I killed her swiftly.

46
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,895
Kahlan?

47
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,096
What's happening to her?
It's the Con Dar.

48
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,762
Kahlan.
ZEDD: Stay back!

49
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,129
Cara, you have
to leave now!

50
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:52,187
I only did
what I was ordered to.

51
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,996
I can't hold her
much longer. Run!

52
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,196
But I swore to serve you.

53
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,762
RICHARD:
That isn't possible anymore.

54
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:08,421
Get out of here now!

55
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,821
RICHARD:
Are you all right?

56
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,087
You shouldn't have stopped me.

57
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:24,962
RICHARD:
You were in the Con Dar.

58
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,563
Killing Cara out of vengeance
wouldn't help you,

59
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:30,062
only the Keeper.

60
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,062
Richard, this isn't
about vengeance.

61
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:38,296
She's a Mord-Sith,
trained to torture and kill.

62
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:41,929
Who knows where she'll go
or what she'll do now.

63
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,396
I have to find her
and stop her.

64
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:47,129
We have a small problem.
What is it?

65
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,129
Flynn has gone.
What?

66
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:50,829
Only a momentary setback.

67
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,696
I was afraid the scamp
might up and leave,

68
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,596
so I took precautions.

69
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:57,187
Magical precautions.

70
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:03,596
You spelled his shoes.

71
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,388
All we have to do
is follow his footsteps.

72
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:12,463
If we don't find Flynn
and get the Stone of Tears,

73
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,630
the Keeper will to destroy
every living thing.

74
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:17,554
So you can come with us...

75
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,821
Or you can go after Cara.

76
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,755
If I ever see her again,
I'll kill her.

77
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,987
MAN:
She's a Mord-Sith.

78
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:13,196
Please, we don't
want any trouble.

79
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:15,621
All I want is a room
and a hot meal.

80
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:24,721
And maybe something
a little sweet.

81
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:46,463
It's much too early for this.

82
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:49,221
We don't want your kind here.

83
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,730
BARKEEP:
Nobody wants you.

84
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,529
Why don't you get out
of my tavern

85
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,688
and go back to whatever vile pit
you crawled out of?

86
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:33,187
Looks like someone stopped
for a nap.

87
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,855
Good morning, princess.

88
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,962
"Figured you wouldn't use magic
on me because of the rune,

89
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,596
"but just in case you spelled
my clothes and shoes,

90
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,463
"I've left them behind.

91
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,263
"Good luck finding
that Stone of Tears.

92
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:04,129
Your biggest admirer,
Flynn."

93
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,496
He's clever,
I'll give him that.

94
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,862
He's also naked.

95
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,154
How far can he get?

96
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,821
Ella!

97
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:38,829
MAN:
Get away from my daughter.

98
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,895
It's all right.
Mama's here.

99
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,821
I'm not here to hurt anybody.

100
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:49,755
Then leave, now, before I put
this arrow through your eye.

101
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:56,221
Wait.
Grace, stay away from her.

102
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:02,855
Cara?

103
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,529
Yes.
You know her?

104
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:13,230
She's my sister.

105
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,355
+

106
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,914
Please, wait.

107
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:34,624
I'm sorry about my husband.

108
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:36,590
He was only trying
to protect our daughter.

109
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,023
There's no need to explain.

110
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:40,148
I can't believe it's you.

111
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,749
It was a mistake
for me to come here.

112
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,490
No, please.

113
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,023
You look so tired and hungry.

114
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,115
At least let me give you
something to eat.

115
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,382
Could you do me one favor?

116
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,357
Your leather will terrify the
children.

117
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,382
Would you mind changing?

118
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,181
This should fit.

119
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,590
Remember when we were little
and Mother made us

120
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,956
those matching dresses?

121
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,382
Where is our mother?

122
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,856
After you were taken,

123
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,715
the worry and grief
made her sick.

124
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:32,823
When the Mord-Sith
came back and took Father,

125
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:35,914
it was too much.
Her heart gave out.

126
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,914
Do you know
what happened to Father?

127
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,881
You don't want to know.

128
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,914
Well...

129
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,715
I'll let you change.

130
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,290
<i>MOTHER:
Hold still, Cara.</i>

131
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:12,856
Is it almost done?

132
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,281
Almost.

133
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:19,515
Wait till your father sees
how pretty you look.

134
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,582
You wear it much better
than I do.

135
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:56,215
Ella, pass Cara the potatoes.

136
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,390
Don't move!

137
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,923
MAN:
Don't move!

138
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:08,423
Her weapons are in the bedroom.

139
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,823
Sirian? Why?

140
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,457
Your husband did
the right thing.

141
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,357
I know how badly you want
to believe she's your sister,

142
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,223
but she's a Mord-Sith.

143
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:20,048
Your sister's never coming back.

144
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:26,490
<i>ZEDD:
We're looking for a young man</i>

145
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,190
<i>with hair the color of sand,</i>

146
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,724
blue eyes,
about this tall,

147
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,090
and a swelled head
about so big.

148
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,856
Heh. A local tailor
found him half-naked

149
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,856
in his shop
a couple nights ago,

150
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,523
stealing clothes.

151
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:42,056
By the time we got there,
he was gone.

152
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,823
Do you have any idea what
direction he might be headed?

153
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:47,490
Well, Black Arrow's Point
is only a day's journey.

154
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:48,889
It's a rich town.

155
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:50,648
If I were a thief,
that's where I'd go.

156
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:55,956
Mother Confessor?

157
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,515
Yes?

158
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:02,323
Please excuse
my ill-mannered interruption.

159
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,590
I've been searching
for you for days.

160
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,956
I bring an urgent message
from the people of Stowecroft.

161
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,490
What is it?

162
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:11,290
We've arrested a Mord-Sith.

163
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,115
We need you to execute her.

164
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,923
KAHLAN:
You don't need me to find Flynn.

165
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,090
I'm going to Stowecroft.

166
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:24,014
Since when is the Mother
Confessor an executioner?

167
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:27,657
If they want Cara dead,

168
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,190
why don't they just
do it themselves?

169
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:32,315
Because they've condemned her to
the harshest fate possible...

170
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,123
Death by confession.

171
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:39,215
What do you mean?

172
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:47,457
Confession works differently
on Mord-Sith.

173
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,990
Once touched, they suffer
in agony until they die.

174
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:51,724
So they don't just
want to execute her,

175
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,257
they want to make her suffer.

176
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,624
They want to make an example.

177
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,223
This isn't right.
The people deserve justice.

178
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,023
Captain Arturis said
that the Mord-Sith

179
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,457
have been stealing little girls
from their town for years.

180
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,956
And we'll find a way
to stop that,

181
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,090
but it sounds like these people
want to punish Cara

182
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:07,690
for every bad thing
the Mord-Sith have ever done.

183
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,789
Richard,
she killed my sister.

184
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,823
And I am so sorry for that,

185
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:14,523
but that is exactly why you
can't be fair about this.

186
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,690
You've already accused me
of wanting vengeance.

187
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,257
This is different.
It's the will of the people.

188
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,348
You say it's the will
of the people?

189
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:26,590
Then if I can prove
to them that Cara's

190
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,923
not the monster
they think she is,

191
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,315
will you spare her life?

192
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,956
What is it about this woman

193
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,648
that makes you always want
to come to her rescue?

194
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,415
I believe people can change.

195
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,415
MAN:
Rot in the Underworld.

196
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,014
Here, drink this.

197
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,281
Drop it!

198
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:20,690
Are you hurt?

199
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,690
It takes more than a few stones
to break a Mord-Sith.

200
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:25,523
Take her out of the stocks,
put her in jail.

201
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:31,523
Come to get your revenge,
is that it, Mother Confessor?

202
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,048
Get her out of my sight.

203
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:36,756
Don't fight.

204
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,181
I'm going to get
you out of this.

205
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:43,923
Before her sentence
is carried out,

206
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,889
the Seeker has requested
to speak on her behalf.

207
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,257
We asked you to come here
to execute her.

208
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,523
ALL: Yeah.
I'm not an executioner,

209
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,056
I'm the Mother Confessor.

210
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,582
And before her fate is decided,
there will be a hearing.

211
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,690
And who will decide what happens
to her after this hearing?

212
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:02,756
You? The Seeker?

213
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,823
The decision will be left
to three of your town's

214
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,257
most fair-minded elders.

215
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,515
And if the elders
still want her dead?

216
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:15,482
Then I will carry out
their wishes.

217
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,483
+

218
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,206
Hey!
Oh. Sorry, sir.

219
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:30,166
It's fine, it's fine.

220
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,565
Oh, my mistake.

221
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,007
Here you are, sir.

222
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:47,607
Oh. Why--
Why thank you, young man.

223
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:50,540
But I seem to have lost
my coin purse as well.

224
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:52,007
Perhaps you've seen it?
Sorry, sir,

225
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:53,565
all I saw
was the handkerchief.

226
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,074
Why are you wasting time
picking pockets

227
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,874
when there's real coin
to be made with this?

228
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,507
What, this? It's just
an old prison tattoo.

229
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:08,999
Oh. Either you're lying
or you're stupid.

230
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,940
The rune on your hand
is a key

231
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,273
to one of the most precious
objects in the world:

232
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,674
The Stone of Tears.

233
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,974
Oh, yeah?
What do you know about it?

234
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,273
Oh, I happen to know
a thing or two

235
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,874
about priceless artifacts.

236
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,173
Now, do you know
what you have to do

237
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:27,607
once you get to Pamorah?

238
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,206
No, why don't you tell me?

239
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:31,607
Oh, no, no, no.

240
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,473
I have another idea.

241
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,340
We go to Pamorah together.

242
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:38,206
We get the Stone of Tears
and we split the profits.

243
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,698
And what if I don't
like that idea?

244
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,540
Oh, well,
then here's another.

245
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,607
Excuse me, madam, but have
you seen the local constable?

246
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,007
I hear there's
a pickpocket about.

247
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,732
All right. All right,
you made your point.

248
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,340
No matter what you say,
they're going to kill me.

249
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:58,407
Not if I can
show them the truth.

250
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,206
What truth is that?

251
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,707
That you're
a different person now

252
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,273
than you were
under Darken Rahl.

253
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:06,074
That you yourself are a victim
of the Mord-Sith.

254
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,774
That's absurd.

255
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:09,907
Cara, I spent time
in a Mord-Sith temple.

256
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,099
I know what they do
to break people.

257
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,907
You think because you
were poked a few times

258
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,065
with an Agiel
you know anything about me?

259
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,141
Being chosen by the Mord-Sith

260
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,340
was the highest honor
of my life.

261
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,206
Your pride is going
to get you killed.

262
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:31,373
I'd rather die than grovel
on my knees and beg for mercy.

263
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:35,306
Unless that's an order,
Lord Rahl?

264
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:38,041
I'm not the Lord Rahl.

265
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,707
And I'm not ashamed
of who I am.

266
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,340
What did you think
was going to happen

267
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:43,640
when you came back here?

268
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:45,807
That they were going
to welcome you with open arms?

269
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,607
You sent me away.

270
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,465
I didn't know where else to go.

271
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,999
Is there anyone here who would
speak on your behalf?

272
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,431
Maybe my sister.

273
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,573
RICHARD:
Because of this woman,

274
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:10,340
all of you here are free
from Darken Rahl.

275
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,540
I couldn't have defeated him
without her help.

276
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,540
Before you condemn her to death,

277
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,874
I only ask that you
listen to the story

278
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,665
of how she
became what she is.

279
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,473
Mord-Sith are not born,
they are broken.

280
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:25,473
Every one of them starts out
as an innocent little girl

281
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,232
and Cara was no different.

282
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,398
Grace, tell us about
the day Cara was taken.

283
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,640
We were fishing
with our father.

284
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,765
I-I was 12.

285
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,507
<i>Cara was 9.</i>

286
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,107
GRACE:
I got one, I got one.

287
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,007
All right, let me show
you how to haul it in

288
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,540
so you won't lose it.

289
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,598
GRACE:
Look!

290
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,740
What kind of fish is it,
Father?

291
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:05,732
I'm not sure.
What do you think, Cara?

292
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,507
It's a baby fish.

293
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:15,965
You think we should put it back
in the water so it can grow up?

294
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,141
<i>GRACE:
She was so sweet.</i>

295
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,232
She couldn't even
kill a fish.

296
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:25,598
And then what happened?

297
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:28,765
They came.

298
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,099
BOTH: Father!

299
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,298
Father!

300
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,440
GRACE:
Cara!

301
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:49,273
Cara!

302
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:53,041
<i>GRACE:
That was the last time
I saw my sister.</i>

303
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,640
A few days later, they came
back and took our father.

304
00:20:56,765 --> 00:21:00,099
I never understood why.

305
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,740
Not a day goes by
that I don't think

306
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:04,640
of my family
and miss them.

307
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,107
That my father
could have lived

308
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,573
to have seen
his grandchildren,

309
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,141
take them fishing.

310
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:16,166
He wasn't the kind,
caring man you think he was.

311
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:21,507
He was a gutless,
selfish,

312
00:21:21,632 --> 00:21:23,373
pathetically weak bastard.

313
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:26,740
How can you say such things?

314
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,607
Because it's the truth.

315
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,632
He deserved what he got.

316
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,273
Did they--?

317
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:36,665
Did they kill him?

318
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,765
No.

319
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:42,841
I did.

320
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,966
+

321
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,856
She is boasting about
murdering her own father.

322
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,182
What more do you
need to hear?

323
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:54,615
Why she did it.

324
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,449
What the Mord-Sith
did to make her do it,

325
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:58,648
because an innocent little girl
doesn't just turn

326
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,116
into a killer for no reason.

327
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,615
Mother Confessor,

328
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,649
you are forcing
the people of this town

329
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,715
to relive terrible days.
And for what purpose?

330
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,949
So she can mock us?

331
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:10,782
It's false pride, she's covering
how she really feels, I'm sure.

332
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,649
No one has to sit and listen

333
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,815
if they don't want to.

334
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,207
The hearing will continue.

335
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,149
Thank you.
He's right, Richard.

336
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:27,249
You're putting
the people of this town

337
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:28,907
through a great deal
of heartache.

338
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,907
I hope it's worth it.

339
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:37,316
<i>RICHARD:
I was once captured and
tortured by the Mord-Sith.</i>

340
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,848
And this is what they
tormented me with,

341
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,982
the Agiel.

342
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,516
It causes
unimaginable pain.

343
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:46,915
I can only hold it because
I was tortured with one.

344
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,382
Is there anyone in the hall

345
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:50,907
brave enough
to feel its effects?

346
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,649
I will.

347
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:57,949
Sirian.

348
00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,583
I have to warn you,

349
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,349
this is going to hurt
worse than anything

350
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:02,882
you've ever felt
in your life.

351
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,274
You'll only be proving
what beasts the Mord-Sith are.

352
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:17,049
They used this on Cara
to train her.

353
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:19,216
And she was
a 9-year-old girl.

354
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:21,416
Tell us what happened when
you were first captured.

355
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:26,907
I was taught strength
and endurance.

356
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:33,907
Please. I want my mother.

357
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,949
<i>CARA:
When I was awake,</i>

358
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:39,115
<i>I was beaten with the Agiel,</i>

359
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,449
and when I tried to sleep,

360
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:43,307
the rats gnawed
on my fingers and toes.

361
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:46,915
<i>Even when I slept in a ball,</i>

362
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,482
they'd feast on my ears.

363
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,815
How long did that go on?

364
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,382
Not very.

365
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,616
The Mord-Sith
gave me the opportunity

366
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,474
to kill my tormentors.

367
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:02,149
NATHAIR:
You don't have to suffer these
little beasts any longer, Cara.

368
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,282
If you wanna
get rid of them,

369
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:05,074
all you have to do
is kill them.

370
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:10,982
I don't wanna
kill anything.

371
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,174
NATHAIR:
Would you rather
they kill you?

372
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,982
Then listen
to me carefully, Cara.

373
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,882
In this world,
it is kill or be killed.

374
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:24,349
If you want to die the death
of a thousand little nibbles,

375
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:26,082
that is your
decision to make,

376
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:29,115
but if you consider your life
more important than a rat's,

377
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,741
then you must kill them.

378
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,349
<i>CARA:
It took me some time
to find the courage</i>

379
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,808
<i>to learn to withstand
the pain of the Agiel...</i>

380
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,349
...but in the end,

381
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:50,040
I killed every rat
in that cell.

382
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:54,216
Cara, no one can blame you
for killing the rats.

383
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,882
Under those circumstances,
who wouldn't get rid of them?

384
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:59,416
But your own father?

385
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,182
What did they do
to make you kill him?

386
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:03,316
They didn't force me to do it.

387
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:05,782
They gave me the honor.

388
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,049
NATHAIR:
Cara.

389
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,541
Look who's come
to see you.

390
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:15,848
Father! Please,
take me away from here.

391
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,915
NATHAIR:
No, no, Cara.
He didn't come to rescue you.

392
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,748
He came to sell
your sister to us.

393
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:23,149
You're lying.

394
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:25,216
My father wouldn't do that.

395
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,149
NATHAIR:
How do you think
we found you?

396
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:29,449
He told us exactly
where you'd be fishing.

397
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,848
We paid him handsomely
for his little girl,

398
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:33,748
and now he wants
to sell us the other one.

399
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:37,474
If you don't believe me,
ask him yourself.

400
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:40,873
Father?

401
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:46,107
Tell your daughter
what you did.

402
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,182
Look at him, Cara.

403
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:54,015
He's so ashamed, he can't even
bring himself to say it.

404
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,708
He sold you.

405
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,249
NATHAIR:
I know this hurts, Cara,

406
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:11,616
but now you see how ugly
common families are.

407
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:15,249
They betray each other because
they're greedy and weak.

408
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,782
But now you have
the Mord-Sith.

409
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:20,015
We're your true
family now, Cara.

410
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,216
We love you so much.

411
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,616
We'll even give you the honor
of killing the monster

412
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,708
who betrayed you.

413
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:32,115
<i>CARA:
They put the Agiel in my hand,</i>

414
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
and I killed him.

415
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:43,115
What they did to you...

416
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,649
Made me powerful.

417
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,649
RICHARD:
You were a little girl.

418
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,416
They manipulated you.

419
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,282
You so badly wanna
believe that, don't you?

420
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:54,848
That I didn't have a choice.

421
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:57,049
You didn't.

422
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:59,649
This takes away
the choice, Cara.

423
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,748
The Mord-Sith
can make a person

424
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:03,949
say or do anything
they want with this.

425
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,840
It almost made me kill
the person I love most.

426
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,949
But you didn't, did you?

427
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:13,249
Because your love for her

428
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,574
was strong enough to overcome
everything they did to you.

429
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,583
My father's love for me wasn't.

430
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,549
He cracked like an egg.

431
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:26,082
The day I killed him,

432
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,949
the sisters of the Agiel
welcomed me into their family.

433
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:30,182
Where are your sisters now?

434
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:31,482
Last I remember,
your family

435
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:32,949
beat you to within
an inch of your life

436
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,282
and left you for dead
at the bottom of a ravine.

437
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:36,649
If it weren't for
the Mord-Sith

438
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:39,149
making me into what I am now,
you'd be dead.

439
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:41,216
Yes. Why did you
save my life?

440
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,674
Because you're
the true Lord Rahl.

441
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,216
But you didn't
believe that at the time.

442
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,815
What are you trying
to get me to say?

443
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,516
That you're sorry
for killing your father.

444
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:54,349
That you never wanted
for any of this to happen.

445
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:57,416
That the Mord-Sith
took your life from you.

446
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,873
They're the ones that
are trying to take my life.

447
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,782
You believe I'm your Lord Rahl?

448
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:08,316
You're too proud
to save your own life? Fine.

449
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,583
Then as Lord Rahl,
ruler of D'Hara,

450
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,149
master of the Mord-Sith,

451
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,982
I command you
to tell me everything.

452
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,082
WOMAN:
Stop this.

453
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:18,249
Who are you?

454
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:20,583
I was Cara's school teacher.

455
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:25,182
What the people of this town
are doing to her is horrible.

456
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:28,583
I remember Cara
as a little girl.

457
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,416
She was such a good student.

458
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,216
So smart,
always wanting to please.

459
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:37,516
Certainly, the Seeker
has proven his point.

460
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:40,374
We shouldn't be punishing her,
we should be pitying her.

461
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:43,882
She is a depraved murderer.

462
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,382
We should have
killed her by now.

463
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:46,748
CROWD:
Yeah.

464
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,516
Silence.

465
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,416
Guards,
don't let anyone leave.

466
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,774
I wanna speak to you.

467
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,583
<i>KAHLAN:
I don't trust
the school teacher.</i>

468
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,949
Somebody agrees with me,
defends Cara,

469
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,149
and now
you don't trust her?

470
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:07,216
It's not because she
agrees with you, Richard,

471
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:08,748
it's because
I can't read her.

472
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,374
There's only one kind of person
that I can't read.

473
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:15,182
Who is this woman to you?

474
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:18,140
She told you.
She was my teacher.

475
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,474
Remember, I've ordered you
to tell me the truth. All of it.

476
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,015
I am telling you the truth.

477
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,082
She taught me.

478
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,649
Everything.

479
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,240
I want my mother.

480
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,015
Miss Crantan?

481
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,949
Here, with my true family,

482
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:47,940
I am called Mistress Nathair.

483
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:51,649
You were always
my favorite, Cara.

484
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:54,341
That's why I chose you.

485
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:58,915
Grab her.
WOMAN: Kill her!

486
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,115
We trusted her
with our children.

487
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Monster.
Guards, subdue him.

488
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,049
How many children have you
taken from this town?

489
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:13,349
Twelve girls have gone
missing over the years,

490
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,416
and they were all
her students.

491
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:18,915
Mother Confessor,
we've heard enough.

492
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,015
We've made our decision.

493
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,015
For what she's done,

494
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,940
it is our will that this woman
die by confession.

495
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,583
She has shown no remorse.

496
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:35,616
It is our will that
she also die by confession.

497
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:38,607
CROWD:
Yes.

498
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,107
Will the Mother Confessor abide
by the wishes of our elders?

499
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,383
I will.

500
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:56,508
+

501
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:07,528
I've never seen
such a carnival act.

502
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:09,539
One shoots fire
out of his hands,

503
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,205
the other carries
a magical torture stick,

504
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,138
and the Confessor?

505
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:17,764
Make her mad,
her eyes turn red and boom!

506
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:25,039
And the Seeker. Ha!

507
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:26,505
If he was so good
at seeking,

508
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,372
you'd have think he'd
have found me by now.

509
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:30,472
I think that old fool
of the First Order

510
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,405
gave the Sword of Truth
to the wrong farm boy,

511
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,664
that's what I think.
Do you ever stop talking?

512
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,973
Well, since I've got this,

513
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,164
I guess you're stuck
listening to me, aren't you?

514
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:44,831
Have another drink.

515
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:50,839
What the--?

516
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:53,405
Oh, don't bother
trying to move.

517
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,739
I put an elixir
in your drink.

518
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:56,105
Why?

519
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,405
Because I suddenly realized:

520
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,772
I only need one part of you.

521
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,639
And it's not the part
that talks.

522
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:04,230
Wait. Wait.

523
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:08,906
Help! Help!

524
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:11,131
Help me! Help.

525
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,939
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up.

526
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:18,697
Or I'll do much worse to you
than just cut your hand off.

527
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:50,597
"Fool of the First Order," eh?

528
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,630
ZEDD:
No!

529
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,772
C-Can't move.

530
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,339
That lunatic put something
in my drink.

531
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:06,472
Dear Spirits.
You're lucky I found you

532
00:33:06,597 --> 00:33:07,839
or you'd be dead by now.

533
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:10,363
You can make whatever
he did go away, right?

534
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,739
I can't use magic because
of the rune, remember?

535
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:19,205
I'll just have to wait
until it wears off.

536
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,105
Thank you.

537
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,339
If you weren't such
a muttonhead, you'd know better

538
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:25,439
than to run away from
the only people in the world

539
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,697
who can keep you safe.

540
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:47,664
I'll see you in the Underworld,
Mother Confessor.

541
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:08,672
Oh, what have I done?

542
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,839
Oh, please. Forgive me.

543
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:12,973
Your remorse is meaningless.

544
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,672
You only feel that way
because you've been confessed.

545
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:18,539
NATHAIR:
Wait. Before you confess her,
there's something you must know.

546
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,606
The Seeker was right.

547
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:24,098
We forced Cara
to believe a lie.

548
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,505
The hearing is over.
Confess her.

549
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,706
No, you don't understand!
I must tell the truth.

550
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:33,172
Confess her!

551
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:35,198
Let her speak.

552
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:42,464
I tortured her father
for weeks.

553
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:48,672
If you want this to stop,

554
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,105
all you have to do is tell
your daughter that you sold her.

555
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,372
Never!

556
00:34:53,497 --> 00:34:54,806
But no matter what I did,

557
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:59,131
his love for his little girl
was too strong.

558
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,205
He wouldn't break.

559
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,397
F-Finally,

560
00:35:09,497 --> 00:35:12,806
I decided that if he wouldn't
say what I wanted him to say,

561
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,205
then I--

562
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,098
I would take away
his ability to speak at all.

563
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:20,939
We burned his throat.

564
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,464
No! No--

565
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:29,973
NATHAIR:
You were so young,

566
00:35:30,098 --> 00:35:33,263
and it was so easy to make
you believe what we wanted.

567
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,964
Tell your daughter
what you did.

568
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,405
Look at him, Cara,
he's so ashamed

569
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,138
he can't even bring
himself to say it.

570
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:47,739
He sold you.

571
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:52,405
<i>You wanted so badly for him
to say that it was all a lie,</i>

572
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,297
but he couldn't say it,
even if he wanted to.

573
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,263
Confess me.

574
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,131
I deserve it.

575
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,931
MAN:
Confessor!

576
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:55,697
I have looked
into this woman's eyes,

577
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:01,230
and I see now that
she is truly remorseful.

578
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:07,572
Her life was taken
from her as a child.

579
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:10,405
I will not take it
from her again.

580
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,472
You said you'd abide
by our decision!

581
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,772
As Mother Confessor,
it is within my authority

582
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:16,272
to overrule that decision.

583
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:18,672
Then we'll kill her ourselves.

584
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:20,098
CROWD:
Yeah!

585
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:57,372
Stop!

586
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:58,897
Confess her.

587
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,272
The Mother Confessor
follows no one's orders.

588
00:38:04,397 --> 00:38:07,872
If you don't confess her,
I'll shoot you

589
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,473
and then I'll shoot her.

590
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:11,598
+

591
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:43,074
The Mother Confessor's
word is final!

592
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,661
Where's Cara?

593
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:03,595
We decided it was best
if she didn't come.

594
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,728
Because of Dennee?

595
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:08,062
So you wouldn't have
to wake up every morning

596
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:10,887
and see the face of the person
who took your sister's life.

597
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,595
Where will she go?

598
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,987
I don't know.

599
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,661
She saved my life.

600
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,062
And you spared hers.

601
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:27,695
Kahlan,
what you did for her

602
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,187
even after you found out
about Dennee...

603
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,786
Thank you.

604
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,621
When I saw that crossbow
aimed at my head,

605
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,786
I thought of the warning
in my dream.

606
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,095
If I die, the line of Confessors
could perish forever.

607
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

608
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,195
Ever.

609
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,962
ZEDD:
What you know about Wizards

610
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:04,095
could fit inside the teacup
of a Night Wisp.

611
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,429
Don't get offended.

612
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,162
All I'm saying is,
sometimes,

613
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,462
your powers seem
a little irregular.

614
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,254
Am I glad to see you two.

615
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,195
What'd you do to him?

616
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,862
Let's just say
I made him realize

617
00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:20,362
there are certain advantages

618
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:21,987
to traveling
with a carnival act.

619
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:26,828
I notice there's
one fewer of us.

620
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:30,220
What happened to Cara?

621
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:39,987
Some food for your travels.

622
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,987
I've mended the dress.
You're welcome to keep it.

623
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,987
I thinks this
suits me best.

624
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:07,887
Promise me we'll
see each other again.

625
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,920
Why are you here?

626
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,887
I can never forgive you
for what you did to my sister,

627
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,695
but if anything
ever happens to me,

628
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,987
the Seeker
will need protection.

629
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:06,928
Father,
do you like my new dress?

630
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:10,120
Look at you.
Smart and beautiful.

631
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:15,087
I can only imagine what you're
going to grow up to be someday.

632
