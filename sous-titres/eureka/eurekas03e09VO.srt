1
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:03,373
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,780
I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,783
Our new mayor-elect is...

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,480
Mr. Henry Deacon!

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:13,763
I've figured out why your hormones
are so out of whack...

6
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,264
you're having twins.

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,769
You've allowed a breach of security
to turn into a potential catastrophe.

8
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:23,046
Where's Thorne?
I want you to arrest her.

9
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:26,609
You disobeyed a direct order,
and I can't look the other way.

10
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,601
Eureka no longer requires
your services.

11
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,239
You are fired, Carter.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,215
This is a very impressive resume.

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,624
You've had a long career
in law enforcement.

14
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,751
There's never been anything else
I wanted to do.

15
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,723
Experience matters to us
at the Department of Homeland Security.

16
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:52,255
Now, for the last two years,
you've been in small community policing.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,442
I grew up in a small town myself.

18
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,567
Anything exciting ever happen?

19
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,605
What are you doing?

20
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:12,079
Just your normal small town stuff.

21
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,522
So how did the meeting go?

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,353
It's weird interviewing for a new job
when you can't talk about your old job.

23
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:22,178
The government protects its secrets,
and you've seen a lot since you're here.

24
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:25,480
Tell me about it. Compared to this,
Homeland Security's gonna be dull.

25
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,694
Forgive me, but I'm actually hoping
you don't get the job.

26
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,753
- I gotta go.
- Anything I can help with?

27
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,700
I'm trying to nail down
a radio diffraction grating.

28
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,472
The EHF antenna array
is still getting crackles.

29
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,093
What do yot think?

30
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:41,058
- Good luck.
- Catcha.

31
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,524
- Did they offer you the job?
- They told me they'd let me know.

32
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,713
But when will they let you know?
Will we have to move right away or...

33
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,363
I don't know,
but no more Vinspresso for you.

34
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:58,008
My life is in complete turmoil,
and you think it's hilarious?

35
00:01:58,643 --> 00:01:59,443
I don't.

36
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:02,246
In fact, I told 'em I can't start
until you finish the semester.

37
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,333
I'm gonna make this
as easy on you as I can.

38
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,553
Vince, can I get a burger?

39
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,931
A simple meal for a simple man.

40
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,809
It's not gonna be the same
without you.

41
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,404
Can you try and hold it together
for just one second, please?

42
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:21,188
Thanks.

43
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:28,439
A coffee and a doughnut!
You're already eating like a Sheriff.

44
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:32,485
It's a 16-grain protein bagel,
and I am not Sheriff.

45
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,936
All right, acting Sheriff.
Just until the DOD makes it official.

46
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,031
You happy?

47
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,344
Carter, you know
I've always wanted your job.

48
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,005
And I deserve it.

49
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,622
And I'll probably do it better
than you did.

50
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,504
Yeah, you will.

51
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,235
I want it,

52
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,382
but not like this.

53
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
I know.

54
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm proud of you anyway.

55
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,305
Look at you!

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,127
It's hard not to.

57
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,941
I'm starting to create
my own gravitational field.

58
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,271
It agrees with you, being pregnant.

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,483
I needed to see the both of you.
About the Sheriff's position.

60
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,087
General Mansfield came around
and he's gonna rehire Carter?

61
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:23,869
Congratulations, Sheriff Lupo.

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,330
It's not Jo either.

63
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:30,538
Sorry, they have hired a replacement.
He will be here any minute.

64
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:40,008
So I guess he sent his stuff ahead.

65
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:42,103
And he's late on his first day.

66
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,183
He gave me his phone number.
Let me give him a call.

67
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,030
He sent his cell phone ahead?

68
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,159
Hello, Dr. Blake... Deputy Lupo.

69
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,727
And you must be...

70
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,540
That's very creepy.

71
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,294
That is the latest
in dynamic copolymers.

72
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,152
Is this one
of your freaky inventions?

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,009
This is a $2.9 billion DOD program.

74
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:23,554
I'll have him on duty in two shakes
of an artificial lamb's tail.

75
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,722
On duty?

76
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,559
Are you saying
the new Sheriff of Eureka is a robot?

77
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,927
The biggest advance in soft-robotics
since the Furby.

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,025
You can't expect just any anthropomorph
to replace Sheriff Jack Carter.

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,561
That's it.

80
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:40,572
Passed over again?
I don't think so.

81
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,614
Come on.

82
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:46,761
I quit.
I am not working for that thing!

83
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:16,649
You can call me Sheriff Andy.

84
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,360
Hi, Sheriff Andy.

85
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,958
Projet-SG (1.00)

86
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,860
Eureka can't have an experiment
in charge of law enforcement.

87
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,956
You needed a Sheriff,
and the prototype was ready.

88
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:43,944
Would you prefer
to leave the position vacant?

89
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,718
I would prefer re-hiring Carter.

90
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,165
Sheriff Andy is programmed
with the latest protocols

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,660
in criminal investigation.

92
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:52,455
He is designed to be ahead
of the problem, unlike Carter.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,152
Look, I know Carter has
a unique investigative style,

94
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:56,876
but his record speaks for itself.

95
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,151
Yes, it does.

96
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,439
Dr. Blake, you are now
the sole head of Global Dynamics.

97
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,014
Your plate is full.

98
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,277
Don't waste your time
worrying about Carter.

99
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,524
<i>Good evening, Sheriff.</i>

100
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,499
Yeah, not so much.

101
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,543
- What's this?
- <i>Ask your sister.</i>

102
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,560
Why doesn't that surprise me?

103
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,967
Come on, Jack.
Look, it's so cool.

104
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:28,048
Let me guess.

105
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,515
A baby aquarium?

106
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,841
No, it's a tensor field generator.

107
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:37,387
It creates sort of
a zero-gravity bubble,

108
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,116
and it's totally portable
and easy to use.

109
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,470
For my home birth.

110
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:44,279
Dr. Fielding says this way,
when my babies are born,

111
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,304
they'll just sort of drift,
totally weightless.

112
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,783
Not weightless, Lexi.

113
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,328
The tensor field repulses
most of the gravitons,

114
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:56,415
but the subject retains
0.0096% of its original weight.

115
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,189
Weighesess enough for me.
I've gained ten pounds in the last day.

116
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,338
- Ten pounds?
- Shut up. Try making two whole people.

117
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:04,939
Fair enough.

118
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,336
I'll come back for the generator

119
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,429
at a better time.

120
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,973
Dr. Fielding,
it was nice to see you again.

121
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:15,619
A pleasure.

122
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,509
I had to cite him
for overloading the power grid.

123
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,899
Try to be nice,
I'm trying to get the twin discount.

124
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,088
Sure you should be planning
all this stuff?

125
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,992
We're not even gonna be here.

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,244
Stop it. You're not going anywhere.

127
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,644
<i>Excuse me, Sheriff.</i>

128
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,341
<i>I'm monitoring a bulletin
on the public safety network.</i>

129
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,613
<i>Numerous fallen trees
have blocked the road.</i>

130
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:43,788
You can get "Sheriff in a box"
to handle that one.

131
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,150
<i>Dr. Blake was involved.</i>

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,255
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,728
The road's just blocked.
We're trying to get a crew out here.

134
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:05,303
I believe public safety
is no longer under your jurisdiction.

135
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:07,277
I'm just out making sure
everybody's okay.

136
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,487
I appreciate.

137
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:12,241
Sheriff Andy has been notified.
Clearly everything's fine.

138
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,076
You okay?

139
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,488
All right, everybody get away
from the treeline.

140
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,072
Come on back.

141
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,676
How are you tonight?

142
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,844
Evening, folks.

143
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,513
Seems like you found yourselves
a bit of excitement, huh?

144
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,962
- Welcome to Eureka, Sheriff Andy.
- Thank you kindly, sir.

145
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,762
We didn't get a chance to talk
when you were unpacking me.

146
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,859
There's time for chitchat later.
Right now we gotta stop the traffic...

147
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:44,896
Done.

148
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,526
I've dispatched roadblock drones.
They should be on station...

149
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,980
And there they are.

150
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,396
We also got to get a medical team.

151
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,994
Don't you worry about it.
I've got it covered.

152
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,536
I've got a complete suite
of medical diagnostic tools.

153
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,274
Just some frayed nerves is all.

154
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,546
Excuse me, Dr. Blake,
your baby is a-okay.

155
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:11,420
Amniotic fluid levels,
pulse ox, all perfectly normal.

156
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:14,085
Pregnancy is such a miracle,
don't you think?

157
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,680
Seems like Sheriff Andy
has everything under control.

158
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,277
I sure do, but thank you
so much for your assist.

159
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:20,928
Now, if you'll excuse me.

160
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,953
All right, people,
move away from the treeline.

161
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,025
I'm sure you wanna observe
your new Sheriff in action.

162
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:32,789
Move to the side of the road,
away from the treeline.

163
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,678
I guess I'll get out of the way.

164
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,506
Hit me, Vincent.

165
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,128
Are you sure, Sheriff...
Jack... Mr. Carter?

166
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,530
Thanks.

167
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,763
What you're looking for
isn't in that glass.

168
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,766
What if I'm looking for
a banana milkshake?

169
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,526
Then, you're good.

170
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:05,062
So, what do you think
brought those trees down?

171
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,980
So far, it looks like an accident.

172
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,399
Really... is that
what the new Sheriff told you?

173
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,861
It's his preliminary findings.
And he's not my new anything.

174
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,256
You can't be replaced by six feet
of nano-polymer with a nice smile.

175
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:20,998
So...

176
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,538
the DHS called.

177
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,292
They offered me the job.

178
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,465
That's good news.

179
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:37,137
They need me to start right away.
Just a few days.

180
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:43,270
You should be packing.
What are you doing here?

181
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,235
Hiding from my daughter.

182
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,646
This sucks!

183
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,719
You told me we wouldn't have to leave
until after the semester.

184
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:53,369
I know the timing's crappy,
but this is the right job for me.

185
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:56,530
- You already have the right job.
- I know, and they hired someone else.

186
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,289
So they bring in Robocop,

187
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:01,057
and I have to leave my friends
and my boyfriend in two days.

188
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,077
Is that fair?

189
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Speaking of Robocop,
there's someone at the door.</i>

190
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,058
Hey, there.

191
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,861
Gee, I hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time.

192
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,636
You must be Zoe. Hello.

193
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,638
Bite me, Terminator.

194
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:19,052
We're kind of in the middle here.

195
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,745
Well, I'll be quick.

196
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,497
I'm doing an office inventory,
and I need your uniform.

197
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,771
It's strictly for paperwork.

198
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:28,622
Sure.

199
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,168
Nice place.

200
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,196
Thank you. I'll get out of your way.

201
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:40,995
Question.

202
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:45,203
Do you think those trees
came down by accident?

203
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,914
The impact pattern
seems perfectly natural.

204
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:52,919
But trees don't just fall down
by themselves.

205
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,591
- Actually, Jack...
- I mean in Eureka.

206
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:01,607
Here, when a tree falls in the forest,
it's not just a tree.

207
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,725
I'm completely confident
in the results of my investigation.

208
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:09,702
But thank you so much
for your advice.

209
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,596
What do you think, SARAH?

210
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:17,032
<i>I believe the saccharine Sheriff act
is already getting quite tiresome.</i>

211
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:19,888
Is it natural for a dozen trees
to come down all by themselves?

212
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,003
Were the roots rotting, were...

213
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:25,864
<i>My analysis of the wood samples
does indicate genetic abnormalities.</i>

214
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,365
How'd you get wood samples?

215
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>The artificial Sheriff
had debris on his shoes.</i>

216
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,059
<i>He tracked it on my carpet.</i>

217
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:34,648
Thank you.

218
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,021
I need a tree guy.

219
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:43,970
Excuse me?

220
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,126
I need someone
who studies tree genes.

221
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,809
Does anyone actually study that?

222
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,727
Of course.
A dendrological geneticist.

223
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,437
Great. Need one of those.

224
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,130
Your clearance has been revoked.
I can't talk to you about GD personnel.

225
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,904
You can't just forget about it because
the tin man says it was an accident.

226
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,615
Yes, and just because he's a robot
doesn't mean that he's wrong.

227
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,286
But he's been here for half a day.
It takes longer to understand this town.

228
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,523
I mean, we got lucky.

229
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:13,561
If more trees fall down,
somebody could get killed.

230
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:14,501
I can't.

231
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,076
I can't tell you that Dr. Leonardo
is the top GD dendrologist,

232
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,677
and that she's working
on increasing xylem nutrient transport.

233
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,485
She has a lab over on South Goddard.

234
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,546
I'd be breaking about 35 federal laws
if I told you that.

235
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:31,893
Excuse me.

236
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,201
Yeah, I can't get anything to grow.

237
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:41,276
I've got a total black thumb.

238
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,196
I'm guessing
she doesn't have that problem.

239
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,037
Not so much.

240
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,786
So, do you make anything out here
that might make trees fall down?

241
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,310
No, quite the opposite.

242
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,835
We study geometrically increased
angiosperm reproduction.

243
00:13:58,575 --> 00:13:59,825
So what's that?

244
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,950
Accelerated tree growth.

245
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,865
You're making some progress.

246
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:16,186
We were wondering if you could
take a look at something for us.

247
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,440
Wood chips from the trees that fell.

248
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:20,538
I'm actually kind of swamped.

249
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,069
Lateral meristems aren't gonna
reconfigure themselves, right?

250
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,821
I was just thinking the same thing.

251
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:28,577
But we'd love your help, to make sure
it wasn't caused by your department.

252
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,335
Thank you.

253
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,162
So where are your uniforms?

254
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,945
It's an unofficial visit.

255
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,711
So is it true that you got fired?

256
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,526
He got fired.

257
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,381
I quit.

258
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,890
Bummer.

259
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,180
Thanks. So what'd you find out?

260
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,517
I found out you're not the Sheriff.
All GD research is classified.

261
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,001
I can't talk about it to civilians.

262
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:58,509
Sorry.

263
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,440
Thank you.

264
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,165
Topping off the batteries?

265
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:16,592
Good one.

266
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:19,792
Actually, I'm running a diagnostic
on the security system.

267
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,684
There seems to be some trouble
with the satellite communications.

268
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,424
When you're unplugged,
I need you to talk to a Dr. Leonardo.

269
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:28,718
Head dendrologist for GD?

270
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:33,568
You're quick.

271
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,247
Keep it all
in the old hard drive up here.

272
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:39,563
Did she say anything about all the trees
that fell last night?

273
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,400
And it was the way
she didn't say anything.

274
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,558
It's tough to explain, man to robot.

275
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,197
Look, it's not an accident.

276
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:53,743
I appreciate all your help,
but I can't have you investigating.

277
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,122
The town charter clearly
delineates my duties as the Sheriff.

278
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,512
You see where I'm coming from, right?
Sheriff to former Sheriff.

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Sure.

280
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,466
No problem.
Got a lot of packing to do.

281
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:09,789
Thank you.

282
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,972
Don't you worry.
I am on top of this.

283
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,570
This is bad.

284
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:31,656
They're never gonna let me test
this top secret robot again.

285
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,659
Stop your whimpering, son.
Patch him up.

286
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,233
I'm not a robot expert,
but this looks like a dead one.

287
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:42,309
This is a secure facility
in which you are no longer permitted.

288
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,342
I'm just visiting.
I'm paying my respects.

289
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,475
I don't think that Andy
can be fixed.

290
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,299
It was designed for durability.

291
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,593
I want him back on the street, ASAP.

292
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:54,635
The town needs a Sheriff.

293
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,837
It's not just the trees.
We now have a destroyed antenna dish.

294
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,811
Somebody's gotta figure out
what's happening.

295
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,709
I don't think that Sheriff Andy
is quite up to it at this moment.

296
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,650
So if someone was gonna investigate,

297
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,535
Henry would be...

298
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:11,246
At the site.

299
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:14,240
That would be
a good place to start hypothetically.

300
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,658
Hypothetically.

301
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,376
This bolt was sheared off prior
to the dish hitting Andy.

302
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,123
It's made of tungsten carbide.

303
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,307
It holds 29 tons.

304
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:28,588
So how does a radio dish snap
like a bread stick, and then crush Andy?

305
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,306
It doesn't do either.

306
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:31,846
Here, look.

307
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,970
Someone's been working out.

308
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,224
This is beryllium composite.
Very lightweight.

309
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,232
Something must have ripped
it off the tower,

310
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,004
and slammed it onto the ground.

311
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,468
- Like wind?
- No.

312
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,801
We're talking
about tremendous force.

313
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,167
Equal to 100 class-5 tornadoes.

314
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:56,449
It's gotta be the same thing
that knocked down those trees.

315
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,030
- Let me know if you find anything else.
- Sure.

316
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,319
Can't stay away
from a good case, huh?

317
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,748
I'm just naturally curious.

318
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:17,220
So if a tree falls in the...

319
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:19,186
Gotta go.

320
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:21,933
What are you doing?

321
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,977
You said this didn't relate
to your research.

322
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,022
I said I can't talk to you,
and I still can't.

323
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,949
But you want to.

324
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,230
You want to tell your side of the story.
Explain why your stuff's here.

325
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:34,435
I'm sorry, but you're not
the Sheriff anymore.

326
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,947
Right. I am.

327
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,398
And I'm very interested to know
why you're here.

328
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:41,596
- You're okay?
- 110%.

329
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,997
The guy with the glasses...

330
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:47,321
Diego, he fixed me all up.
Except for the names database.

331
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,786
Now, are you willing
to cooperate, Dr. Leotardo?

332
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,046
"Nardo." Leonardo.

333
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,423
- Thanks, Steve.
- Jack.

334
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:54,574
Dr. Zhivago.

335
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,468
Why are you here?

336
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:58,720
Growing trees.

337
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:00,157
I just...

338
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:03,600
- I needed more space.
- This is public land.

339
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,395
You do realize that it's illegal
to do research on public land?

340
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,807
Yes, but I'm doing this
for the public.

341
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,891
I grew this entire grove
in nine hours.

342
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,376
Do you know what lightweight hygroscopic
hardwood could do for the world?

343
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:25,117
It could reforest entire continents.
And global warming...

344
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:28,254
- Until they all come crashing down.
- Yeah, but they shouldn't.

345
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:31,002
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know why the trees fell.

346
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,505
My trees could stand up
to a hurricane.

347
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,674
She's right, Dave. Hygroscopic hardwood
is incredibly tough.

348
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:42,674
It'd take 100 class-5 tornadoes.

349
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:51,106
Do you have any Fig Newtons?

350
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,010
Absolutely, coming right up.

351
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,290
Henry, what'd you find out?

352
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,429
No evidence of any force
from the outside

353
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,410
on the trees
or on the antenna dishes.

354
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:01,848
No molecular breaks.

355
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:05,230
- No zero-energy scorches.
- So we have no idea what blew 'em down.

356
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,490
Whatever knocked 'em down
hit 'em really hard.

357
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,582
Those trees hit the ground
like a ton of...

358
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:12,155
trees.

359
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:13,455
I was there.

360
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,922
- Here's your Fig Newtons.
- Thank you very, very much.

361
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,507
You are very welcome.

362
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,920
Weren't you off cookies?

363
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,011
Something about ten pounds a day?

364
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,465
Maybe the scale was off.

365
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,447
I don't know. I'm ten pounds
lighter than I was yesterday.

366
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:30,754
What if the...

367
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:33,165
trees could get fatter, like Lexi?

368
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,854
What if they weren't blown down?

369
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:38,444
What if they fell
because they got heavy?

370
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,405
They didn't get fat, Jack.

371
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,242
I mean, I weighed everything myself.

372
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Yeah, now.

373
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,730
But what if they just got heavy
when they fell?

374
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,956
If an extremely
lightweight object...

375
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,210
Yeah, like a genetically
rejiggered tree.

376
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,478
... experiences an increase in weight,
the sudden change in stress

377
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:58,260
- could cause catastrophic failure.
- And it would fall down.

378
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,310
But terrestrial weight
doesn't change.

379
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,760
Gravity, for all intents
and purposes, is a constant.

380
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:06,015
Is it possible?
Is it Eureka possible?

381
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,476
I suppose so, yeah.

382
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:18,810
- What's up?
- I think what we've been experiencing

383
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,735
is random acts of gravity.

384
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,906
I'm still a little foggy,
but that sounds nuts.

385
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:25,774
Yes, it is. But it does explain
the antenna and the trees.

386
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:27,971
What we have to do
is track down any other incidents

387
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:30,775
and find out what's causing this
before someone gets hurt.

388
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,209
All right. I'll look into it, but I can
only go where the evidence takes me.

389
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,586
Great. Thanks.

390
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:38,835
Anything for you, Bob.

391
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,803
I'm okay.

392
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:51,865
Wait. Sorry I'm late.

393
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,775
I didn't even know GD had a warehouse.
So, how's Andy?

394
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,204
Fargo's working on him.

395
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,180
- So, Henry, why did you call us?
- Just a few minutes more.

396
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,980
I'm tracking something here,
and you need to see it.

397
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,676
First the radar dish,
and now his car gets stomped.

398
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,500
Andy's had some bad luck.

399
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,610
I think it might be more
than bad luck.

400
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,919
All right, who remembers
their M-theory physics?

401
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,390
I'll let you take this one.

402
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,556
Gravity is made up
of massless particles,

403
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:26,386
which are distributed equally
across the gravitational field.

404
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:29,180
Correct, but my CMS scans
indicate that, right now,

405
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,770
those gravitons
are actually coalescing.

406
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:34,290
What?
Are you talking about gravity wells?

407
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:35,980
What's up with a gravity well?

408
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,910
It is an area
of intense supergravity

409
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:41,327
caused by the momentary
concentration of gravitons.

410
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,770
- And they don't exist.
- Okay, you know what...

411
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,083
Stand back and watch.

412
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,882
They last just for a moment
before the gravitons dissipate.

413
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:04,215
And my scans indicate that
these gravity wells are starting to form

414
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,683
all over Eureka.

415
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:11,931
Gravity wells are one thing, but I think
that someone is targeting Sheriff Andy.

416
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,455
Do you really think
that I was murdered?

417
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:21,166
It's Dutch. Fargo's still repairing
his speech circuits.

418
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:22,900
You speak Dutch?

419
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,109
- Carter, you said murder?
- Right. Yes.

420
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,560
So we've got these gravity wells
popping up all over town.

421
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,135
There have been reports
of sink holes,

422
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,294
downed power lines, fallen fences.

423
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:34,500
Maybe we should start
thinking about evacuation.

424
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,496
Maybe not.

425
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,958
No one has been injured except Andy.
And he's been flattened twice.

426
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,835
I think someone is targeting him.

427
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,820
You know what Mansfield would say.

428
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,757
Of course you want it to be murder,
because you'd have to investigate it.

429
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,345
I got a great job.

430
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:50,295
I got a nice office.
I got normal gravity.

431
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:56,162
I just came to town.
Why would someone wanna murder me?

432
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:58,144
I would.
I mean, if I wanted my job back.

433
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,719
- Me too.
- I wouldn't mind seeing you dead.

434
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:02,027
No offense.

435
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:04,875
None taken.

436
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,571
So what would it take for someone
to steer a gravity well?

437
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:12,221
Well, you'd have to calibrate
a tensor field specifically

438
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,525
to repulse gravitons,

439
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,032
which no one has ever done,
not even come close.

440
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,493
They might be closer than you think.

441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,627
See, a baby aquarium's
just a bad idea.

442
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,890
Dr. Fielding,
the gravity disturbances

443
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,209
that have been occurring
in and around Eureka

444
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:30,287
are caused by
a compact tensor field.

445
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,804
Exactly the kind of field created
in your birthing chamber.

446
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,347
Interesting.

447
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,830
Interesting?

448
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:38,429
I know you only intended to create
a small, contained field,

449
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:42,455
but you've stumbled on a way
to actually control gravitons.

450
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,706
To manipulate
the gravitational field.

451
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:48,945
It is an incredible breakthrough.
Astonishing. But it is out of control.

452
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:52,295
My apologies.

453
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:54,706
I suppose if being an...

454
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:58,005
accidental genius is a crime,
then guilty.

455
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,374
I am sorry if I caused any problems.

456
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,365
You crushed Sheriff Andy!

457
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:07,380
What are you talking about?

458
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:09,576
Your gravity wells,
they crushed him.

459
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,093
Twice.

460
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:16,025
- And I don't think it was an accident.
- That's insane.

461
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:18,808
I had no idea
what my field was doing.

462
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:22,228
And if I wanted to crush a Sheriff,
it wouldn't be him.

463
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,532
You know what,
we need to stop the gravity wells

464
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,380
before the whole town is crushed.

465
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,157
Look, Henry, I need you to put a team
together at GD. Our best people.

466
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:33,239
I don't care what projects they're
working on, this is their only priority.

467
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,419
Great, thanks.

468
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:36,826
- Bring the doctor back to GD.
- Done.

469
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,210
- I have a lab to tend to.
- Your lab will have to tend to itself.

470
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:43,624
However unintentional, your tensor field
is responsible for this problem.

471
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,980
And right now you're our best option
for a solution.

472
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,755
Right. I'll stay here.

473
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:51,466
We'll start untangling
the issues immediately.

474
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,177
- We who?
- I.

475
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:58,497
And I'll surely let you know
as soon as I make any progress.

476
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,477
You'll have all our resources
behind you.

477
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,811
Including sole use of the graviscalar
particle accelerator.

478
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,396
The GPA....

479
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,105
Let me gather my notes.

480
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,738
<i>60 seconds
until accelerator ignition.</i>

481
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:17,074
All right, we stabilize the gravity
fields and we stabilize the town.

482
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,245
You, set the spin for two
and the electrical charge for zero.

483
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,355
- Mean lifetime?
- Stable.

484
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:28,675
Setting for "stable".

485
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,219
The particle beam should fix
the gravity disturbances.

486
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,468
It's dicey.
If his settings are inaccurate...

487
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:39,018
He's the only person in the world who
has successfully manipulated gravity.

488
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:41,604
- Accidentally.
- He's the closest we have to an expert.

489
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,060
<i>Ten seconds
until accelerator ignition.</i>

490
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,115
Take your positions.

491
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,149
<i>Ignition.</i>

492
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,817
Passing one teravolt.

493
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,196
Six teravolts.

494
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,611
We're getting graviton blowback.

495
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:00,284
It's tearing the fields apart.

496
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,790
The field is destabilizing.

497
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,750
It'll be... fine.

498
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,669
We need a vector for the neutrinos.

499
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,506
We need to shut this down right now.

500
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,270
Emergency shutdown engaged.

501
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,189
The particle beams are stabilizing.

502
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:41,258
Do you know what happens when you stop
an accelerator in mid-cycle?

503
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:43,863
Jo says we've got reports
on dozens of buildings collapsing.

504
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:47,810
It's gonna take 10 months to repair.
We have gravity wells all over town.

505
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:50,839
The particle beam further destabilized
the gravitational field.

506
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,753
- He made it worse?
- Yes.

507
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,860
I'm so sorry.

508
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:57,885
Sorry will not help
solve the problem.

509
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,570
We need to analyze
your initial tensor field design.

510
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:03,264
What were your LEP positions?

511
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,465
Dr. Fielding, it's a basic question.

512
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:08,605
Right.

513
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:11,731
He doesn't know the basics.

514
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:13,899
What? Of course he does.

515
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:16,402
He built the tensor field
that started this problem.

516
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,288
Not on his own he didn't.

517
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:21,282
I'm betting he doesn't even
understand his own machine.

518
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:25,130
What, you're...
You're taking credit, but you had help?

519
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:28,789
I'm guessing from somebody
who'd wanna hurt the new Sheriff?

520
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:33,085
Marguerite would never harm anyone.

521
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,755
- Marguerite?
- Someone at GD?

522
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,060
Dr. Marguerite Von Dieter.

523
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,640
She's a researcher
at the University of Bonn.

524
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,889
Brilliant woman.
We never actually met.

525
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,439
See, we found each other
in an academic chat room.

526
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:52,021
My research was going nowhere.
She steered me in the right direction.

527
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:55,862
Just seeing her name in my inbox
would make my heart...

528
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,035
- pound.
- Oh, please.

529
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:03,009
Is that possible? They could
work together without ever meeting?

530
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:06,550
It's common. You never know where you're
gonna find a specialist in your field.

531
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:09,662
But what possible reason could
this woman have to get rid of Andy?

532
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,032
I called the university authorities
in Germany.

533
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:15,240
I used your phone because Eureka's
not paying for my calls anymore.

534
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:18,565
And they'd never even heard
of Marguerite Von Dieter.

535
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:22,615
I thought you were supposed to be
with Fargo getting your memory checked.

536
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:26,305
I had him check Fielding's email first.
What'd you find?

537
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,740
You're not gonna like it.

538
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:34,221
Good luck at getting her
to admit it.

539
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,540
I'm supposed to be happy about this?

540
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:39,554
I mean, he gets this great new job,
and what do I get?

541
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,679
The shaft.

542
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:42,982
<i>I'm sure your father considered
your best interests</i>

543
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:44,570
<i>when making his decision.</i>

544
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:45,920
I'm sure he didn't.

545
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,202
<i>All human decisions
are subject to reversal.</i>

546
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,171
<i>At this time,
I estimate a 27% chance</i>

547
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:53,180
<i>that your family
will remain in Eureka.</i>

548
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,905
<i>Hello, Sheriff Carter.</i>

549
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,586
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, whatever.

550
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,258
Look...

551
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:04,260
I know that you're upset
about having to leave Eureka.

552
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,877
But this has gone way too far.

553
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:09,821
What has?

554
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:12,810
I know about the emails
you sent Dr. Fielding.

555
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,917
- What emails?
- We traced them.

556
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,439
You sent them from here.

557
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:20,294
And I know about the online research
you did on gravity.

558
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,133
Okay, I don't do
gravity research online.

559
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:25,114
- I shop.
- This is serious.

560
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,783
We know that you tried
to kill Sheriff Andy.

561
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,411
- What are you talking about?
- Zoe, it's over.

562
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:31,979
- Dad!
- <i>Wait.</i>

563
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,290
Mind your own business.
This has to do with Zoe and me.

564
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,625
<i>No, Sheriff Carter,
I'm afraid it doesn't.</i>

565
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:38,230
<i>I'm deeply involved.</i>

566
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:40,890
<i>I'm responsible
for everything that happened.</i>

567
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:42,666
<i>It was me.</i>

568
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,635
Okay, what is going on?

569
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:48,137
Thank you.

570
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,091
I thought so.

571
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,393
SARAH is Marguerite Von Dieter.

572
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:56,604
- Isn't that right, SARAH?
- <i>Ja.</i>

573
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,148
Okay, you're both insane.

574
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:01,556
And who is Marguerite Von Dieter?

575
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,787
There's a tiny bit of trouble
with the traffic light on Main Street.

576
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,479
<i>What's wrong?</i>

577
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:18,300
Now it's kinda in Main Street.

578
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,253
<i>All right,
we're working as fast as we can. Thanks.</i>

579
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,666
So you knew I didn't do it.

580
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:26,321
You just used me
to get SARAH to confess.

581
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:27,496
Pretty much.

582
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,554
- Very devious. I'm totally impressed.
- Thank you.

583
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,196
<i>Dr. Fielding's tensor field
was quite primitive.</i>

584
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,915
- <i>He was unable to see the potential.</i>
- But you did.

585
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,747
<i>I was able
to expand on his breakthrough</i>

586
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:39,978
<i>by cross-referencing
the Global Dynamics mainframe</i>

587
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:42,729
<i>with a number of recently
developed theoretical models.</i>

588
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:44,884
Which you then used
to squish Sheriff Andy.

589
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,074
<i>I apologize.</i>

590
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,914
<i>I let my artificial emotions
get the best of me.</i>

591
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,667
She was desperate. She didn't
want us to leave her here alone.

592
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,577
Fargo sent the new scan results.

593
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,042
That doesn't look good.

594
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,167
The gravitational wells are coming
together into a single massive event.

595
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,898
If that happens, they will suck in
any matter that comes close.

596
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,807
What, like a black hole?

597
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,605
- What did you do?
- We gotta move this someplace

598
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,260
- where there's no people.
- <i>I no longer have graviton guidance.</i>

599
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:14,164
<i>Dr. Fielding's misguided attempt
at a solution made the problem grow</i>

600
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,433
- <i>far beyond my control.</i>
- Then it's evacuation.

601
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,589
I'm afraid that
if these wells come together

602
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:21,288
into a singularity,
then evacuation won't help.

603
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,852
The entire west coast
will be in danger.

604
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:27,152
How 'bout another shot
from your accelerator thingy?

605
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,780
The field's too strong,
like shooting a bullet at an asteroid.

606
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,578
Well, if a bullet won't work,
how about a bomb?

607
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,604
<i>That is an interesting metaphor.</i>

608
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:37,981
<i>A graviton pulse explosion
could return gravity to normal.</i>

609
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:39,977
Fielding's birthing chamber.

610
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:43,460
If you overloaded the tensor field,
it could make a wicked gravity bomb.

611
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,960
<i>It would require a substantial
external power source.</i>

612
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:49,258
We get some batteries.
We go to his lab, problem solved.

613
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,101
Except the scan indicates
that the singularities

614
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:54,477
are forming
on top of Fielding's lab.

615
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,266
That's where the gravitational
disruption began.

616
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,928
<i>The gravity fluctuations
will be very intense.</i>

617
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,758
- How intense?
- Birds hitting the ground

618
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,454
like cannonballs.
What we need is...

619
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,714
someone more durable.

620
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:11,633
I just got him
speaking English again,

621
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,045
and now you wanna throw him
into a giant trash compactor.

622
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,979
He needs to connect the power supply,
then detonate the chamber.

623
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:20,052
It's gonna be dangerous, Andy.
I won't lie to you.

624
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:24,168
This is the perfect testing scenario
for our technology, get him ready.

625
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:28,789
- I can't go.
- Excuse me?

626
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,290
We need you to do this.

627
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:32,343
For God's sake, he's a machine.
He can't refuse.

628
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:35,914
According to the town charter,

629
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,102
the Sheriff is to protect
the citizenry of Eureka

630
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,976
while avoiding unreasonable
personal danger.

631
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:44,003
In this case, my odds of survival
would be around...

632
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:44,980
7%.

633
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,338
I gotta say no.

634
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:48,847
I'm really sorry.

635
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,527
- This is an order.
- I'm really sorry.

636
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:55,699
We have to do something,
Fargo... what about a drone?

637
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,235
We'd have to rig it to compensate for
the change in the gravitational field.

638
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,962
- But that would take about 12 hours.
- We don't have 12 hours.

639
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,093
I'll go.

640
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:04,249
What... no.

641
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,127
Andy is right...
not with the odds at 7%.

642
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,095
Well, around here...

643
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,635
that's pretty good.

644
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:18,055
I've hotwired Fielding's
tensor generator to the engine.

645
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:21,266
The repulsive field should give you some
protection against the supergravity.

646
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:25,181
- What happens when I get out?
- You're on your own.

647
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:26,889
That's the power supply.

648
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:28,691
Attach it to the chamber,
set the timer.

649
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:31,443
- Then run.
- I forgot that part.

650
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,829
You're tracking
the gravitational field?

651
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:46,240
Fargo has temporarily replaced
my night vision with magnetic sensors.

652
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,985
If he doesn't stop the singularity,
we'll have to evacuate.

653
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,316
Why is he doing this?
It's not his job.

654
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:55,509
It's who he is.

655
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:03,047
<i>You should be reaching
the edge of the gravity disturbance.</i>

656
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:05,865
Nothing yet.

657
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:10,406
Wait.

658
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:12,858
Holy crap!

659
00:35:12,983 --> 00:35:14,485
- <i>What?</i>
- Pine cones.

660
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,989
- They sound like anvils.
- <i>They probably weigh as much.</i>

661
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,159
Jack, just drive.
You don't have much time.

662
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:27,665
I'm at the barn.
It's pretty bad in here.

663
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,671
<i>Trust me, it's gonna get worse.</i>

664
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,231
- My legs feel like they're 200 pounds.
- They probably are.

665
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:36,050
You're near the edge of a gravity well.
There's no way to know where they'll be.

666
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,011
<i>They're forming and dissipating
all over the laboratory.</i>

667
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,108
<i>Just hook in that power supply.</i>

668
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:42,233
I got it.

669
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,591
Here goes nothing.

670
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:05,958
A little problem here.

671
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,461
<i>Are you sure
the battery supply is gone?</i>

672
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,338
We have to find
another source of power.

673
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,964
Little wrinkle... I can't move.

674
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,216
You're caught near a gravity well.

675
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,203
<i>Just see if you can slide
a few inches in the right direction,</i>

676
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:23,503
- <i>and you might be free.</i>
- All right.

677
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,230
There's no sliding.

678
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:29,048
Hey, there!

679
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,205
Need a hand?

680
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,470
I thought you didn't like the odds.

681
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:35,629
Well, I reran the analysis.

682
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:39,673
Seems the odds are always
a little better when you're around.

683
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,327
Yeah, I'm full of luck.

684
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,951
- Careful.
- It's okay.

685
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,744
Fargo replaced my sensors.

686
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,121
I can read the gravity fields
as they're forming.

687
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,232
Where's the power supply?

688
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:59,247
- What about that?
- That's not gonna be enough power.

689
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,171
It might be.

690
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:03,594
No, we need ten times
household current.

691
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:06,231
I've always given Fielding
these citations

692
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:08,938
for tapping too much power
from the grid. It might be.

693
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,306
All right, let's check it out.
But you follow me.

694
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:16,723
You're right, this is
way over household current.

695
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,233
This is definitely a citation.
But it is not enough.

696
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:21,736
All right, we gotta
boost it with something.

697
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,616
- Me.
- Won't that fry you?

698
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,293
Well, yeah, maybe.

699
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,706
Running the power through me could be
just enough to overload the field.

700
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,792
It sure ain't gonna be fun, but we don't
have a lot of choices right now.

701
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:35,711
Or time.

702
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:39,381
All right, we only have a millisecond
or two before this thing overloads.

703
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:42,651
So you need to activate the field
at the exact same moment.

704
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:43,776
Ready?

705
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,097
One, two, three.

706
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:08,858
You with me?

707
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,268
I don't like this job.

708
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:24,715
We're here.

709
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,511
We're okay.

710
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:28,132
All right.

711
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,980
I don't wanna go to this.

712
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,296
You kinda have to.
It's your party.

713
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:56,511
You know,

714
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,456
you could stay here.

715
00:38:58,933 --> 00:38:59,933
Right.

716
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,296
No, I'm serious.

717
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,742
And I'm okay with it.

718
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:06,329
I think that you are old enough.

719
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:09,437
And I think that this town
is your home.

720
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:12,043
No, it's not.

721
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,168
You are.

722
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,394
Okay, can't keep a pregnant woman
inside with a cake this long.

723
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,687
- He's being a party pooper.
- Well, it's just weird.

724
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:26,115
I mean, you get fired,
then all anyone wants to do is tell you

725
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,540
- how much they're gonna miss you.
- A lot.

726
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,033
We're gonna miss you a lot.

727
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,704
- Did we miss the big entrance?
- No, I'm stalling.

728
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,248
Good.
Because I have a present for you.

729
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:38,523
Did you know that in Eureka,

730
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:40,945
the Department of Defense
has the authority

731
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,797
to fire any local peace officer,
including the Sheriff?

732
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:45,429
Thanks.
Yeah, I did.

733
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,144
But only...

734
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:49,094
with the approval of the mayor.

735
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:50,918
Written approval.

736
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,104
Is that true, Henry?

737
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:55,250
That would be mayor Deacon.

738
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,227
Wait, so can my dad
have his job back?

739
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:59,605
No. He never lost it
in the first place.

740
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:02,230
See, I told you
you weren't going anywhere.

741
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:04,667
- Hold... Where is this written?
- Town charter.

742
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:07,279
Henry, the town charter
is 174 volumes.

743
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,291
See, I had a little help
from my friend.

744
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,783
He had it all in his hard drive.

745
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,856
- So I think it's time for a party.
- Sounds good to me.

746
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,603
Yeah. I'm gonna
meet you guys inside.

747
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:25,964
- You okay?
- All patched up.

748
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:28,550
Henry just told me what you did,
so thank you.

749
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:32,201
- You're welcome.
- You know, Eureka owes you one.

750
00:40:32,581 --> 00:40:35,599
You did a good job,
and you're a good Sheriff.

751
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:38,727
With some severe limitations.

752
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,784
An honest assessment of myself

753
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:44,441
leads me to the conclusion
that I am just not built for this job.

754
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:47,887
Aren't you... Actually?

755
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:53,177
Well... not like you.

756
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:58,104
Everyone has a choice, right?

757
00:41:01,351 --> 00:41:03,502
I think I choose something else.

758
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,416
- Are you sure?
- It's a smart move.

759
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,510
Odds are better with you around.

760
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,415
Do you wanna come to the party?

761
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,602
I think I need to spend
a little time in my box.

762
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,517
You know, sorting things out.

763
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:20,664
Sure.

764
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:23,805
It was real nice
working with you, Sheriff.

765
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,235
Thanks.

766
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:41,676
Here he comes!

767
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,593
- Thanks for coming to the party.
- Thank you, Henry.

768
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:51,672
What's this?

769
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:53,844
Privileges of pregnancy.

770
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,868
So thank you

771
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:00,267
for keeping him around.

772
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:01,484
You're welcome.

773
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,687
Besides, I think you'll need
all the help you can get.

774
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,319
We've been having trouble
with our NAVSAT antenna array.

775
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,570
Some kind of interference we couldn't
pin down before the array was destroyed.

776
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,602
Yeah, I ran the output.
It wasn't interference.

777
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:15,100
- It was a radio signal.
- Man made.

778
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:18,285
I mean, we don't have
anything out that far.

779
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,602
What are you saying?

780
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:22,914
I'm saying there's something out there,
and it's heading straight for us.

781
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,163
Straight for Eureka.

782
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:32,976
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Good morning.

783
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,658
I'm just staying
because I hate job interviews.

784
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:43,227
What would you consider
your greatest weakness?

785
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,021
What kind of dumb-ass question
is that, seriously?

786
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,698
It's gonna happen for you, Jo.

787
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,053
It will.

788
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:52,102
I really don't care.

789
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,540
Yeah, you do.

790
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:55,942
And you're gonna be a great Sheriff.

791
00:42:57,568 --> 00:42:59,164
Damn skippy, I will.

792
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,916
"Damn skippy."
