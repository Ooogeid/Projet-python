1
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:23,379
First day with the new boss, huh?

2
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:26,297
And the new desk.

3
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:27,814
Jealous much?

4
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:30,997
Just because Blake inherited you
doesn't mean she has to keep you.

5
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,020
Not if there's a better candidate
for the job.

6
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,098
The better candidate
already has the job.

7
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,830
Oh... we'll see.

8
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,042
This transition has to go smoothly.

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,696
The D.O.D. brass in town.

10
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,254
The computer reboot.

11
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,317
Lot of pressure to perform, huh?

12
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:48,285
No room for screwups.

13
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,756
That shouldn't be an issue
for you, should it?

14
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,008
Midterms today, right?

15
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,881
Those were last week, Dad.

16
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,819
Yeah... I know.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,195
You haven't told me how you did yet.

18
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,704
Oh, yeah, um...

19
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:17,988
B...

20
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,300
B- plus...

21
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:21,535
F...
B- minus...

22
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:22,683
A.

23
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,492
Well, A's great.

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,882
Yeah, it's for P.E. You get it just
for putting on the stupid shorts.

25
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,654
And... and, uh... and the...

26
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,912
F?

27
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,493
The make-up exams are today,
so you can relax.

28
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,158
I am relaxed.

29
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,648
- I didn't even yell.
- Which is killing you.

30
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:45,493
Yeah, it really is.
But... I got an F once.

31
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:47,146
Yeah, eighth grade geometry.

32
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,552
No time for story mode
'cause we really need to go.

33
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:50,849
Yeah, but, you know, keep...

34
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,981
"Nose to the grindstone.
Don't get discouraged. "

35
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,198
Something about walking
3 miles through broken glass,

36
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,412
uphill, both ways,

37
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,790
and just keep trying.
Close enough?

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,239
Uh, yeah...

39
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:03,330
it was 4 miles, but...

40
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,649
- Did you get her anything?
- Get who anything?

41
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,631
The woman you have
a crush on is becoming

42
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,490
the most powerful person in Eureka,

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,321
so you might want to get her something.

44
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,853
I don't have a crush on anyone.

45
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,619
S.A.R.A.H., door.

46
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,419
S.A.R.A.H., door.

47
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,202
Okay, what's with all the looks

48
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,867
and the "Ms. Blakes?"
I was "Allison" until yesterday.

49
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,697
And you're taking over
Global Dynamics today.

50
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,637
Things are gonna be different.

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,853
- Has General Mansfield arrived yet?
- A few minutes ago.

52
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,189
He wanted to personally supervise
the change in command.

53
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:15,855
- And you handle biometric verification?
- And the retinal scan.

54
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:19,040
- Once you've replaced Dr. Stark...
- Succeeded Dr. Stark.

55
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,500
Once you're in charge,
Global's core computer systems

56
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,482
will immediately begin
the eight-hour reboot,

57
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,752
audit, and reset.

58
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,638
Everything but external security and

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,444
nominal desktop functionality
will be offline.

60
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,934
It's kind of like a snow day.

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,777
Normally it would've been
six months before we did the shutdown,

62
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,155
but with the accident
in Section Five and the transition,

63
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,629
the D.O.D. decided to move the date.

64
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,245
So, I guess I'll meet you inside.

65
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,809
- I was going to call you this morning.
- Hey, busy day.

66
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,217
I get it.

67
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:01,057
Again, I'm sorry about the way
things came down.

68
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:02,287
Don't be.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,829
It wasn't your call.

70
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:09,709
After you.

71
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,207
Dr. Stark, if you would place your hand
on the scanning device.

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,346
And now the retinal verification.

73
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,788
Retinal scan confirms a match.

74
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,729
Ms. Blake.

75
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,033
And a match on Ms. Blake.

76
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:04,919
Dr. Stark, if you would type in your
master password on the touch screen.

77
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,252
And now by keying in your own password,

78
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,493
you'll become the new head
of Global Dynamics.

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,794
Transfer is complete.

80
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,115
Global's computer reset will begin...

81
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:26,971
now.

82
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,689
Global Dynamics computer shut down.

83
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:33,275
In nine,

84
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,491
height,

85
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,544
seven,

86
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,637
six,

87
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:37,895
five,

88
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,029
four,

89
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,212
three,

90
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,298
two,

91
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,555
one.

92
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,642
The Global Dynamics
computer system is now offline.

93
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,263
Eight hours to reactivation.

94
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,327
The Global Dynamics
computer system is now offline.

95
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,238
Eight hours to reactivation.

96
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:02,464
When the computer does
a shut down like this

97
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,896
all operative projects are suspended.

98
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,669
All transportable protypes
are stored securely here in the vault.

99
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,431
There's an automatic inventory
as soon as the system comes back online.

100
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,068
Looks like some of this stuff
has been here for a while.

101
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,280
That's because we store
abandoned projects here as well.

102
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,219
We got organic, electronic, A.I....

103
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,381
you name it.

104
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,729
Your job will be to make sure
it all stays safe and sound.

105
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,025
You got some pretty big shoes to fill.

106
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,581
I got over 20 years
without a single loss.

107
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,099
What's supposed to be here?

108
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,656
You have got to be kidding me.

109
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,301
It's a big improvement.

110
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,353
It is missing something, though.

111
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,881
What is that?

112
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,352
A little parting gift.

113
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,650
My parting,

114
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,400
not yours.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,175
Thank you.

116
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,925
Now you're official.

117
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,063
You don't have to leave, you know.
It's not like you were fired.

118
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,792
I don't know.
This place, what it did to me...

119
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,251
gotta admit, it's kind of nice

120
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,684
not having all this
resting on my shoulders.

121
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,898
Was it really that bad?

122
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,296
Ms. Blake,

123
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,551
I'm afraid there's been
a breach in vault security.

124
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,176
A theft.

125
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:42,777
It's...

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,770
a category red device.

127
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,672

00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,292
- Season 2 | Episode 2 -
Try Try Again (v 1.0)

133
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,108
Oh, Sheriff Carter, General Mansfield.

134
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:42,270
- Sheriff.
- Hey,

135
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,435
so, what do we got?

136
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,305
Time warp, black hole, random quantum...

137
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,626
not that that ever happens here.

138
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:50,471
A protype for a next-generation "macaw"

139
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,111
is missing from the vault.

140
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:53,738
It's not a bird.

141
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,647
It's Multi Application Combat
Armor Alternative.

142
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,205
M.A.C.A.

143
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,683
- Personal force field generator.
- Oh,

144
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,371
a personal force field.

145
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,756
Uh, do you have a picture or something
so I know what I'm looking for?

146
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:09,918
Unfortunately, no.

147
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:12,679
With the computers offline,
the only thing I can tell you is that

148
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,346
it's a category red.

149
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,351
- I assume red is bad.
- Red is catastrophic.

150
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,289
Handled incorrectly,
a category red device could...

151
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,831
take out this entire facility.

152
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,362
Mansfield.

153
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,030
It needs to be found.

154
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,371
What are you doing?
Stop screwing around.

155
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:33,070
I'm not screwing around. I...

156
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:34,287
just...

157
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:36,726
- doing what we do.
- No more of that.

158
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:39,581
Okay.

159
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,395
I'll go find your catastrophe.

160
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,141
Thank you.

161
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:50,823
Yes?

162
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,699
Uh... Nice name plate.

163
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,161
It was a gift from Nathan.

164
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,645
You were gonna say something?

165
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,735
Uh... no.

166
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,024
I mean, you know... congratulations.

167
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,564
Thanks.

168
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:16,460
How are you doing, Henry?

169
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,275
Okay.

170
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,830
Considering.

171
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,517
Are you sleeping all right?

172
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,874
Really, I'm good. I...

173
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,538
just want to get back to work.

174
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,227
- At Global?
- Yes.

175
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:31,546
- Why?
- I want to continue Kim's research.

176
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:34,291
I can't get her back. I can at least

177
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,110
honor her memory
by finishing what she started.

178
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,156
And how do you feel about science now?

179
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:44,055
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

180
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:48,512
Well, you've been pretty vocal about
how you think Eureka has lost its way.

181
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:52,419
That noble ideas have turned
into weapons of destruction.

182
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,475
Science has failed you.

183
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:59,313
And now it's cost the life
of the woman you loved.

184
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,696
Science hasn't failed me.
The approach to it has.

185
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,703
And that's what I want to change.

186
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:08,362
Nathan Stark's experiences made him
want to leave Global altogether,

187
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:09,842
yet you want back in.

188
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,280
Nathan and I are very different people.

189
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,065
I don't see how his decision

190
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,380
has anything to do with
my wanting to get back to work.

191
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:20,523
So you think you can
put this tragedy behind you?

192
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:22,341
Never.

193
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:26,004
But I can be motivated by it.

194
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,451
That's good.

195
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:32,868
That's good.

196
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:34,982
Anything?

197
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,093
Naw.

198
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,277
With the main computer down,
I can't access any security footage.

199
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,817
Did I mention I'm one day away
from retiring with a perfect record?

200
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,897
Twice, yeah. Look, do you know who'd
want one of these force field things?

201
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,825
Yeah, me, right now!

202
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,990
All right, Victor. Think.

203
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,576
Who was down here this morning?

204
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,495
I don't know. A lot of people.

205
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,357
This is the GD storage vault.

206
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,065
With the computer about to shut down,

207
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,569
this was a busy place.

208
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:04,118
Well,  how about someone new?
You said you had a trainee.

209
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,239
Yeah.

210
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,536
But he got here later.

211
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:10,547
There was this one guy, though.

212
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,945
A shifty, weaselly,
suspicious kind of guy.

213
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,353
Um, thick, black-rimmed glasses?

214
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:19,552
Yeah!

215
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:22,173
I shoulda known.

216
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,737
Attention.

217
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,102
This is a reminder
that the Global Dynamic

218
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:29,122
computers will be offline
for the next eight hours.

219
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,448
You're not Fargo.

220
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:31,994
I'm Larry.

221
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,173
Hey, Larry. Um, I need Fargo.

222
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,634
You and a lot of people,
including Ms. Blake.

223
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,520
He went to the bathroom
about an hour ago,

224
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:39,654
never came back.

225
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,282
Not the best way
to impress your new boss.

226
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,034
Looks like something made an impression.

227
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,235
- You gonna stick around?
- Oh, I intend to.

228
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,606
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, there.

229
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,605
Anybody here?

230
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:08,644
No.

231
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:19,829
Yeah?

232
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,086
Whatcha doing?

233
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:23,966
Hiding.

234
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,683
Found the missing mech...

235
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:58,869
uh, ma...

236
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,632
- macarena.
- Fargo, look...

237
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,169
turn that thing off and take it back
to the vault right now.

238
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:04,434
I can't turn it off.

239
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:05,681
I can't open it up.

240
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,973
- Can't drop it.
- You probably don't want to do that.

241
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,433
And they can't take it back.

242
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,117
Personal force field!

243
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:20,147
Hardly catastrophic,
but very impressive.

244
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,374
Except for the not being able
to turn it off part.

245
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,891
What are you doing with that?

246
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,502
Nothing! I've never seen it before.
I found it in my pocket.

247
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,020
But you did turn it on.

248
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,647
- Uh, yeah.
- Why?

249
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:32,039
Um, because it's what I do?

250
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,624
Ridiculous as this may sound,
I happen to believe him.

251
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,087
I don't think anyone else
would pretend to be that stupid.

252
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,192
Oh, great.

253
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,567
Sorry!

254
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,148
Oh, why is this happening?

255
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:43,392
It's pretty amazing. I mean,

256
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,462
you've only had the job for what...
like, an hour?

257
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,628
- Actually, an hour and...
- Okay! I need this thing turned off.

258
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,309
- Are you sure?
- It might be safer for-

259
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:51,590
Please, just figure it out.

260
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,652
All we have to do
is to figure out who took it

261
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,716
or better yet, who built it.

262
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:57,756
But you gotta level with me.

263
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,178
Are you sure you don't know
anything about it?

264
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:03,239
- I wasn't here when it was developed.
- Who was?

265
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:07,277
Oh, crap!

266
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:13,042
Stark, need your help.

267
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:14,741
Carter, no.

268
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:16,199
It's about Fargo.

269
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:17,888
Fargo?

270
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,042
Yeah, you know, uh... glasses,
sort of accident-prone.

271
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,450
Yeah, yeah. What about him?

272
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:24,929
It seems he got caught
in some sort of, uh...

273
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:28,283
force field thingy. He got it from
the vault and he can't turn it off.

274
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:29,985
You talking about the M.A.C.A.?

275
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:33,205
Not that coherently, but yes.
What do you know about it?

276
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,925
I know that it was category red
and it was terminated.

277
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,426
Well, Fargo unterminated it.

278
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:40,460
And we can't get any information from
Global 'cause the computers are down.

279
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,254
- What do you know about it?
- Not a lot.

280
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,456
It's before my time.

281
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,609
Do you know anyone
who was associated with it?

282
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:48,029
Maybe.

283
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,681
Wow, someone's going
a little overboard on the firewood.

284
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,231
Chopping the wood
could be very therapeutic.

285
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,239
You never swung an ax in your life.

286
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,953
Swung a lot of things that
would surprise you, Sheriff.

287
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,235
What does that even mean?

288
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,704
There's Dr. Todd.

289
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,788
Don't get many visitors up here.

290
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,442
Well, we would've called but...

291
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:23,510
I don't have a phone,
so I guess you didn't take the hint.

292
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,766
Ultrasonic fishing rod?

293
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,102
- Pulse stuns the fish.
- It's painless.

294
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,300
Catch and release, I hope.

295
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,736
Unless I turn up the power.

296
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,568
I try my best not
to kill things anymore.

297
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:46,122
Yeah, we need some information
about your M.A.C.A.

298
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,126
If I tell you, will you go away?

299
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,966
Well, we have a situa...

300
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:51,741
All right! Enough!

301
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:55,196
Someone at GD messed
with it and is in trouble.

302
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:58,763
The M.A.C.A. was my project

303
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,663
five years ago until
I stopped working on it.

304
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:02,003
Because it had problems?

305
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:03,301
Because a man died.

306
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,500
We were having containment
issues with the power source.

307
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:09,796
Sometimes the power surged and
we couldn't stop it. And other times,

308
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,938
the biological backup would
activate spontaneously

309
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,003
and start drawing power
from the environment.

310
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:17,742
But we thought we'd solved it within
tolerated level. We thought it was safe.

311
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:19,469
What happened?

312
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,979
We were wrong.

313
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,373
The field around the test
subject started to grow.

314
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:26,482
After

315
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,692
three hours, it was as big as a house.

316
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,444
We calculated that after four hours

317
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,190
it would never be contained.

318
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,052
It would've taken out Global,
everything in it.

319
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,391
It would've taken out Eureka
and everything in it.

320
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,318
A force field growing at that rate?

321
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,723
It'd have displaced everything
in its path. Towns, cities,

322
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,474
nothing would've stopped it.

323
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:49,269
It's funny how four hours
can change your life.

324
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:54,358
- When you said you had to contain it...
- We dropped it...

325
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,705
and the man inside it into Section 14.

326
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,823
A two-mile-deep pit

327
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,742
that we used to
test nuclear weapons in the '50s.

328
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,370
And then we dropped in
a three-megaton bomb after it.

329
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:11,876
That was my last day at
Global Dynamics and my first day here.

330
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,717
I'd like you to leave now.

331
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,174
I'd like to get back to my fishing.

332
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:19,407
Dr. Todd,

333
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,548
I'm really sorry, but

334
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,984
we need some help here.

335
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,510
We need you to tell us what we can do.

336
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,022
You can say good-bye to your friend.

337
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,274
Thanks

338
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:49,392
How long since Fargo
turned on the generator?

339
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,593
Maybe two hours.

340
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,683
That only leaves us two hours.
It's not a lot of time.

341
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,683
That experiment was five years ago.

342
00:19:56,787 --> 00:20:00,073
You tell me that Global hasn't come up
with anything that can counter this?

343
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,414
Drop me at Henry's.

344
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,570
Still can't let go, huh?

345
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:20,624
Can you?

346
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:23,246
That's why I'm leaving Global.

347
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,503
- But I can't leave just yet.
- Why not?

348
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:27,558
I got work to do.

349
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:31,997
You get anything?

350
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,358
Uh, yeah.

351
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,194
Hey, Fargo.

352
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,691
Uh, you're gonna be okay...

353
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:41,350
just as long as the...
force field doesn't grow.

354
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:50,910
Oh, my God.

355
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:52,413
You can't stop it, can you?

356
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,986
Uh, not yet.

357
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,311
But if we don't give up,
you can't either.

358
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:06,737
I really have to go to the bathroom.

359
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:08,556
Of course you do.

360
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:11,908
Do we have any suspects yet?

361
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,464
No, unless you count this long list
of people around here

362
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:16,753
who find Fargo as annoying as we do.

363
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:18,872
Hey, that's not...

364
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,181
Oh, yes it is.

365
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:24,457
It's not so much who finds Fargo
annoying as who on this list stands...

366
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,710
to gain from what happened.

367
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,306
Like this guy.

368
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,120
Hey, Larry. Seen Fargo yet?

369
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,050
- Sure haven't.
- Well, I have.

370
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,403
See, it seems that somebody
stole something from the vault

371
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:39,608
that's gotten him
into a whole lot of trouble.

372
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,407
Trouble like maybe he won't be able
to return to his job for a while?

373
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:47,388
Trouble like the person who did this...
is gonna go to jail.

374
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:50,474
How do you feel about jail, Larry?

375
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,340
- Wait a minute, you think I...
- Motive seems clear to me.

376
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:57,467
You wanted this job, he got it.
Now you're here.

377
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:00,572
Did the guy in the vault
say that I was down there?

378
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:02,312
A lot of people have been down there.

379
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:03,861
Well, I wasn't one of them.

380
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,329
- Check the logs.
- I can't.

381
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:08,277
Not for 6 hours.
Not till the computers come back online.

382
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,093
- Well, that's convenient.
- Yeah... it is.

383
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,490
Isn't it?

384
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,002
I'm not even cleared for that section.

385
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,031
Hold on. We're not through.

386
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:20,602
Carter.

387
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:22,001
I think I found something.

388
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:24,128
I need you to bring Fargo
to Henry's garage.

389
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,943
- I'll be right there.
- Have a lead?

390
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:29,260
Um, I'm not sure yet.

391
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:31,056
Gotta go.

392
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:36,387
- He has an idea.
- So do I.

393
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:37,868
Open Section 14,

394
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,145
authorize the transfer
of the nuclear device.

395
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,044
- These things take time.
- Not yet.

396
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,367
Carter's never let me down.

397
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:58,766
You were right, Carter.

398
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:01,857
Something has changed since
Dr. Todd first tested the device.

399
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,810
We developed the next generation

400
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:06,643
non-lethal carbon
nanotube antipersonnel weapon.

401
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:08,367
I call it a goo gun.

402
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,504
It's for crowd control.

403
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,153
If fires an epoxy-like foam

404
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,818
that sticks people in their place
until they're collected later.

405
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,563
That's what
the first generation could do.

406
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,870
This baby could stop a jeep.
So I'm thinking...

407
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,800
If we can cover
Fargo's force field with it,

408
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,875
- we may be able to restrict its growth.
- Yeah, for how long?

409
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:28,136
Hopefully long enough for
Global's computers come back online.

410
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:34,562
Dr. Stark, are you smiling?

411
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:37,176
Course not.

412
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,678
You ready?

413
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:41,741
Does it matter?

414
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,040
I'm still alive,
in case anyone's interested.

415
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:13,340
Mission accomplished.

416
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,299
Yeah, all we have to do now...

417
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:18,375
Right.

418
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:20,213
What's happening?

419
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,629
The force field is still expanding.

420
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,004
And I'm all out of ideas.

421
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:40,057
The fact that Henry and Nathan
together came up dry, not encouraging.

422
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:43,017
I'm gonna need to take a look at
the hard copy backup of vault inventory.

423
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,119
- Why?
- Why?

424
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:45,872
Just a hunch.

425
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:47,933
But I think it might not be an accident

426
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,202
that the theft occurred
when the computers were down.

427
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,928
I know that you're trying,

428
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,636
but I think you need
to prepare yourself.

429
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:55,093
- For what?
- For what's coming.

430
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:57,358
Time is running out...
for Fargo, for Global...

431
00:25:57,478 --> 00:25:58,600
For you.

432
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,127
What are you implying?

433
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:03,178
Nothing.

434
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,161
Forget it. It just...
you seem different today.

435
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,455
Yeah, well, l am different.

436
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,875
Part of the job description.

437
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,066
Yeah, well, I'm not.

438
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,781
But like you said,
we're running out of time, so...

439
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,803
- I'm having Fargo moved to Section 14.
- Wait a minute...

440
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:18,971
It's just precautionary,

441
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,241
but under the circumstances,
I don't have a choice.

442
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:23,876
Look, if you want the hard copy,

443
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,223
the records are located in Section Three

444
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:28,986
along with every other record
from the history of Global.

445
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:31,172
The record section is big.

446
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:33,201
How big are we talking?

447
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:39,412
Big.

448
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:52,114
Oh, my...

449
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:56,298
Attention all Section 14 personnel.

450
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:59,312
Please make sure
you are wearing your radiation badges.

451
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,826
How fast is it growing?

452
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,050
Well...

453
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:05,385
It's not that bad.
Just hang in there.

454
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:07,302
Easy for you to say.

455
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:09,926
I know where we are.

456
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:13,923
I know what Section 14 is.
That pit's 10,000 feet deep.

457
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:18,628
It's the only place we have
that's big enough to hold you.

458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,917
That's all.

459
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,489
Hi, Fargo.

460
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:26,331
Henry.

461
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,611
So... how are you doing, Fargo?

462
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:35,120
I've been better.

463
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:38,149
Allison thought that you...
might want to talk.

464
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:42,115
Right, bring the psychiatrist in
to hear the dead guy's last words.

465
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:43,364
I didn't say that.

466
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:44,863
You didn't have to.

467
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:49,352
You know, I do have some last words.

468
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:51,616
Some things I want to get off my chest.

469
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,826
Good. I'm listening.

470
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,466
You better get a pad.

471
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,648
There's gonna be a lot to write down.

472
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:01,317
- How are you holding up?
- I'm not the one to worry about.

473
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,651
I can worry about you both.

474
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:04,235
Nuke on the way?

475
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:05,924
Not yet.

476
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Does Fargo know?

477
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,045
Not yet.

478
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:12,122
We have 30 minutes.
Carter's working on something.

479
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,260
And if that doesn't pan out?

480
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,902
Half an hour, I'll have no choice.

481
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:19,937
Hell of a first day.

482
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:23,416
Yes, it is.

483
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,445
Email to Allison Blake.

484
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:30,506
You are the most
intoxicating woman I ever met.

485
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:32,732
I used to dream of you
catching me asleep

486
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,095
on your desk late at night.

487
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,060
Send one of those to Jo,

488
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,047
and substitute "jail cell" for "desk".

489
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,346
Oh, and...

490
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,305
send one to yourself
substituting "couch".

491
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,285
And see if you can work
the word "tempestuous" in there.

492
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,377
Now, Sheriff Carter.

493
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:56,539
You really tried to help me
on my last day, and, um...

494
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:58,857
for that, I don't know how to thank you.

495
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,342
- That's actually quite tou...
- If only you were better at your job.

496
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,233
Victor!

497
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,405
Leaving a little early today,
aren't you?

498
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,647
About half an hour ahead
of your regular schedule?

499
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,381
What are you talking about?

500
00:29:16,732 --> 00:29:18,520
What do you know
about my regular schedule?

501
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:19,658
A lot.

502
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:22,029
We know a lot about
everything you do, Victor.

503
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:23,735
Jo and I just spend
a little quality time

504
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,356
looking through your vault records.

505
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:29,631
You didn't know we could do that
with the computers down, huh?

506
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,341
Come on, you wanna do honors?

507
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:39,843
Move ! Let me through !

508
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,663
Clear the way !

509
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:56,989
It's okay.

510
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:00,296
All right, Victor.

511
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,591
Here it is.

512
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:05,131
You not only stole the generator,

513
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:08,306
you stole a lot of stuff in the vault.

514
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,924
And you knew you were safe
until the computer reboot

515
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:12,409
forced the next vault inventory.

516
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:13,688
Once you found out

517
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,873
that they were gonna
shut down the computers early,

518
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,116
you knew you had to find
someone to frame.

519
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,843
- And who better than Douglas Fargo?
- I have no idea what...

520
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:23,276
We'll have all the proof we need
with computers back online,

521
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:24,924
but by then, a man will be dead.

522
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:27,418
And that'll be your fault,
and that's murder.

523
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,249
If you talk then
it'll be too late for you...

524
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:31,504
and too late for Fargo.

525
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,357
He wasn't supposed to turn it on.

526
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,651
Well, it's Fargo!

527
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:36,028
Of course he turned it on.

528
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,572
Who was buying the stolen equipment?

529
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:39,329
Who wanted the force field generator?

530
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:40,724
I don't...

531
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,529
I need to know who paid you to steal it?

532
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,328
Do they know how to turn it off?

533
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:46,084
You don't understand.

534
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:47,771
I didn't sell the technology.

535
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,321
I just sold the parts.

536
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,095
I picked something that would fit
in Fargo's pocket.

537
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:53,748
I never intended to sell it.

538
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,165
I just needed a fall guy.

539
00:30:58,665 --> 00:30:59,915
What are we gonna do now?

540
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,799
Yes, this is Allison Blake.

541
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:16,475
I'm authorizing
a priority one mobilization, Section 14.

542
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,105
Yes, that's right.

543
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:20,565
Bring in the nuclear device.

544
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:55,889
Allison, can I have a word
with you please?

545
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:58,294
You're cutting this awfully close.

546
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:00,618
We're trying to save a life.
Rushing isn't gonna help.

547
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,872
This is the kind of decision
someone in your position

548
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:04,048
has to be prepared to make.

549
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,068
I'm aware of that. And questioning
my approach doesn't make it any easier.

550
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:09,200
It's not about easy, Allison.

551
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,975
It's about having faith
you made the right choice.

552
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:14,918
Do you have faith?

553
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:55,550
You did everything you could.

554
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:57,477
More than anybody else.

555
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,568
Not that it matters.
Fargo's still gonna die.

556
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:03,094
Four hours really can change your life.

557
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,325
You're right.

558
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,666
Uh, Fargo activated
the generator four hours ago.

559
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:13,045
Dr. Todd said that
after three hours, the...

560
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,986
the force field was as big as a house.

561
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,477
- It's nowhere near that big.
- It's growing more slowly.

562
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:21,552
- The power supply is unstable.
- Maybe it's the way it was handled.

563
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,325
Or... or stored.

564
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,077
It sat right here
for five years until today.

565
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,510
- Could've been touching this.
- Yeah, whatever this is.

566
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,970
This could be the answer but
without access to computers...

567
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,852
Jo has the inventory. We got it
from Section Three this afternoon.

568
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,713
We still can't compare the field's
growth rate to the first experiment.

569
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:40,736
All that data is in the computer.

570
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:43,564
And one other place.

571
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:49,479
Dr. Todd, do not zap me with that thing.

572
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:52,226
I guess I wasn't clear about
not wanting any visitors.

573
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,614
No, you were clear,
but it's different now.

574
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,541
I still want to be left alone now,
you're still bothering me now, so?

575
00:33:57,643 --> 00:33:59,264
The force field is different.

576
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,027
It's growing more slowly.

577
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:04,172
It's been four hours and
Fargo still fits in Section 14.

578
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:06,263
If it slowed down,
maybe it can be stopped.

579
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:08,368
Let us take you back to Global.

580
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:10,186
Help us figure this out.

581
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:11,900
There's nothing I can do.

582
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:14,675
Dr. Todd, your device was stored

583
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,094
next to another protype
that created a magnetic field.

584
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,294
Is there a possibility
of some sort of power drain?

585
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:20,889
Look at the specs.

586
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,314
Check the test records.

587
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,093
We don't have the specs, we have you.

588
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,811
I know how you feel.

589
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,096
Believe me.

590
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:32,542
We both made mistakes at Global.

591
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,660
Lost people who trusted us.

592
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,257
But today, we got a chance
to try and make things right.

593
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,432
- How long has it been?
- Five hours.

594
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:48,824
You're right. Something's slowing
the field's growth rate.

595
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:53,075
- You're generating a magnetic field?
- Generating it isn't the hard part.

596
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:56,000
It's the modulation that's tricky.
Do you want to check my readings?

597
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:59,020
I never thought I'd say
the phrase "last chance"

598
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:00,884
so many times in a single day.

599
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,191
Allison...

600
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:05,453
why has he not been lowered
into Section 14?

601
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,839
- We're exploring one final alternative.
- You have missed the cut-off.

602
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,534
There was a firm deadline in place.

603
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:13,414
- Um, I'm aware of that.
- You are risking this entire facility

604
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,833
and everyone in it on one man.

605
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:18,006
That is not a logical choice.

606
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,948
That is an emotional one.

607
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,834
Well, sir, that's your opinion.

608
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,662
Yes, and if you do not reconsider,

609
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:28,503
I will have no choice but to remove you
as head of Global Dynamics.

610
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,485
Actually, sir,

611
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,013
I'm afraid you can't do that.

612
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,460
- I beg your pardon.
- Protocol states that no transfer

613
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,620
of power or relief
of duty can be effected

614
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,642
when the Global computer systems
are down.

615
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,706
Security concerns. So...

616
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,642
you can't fire me
for another three hours.

617
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:53,422
You do understand that once
that force field gets to be too large

618
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:56,538
to leave this facility it will also be
too large to fit into that hole.

619
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:59,291
And at that point, containment
will be out of the question.

620
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,710
Let's hope that doesn't have
to happen, sir.

621
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:10,503
I think I'm starting to like
the new you.

622
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,303
It... it's shrinking!

623
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:19,079
Look, the light's fading.

624
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:20,825
He's right... the field is contracting.

625
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,594
The mag field's affecting
the power source.

626
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,725
Wait, the light's out!

627
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,818
Then why is the force field still there?

628
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,422
Wait,

629
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:40,317
- now there's a red light.
- The alternate power source

630
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,433
- has been activated.
- How?

631
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,797
Told you it draws power
from environment.

632
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:46,956
What environment?
There's no one in there but Fargo.

633
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,925
Exactly... it's biological power.
His body is the power source.

634
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:51,436
Fine. The field is shrinking which

635
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,165
means we can use
the computers when they-

636
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,416
You don't understand.
Power requirement is tremendous.

637
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,401
Finding the source
is the default priority.

638
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:59,695
- Which means?
- It'll kill him.

639
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:01,711
So what do we do?

640
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,632
We're not gonna let
that thing kill Fargo.

641
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,824
I'm gonna kill him first.

642
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,176
Fargo's the battery
that powers the force field?

643
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,857
- Essentially.
- So to collapse it,

644
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:21,907
we need to shut that battery down.

645
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,394
- What?
- Just... just for a second.

646
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,197
How? Nothing can get through the field.

647
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:27,742
We can hear him, right?

648
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,470
It'll pack quite a punch.

649
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,395
The sonic pulse will target
the area just like a bullet.

650
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,032
We hit Fargo's heart,

651
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,385
it will stop.

652
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,613
- You're gonna what?
- Is the defibrillator ready?

653
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,513
- Ready to go.
- Right.

654
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:45,363
- Let's do this.
- Hold on.

655
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:49,000
l am the one with the most marksmanship
titles in special forces history.

656
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:50,679
- Right, good point.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,036
Let...

658
00:37:58,612 --> 00:37:59,938
Locked and loaded.

659
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,216
- Fire when ready.
- Now, is that when I'm ready, or...

660
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:22,052
Clear!

661
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:35,114
Clear!

662
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:41,161
Damn it! Come on. Just...

663
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,409
Come on, Fargo.

664
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:04,931
You all right?

665
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:07,583
Who ripped my shirt?

666
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,123
He's fine.

667
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,333
Good job, Carter.

668
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:19,748
Wow, that didn't even leave
a bad taste in my mouth.

669
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,064
Oh, give it a second.

670
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,507
Yep, there it is.

671
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,260
Thanks, Dr. Stark.

672
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,816
I feel closer to you
than I ever have before.

673
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,989
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

674
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:34,694
Seriously...

675
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:38,411
what you and Sheriff Carter did was...

676
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,623
- a miracle.
- No, we just didn't give up.

677
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,316
No one did.

678
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,440
Thanks for killing me.

679
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,557
Any time.

680
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,563
If you happen to get an email from me...

681
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,250
Yeah, I already did.

682
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,874
Done here?

683
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,116
I'm glad I was wrong.

684
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:39,104
I hear there's a two-for-one deal
at colossusjobs.com,

685
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:41,501
if you want to get your resume
up with mine.

686
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,462
I think I'm safe here.

687
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:45,001
At least for another day.

688
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,374
You did good today.

689
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,452
Handled the situation
better than I would've.

690
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,307
Not better, just...

691
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:55,463
just differently.

692
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,346
Nathan...

693
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,493
Global needs you.

694
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:04,242
I need you.

695
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,790
Really?

696
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,935
And Carter's right.
The two of you do work well together.

697
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:13,724
You just know how to ruin the moment.

698
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:15,127
Just think about it.

699
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:20,071
Well, maybe you should think about
how well you and I work together.

700
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:22,813
You have a lot of faith in yourself.

701
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:24,247
I do.

702
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:28,626
Me too.

703
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,074
Attention.

704
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:35,220
Global Dynamics computer systems
are now back online.

705
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,936

00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:44,483
Good evening, Sheriff Carter.

707
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:45,893
Hard day at work?

708
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,252
Eh, they've been easier.

709
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,217
Hey, Dad.

710
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,630
Hey.

711
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:09,146
Catch any bad guys today?

712
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,494
Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

713
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:14,152
How was the make-up exam?

714
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,303
You know how you're always saying,
"Try, try again"?

715
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,192
Yeah, well, never more than today.

716
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:20,840
Well, I did.

717
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,070
And I passed.

718
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,777
You are now looking at
the proud graduate of Driver's Ed.

719
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:31,170
So when do you want
to take me out driving?
