00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,170
<i>Previously on Eureka...</i>

2
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:03,404
Because of his autism,

3
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:04,839
Kevin's usually
more comfortable

4
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:07,574
with technology than people.

5
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:08,880
Marry me, JoJo.

6
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,878
I don't know what to say.

7
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,728
I don't have you here.

8
00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:15,182
I just don't know
if I can do it anymore.

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,346
Bye, Jack.

10
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:21,554
I'm pretty sure
we're in 1947.

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,525
You're all from 2010?

12
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:25,495
From the Eureka
that you helped create.

13
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:28,465
And now we need your
help to get us back.

14
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,834
Just for luck.

15
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:37,287
Thanks for getting
us home, Henry.

16
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,582
And somehow
everything is just the same?

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,040
Isn't that supposed
to be granite?

18
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,135
If that's different,

19
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,097
other stuff could
be too, right?

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,092
Yes, I will marry you.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,292
Me marry you?

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,659
In what universe?

23
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,159
Kevin? Honey?

24
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:56,894
Where are you?

25
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,761
Relax, mom.
I'm right here.

26
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,029
Nice hat.

27
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:02,695
I'll be home before dinner.

28
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,632
S.A.R.A.H.?
You there?

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,500
Yes, sheriff.

30
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:24,002
Is, uh, is Zoe
still at Harvard?

31
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,736
Of course she is, Jack.

32
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,203
Where else would she be?

33
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:33,405
Look at you, handsome.

34
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:34,906
Mm.

35
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,342
I thought
you'd never get home.

36
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,143
Yeah, me neither.

37
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,077
You're...
You're not in Australia.

38
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:48,679
I mean, uh, for...
for example.

39
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:50,913
Um, yeah,
that would be true.

40
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,180
[Laughs]

41
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:54,848
S.A.R.A.H., um, can you
get Jack some lunch?

42
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,082
I think his brain is hungry.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,917
Bacon cheeseburger
with extra bacon coming up.

44
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,718
Okay, well, enjoy.

45
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,152
I got to go.

46
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,620
Wish me luck.

47
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:07,121
Testing day?

48
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,090
We're pulling Tiny
out of section five.

49
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:10,258
Taking her through her paces.

50
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,325
Yeah, uh, Tiny.

51
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes.
Uh, good luck.

52
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:15,761
Thanks.

53
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:17,029
Jack, is this...

54
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,730
Is this about the thing?

55
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,864
Because if it is
about the thing,

56
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,399
then I just need
more time to think.

57
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,900
Sure.

58
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:29,868
Yeah. I get that.

59
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:31,936
It's the thing.

60
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:35,437
Sheriff,
Kevin is at the door.

61
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,570
Why are parents
so freakin' lame?

62
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,372
Holy smokes.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,940
Give her a break, Kev.

64
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,173
Kevin.

65
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,440
Uh, Jack.

66
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:46,708
Ignore him.
He hasn't had his lunch.

67
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,476
I smell bacon.

68
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,377
That's Kevin.

69
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:52,411
So get this.

70
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,112
Mom was late this morning,

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,479
and I didn't get
to make it to Dre's.

72
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:57,414
And, I mean, she's always
on me about being late.

73
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:58,681
Maybe now she'll realize

74
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,249
that time
is a relativistic construct

75
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:01,717
and ease up.

76
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:02,984
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

77
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:04,585
But, listen,
I'm going home before work,

78
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,919
so I can take you into town.

79
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,420
Cool. Thanks.

80
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,654
Bye.

81
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,288
Bye.

82
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,289
Later, Jack.

83
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,591
Yeah.

84
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:15,625
Ha...

85
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,460
Have a good day.

86
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,696
Hey, dungeon master,

87
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,764
when am I
getting out of here?

88
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,266
I don't know.

89
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,967
What'd you do?

90
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:29,735
Nothing.

91
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,937
You just like
throwing me in jail.

92
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,072
So I...I unlocked a few cages.

93
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,708
Those monkeys
deserve some freedom.

94
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:42,510
Lupo, be a human.
I've got a date.

95
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,745
A date.

96
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,546
With who?

97
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:47,747
You know the blonde chick

98
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,315
with the phd in
reproductive biology?

99
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,784
And we're gonna
play doctorate.

100
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,154
Get out.

101
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,588
Gonna taze me
in the ass again?

102
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,490
Just get out.

103
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,564
[Knock on door]

104
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:12,932
Allison?

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,702
I'm here, Carter.

106
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,702
Hey.

107
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,671
Hey.

108
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,072
You okay?

109
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,875
Well, I came in,

110
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:30,110
and Jenna was with the nanny.

111
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:34,115
And Kevin...

112
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:37,151
Yeah, I... I know.

113
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,353
He came by my place.

114
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,090
He's different.

115
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,494
He stole my bacon.

116
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,862
I don't believe it.

117
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,164
I mean, he came in.
He talked to me.

118
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:49,598
He looked at me.

119
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,366
We've changed him somehow.

120
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,068
That's not the only thing.

121
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:57,038
Um, when I got back...

122
00:04:57,105 --> 00:05:02,210
Uh, Tess was at my place.

123
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,380
She never moved away.

124
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:11,118
And from what I can tell,
we're still together.

125
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,154
Oh...

126
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,855
Um...

127
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:17,291
Well, that's good.

128
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,894
Happy for you.

129
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,229
It's something.

130
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,935
I feel like I'm being a jerk to
Allison and felt like a liar,

131
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,970
not at least trying to explain
to Tess what happened.

132
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:33,405
- No, you did the right thing.
- Nah.

133
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:34,906
Talking about
an alternate timeline

134
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,374
could have
unforeseen repercussions.

135
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,309
What, besides everybody
thinking we're nuts?

136
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,044
And please tell me
this thing's out of batteries.

137
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,446
Oh, it still could have

138
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,781
enough residual antibaryons
to open a wormhole.

139
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:46,083
You know, Allison
should get this taken to G.D.

140
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,351
Yeah, she's on it.

141
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,752
She's also really focused
on Kevin.

142
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,021
I mean,
how could he just change?

143
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,422
The perceived present

144
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,790
is built on events
of the past.

145
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,058
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, sorry.

146
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,125
But, uh, Kevin isn't an event.

147
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,493
He's a person.

148
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,228
And now he's
a completely different person.

149
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:00,796
The causes of autism
are not clear.

150
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,397
They seem to require

151
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:07,001
a series of genetic and
environmental dominoes to fall.

152
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,703
So, Henry,
do you think it's possible

153
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,003
that he did it on purpose?

154
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,471
That... no, that he
targeted the five of us,

155
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,940
he messes with the machine
to set us back,

156
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,308
so he would change.

157
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,543
We're talking about
decades of history here.

158
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,780
I mean, the calculations
of probability and outcome

159
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,548
are infinitely complex.

160
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,650
Yeah, we're also talking about
scary-smart Kevin.

161
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,285
But not this Kevin.

162
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,486
And that machine
was not altered

163
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,721
to target specific people.

164
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,625
And this Kevin did not
send us back into time.

165
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,294
Okay, so his intentions...

166
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,996
Are locked in a boy

167
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,997
whose consciousness
of that event

168
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:41,832
no longer exist.

169
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,667
Hi, Carter.

170
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:44,902
Hey, sweetie.

171
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,101
Hi.

172
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,369
All right, you should get up there.

173
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:49,836
- It's almost time.
- For?

174
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:52,469
Shut up.

175
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,538
Giving speeches is his
favorite part of being mayor.

176
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,140
He complains, but he loves it.

177
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,208
- Ha.
- Yeah.

178
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,209
A speech for Founders' Day.

179
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:01,477
I'll be right over.

180
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,145
She's on the committee.

181
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,747
Yes, Grace.

182
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,615
And I'm pretty sure
I'm married to her.

183
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:07,816
Oh, dear.

184
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:10,718
Oh, yes.

185
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:15,056
Hello, and welcome
to Founders' Day.

186
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,091
It's a good thing
to get together

187
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:22,530
and realize that the past
is still very much with us...

188
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:25,399
So Zane un-proposed?

189
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,368
I thought proposals were
a no-backsies kind of deal.

190
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,435
No, he didn't take it back.

191
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:29,536
He never asked me.

192
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:31,472
You see, we never even dated.

193
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:32,473
So how's your day going?

194
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,707
Oh, swell.

195
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,209
Remember Julia,
my sort of girlfriend?

196
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,244
Sure.

197
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:37,745
Yeah, we never met.

198
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:39,981
She works for Google,
she's, like, a gazillionaire,

199
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,282
and she's married
to an astronaut.

200
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,250
I'm sorry.

201
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:43,818
An astronaut.

202
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,420
And other than that
cheery chestnut,

203
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:48,723
I seem to be living
my same old life, alone.

204
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,625
This reality blows.

205
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,727
Amen, sister.

206
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,631
What's this on your face?

207
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:57,732
Mom, quit it.

208
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,666
Nope, not gonna quit it.

209
00:07:58,734 --> 00:07:59,767
I'm gonna go get a burger.

210
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,903
Try and survive without me.

211
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:05,939
Amazing, isn't it?

212
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,908
Good-looking boy
you got there.

213
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,309
Love what you've done
with the place.

214
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,244
You did all this
to make me feel at home?

215
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,245
I don't know what to say.

216
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:15,212
Oh, my God.

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,413
Could say that, yeah.

218
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,613
You're not
supposed to be here.

219
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,081
I was thinking
the same thing.

220
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,883
Although the problem
isn't the here, it's the now.

221
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,951
This doohickey worked.
You believe it?

222
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,920
It's one of Henry's markers
made from your phone.

223
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,087
Yeah, when we
switched jackets,

224
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:28,255
it was in my pocket.

225
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:29,456
Please.
Don't blame yourself.

226
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:30,457
I wasn't planning to.

227
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,925
Okay, Carter.

228
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,661
Dr. Grant, I know this must
be overwhelming for you.

229
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:35,862
We know what it feels like

230
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,197
to be pulled away
from our own time.

231
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:38,498
Thank you.
It's fine here.

232
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,299
I just expected...

233
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,468
I thought there'd be
more flying cars,

234
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:44,203
robotic servants,

235
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,773
super highways
stretching into the sky.

236
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,942
Less '47 Chrysler New Yorkers.

237
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,511
But, you know...

238
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,879
Well, sorry to
disappoint you,

239
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,380
but I promise you

240
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,549
we will get you back where
you belong lickety split.

241
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:59,185
Thank you.
Until then, Dr. Blake,

242
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,354
would you care
for some cotton candy?

243
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:02,755
No, no, no!

244
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,724
Can't walk around
looking at everything

245
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,526
that's been invented
since the... telephone.

246
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:07,794
Which was invented in 1876.

247
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:08,828
Stay.

248
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,063
Thank you, no.

249
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,498
I got a whole new
world to explore.

250
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:12,666
Be seeing you.

251
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,034
Dr. Grant, please.

252
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,002
Just while we talk
over the situation.

253
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,905
All right, for you.

254
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:23,144
Thank you.
I'll be back.

255
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,413
Henry.

256
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,447
Can I borrow you for a second?

257
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,782
Sure.

258
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,619
Oh, my God.

259
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:37,288
He had this.

260
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:39,290
That guy's bad news,

261
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:41,725
and we got to get him back
where he belongs and fix this.

262
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,194
What?

263
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:44,595
There's nothing to fix.

264
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,997
Allison, our time journey

265
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,365
could have had a huge impact.

266
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,766
We don't know
if man walked on the moon.

267
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,401
We could have changed anything.

268
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,002
Yeah, we changed Kevin.

269
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,337
- Both: I know.
- We know.

270
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:56,272
I'm not gonna lose him again.

271
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,074
We have to examine
the bridge device.

272
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,510
It could be supporting
an unstable temporal wormhole.

273
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:03,246
Space-time could unravel.

274
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:05,815
Unraveling space-time is bad.

275
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,488
I'll arrange the transport.

276
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:15,056
Things have really
changed around here.

277
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,325
Eureka is a new town.

278
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,914
Let's go.

279
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,582
Everybody go!
Go!

280
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,583
Off! Off the street!

281
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,353
Go! Go! Off!

282
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,757
Run!
Everybody, run!

283
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,326
Tiny!

284
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,563
Tiny, stop! Stop!

285
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:55,098
Stop! Tiny!

286
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,100
Bad robot!

287
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,301
Bad! Bad! Stop!

288
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,670
The more things change...

289
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,338
The more they stay the same.

290
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:06,073
Mm-hmm.

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sync by fant0m, corrected by gloriabg

292
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,484
Another day,
another runaway robot.

293
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:21,485
Anyone hurt?

294
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,820
Not yet.

295
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:24,154
I have been working
on that probe

296
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,589
for ten months!

297
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,122
- If you need a probe, Red...
- You know what...

298
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,058
You, go.
Do it.

299
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:37,698
You really think someone
messed with your giant bug?

300
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:38,767
Tiny was built

301
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:41,368
to sample atmospheric
electricity on Titan.

302
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:42,637
Her power cell was hardened.

303
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,238
There was no way
it would just short out.

304
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:45,673
Any particular reason

305
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,342
you think it was Zane?

306
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,244
Uh, because he's a jackass.

307
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,213
That's why I kicked him
off my design team, Jack.

308
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,716
He's in your jail so much
he has his own pillow.

309
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,952
Okay. If you want
to fix the remote,

310
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,221
I will find Tiny.

311
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,956
Thank you, love.

312
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:00,924
Hey.

313
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,059
Hey.

314
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:04,060
[Exhales]

315
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:05,794
That looked...

316
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,495
Intimate.

317
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:10,295
This is one of the
weirder days ever.

318
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,764
What's the story
on the time machine?

319
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,398
Well, it's not a time
machine precisely.

320
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:17,267
I mean, it connects
two timelines.

321
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,635
Allison's moving it to G.D.

322
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,203
To see if it has
enough residual power

323
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,204
in order to open up
a new wormhole.

324
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,605
Great. And send
Doctor Charming home.

325
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:27,474
And as for our hitchhiker,

326
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,309
I designed these markers

327
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:32,345
to detect our temporal anomalies.

328
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,946
In order to transport Dr. Grant,

329
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:38,116
it would have had
to have been retuned manually.

330
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,655
Listen to me.

331
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,059
I'm responsible for the
greatest scientific experiment

332
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:48,494
known to mankind,

333
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:49,895
and this is the way
you're treating me?

334
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,364
It's a crying shame, Jack.

335
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,134
Well, I know, and, uh, I...

336
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,238
Oh, you know what else
is a crying shame?

337
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,707
Is you trying
to strand me in 1947!

338
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,140
Where'd you get that idea?

339
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,008
Oh, you tweaked my marker
so it worked for you,

340
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,710
and you risked my life to do it.

341
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,612
You just wanted
to see the future.

342
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,547
And what a disappointment it is.

343
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,416
Where a visitor's treated

344
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:12,118
with cruel suspicion
and accusations.

345
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,753
Future's come a long way.

346
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,319
Yeah, well,
my cell, my time, my rules.

347
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,187
Get comfy.

348
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,588
Take a seat.

349
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:21,990
Look at this.

350
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,391
You know what this means?

351
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,626
I'm fat.

352
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:28,496
In this timeline,
I am the fat deputy.

353
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:31,566
Oh, no, ma'am.

354
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:32,933
- Sheriff Andy.
- Sheriff Andy?

355
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:36,268
Well, I appreciate
the promotion, boss,

356
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,337
but I'm still
just your deputy.

357
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,904
A robot deputy.

358
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,439
This thing's really a machine?

359
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,007
Yeah.

360
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,475
I prefer synthetic colleague.

361
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,544
That's a bit more like
the future I envisioned.

362
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:50,378
Miss Lupo, why are you
wearing my spare uniform?

363
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,579
Yeah.

364
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:52,912
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

365
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,212
We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

366
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,247
No fiance and no job.

367
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,249
Good to be home.

368
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,821
Come closer, robot man.

369
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,694
You're extremely lifelike.

370
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,129
[Chuckles]

371
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:17,165
I'd love to get a look
under your uniform.

372
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:21,334
Boss?

373
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,404
Tiny gives off
an alpha-ray signature,

374
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,175
but it's very difficult
to follow in this environment.

375
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:30,778
Yeah, but I think
we're on the right track.

376
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:42,786
Andy, mind if I test
your memory circuits a little?

377
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:43,853
Little game to pass the time?

378
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,288
Sure.

379
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:48,423
Yes, how long have you and
I been working together?

380
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,558
312 days, 16 hours.

381
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,326
And Lupo left
when you got here?

382
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:56,195
Miss Lupo wasn't too happy she
didn't get promoted to sheriff.

383
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,895
Yeah, I, uh...

384
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,096
I'm really enjoying this game.

385
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,396
Can we do movie trivia next?

386
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,431
Sure.
Yeah, let's do History.

387
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:05,701
Uh, when did man
first walk on the moon?

388
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,069
Neil Armstrong,
July 20th, 1969.

389
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:10,905
And when did the
designated hitter rule

390
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:12,540
come in and ruin baseball?

391
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,141
Oh, 1973,

392
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,710
but the D.H. Rule

393
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,911
actually extended the careers

394
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,378
of many stars of the game.

395
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,512
Sheriff, do you mind if I
shoot a question your way?

396
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,180
Yeah, sure.

397
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:23,981
Did you happen
to go back to 1947,

398
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,616
come back to an
altered timeline?

399
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:29,019
That seems
a bit of a stretch.

400
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,253
Why would you ask?

401
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,088
Huh. Well, the questions
lead me to think

402
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,557
that you're trying to see
if history is still the same.

403
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,492
That, and the pollen
in your hair has pollution

404
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,393
consistent of the late 1940s.

405
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,729
And our prisoner
matches a Dr. Grant

406
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,363
that disappeared in 1947

407
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,098
with five other
unidentified suspects.

408
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,766
I connected the dots.

409
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,234
Nice connecting.

410
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:49,268
Thanks, boss.

411
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:53,371
[Mechanical whirring]

412
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:55,473
Well.

413
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,580
Did somebody take a tumble?

414
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,588
Morning, Chief.

415
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,256
Hi.

416
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:15,158
Uh, find an empty lab
in section five for the device.

417
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,226
Something off of
corridor "D" that's quiet.

418
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:18,494
Got it.

419
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,096
When did they
start calling me chief?

420
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,301
Good lord.

421
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,803
This is my office?

422
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,372
Well, apparently in this
timeline, I have no taste.

423
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,907
Are you kidding?

424
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,375
This is wicked.

425
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:36,976
It's, like, my dream office.

426
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,512
Oh... no!

427
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:47,818
Fargo, they weren't
calling me Chief.

428
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:51,420
Fargo, this is your office.

429
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:55,323
I'm running G.D.?

430
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,928
Tiny's on her way to G.D.

431
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,530
I'm just heading
back out to the scene,

432
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,164
finish my incident report.

433
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,598
Paperwork, huh?

434
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,333
Big whoop, tin man.

435
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,702
I imagine
going back to the past

436
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,607
will put you in a sour mood.

437
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,810
Carter told you?

438
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,279
Well, he confirmed a hunch.

439
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:21,014
Don't worry.
I know it's all on the down low.

440
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,850
I thought
you'd be out and about,

441
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,951
seeing what's changed.

442
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:25,886
I have no man and no job.

443
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,188
That's enough change
for one day.

444
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,890
No job?

445
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,899
Afternoon.

446
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,635
Hey.

447
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,171
You tell what happened to it, yet?

448
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,774
No, still untangling
her electrical system.

449
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,309
Hey, you want to hold Zane down

450
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,577
while I beat
the crap out of him,

451
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,112
or you want to take turns?

452
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,613
Well, we should
probably take turns,

453
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:51,048
but, um, usually prefer
to have evidence.

454
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,015
Killjoy.

455
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,349
Yeah.

456
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,617
Listen, thank you
for finding Tiny for me.

457
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:56,851
You're welcome.

458
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,986
You're always there
when I need you.

459
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:01,354
Um, listen, Jack.

460
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:05,423
I've been thinking about
the, um, you know, the thing.

461
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,191
- It.
- It.

462
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:11,796
And, um, my answer is yes.

463
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:13,531
Yes. Yes.

464
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,000
Absolutely, yes.

465
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:19,371
Mm.

466
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:20,905
Aren't you happy?

467
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:21,906
Oh, you know...

468
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:22,873
[Laughter]

469
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,073
Yes, I'm happy.

470
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,641
I mean, you look
a little shocked.

471
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,210
Well, I'm a little...

472
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:35,584
Medic!

473
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,137
What happened?

474
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,505
Uh, some kind
of electrical shock.

475
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:47,540
Don't you love his hair?

476
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,608
It's so Fluffy.
Fluffy.

477
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:52,077
Fluffy's a funny word.
Fluffy.

478
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,545
She's a little out of it.

479
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,179
All right, well, let's
get her into the infirmary.

480
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,480
Okay.

481
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:58,715
Did you see...
Did you see the big, red elf?

482
00:18:58,783 --> 00:18:59,850
Yes.
Yes, we did.

483
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:00,917
He's an awesome red elf.

484
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:02,185
It was a big, red elf.

485
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,886
Nurse, this woman
needs a neuro exam.

486
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,788
Where's the doctor in charge?

487
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,556
That's you, Dr. Blake.

488
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,324
Oh, okay.

489
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:11,426
So, well, then give
me a E.E.G., lights,

490
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:12,560
and set up
for a portable MRI.

491
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:13,561
Right away.

492
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,762
You're the medical director?

493
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,530
Don't ask me.

494
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:18,064
Never gonna be able
to keep this straight.

495
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,399
Is Elvis gonna walk
through the door?

496
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:20,566
That would be so cool.

497
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:21,633
We could show him
the big red elf.

498
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,101
Yes, we could.

499
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,136
You know, Allison's
gonna take care of you, okay?

500
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,170
You understand?

501
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,039
I love you.

502
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:34,311
Fluffy.

503
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:36,980
Jack.

504
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:38,648
Hey, Fargo.

505
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:39,783
Got a minute?

506
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,085
Uh, Dr. Fargo
does not have a minute.

507
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,420
But I can squeeze you in
for next Tuesday.

508
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,521
Larry, I always have time
for sheriff Carter.

509
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,559
Heard about the promotion.

510
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,660
Isn't it awesome?

511
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,128
Larry has to do
everything I say.

512
00:19:55,196 --> 00:20:00,799
Larry, one foot.
Now.

513
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,634
Uh, look, we got problems.

514
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,135
Tess' bug blew again,

515
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,404
and, uh, this time she got hurt.

516
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,440
Send a basket of
mini muffins to Dr. Fontana.

517
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,475
Send a team to find out
exactly what happened.

518
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,943
My day is just packed.

519
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,077
Fargo, send a team.

520
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,713
Larry, uh, clear my afternoon.

521
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:20,782
You got it, Chief.

522
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,252
Hey, uh, where's Zane?
I need to talk to him.

523
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,553
I don't know.

524
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:26,455
But I'm looking
through his personnel file,

525
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,523
and he gets in trouble
for stupid stuff...

526
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,758
Pranks, nothing serious.

527
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:34,094
Where'd you get his G.D. File?

528
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:38,230
You're looking at the head
of G.D. Security.

529
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:41,502
But you know I want us to keep
working together like normal.

530
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:43,874
You're head of security
for this whole place?

531
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,275
Yeah.

532
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:49,079
Congratulations.
[both chuckle]

533
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,615
I'm so proud of you.

534
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,551
Thank you very much.
[cell phone rings]

535
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,552
Hold on.

536
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,520
Uh, Carter.

537
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,790
Yeah.

538
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,027
Ah, great.

539
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,161
Sorry, boss.

540
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,464
He kind of insisted that I call.

541
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:07,200
That device sends
and receives calls anywhere.

542
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:08,735
What do you want?

543
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:10,771
It's possible that I did...

544
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,442
Maneuver events so that I'd
end up traveling in time,

545
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,410
to this time.

546
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:16,645
So you're confessing?

547
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:17,947
You knew the marker
was in my pocket...

548
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,415
Please, you have to understand,

549
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:22,182
I've been chasing the future
my entire life.

550
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,214
When the opportunity
presented itself, I...

551
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,314
I simply couldn't resist.

552
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,645
And leaving me back there?

553
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:29,678
Well, sometimes
journeys of discovery

554
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,147
require a sacrifice.

555
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:32,548
Oh, sure, you were
discovering my sacrifice.

556
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:35,384
I'm trying
to make things square.

557
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,385
I'd rather not waste any
more time sitting in here,

558
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:38,787
so if you wouldn't
mind just, uh...

559
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,489
Oh, grow up. Tried to leave
me in another century?

560
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:43,690
You're not
getting out of here.

561
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:44,891
Hey, I thought we were square.

562
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,260
Ah, we're square.

563
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:51,429
Hey, sweetheart.

564
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,030
Grace.

565
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,565
You're here working.

566
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,733
Uh, no. I'm procrastinating.

567
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,902
I was just thinking
about coffee.

568
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,603
Great minds.

569
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:02,104
I don't want to bug you,

570
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:05,440
but I wanted to remind you
about Stan and Jill tonight.

571
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,541
Oh, Henry, look,

572
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,112
we've already cancelled
dinner on them twice.

573
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,648
I'm with a project.

574
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:12,816
A 60-year-old gadget
that doesn't work

575
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:14,884
means you can't take
a dinner break.

576
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:18,488
I'm trying to see if this
cell has any trace charge.

577
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,757
Okay, I get it.
You're working.

578
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:22,392
I'll bother you later.

579
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,029
And, um, FYIi,

580
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:28,332
the charge in those
cells is building.

581
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,167
No, the phosphor is clear.

582
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:34,606
Check the electron drift speed.

583
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:36,174
[Sighs]

584
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,176
Okay, you're right.

585
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:38,344
I didn't take into account

586
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,845
the 60-year-old
conductive materials.

587
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:42,682
Hmm.

588
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,384
What, did you think
you married a dummy?

589
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:46,887
I guess not.

590
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,789
Carry on!

591
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:54,863
Hey, Vince!

592
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,431
Oh, you have no idea
how good it is to see you.

593
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,667
Uh, likewise.

594
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:59,135
Yeah, has Zane been in today?

595
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,671
Uh, no, but he should be
picking up his lunch order

596
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,172
any time now.

597
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,974
Okay.
Um, uh, one more thing.

598
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,277
Do you know if I've asked Tess

599
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:12,545
any big, life-changing
questions recently?

600
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:16,844
Oh... my God!

601
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,512
You proposed?

602
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,578
I did?

603
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:20,545
I don't know.
Did you?

604
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,146
I don't know.
Did I?

605
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,748
Oh, Carter!

606
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,483
What? Hey.
Um, one sec.

607
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:27,252
Look, let's just...Uh,
I'll get back to you on this.

608
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,820
Can we keep this quiet?

609
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:30,822
I'm the vault.

610
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,260
Hi.

611
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,261
Hey.

612
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:38,496
So Kevin and I

613
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,064
were just talking about his school

614
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:43,167
and other friends and girlfriends.

615
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,901
You don't say.

616
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,003
[Laughs]
We don't have any secrets.

617
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,704
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

618
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,005
Baby, do you want
another shake?

619
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:53,943
I'm good.
Thank you.

620
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,745
Dude, she has lost her mind.

621
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,112
I know.

622
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,747
She won't stop touching
me, asking me stuff.

623
00:23:58,815 --> 00:23:59,747
She keeps feeding me.

624
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:00,981
I know. I know.

625
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,215
It's hard watching
your kid grow up.

626
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:06,983
Seriously, I...
I think she's on drugs.

627
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:10,817
Well, she's probably
not on drugs.

628
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,353
But, look...

629
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,121
Shoot.
I got to go.

630
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:18,324
Um, look, you got
to hang in there, okay?

631
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,325
Have some patience,
and we'll talk about it soon.

632
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,927
Okay?

633
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,430
Zane! We need to talk.

634
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,733
So you're thinking that Zane

635
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,801
rewired the robot's systems?

636
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:34,570
He has the requisite skills
and a shady history.

637
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,539
Yeah, but it just doesn't
seem like Zane, though.

638
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,374
I mean, I always thought
that people, at their core,

639
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,908
that they are who they are.

640
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:42,077
Well, you'll get a perfect
chance to test that theory

641
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:43,078
right here in the new world.

642
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,112
Ah, I guess.

643
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,379
That would bear out

644
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:46,981
the Novikov
self-consistency principle.

645
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:48,215
Yeah, think of time as a pond.

646
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,516
When we went back,
we made ripples.

647
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,716
Those ripples made changes.

648
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:52,384
But the farther away
from us you get,

649
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:53,718
the ripples fade.

650
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:58,388
99.99% of the wider world
is the way we left it.

651
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,756
Yeah, but we're gonna use
the machine or the device

652
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:01,790
to fix that, right?

653
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:02,924
Yes. Yes.

654
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,659
The batteries
seem to be recharging,

655
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,093
and I believe I'll be
able to reverse...

656
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,094
[Alarm blaring]

657
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:09,795
Our temporal impact.

658
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,674
That looks bad.

659
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:28,620
Dr. Fargo
was perfectly clear

660
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:31,156
that this entire area of
Section Five was off limits.

661
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:32,757
Yeah, use your
brave voice, Larry.

662
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,091
No one's breaking any rules.

663
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,993
Dr. Fargo will not accept it.

664
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,061
All right. Well.

665
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,430
I gave them permission to
use this lab for the project.

666
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,765
Thank you, Fargo.

667
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,534
Of course, sir.
My mistake.

668
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:45,969
Your conference call

669
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:47,804
with the Secretary of
Defense is in five minutes.

670
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,573
Sorry, Larry.

671
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,742
The Secretary of Defense.

672
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,243
How cool is this job?

673
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,778
Are you here for a reason?

674
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,680
Oh, yeah!
I got the scans back on Tiny.

675
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,716
You got to see this.
It's hilarious.

676
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,851
Look at those gamma signatures.

677
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,754
It looks like there was
an overload of positrons.

678
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:05,589
I mean, like that's possible.

679
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:07,591
[Laughs]

680
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,126
[Laughs]

681
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,092
It's sort of
a physics joke, because...

682
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,060
I'll redo the scans.

683
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:16,827
Well, I'm glad he's happy,

684
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:19,562
because this may be our reality
for a very long time.

685
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,764
I mean, I might be able
to salvage some parts, but...

686
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,232
All right, is there any way to tell

687
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,834
if somebody did this on purpose?

688
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:27,035
Sabotage.

689
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,604
Um, can't rule it out,

690
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,106
though I'm not an expert
on the technology from this era.

691
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,708
But you know who is.

692
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,208
Oh.

693
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,577
Dear Lord.

694
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:43,313
Not too shabby, huh?

695
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,313
I don't know if you know,

696
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:45,715
but I started this project

697
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:47,917
with a handful of scientists
out of some army tents.

698
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:51,821
My lab table
was an old munitions crate.

699
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,223
Did you ever think
it would turn into this?

700
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,093
Well, I was always
a fella that could dream big,

701
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:58,394
but no.

702
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:01,363
No, not in my
wildest imagination.

703
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:03,298
I wouldn't light that.

704
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:06,332
Global Dynamics
is a non-smoking facility.

705
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,731
Please extinguish
your smoking material.

706
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,265
What is it?

707
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:14,234
Some... Some kind of mobile
patrol system?

708
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:17,404
Please extinguish
your smoking material promptly.

709
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,239
You might want
to listen to her.

710
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:23,408
She? Really?

711
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,743
What kind of propulsion system
does she...

712
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,378
Never mind.
Wait a minute.

713
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:32,049
Uh, pardon me.
Ma'am.

714
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,318
What kind of
propulsion system do you use?

715
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:43,559
Have a pleasant day.

716
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:45,760
I think I'm in love
with this place.

717
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,136
Hey, Allison.

718
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:56,503
Hey.
So, uh, Tess is fine.

719
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:57,704
Oh, good.

720
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:58,872
She'll probably sleep
for a few hours,

721
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,006
but her tests are good.

722
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:01,441
Good. Good.
I figured.

723
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,376
Look, uh, something happened
to the bridge device,

724
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:04,843
and it looks intentional.

725
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:06,245
Yeah, I heard.

726
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:13,617
So if you're gonna ask, ask.

727
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:15,286
Do you know
anything about it?

728
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:16,687
You mean did I destroy it?

729
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:17,654
Did you?

730
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,460
Have you talked to Zoe?

731
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,161
Yeah, she's great.

732
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:27,362
Loving Harvard.
Why?

733
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,064
Think about
what it would be like

734
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,365
if you could never
talk to her.

735
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,200
- Yeah, Allison, I get it.
- No, you don't.

736
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,301
What if you could never know
your own daughter?

737
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,703
Never connect to the world
the way she sees it?

738
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:40,973
Then I would do whatever
it takes to get her back.

739
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:46,812
Fargo said that he saw you
going down to Section Five

740
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:48,813
right before the device
was destroyed.

741
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:49,981
Yeah, I went down there.

742
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,282
I don't know exactly
what it was

743
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,650
I thought I was going to do.

744
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:55,519
I was denied entry.

745
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:56,820
The medical director

746
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:58,521
doesn't have clearance
for Section Five,

747
00:28:58,589 --> 00:28:59,522
so I went back.

748
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,923
I didn't do it, Carter.

749
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,893
But, honestly,
I think that I would have.

750
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,036
Hi, gentlemen.
Any progress?

751
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:16,005
Hey, Carter.
You seen this?

752
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,140
Uh, what?

753
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,609
Excites radiation into a beam

754
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:20,912
that can cut
through carbon steel.

755
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,647
I don't suppose
you've heard of a laser.

756
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,616
Uh, yeah, I think I have one
in my printer, actually.

757
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:25,883
So was it sabotage?

758
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,318
There doesn't seem to be

759
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,653
any evidence
of tampering, sheriff.

760
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:31,188
You sure?

761
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:34,024
It seems like a stream
of antimatter positrons

762
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:36,760
may have overloaded
the power system.

763
00:29:36,828 --> 00:29:38,095
Well, now Fargo said

764
00:29:38,163 --> 00:29:39,596
that's the same thing
happened to Tiny.

765
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:42,198
So Zane is, what, firing
these things around for yuks?

766
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,233
Creating antimatter positrons

767
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,501
is incredibly difficult,

768
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:47,202
so if Zane has found a shortcut,

769
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,071
he wouldn't be playing jokes.

770
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:51,506
He would be getting
a Nobel Prize.

771
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:53,307
I don't believe Zane
is responsible, sheriff.

772
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,341
I think you were right.

773
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:55,909
Great.

774
00:29:55,977 --> 00:30:01,481
So that leaves me
exactly nowhere.

775
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,382
Might as well start looking
for a giant red elf.

776
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,885
Excuse me?

777
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,920
No, it's, uh, a joke.

778
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:09,589
Something Tess said
when she was hurt.

779
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:13,296
She was talking about a...
A red elf.

780
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:15,700
Oh, come on.

781
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:17,369
"Elf" is short
for emission of light

782
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:19,005
in very low-frequency
perturbations.

783
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,040
I did not know that.

784
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,241
It's a kind of lightning

785
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,576
that occurs
in the upper atmosphere,

786
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:24,411
along with sprites
and blue jets.

787
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,246
Didn't you study weather
in science class?

788
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,981
Well, I remember
cumulous clouds, and...

789
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,216
No, but this sounds
like positronic lightning.

790
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:31,785
That sounds bad.

791
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,254
Yeah. It's probably
what overloaded

792
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:34,958
Tiny and the bridge device.

793
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,427
It's five times hotter
than the Sun,

794
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,396
but luckily, it's incredibly rare.

795
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,731
- Oh, except today.
- Right.

796
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,466
Plus there's no way
I'll be able to predict

797
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,967
where it's gonna strike next.

798
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:46,368
[Thunder rumbles,
electricity crackles]

799
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:49,569
- Found it.
- Uh-huh.

800
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,069
Ah.

801
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,870
Look at that.

802
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:57,174
That there, now that is a red elf.

803
00:30:57,242 --> 00:30:59,042
This... this is insane.

804
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,210
Um, everybody,
can I have your attention?

805
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,679
Need you to go back
to your labs, please.

806
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:03,814
Not a drill. Not a test.

807
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,116
Off the floor, please.

808
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:06,651
Ma'am, sir,
thank you guys very much.

809
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,719
All the way off.

810
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:08,956
Yeah, you guys go.
You got to go.

811
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:10,492
Back to your labs.
Off the floor.

812
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,463
Thank you.
Go!

813
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,235
Nice elf.

814
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:37,864
Nasty weather we're having.
Inside.

815
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:39,666
It's a positronic lightning storm.

816
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,167
Any idea when it's gonna end?

817
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,603
No, since this is the
first one that's ever existed.

818
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,371
There's strikes
all over the building.

819
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,406
Andy's moving employees
into shielded areas.

820
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:48,842
All right, well,
even if you move fast,

821
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,310
you're gonna get some injuries.

822
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:51,879
I'll call in a medical team
and brief Allison.

823
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:53,148
Okay.

824
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,119
The directory
doesn't show any projects

825
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:57,388
that could be generating
this much positronic energy.

826
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:58,889
All right, how about hobbies?

827
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:00,958
Uh, maybe somebody messing
around with test tubes, beakers?

828
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:03,230
Beakers? Beakers?

829
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,931
Jack, positronic lightning

830
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:07,138
would be a gigantic project

831
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:09,207
that would require
constant adjustment

832
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,777
just to keep it
from going out of control.

833
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:12,214
But it would be the first steps

834
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,051
toward a source
of terrestrial antimatter.

835
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,688
Uh, limitless, clean energy.

836
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,890
Or antimatter weapons.

837
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,190
That sounds like something

838
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:25,494
that someone might
want to keep secret.

839
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:27,695
A white list project.

840
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:29,330
Oh, great, there's a name for that.

841
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,769
A darpa project so
potentially destabilizing

842
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:36,105
that it operates
with no official record.

843
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:37,807
Yeah, but it would still
need the permission

844
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:38,874
of the Director's office.

845
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:39,975
This is the Director's office.

846
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,210
If you gave permission

847
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:42,578
before you traversed
that wormhole,

848
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:43,779
you would have no memory of it,

849
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,281
and there would be no record.

850
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:46,782
Oh, that is trippy.

851
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,217
Fargo, if you did this...

852
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:49,585
I didn't.

853
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,954
<i>Not you you,
but successful you.</i>

854
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:55,258
Where would you put it?

855
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:57,993
I've been very successful
in my career.

856
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,795
Section Five.

857
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,396
But there are hundreds
of labs down there.

858
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,365
Where would you look?

859
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:06,301
Right where Larry told us not to.

860
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,105
Uh...

861
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:12,843
Welcome, Dr. Fargo.

862
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,045
DNA scan complete.

863
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:18,182
Iris recognition scan complete.

864
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:20,484
Voice recognition incomplete.

865
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,420
Please state your password.

866
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,623
I don't know.

867
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:28,359
Guess.

868
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:30,461
Dougie the vampire slayer.

869
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:32,396
Voice recognition complete.

870
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:35,566
Honestly?

871
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:45,207
I made positronic lightning, baby!

872
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,477
Not too close. 6 million volts.

873
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:51,280
You got to be kidding.

874
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:53,282
We have to find a way
into that lab.

875
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,885
Tell me you didn't.

876
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,219
Did you get my mini muffins?

877
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,220
You built a positronic array
in my section,

878
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,454
and you made it white list.

879
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,454
You hid it from me?

880
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:02,688
He had reasons.

881
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:04,887
Oh, oh, because he's a paranoid,

882
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:06,219
secretive dictator.

883
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,787
That is the reason.

884
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:10,421
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

885
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:16,660
Uh, I...I've never heard
you apologize before.

886
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,662
To anyone.

887
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,030
I'm turning over a new leaf?

888
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,031
Please stop yelling at me.

889
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,332
Aah!

890
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,699
Containment is failing.

891
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:26,666
You think?

892
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,267
We have to work fast

893
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,135
unless you want the skeleton
of this building to vaporize.

894
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:31,670
I vote work fast.

895
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:34,339
We could purge it
into the bedrock.

896
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:36,174
We could use a particle drill
to sink the ground wire,

897
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,942
but we still have
to tap the dump coil.

898
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,776
- I'll go.
- You'll be vaporized.

899
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,812
Then I take it back.

900
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,214
We can't shut it off
without going into the lab,

901
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,249
and we can't go into the lab
without shutting it off.

902
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,250
Can we do it, um,
like, with a kite and a key,

903
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,254
like Ben Franklin style?
Sort of...

904
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,722
No, exactly.

905
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,324
If we can get the charge
to go to one area of the lab...

906
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,825
I'm very attractive.

907
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,793
I mean, positronically speaking.

908
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,994
I'll be the lightning rod.

909
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,596
But could you
take the pounding?

910
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:04,230
It'll be a couple billion amps.

911
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:05,965
Well, dress me up
in some Compton shielding

912
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:07,600
to protect me and draw
the lightning, I'll be fine.

913
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:11,168
I think I got just the girl
who can lend you that dress.

914
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,703
Move, guys.

915
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:15,405
We need the shield to be
980 statcoulombs thick.

916
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:16,640
Hey.

917
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,644
Hey.

918
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:21,045
Got a Sec Five pass
from Fargo.

919
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,647
See if you guys
needed any help.

920
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:24,048
Uh, no,
Andy's almost ready,

921
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:25,616
and Tess is sacrificing a project

922
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,084
she's been working on for a year.

923
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,084
And she does it with a smile.

924
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,119
She's pretty amazing.

925
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,788
Must be why you asked
her to move in with you.

926
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,394
That's what she
was saying yes to.

927
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:39,929
[Stammers]
She told me.

928
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:41,898
She was still kind of loopy
from the electric shock.

929
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,967
We're moving in together?

930
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:50,907
I spent a year realizing
we don't work as a couple,

931
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:53,409
we break up,

932
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:57,946
she spends a year
thinking it's great.

933
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:01,749
It's just...

934
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:04,385
I guess that's up to you, Carter.

935
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:13,630
Andy moves along
the east pylons,

936
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:15,198
attracting the strikes.

937
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:16,399
You don't have much
of a window.

938
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,833
- Okay.
- 74 seconds.

939
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,836
74 seconds?

940
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:21,671
So move your ass, honey.

941
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,507
Then across the lab,

942
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:25,274
directly under the capacitor sphere.

943
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:26,607
Uh, the silver thing?

944
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:28,709
Exactly. Then directly
behind the sphere

945
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,110
is the dump coil.

946
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:31,545
Oh, how do I get the...

947
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:33,347
Every time you say dump coil,
it sounds so gross.

948
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:36,651
Right.
How do I get to the dump coil?

949
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,186
Oh, you got to be kidding.

950
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:40,723
Any chemical propellant
would explode.

951
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,224
Shoot the bolt into the coil,

952
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,760
use the drill
to drop the titanium wire.

953
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,328
- That should purge the charge.
- Okay.

954
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:49,064
Sheriff!

955
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:50,066
What are you doing here?

956
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,434
He volunteered.

957
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,035
I'm the drill guy.

958
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:55,338
He's the drill guy?

959
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,440
This isn't your problem.

960
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,142
Sure it is.

961
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:01,044
I've been part of this town
for 60 years.

962
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,379
I can't to pretend to understand
what goes on around here,

963
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:04,679
but electricity doesn't change.

964
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:08,617
I can handle the drill.

965
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,785
No, I...

966
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,554
Okay.

967
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,689
Hey, sheriff,
we should get moving.

968
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:30,238
Yippee ki-yay.

969
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:38,012
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

970
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,181
Go.

971
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:46,620
Oh! Thought these suits
were supposed to protect us.

972
00:37:46,688 --> 00:37:48,389
From the charge, not the pain.

973
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:57,698
There's the dump coil.

974
00:37:57,765 --> 00:38:00,133
You got 30 seconds, Jack.
30 seconds.

975
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,910
I'll drop the ground coil!

976
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:18,250
We should hit bedrock
in about 200 meters.

977
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:19,886
About 20 seconds.

978
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:22,922
Any time now.

979
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,258
You've only got 15 seconds.

980
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:29,561
[Groans]
This wire's awful thin.

981
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:32,832
Titanium alloy.
Strong as it gets.

982
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,000
You're almost out of time, Jack.

983
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,034
Hurry.

984
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:37,036
Bedrock!

985
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:53,650
Good job, deputy.

986
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:56,152
Ah.

987
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:03,359
Hey.

988
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:04,594
You okay there, Tex?

989
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:06,162
Oh, yeah.

990
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,497
I mean, don't believe 'em

991
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:08,865
when they tell you
that lightning

992
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:10,333
doesn't strike twice
in the same place.

993
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:13,836
But, uh, how's Andy?

994
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:16,339
Oh, he'll survive.

995
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:19,508
Fargo said that he needs a
complete memory wipe and reload.

996
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:21,043
Oh, that's okay.

997
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,312
I mean, he enjoyed the time
travel story the first time,

998
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:27,282
so he'll forget,
I'll tell him again, it'll...

999
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,753
What are you doing
here all alone?

1000
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,755
It's where Zane proposed.

1001
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:35,690
And I didn't answer.

1002
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:40,062
Ah.

1003
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,566
Well, everybody freezes

1004
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,568
the first time in combat.

1005
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:48,272
Well, almost everybody.

1006
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,973
You got scared.

1007
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,677
Doesn't change
how you feel about the guy.

1008
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:55,112
You just got scared.

1009
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,981
I just wish that I said something.

1010
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:00,017
You know, I know that
it wouldn't make a difference,

1011
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,518
and I know that he
wouldn't remember now,

1012
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:03,420
but, you know, at least

1013
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:06,356
it would be out there
in the universe, somewhere.

1014
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,827
You know, I love the guy.

1015
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:14,629
And he loved me.

1016
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:17,599
Once.

1017
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:28,879
Hey.

1018
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:29,913
Hey.

1019
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:31,481
How's my hero?

1020
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:33,416
Slightly singed, but I'm okay.

1021
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:34,884
Hmm. Um, listen,

1022
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:36,718
we need to talk scheduling
with the movers,

1023
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,586
but I'm whipped.

1024
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:40,621
Electroshock can be exhausting.

1025
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,790
Can we talk about it tomorrow?

1026
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,358
Uh, that would be better.

1027
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:45,826
Okay, good.

1028
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:46,994
Hey, I'm going to Dre's.

1029
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,296
We might go see a movie
or something.

1030
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,830
Well, what about dinner?

1031
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,466
This is dinner.
I'll see you later. Love you.

1032
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,002
Hey, loser.

1033
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,071
Loser.

1034
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:02,042
That, uh, that means cool,
right? Hmm.

1035
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,445
You okay?

1036
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,047
Yeah.

1037
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:07,215
Actually, I'm more than okay.

1038
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:10,084
I'm not sure exactly why.

1039
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:11,552
I don't know.
But it's still difficult.

1040
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,954
You better get used to it.

1041
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:15,490
He sounds like he's
a pretty independent kid.

1042
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,459
Think I'm gonna need help
with this teenager thing.

1043
00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:19,428
I will help you.

1044
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:26,069
So, um, the device is dead.

1045
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:30,073
And the energy field
is decayed beyond repair.

1046
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:40,583
So this is home, then?

1047
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:43,085
For all of us.

1048
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:46,188
Well, what do you know?

1049
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:48,089
So how do we tell everyone
what happened to us?

1050
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,457
All at once.

1051
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:52,227
Pull it off fast,
you know, just like a hangnail.

1052
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:54,395
If people find out
there's an alternate timeline,

1053
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:56,631
it could be destabilizing
and dangerous.

1054
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:58,132
This is dangerous,

1055
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,133
having us walk around
like we know what we're doing.

1056
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,634
Yeah,
but how would people react?

1057
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:04,204
I mean, if Henry tells his wife
he doesn't remember her...

1058
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,405
I'm not saying
it's gonna be fun.

1059
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:08,742
We need to be honest.

1060
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,111
Would I still keep my job?

1061
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,514
Listen, we can't tell anyone.

1062
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,482
There's a military protocol in place

1063
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,683
for a situation like this.

1064
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:17,951
You're kidding me.

1065
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:19,185
No, there's a military protocol

1066
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:20,586
in place for everything.

1067
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:23,156
Anyone who has seen the
future or affected history

1068
00:42:23,223 --> 00:42:24,457
is inherently dangerous.

1069
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,760
They can further
contaminate the timeline.

1070
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:29,896
Violators will be isolated
and sanctioned.

1071
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,365
Um, sanctioned, like, dead?

1072
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,436
No, sanctioned
like we each get a puppy.

1073
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:40,337
We can't tell anyone
what happened.

1074
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:43,506
It has to stay
with the six of us.

1075
00:42:43,572 --> 00:42:45,570
Agreed?

1076
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:51,944
Agreed.

1077
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,987
Welcome to the new world.
