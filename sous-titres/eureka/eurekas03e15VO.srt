1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:02,070
Previously on <i>Eureka</i>...

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:04,873
It's Kim.

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,083
More knowledge than
what mankind has learned

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,718
since the beginning of
time is locked inside Kim.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,887
I became the primary machine.

6
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:16,390
There's still an incredible amount
of information locked inside of you,

7
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:19,819
and we have to figure a way
of getting it out safely.

8
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,881
That was fast.

9
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,232
Good hair.

10
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:31,900
It always looks good.
But it looks gooder. Better.

11
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:34,417
Well, curling iron...
greatest invention of the 20th century.

12
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:39,434
- So you're missing something?
- More like someone.

13
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:45,544
Just saw her at Café Diem with Henry.
Case closed.

14
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:49,106
Kim is technically property of GD,
and we haven't downloaded her yet.

15
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,294
If she were a laptop, Henry could be
arrested for taking her out of here.

16
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,610
He should know better.

17
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,823
People take things
out of here all the time

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,823
and it might help
with the downloading process.

19
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,797
Actually, we've got
bigger help coming in...

20
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:02,047
A neural networking specialist
from Bethesda.

21
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,439
I just thought Henry would
take it better coming from you.

22
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,357
Fair enough. I mean, Henry had
a rough time when Kim died, so.

23
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,549
Yeah, that sucks.
Allison told me.

24
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,864
Finding the person that makes you happy
but not getting the ever-after.

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,985
I had fun the other night,
the whole meteor thing.

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,077
Yeah, me, too.

27
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,248
You know, we should get some...

28
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,537
Tess the mess?

29
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:25,126
Is it you?

30
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,303
- All me.
- Impossible.

31
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:30,615
Where's the baggy sweatshirt?
Those red glasses?

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,315
- Oh, God.
- The crazy hair?

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,986
The curling iron...
greatest invention of the 20th century.

34
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,925
Sheriff Jack Carter,
this the neural networking specialist

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,558
I was just telling you about...
Dr. Bruce Manly.

36
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,019
- Us. Dr. Bruce Manlius.
- Us.

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,439
- He's here to help with...
- Help us, yes. I heard.

38
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,316
I didn't hear about you guys
all knowing each other, though.

39
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:52,818
Yeah, I've known
these two lovely ladies

40
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,178
since I was their TA in grad school.

41
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:57,241
Yes, when we were more
awkward than lovely.

42
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,870
- We should do dinner.
- I'm in bed by 7:00 nowadays.

43
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,497
- Well, then, the two of us.
- Okay.

44
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:08,121
Yeah, it'll be a celebration
of downloading the organic computer.

45
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,617
- Which, by the way, where is that?
- With Henry at Café Diem.

46
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:15,479
- I'll be back... Manly.
- Us. Dr. Manlius.

47
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,144
Bacon.
Salty, right?

48
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,323
Right.

49
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,523
How about this?

50
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,778
Apple pie.
Sweet.

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,025
But I like cherry better.

52
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,931
Next time you want
to impress a girl, don't, okay?

53
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:42,830
What?

54
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,071
You told Tess to do
the baby shower at our house,

55
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:48,277
and now I'm stuck planning it
with the harpies because she's too busy.

56
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,472
The harpies?

57
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,429
Monroe, Draper, and Bell.

58
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,905
- Infant development of GD.
- Infantile is more like it.

59
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,825
They all wanna impress the boss
and they are driving Zoe crazy.

60
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,694
- Can you sit down, please?
- I am working.

61
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,891
- You missed yesterday's meeting.
- I had school.

62
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,560
If you're not gonna take
planning this shower seriously...

63
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,504
Look, I can't come to the GD gym

64
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,814
just because you guys
are multitasking maniacs.

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,567
And no, that wasn't a compliment.

66
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:17,870
Well, this looks like a lot.

67
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,074
Well, Kim's sense of smell
is developing.

68
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:21,826
But eating isn't on my menu.

69
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,994
And a sense of humor.

70
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,789
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

71
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,708
We've broken protocol.
You should take me back.

72
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,463
You're right.

73
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,992
You have to take her back.

74
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,638
This is genius.

75
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,774
A self-replicating mainframe

76
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,632
with who knows
how much storage in each cell.

77
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:50,347
It has follicles and pores,

78
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,189
a denser mass in the skeletal frame.

79
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,000
Even its flesh has
a reasonable degree of elasticity.

80
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,628
- Her flesh, and she can hear you.
- Dr. Manlius is doing his job.

81
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,621
I meant no offense.

82
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,187
But this...

83
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:07,145
This is a remarkable piece of technology
you've created, Dr. Deacon.

84
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,331
Kim Yamazaki
and I were the designers.

85
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,762
Well, let's see what it can tell us.

86
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,987
I need to test
the data extraction process

87
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,547
- before we proceed to the download.
- What are you doing?

88
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,441
What did you think I would do?

89
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,672
Everything's clear.
You can test anytime.

90
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,984
Your laser is connected
to the GD hydroelectric cooling system.

91
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:39,611
Radiation.

92
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:43,396
Bruce's technology can momentarily
alter the shape

93
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,160
of an organic computing cell,
so an electrical impulse

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,871
can duplicate the data
locked within its structure.

95
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:52,733
If this works, we'll be able to copy Kim
without damaging the original.

96
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:53,791
Kim stays safe.

97
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:56,335
Dr. Fontana, would you assist?

98
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,477
I'm sorry, I should have
phrased that differently.

99
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,039
Activating shield.

100
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:11,078
Well, it must be a little strange
calling your former student "Doctor".

101
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:13,206
I meant asking you to assist.

102
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,887
Activating laser.

103
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:18,519
You are my boss here...

104
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,273
and I respect that.

105
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:22,707
Thanks.

106
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,156
Activating current.

107
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,391
Irradiating it's hair
should show us our chances

108
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,366
of unlocking the rest of the data.

109
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,214
My God.

110
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,884
And that's just a lock of hair.

111
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,479
Imagine what's inside that thing.

112
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,018
Nice wrapping job, Jo.

113
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,668
Shocking, I know.

114
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,261
"Stain-free co-polymer."

115
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,653
Okay, I guess she'll wear this
when auntie Jo babysits.

116
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,154
- What are you doing?
- Well, my bib isn't high-tech, so...

117
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,887
And you could have told me
it was just all women.

118
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,210
Well, I figured
you'd watch baseball.

119
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,087
I'm the birthing coach.
I take my responsibility seriously.

120
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,196
"Self-adjusting size
to three years old."

121
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,224
Me next.

122
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,686
This is the future of baby monitors.

123
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,897
It actually lets you feel
what your baby is feeling

124
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,524
through biorhythmic sync.

125
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,840
Three for three.

126
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,962
Birthing partner.
Come here.

127
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,649
So when she's hungry,
you'll be hungry, too.

128
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,340
Tired, tummy ache...
You name it, you'll know it.

129
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:56,854
Now, if you'll hold this
over your heart.

130
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,838
Hold this over her belly.

131
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,039
Now we sync up your biorhythms.

132
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:07,843
That's a strong, healthy heart.

133
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,150
Mommy and baby are connected.

134
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,348
This will revolutionize child care.

135
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,142
Not as much as these.

136
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:21,190
Monitors are cute,
but they don't help with messes.

137
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,180
One Draper diape

138
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,203
can hold up to five times
its volume in water.

139
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,609
- Now, that's revolutionary.
- But not as planet-friendly

140
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,386
as these... self-sanitizing bottles.

141
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,585
It's an incredible new
plastic technology

142
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,266
that actually bonds to the liquid
and releases 100% of it.

143
00:07:56,973 --> 00:08:00,260
Saves on plastic, water waste...
It's truly the perfect baby gift.

144
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,231
And I made mimosas.

145
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,521
Wait, one more gift.
We got...

146
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,000
We got you...

147
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,409
a basket that you can take
all your gifts home in.

148
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,959
Which, you know...

149
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:16,827
Thank you, Carter.

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,873
So who wants to play
the bottle-drinking game?

151
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:25,574
All right.

152
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:39,351
<i>Good morning, mimosa king.
You're late for work.</i>

153
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,520
Yeah, I'm on my way,
and not so loud.

154
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:44,439
You didn't have to win the game.

155
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,185
My manhood was at stake.

156
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,819
But you know what?
I absolutely crushed 'em.

157
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,979
All right, careful on the road.
That was some storm last night.

158
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:55,855
Looks that way.

159
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,812
I'll call you back.
I've got a vehicle off the road.

160
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,132
Ma'am?

161
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,603
Oh, my God.

162
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:35,866
Projet-SG (1.00)

163
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,286
Dr. Monroe, the baby monitor lady?

164
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,006
How could this happen?

165
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,979
She could have gone off the road on
the way back from the baby shower.

166
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,418
What's that smell?

167
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,086
But how did she drown in a car?

168
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,672
Leaky sunroof.
It was raining pretty hard.

169
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,926
Where is Henry?
What is that smell?

170
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,845
Henry is staying with Kim.
I'll be doing the autopsy.

171
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,097
You?

172
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,725
Henry says I've assisted
him enough to fly solo.

173
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,311
I wouldn't fly in a plane with you.

174
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,981
It could be as simple
as a heart attack.

175
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Or not. Someone
could have done this to her.

176
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,292
There are easier ways to kill
than drowning someone in a car.

177
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,876
- And did she even have any enemies?
- Plenty of people at GD

178
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,613
wouldn't have minded
that particular baby researcher gone.

179
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:22,496
Next year's grants have been cut.
Fewer jobs. People get desperate.

180
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,123
I'm gonna need a list of the people
that could get downsized.

181
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:28,126
Sheriff, open the car.

182
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,185
- Me?
- This might be a crime scene.

183
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,274
How would it look
if I compromised evidence

184
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,505
for my first gig
as medical examiner?

185
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,058
That's the smell.

186
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,018
Tuna, egg, and cream cheese burrito
with horseradish.

187
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,428
You want a bite?

188
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,023
No, I'm good.

189
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,373
Dr. Monroe?
That's... That's terrible.

190
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,115
I was just getting to know her
because of the baby shower.

191
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,990
Yeah, Fargo's
doing the autopsy right now.

192
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,503
It could have been an accident.

193
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,701
Or it could have been one
of the people on this grant list.

194
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,600
The car was perfectly sealed.
Someone had to fill it.

195
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,430
We've narrowed it down to four.
The rest have alibis.

196
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:25,307
So you think that GD scientists are
killing each other over grant research?

197
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:28,035
That's ridiculous.
No one on that list is capable of...

198
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,253
I know of two.

199
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:32,551
Draper and Bell, the type As
that I planned your party with.

200
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,495
They would eat their own young if
they thought it would impress you.

201
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,738
Please find out what happened,
before rumors start to spread.

202
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:39,993
Sure.

203
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,252
- Draper did it.
- See what I mean?

204
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:46,413
Fargo, please don't jump to conclusions.
These are people that we know.

205
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,242
All I know is Dr. Monroe's lungs
were like sponges.

206
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,168
Every cell was bursting with water.

207
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,962
Yeah, but isn't that what happens
when someone drowns?

208
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,241
Not unless there's
a super-absorbency technology involved.

209
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,299
Sound familiar?

210
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,303
Death by Draper diape.
I rest my case.

211
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:04,514
Well, Draper's research
does involve microfibers

212
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,850
that if inhaled or ingested
in major quantities

213
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,321
might cause this kind
of water retention.

214
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,396
Okay. I'll find Draper.
You want to talk to Bell?

215
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,810
And Fargo, if you could check
the body for any microfibers.

216
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,984
And no speculation
until we figure this thing out.

217
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,517
You guys have
the mimosas last night?

218
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,913
I learned that lesson at
an astronomy conference in Puerto Rico.

219
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:31,187
And by the way, there's an asteroid
event tomorrow night.

220
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,502
- Feel like stargazing again?
- Again?

221
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:35,312
I can't.

222
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,139
I have our first birthing class.
It's tomorrow.

223
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:44,123
- I didn't know you were that into it.
- I am. I am.

224
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,601
And tell Henry I'm gonna stop by later
after I figure out

225
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,269
how a woman could drown
in the middle of a highway.

226
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,803
A hell of a hangover.

227
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:54,814
Bye.

228
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,037
I am so confused.

229
00:12:58,563 --> 00:12:59,694
I thought he liked me.

230
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,034
Well, we went on this date,
and I thought we had a great time.

231
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,284
You went on a date.

232
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:09,534
No, an almost-date.
And... We... He...

233
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:11,956
God, I suck at this.

234
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,224
So do you like him?

235
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:15,962
Like like like?

236
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,756
I mean, I think I do.

237
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,254
Dad.

238
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,223
Is Dr. Monroe really dead?

239
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:30,350
I'm afraid so.

240
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,061
- Do you have any leads?
- Maybe.

241
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,442
Could you make me
one of those to go?

242
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,922
I'm just starving.

243
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,433
Sorry, sorry.

244
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,954
So, Dr. Draper.

245
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,366
You still working
on the Draper diape?

246
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,205
Every G8 country is trying to perfect
ultra-absorption technology.

247
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,706
I don't plan
on letting them beat me.

248
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,252
Just like you didn't want Monroe
to beat you to next year's grant?

249
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,049
Look.
I've known Monroe for years.

250
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,052
I'm very competitive.
I didn't kill her.

251
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,262
Now, if you'll excuse me...

252
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,195
The data extraction
worked on your hair.

253
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,137
Now we'll try the rest of you.

254
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,726
So do you think this is okay?

255
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,377
It's what we need to do.

256
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,779
I need to know
what you think, Henry.

257
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:26,703
You're the one I trust.

258
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,186
I think Manlius knows
what he's doing.

259
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,789
Activating cooling system.

260
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:39,231
Fargo's checking Draper's diapers.

261
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,777
You realize how strange that sounds.

262
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,652
Activating isolation shield.

263
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,390
That didn't come down before.

264
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,307
Higher radiation levels
require the lead shield.

265
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,997
No worries. We'll keep an eye on her
with the infrared scanner.

266
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,314
Activating laser.

267
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:06,655
- This looks wrong.
- And activating current.

268
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,659
She's saying something.

269
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:14,538
Well, we can't stop it mid-process.
We might damage the data.

270
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:16,665
- What about her?!
- She is the data.

271
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:18,792
It could cause more harm
if we don't finish.

272
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,127
More than that?
Stop the transfer!

273
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,088
He's right.
Shut it down!

274
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,513
I'm sorry.
It's not working.

275
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,283
It's all right.
Come on.

276
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,025
Your radiation levels were way too high.
They were hurting her.

277
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,718
We'll have to close early until I can
find out where this leak is coming from.

278
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,984
As soon as people are done,
you can leave.

279
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,584
Plumbing emergency.

280
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,875
If everyone could just finish up
and go home, that would be awesome.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,905
You don't need to eat that.
Go home.

282
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:25,394
Dr. Draper?

283
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:35,662
I think we found our leak.

284
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,526
My preliminary, albeit
well-trained forensic analysis,

285
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,675
leads me to
the obvious conclusion...

286
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:51,885
She drowned.

287
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,433
Dr. Monroe also drowned,
and they were both at the baby shower.

288
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,678
How could she drown
in the middle of a restaurant?

289
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:00,324
I get it how someone could

290
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,311
absorb water or drown
in a flooded car, but,

291
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,273
in a bathroom?

292
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:08,499
I mean, maybe it was out of the air.
It's been humid since the storm.

293
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:11,029
Doubtful...
Even with a high vapor pressure

294
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:14,730
you couldn't precipitate
that much liquid from the atmosphere.

295
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,618
So where did the water come from?

296
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,120
From them.

297
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,841
- Them who?
- Monroe and Draper...

298
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,918
Maybe they weren't absorbing water
but making it.

299
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,588
The body holds ten gallons of water.
That wouldn't fill up a car.

300
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,383
Draper was sweating,
a glass slipped right out of her hand.

301
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,678
Maybe she was making extra water...
Like overproducing it.

302
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:37,972
I'll need to see more evidence
to buy that theory.

303
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,414
Maybe I should test the water.

304
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,823
Please.

305
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,185
Look, I've been
all over the diagnostics,

306
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,086
and there was no malfunction
in the system.

307
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:00,488
Look again.

308
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,572
Kim reacted so violently

309
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,713
because her cellular
structure is changing.

310
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,022
That's understandable.
She's been exposed to new stimuli.

311
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,129
But new neural pathways
should form and...

312
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,534
Changing for the worse.

313
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,299
She's decaying, and we're
not exactly sure why.

314
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,223
But if we can't find another
way to access that data,

315
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,013
it could all be gone
in a matter of days... maybe hours.

316
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,802
And because she is the data...

317
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:25,740
She'll be gone.

318
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,776
Samples from Dr. Draper
and Dr. Monroe.

319
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,964
- Looks like water.
- Pure water.

320
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,533
Neutral Ph.
No bacteria, no contaminants.

321
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,412
- You know what that means.
- No, actually.

322
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,662
It's synthetic.

323
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,983
Dr. Rivers makes it in her lab.

324
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,356
Synthetic water?

325
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:50,046
Yeah, you should meet her.

326
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,677
I've been in synthetic water
research for ten years.

327
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,281
It's a spectacular achievement.

328
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,504
The proper rotation
of hydrogen atoms alone...

329
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:59,270
Regular water
is still fine, though, right?

330
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,143
Well, there's fine,
and then there's perfect.

331
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,872
We have two bodies,

332
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:07,582
and both of them are filled
with your synthetic water.

333
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:08,772
That's awful. How?

334
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,233
Well, we think that your water
made them drown from the inside out.

335
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,359
That's impossible.
My water is perfectly safe.

336
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,405
It's used throughout Eureka,
tracked, and recycled right back here.

337
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,611
You probably showered in it
this morning.

338
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,242
That's very reassuring.

339
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:22,707
Thank you.

340
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,458
You okay, Sheriff?

341
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,253
Forgive me... No, actually,
do you have a bathroom?

342
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,859
- Through the door to the left.
- Thank you.

343
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:38,865
<i>Sheriff, are you all right?</i>

344
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,616
<i>That's your third visit to the bathroom
since you've been home.</i>

345
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:45,679
You try working on
a case all about water.

346
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,580
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

347
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,741
<i>Your blood pressure
seems to be higher than usual.</i>

348
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:53,738
My pants are tight.

349
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:56,431
Have you been putting
my uniform in the dryer again?

350
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:59,366
<i>I use a dry-cleaning process
to avoid shrinking.</i>

351
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,489
<i>Perhaps you overindulged
the mini quiches</i>

352
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:02,870
<i>at the baby shower.</i>

353
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,745
Please. I had ten.

354
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,990
Speaking of which,
you finish the analysis?

355
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,234
<i>Yes. No traces of synthetic water</i>

356
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:13,320
<i>in any of the food or beverages
consumed at the party.</i>

357
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:17,257
How about the mimosas? I haven't had
a hangover like this in years.

358
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,525
<i>Would you like me
to run that analysis again?</i>

359
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:22,296
No, no, it's...
Yes! Wait!

360
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,946
How about Dr. Bell's
self-sanitizing bottle?

361
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:30,215
I mean, that's what the mimosas were in.
What'd she say about that?

362
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,390
<i>Incredible new plastic technology</i>

363
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:35,640
<i>bonds to any liquid
then releases 100% of it.</i>

364
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:39,065
Like maybe into the body,
the person who's drinking it?

365
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,315
Like me?

366
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:42,905
<i>Sheriff Carter?</i>

367
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,091
Tell me he's not here
to do another autopsy.

368
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,010
I have enough bodies
on my hands already.

369
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:08,105
I was sure I was
the next drowning victim.

370
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,936
You're just a little bloated.

371
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:15,940
You passed out from a combination of
high blood pressure and low blood sugar.

372
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,526
So I'm not drowning at all.

373
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,485
Nothing in your lungs.

374
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,145
But your condition is serious.

375
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,465
What condition is that?

376
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,140
Couvade syndrome.

377
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:30,545
I had Bruce examine you.

378
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,370
He's an expert
on neural pathway anomalies.

379
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,543
How serious is this?

380
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,335
You're pregnant.

381
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:43,915
Excuse me?

382
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,460
It's sympathy pregnancy.

383
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,198
Some men can develop symptoms
when they worry too much

384
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:50,973
about their pregnant...

385
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:52,936
their birthing partners.

386
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,535
So I'm feeling this because of you?

387
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:58,191
The mind is a very powerful force.

388
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:01,277
If you believe in something long enough,
the body can make it happen.

389
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,870
I don't understand. I was exposed
to the water that came out of Monroe,

390
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:08,201
and Zoe was exposed
to the water that came out of Draper.

391
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,412
We know that syn water
can't enter the body through contact.

392
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,625
It has to be absorbed
directly into the bloodstream.

393
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Well, here.

394
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,335
Yeah, I'll be right there.

395
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,176
Well, drink a Red Bull, Fargo.
We got another case.

396
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,090
Someone else from my shower?

397
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,310
No ID yet, but I want everyone who was
at that party tested for syn water.

398
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:33,101
Just because I'm fine doesn't mean
that everyone else will be.

399
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,570
I found her this morning
when I opened up.

400
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,880
She usually closes the place by herself
after she finishes cleaning.

401
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:42,440
- And she was here all day before that.
- Yeah, her shift starts at noon.

402
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,164
She takes care of the steam
and sauna during the day,

403
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,699
then sanitizes the whole area
after she's done.

404
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:53,940
Guess this kills our theory
that the baby shower was the cause.

405
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,115
Maybe this one was just clumsy.

406
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:59,160
Slipped, whacked her head,
and drowned in the tub.

407
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,635
- It's possible.
- I don't think so.

408
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,835
I mean, she's wearing rubber gloves,

409
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,676
and you don't fill the tub with water
to clean it, right?

410
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,886
It was empty when she started.

411
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:12,920
So this one turned into old faithful
like the others.

412
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:14,995
So it wasn't the baby shower.

413
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:18,030
But she must have something in common
with Monroe and Draper.

414
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,155
She does.

415
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:20,898
Syn water.

416
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,375
You remember Dr. Bell,
the baby bottle lady?

417
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,595
Was it syn water?

418
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:37,994
Good thing we started to test people
from the shower.

419
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,330
We caught Dr. Bell
before her lungs started to fill.

420
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:42,170
She would have had
5 minutes after that.

421
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,880
- She's the only one?
- So far.

422
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:47,341
We can arrest her drowning symptoms
by artificially respirating her

423
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,775
until we can figure out
what's causing this.

424
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:54,057
Didn't you say something about
syn water in the bloodstream?

425
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:58,019
Not absorbed through surface contact.
Has to enter the bloodstream directly.

426
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,022
- Is that what we're looking at?
- Potentially.

427
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:05,980
Kim's suffering from a degeneration
of the organic tissue.

428
00:24:06,105 --> 00:24:08,710
Because her original cell structure

429
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:10,935
had no Earth-centric immunities.

430
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,300
That was my call back then.

431
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:16,568
I thought it would free up more space
within the cell for data storage.

432
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,654
And you were right,
but that's why it's imperative

433
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,829
we access the data before it...

434
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:21,918
disappears.

435
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,711
Before she dies.

436
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,589
We submerge her in an acid solution,

437
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:28,644
break up
the individual nanobytes of data...

438
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:32,500
- You wanna dissolve her.
- Not easy to consider, I know, but...

439
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,348
There has to be another way.
Look, give me 24 hours.

440
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,642
Well, I can give you until midnight.

441
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,027
That's how long it'll take for us
to prepare the procedure.

442
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:41,152
Fine.

443
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,984
We've done more analysis of your water
and found something interesting.

444
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:51,000
The syn water we found in the victim's
body is perfectly harmless

445
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,116
until it's added directly to...

446
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,952
human plasma,

447
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,095
at which point...

448
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:01,595
Old faithful.

449
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,293
It must be something
within their specific plasma.

450
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:08,172
Sorry, that was a generic sample
from the infirmary.

451
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:11,998
There's bad syn water out there,
I've got a third victim on life support.

452
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,428
We'll have to shut down your lab
until we can test everything.

453
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,727
You said that the water
that comes in here is recycled,

454
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:19,250
so you must have
a filtration system or something?

455
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,053
- Best on or off the planet.
- Great, we'll get...

456
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,505
Off the planet?

457
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,317
Synthetic water is the only way
we'll ever be able to colonize space.

458
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,085
Natural water molecules
can't be compressed, but syn water...

459
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:36,284
One canister can start
an entire civilization.

460
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,655
It's perfectly harmless.

461
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:49,088
The isotope bonds that compress it
disappear once the molecule is reformed.

462
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:53,295
Well, I have three victims
and a fourth on life support,

463
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:55,690
so something is causing it.

464
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:57,346
You're a very caring man.

465
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,235
Well, we'll just call it
"sympathetic".

466
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,480
Carter, that water goes everywhere.

467
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,760
That's why Dr. Rivers is checking, maybe
she can find out where it's coming from.

468
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:09,202
She has the most advanced
tracking system on and...

469
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:10,860
Or off the planet. Yeah, I know.

470
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,730
Well, we need to figure this out
before someone else goes down.

471
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,205
Well, I'm trying.

472
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:19,355
- Is there something wrong?
- No, I'm...

473
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:23,887
I'm... I... My back hurts.
My ankles are sore.

474
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:26,511
It feels like my organs are up
on my lungs. I'm gonna...

475
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,860
I don't know how you do it.

476
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:30,535
Well, you just do it.

477
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,798
Come on. Henry wants us in there.

478
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:36,755
- Let's go for ice cream after.
- Two scoops.

479
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:39,275
So you can save me and my data?

480
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,900
Manlius came up
with the wrong solution?

481
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:45,228
Yeah, this is a nutrient bath
with antibiotics.

482
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,730
Will it filter the data
out of my cells?

483
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,048
And repair them at the same time.

484
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:52,285
Okay, we're all set.

485
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,225
So are we.

486
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:00,159
Now just try to keep still
and relax.

487
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,185
What is that?

488
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,665
It's a hydroelectric cooling system.

489
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:19,005
Puppy puts out a lot of heat.

490
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:21,095
Starting the download...

491
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,165
Now.

492
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:38,195
It's working.

493
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:54,006
Turn it off.

494
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:13,858
Look, I understand that
this is emotionally complicated,

495
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,776
and I mean no disrespect.

496
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:17,545
But Kim...

497
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:20,156
Kim is a sophisticated
storage device.

498
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,285
Her personality was a construct
of the computer and she was never human.

499
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:27,580
We're bringing her back,
but not for long. She is degrading.

500
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,905
Any hope we have of retrieving
what's left inside her

501
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,419
means that we have to act fast.

502
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:37,765
We need to sacrifice her
to save everything she has to tell us.

503
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:41,344
Could we just give them
a moment alone?

504
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:44,764
Thanks.

505
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:46,655
I'm sorry, Henry.

506
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:47,835
Thanks.

507
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,335
Yeah, thanks.

508
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:03,657
Welcome back.

509
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:08,810
Those cooling pipes. Could they
be filled with synthetic water?

510
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,190
Well, yeah. They are.

511
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,672
It's conductivity is vastly superior
to other coolants. Why?

512
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:15,878
Well, that chamber
was pumped full of radiation.

513
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:17,671
That's why we use the shield.

514
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:20,841
The cooling pipes are inside the shield.
Couldn't that affect the water?

515
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,440
I talked to Manlius.

516
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,280
Your water isn't the problem,
but your isotopes may be.

517
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,977
Could they be affected
when the water is exposed to radiation?

518
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:34,939
If the radiation level is high enough,
it might compress them again.

519
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:37,900
Like in your never-ending canister.

520
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,528
Exactly,
and if that's what's in their lungs...

521
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:43,906
Now Allison said also you had a tracking
system of some sort. Is that true?

522
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,930
I know everywhere my water goes.

523
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:49,520
It's a closed system that never comes
in contact with nature's water cycle.

524
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:52,998
Dr. Manlius' lab is right there.
That's where the radiation came from.

525
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,260
Now, where does the water go
after that?

526
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:56,735
I'll need a time.

527
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,547
First test was about noon yesterday.

528
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:04,240
There was only one flush
from his lab at 12:08,

529
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,665
- and it went to...
- Into the gym.

530
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,955
How did you know?

531
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,230
That's when the...
that attendant started her shift.

532
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:17,435
This is hard for you.

533
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:22,345
I shut myself down before because...

534
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,614
I didn't want to cause you any pain.

535
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:30,119
And Kim would not have
wanted that, either.

536
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,515
But you're not Kim.

537
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,541
I know that.

538
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:39,855
You do have her laugh.

539
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:43,095
And her mind.

540
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:45,965
And...

541
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:49,445
her spirit.

542
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,365
And she'll always be a part of you.

543
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,715
I'm just a copy, Henry.

544
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,435
And you have to let me go.

545
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:00,705
I have a mission.

546
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:03,265
We both do.

547
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,865
Then let's see this through.

548
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,554
Well, the hydroelectric pipes
lead right here,

549
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,213
so the question is who was
in the steam room yesterday at noon?

550
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,918
It was a group of very catty women.

551
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,625
Would that be Monroe,
Draper, and Bell?

552
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:24,507
Yeah, exactly right.

553
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,633
There's a chance they inhaled the steam
made from the irradiated syn water.

554
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:30,262
That's how it got into their bloodstream
and mixed with their plasma.

555
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:33,366
If they inhaled it all the way
to their lungs, then, yeah.

556
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,250
Hang on, it looks like there was
one other person in there with them.

557
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,525
A late arrival. Last name Fontana.

558
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,275
Tess?

559
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:49,215
Excuse me, excuse me.

560
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:53,370
<i>Section Five,
ocular identification required.</i>

561
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,662
Better make it fast.

562
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,560
<i>Invalid retinal scan.</i>

563
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,185
<i>Invalid retinal scan.</i>

564
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,250
<i>Security code breach.</i>

565
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,344
<i>Security lockdown engaged.</i>

566
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,260
- Where's Tess?
- Stuck in that elevator.

567
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:22,273
- Some kind of security problem.
- Did Fargo test her with the other one?

568
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,137
No, you ruled out that shower connection
before we got to her. Why?

569
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:27,910
- How long has she been in there?
- A few minutes. I'll call emergency.

570
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,114
No time. She's got 5 minutes
before she drowns.

571
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,740
Get him in that elevator shaft.

572
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:35,715
Why is it always heights?

573
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:39,290
<i>I've entered the security code
for the hatch.</i>

574
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:47,835
<i>I'm still trying to get manual override
in the elevator.</i>

575
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:49,285
I got her.

576
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:57,474
- <i>She has pulse but she's not breathing.</i>
- A medical team's on the way.

577
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,920
Yeah, well,
that's gonna be too late.

578
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,045
Honey?

579
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,990
- You're gonna be okay.
- Keep putting air in her lungs.

580
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:21,965
They're gonna continue filling
with fluid until we can drain them.

581
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,400
Not how I saw our first kiss.

582
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,825
But I'm gonna breathe for you, okay?

583
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,636
You're gonna be okay.

584
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:42,605
How are you feeling?

585
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:45,645
It hurts to breathe.

586
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,276
They're draining the water
from your lungs as fast as they can.

587
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:51,405
I'm scared.

588
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:52,995
You'll be fine.

589
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,255
Just rest.

590
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,834
- Hey, guys. Give me some good news.
- Well, I wish there was.

591
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,955
We can keep her alive in here
like Dr. Bell.

592
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:12,216
Well, that's a start,
but it's not a solution.

593
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,870
The compressed water
she inhaled in the steam room

594
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:16,690
could take months to expel.

595
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,745
Her organs could give out
before then.

596
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,477
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,285
She loved you, Henry.

598
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,665
And I loved her.

599
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,278
Activating laser.

600
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,573
The radiation and chemical combination
should undo the bonds

601
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:23,104
that hold her form together.

602
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:26,165
Now, as that happens,
the data should begin to release.

603
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:37,335
Oh, my God.

604
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:41,155
Kim gave this to you, Henry.

605
00:35:42,415 --> 00:35:44,565
You'll always have a part of her.

606
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:47,575
Yes, I will.

607
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,711
Download complete.

608
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:15,464
Looks like we got it all.

609
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:34,485
I am so sorry for his loss.

610
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:37,535
How is Tess?

611
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:43,985
She's not good.

612
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:49,435
And maybe we're not putting
the right technology together.

613
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,963
There's someone
I need to introduce you to.

614
00:36:58,355 --> 00:36:59,455
Here you go.

615
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:02,986
- Will it work?
- All depends on Manlius.

616
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:04,940
If he can calibrate
his radiation correctly,

617
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:07,489
it should be able to break
the specific molecular bond

618
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:10,394
and release all the compressed syn water
inside of her intact.

619
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,120
And if it doesn't?

620
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:15,148
He could decompress
all the remaing syn water at once.

621
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:16,608
She'll drown.

622
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:20,015
And we wouldn't be able to drain it
quickly enough.

623
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:28,787
We've got her in a nutrient bath
that Kim and I developed.

624
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,204
It'll protect her from the radiation
long enough

625
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,041
for the syn molecules
to get released.

626
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,690
And once they're out,
then we can all breathe easier.

627
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:37,838
Especially Tess.

628
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:39,449
Thank you, Henry.

629
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,508
All right.
I'll need to take your respirator now.

630
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:44,261
You'll have to go underwater,

631
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,515
and breathe with this.

632
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,595
Until we can disperse enough molecules
for your lungs to empty,

633
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:56,982
it will feel like you're drowning.

634
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,569
I know you can do this.

635
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,135
All right?

636
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:24,255
Activating laser.

637
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,475
Okay, it's working on my end.

638
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:36,813
I'm not tracking any release.

639
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,949
Geez.

640
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:51,244
Come on.
Come on, Tess.

641
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:55,225
I don't know how much longer
I can expose her.

642
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:59,175
It's working.

643
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:00,770
We have release.

644
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:03,365
The compressed molecules
are coming out of her lungs intact.

645
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,841
- She's just gotta hold on.
- She can do it.

646
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,125
What happened?

647
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,980
She's clear.

648
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:42,565
Ice cream?

649
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,524
Just what I wanted.

650
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,844
You know,
I'm starting to get used to this.

651
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:51,346
I gotta say, it's exhausting,

652
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,665
but...

653
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,517
It's kinda nice.

654
00:39:56,305 --> 00:40:00,205
I wasn't very good at being around
when Abby was pregnant with Zoe.

655
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,875
So...

656
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:04,305
Thanks.

657
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,275
And when is our first
birthing class?

658
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,725
You remember this?

659
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,943
That's the high-tech baby monitor
from the shower.

660
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,860
The thing that's supposed to make you
feel what the baby feels, right?

661
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,985
Right.

662
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,462
Or...

663
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,160
Instead of connecting me to the baby,
it connected you to me,

664
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:30,469
which is why you've been having
all these symptoms.

665
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,015
I thought...

666
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,135
Well.

667
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,651
Good news is
that we can turn it off.

668
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,990
You know,
we can't stay connected forever.

669
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,935
Life is gonna change for me
pretty quickly.

670
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:00,265
And it's changing for you.

671
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:10,535
But...

672
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,475
I think you should...

673
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,955
you know, go be with Tess right now.

674
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:22,755
Are you sure?

675
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:29,653
Yeah, well, you know,
right after you rub my feet.

676
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,420
- I'll do it nice.
- Gentle.

677
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,794
I will, I will.

678
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,673
Well, well, well.

679
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:51,508
You seem awfully happy.

680
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,795
Yeah, I feel like I lost ten pounds.
How are you feeling?

681
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:57,403
Well, actually, I was hoping to go
to that asteroid event tonight.

682
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:01,995
Well, it doesn't happen that often.
And it's pretty special.

683
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:05,715
Well...

684
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:11,111
If you'd like,
maybe we could watch it together.

685
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:17,576
You know, I never got to thank you
for saving my life.

686
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:21,090
- Manly did that.
- I meant in the elevator.

687
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:22,665
That was some kiss.

688
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:25,745
That was CPR.

689
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,395
