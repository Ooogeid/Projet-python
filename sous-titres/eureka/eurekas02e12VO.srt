1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:02,327
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka.

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:04,986
I need the files... from the explosion
that killed Kim Anderson.

3
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:07,341
- Why?
- Beverly is involved.

4
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:08,615
<i>Carter follow a road</i>

5
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:10,895
that goes right through Henry
and leads right to Kevin.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,608
He controls the field now, Allie.
He's evolving.

7
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,164
If they get a hold of Kevin,
he will never have a normal life.

8
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,887
We have to get that thing out of him.

9
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:21,336
I'm shutting down all research
into the artifact and the accident.

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,881
I'm sorry, Henry.

11
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,342
Okay, fifth geometric postulate.

12
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,750
Math is useless, bordering on futile.

13
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,198
But you have to pass it.

14
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,555
And how can you hate something
that's perfect?

15
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,000
There's no wiggle room.
I like things messy.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,763
But chaos theory states that there's an

17
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,662
underlying perfection
to the randomness of all things.

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,242
Like if I did something
completely unexpected...

19
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:49,973
It'd be totally perfect.

20
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,554
And not at all futile.

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,952
Now close your eyes.
I've got something for you.

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,378
Lucas, it's so pretty.

23
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:09,714
Working here!

24
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,880
So... did you ask your dad?

25
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,080
Well, not yet,
but with his weekend plans,

26
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,570
how could he say no?

27
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,896
Oh, thank you.

28
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,523
- You're welcome.
- Thanks, Vince.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,485
So I'm closing up tomorrow at five.

30
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:32,490
Then we can be on the road by six.
I... found my old waders, by the way.

31
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,393
We don't have
to actually fish, you know?

32
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:37,318
You're kidding?

33
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:40,070
How often is it that I find
a girl who likes to fish?

34
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,115
Anything else for you guys?

35
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,752
- No.
- Hey, hey. Let me get that.

36
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:49,089
Ready for the trip? Dad went out
and bought a new pair of waders.

37
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:50,630
Really?

38
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,215
Thanks.

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,443
What are you doing, Zoe?
What do you want?

40
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,751
What do I want? How could you say that?

41
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,544
I'm hurt and offended.

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,004
Okay, this sounds like a private thing.

43
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,728
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

44
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,266
- Bye, Zoe.
- Bye.

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,633
See you later.

46
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:09,378
Don't worry. You'll have plenty
of time together this weekend.

47
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,612
Whatever happens fly-fishing,
stays fly-fishing.

48
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,629
- In separate rooms.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,699
But since you're gonna be gone,

50
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,233
I thought that maybe...

51
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:20,287
I could have a few people over,
to keep me company.

52
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,748
Like a party?

53
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,782
Like a... Slumber party.

54
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,629
Maybe, how many girls we're talking?

55
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,110
Roughly five or six.

56
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,592
And...

57
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,594
Maybe five or six boys.

58
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,145
Dad, we're not kids anymore.

59
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,249
Then they're definitely
not gonna spend the night.

60
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,997
Here's the new not-kid rule: no boys.

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,637
- But Dad...
- No buts.

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,494
No coffee!

63
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,315
Put your finger there.

64
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:56,968
Put your arm up.

65
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:58,995
And you're good to go, kiddo.

66
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:01,938
Loss of hemoglobin makes
my blood sugar low, you know?

67
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,496
Well, you know what else I know?

68
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,382
The cafeteria has
chocolate chip cookies today.

69
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,596
Go ahead.

70
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:14,294
I couldn't let him do that
by himself a month ago.

71
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,817
He communicates so well now.

72
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,113
Just like a normal kid.

73
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,929
It scares me, Nathan.

74
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:25,583
I'm afraid of what the change
might be doing to him.

75
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,987
- You're thinking about Carl Carlson.
- Aren't you?

76
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:31,941
He's the other person who's
had a connection with the artifact.

77
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,194
- Not like Kevin.
- If only a fraction of it killed Carl--

78
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,467
I'm working on it.

79
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,469
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

80
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,087
Hey, Jo! What, what?

81
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,798
Is it a... What is it?
Free donut day at Cafe Diem?

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,009
No. A crowd control call.

83
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,610
Excuse me.

84
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,365
- Is that...?
- Gold.

85
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:26,669
Beats free donuts.

00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:39,488

- Season 2 | Episode 12 -
All That Glitters (v. 1.0)

92
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,338
Well, it looks like...

93
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,773
Pure...

94
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,010
24 karat...

95
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,101
Gold.

96
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:18,981
Wasn't there a...

97
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,466
fairy tale about
turning metal into gold?

98
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,177
The ancient science of alchemy.

99
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,960
The modern term is transmutation.

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,390
People have been obsessed
about this myth for millennia.

101
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,977
You're still okay to take
some samples, do your thing?

102
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:35,485
I'll try, but I'm not sure
I have the right equipment

103
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:36,606
in my garage.

104
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,130
Why don't use your lab at GD?

105
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,994
Don't have a lab at GD.
I was locked out.

106
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:41,316
- What?
- Someone

107
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,364
is denying me access
to Kim's artifact research.

108
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,157
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

109
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:49,870
I don't think so.

110
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,719
Well...

111
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,502
I'll find out what I can about...

112
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:58,696
golden boy.

113
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:02,132
<i>Anything else you can remember
about the statue cleaner?</i>

114
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:05,216
He had an accent.
And no respect for privacy.

115
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,743
Did you see his name?

116
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
No.

117
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,673
Wait, wait. Yes. On his overalls.

118
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,295
Are we done yet?

119
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:19,315
- Yeah, we're done.
- Okay, your turn.

120
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,300
Your date with Zane. All-nighter?

121
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,486
That would be none of your business.

122
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:27,435
I have to live vicariously through you,
since my dad shut me down this weekend.

123
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:30,129
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- If I wanted to have sex with Lucas,

124
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,365
I wouldn't have to wait
until my dad went out of town.

125
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,122
Okay, but you're not. Right?

126
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,708
Relax, I've seen
the after school specials.

127
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,556
And I mean, Lucas is
a perfect gentleman.

128
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,492
Odd, yes. But...

129
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:43,590
a complete romantic. Look.

130
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,385
Very medieval.

131
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,092
Yeah, so... Now that we know
that my virtue is still intact,

132
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,085
let's talk about you compromising yours.

133
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:56,936
Look at the time.

134
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,489
Gotta find Rudolph.

135
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:03,901
<i>So how did this happen, Carter?</i>

136
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,097
- Henry's working on it.
- Good.

137
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,580
From his garage.

138
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,271
I gotta ask. Did you shut him out
of Kim's lab because of me?

139
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:15,098
You said he wasn't being honest about
the accident. It's a security issue.

140
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,319
Well, I didn't say he broke the law.

141
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,883
I mean, I just said
that he might know something.

142
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:21,518
And I just...

143
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,494
Okay, I'm gonna need access
to Kim's lab, so when should I stop by?

144
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:28,307
This is getting serious, Carter.

145
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:31,469
If you do an investigation, you're gonna
have to do everything by the book.

146
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,874
You're gonna need to make
an official request.

147
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,296
Since when?

148
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,476
I'm sorry, Carter.

149
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:38,972
Yeah.

150
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,489
Me too.

151
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,062
As long as we're being official,

152
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,609
I'm gonna need to see
Beverly Barlowe's classified GD File.

153
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:48,487
You need to make
an official request for that also.

154
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,107
Allie, I am looking
at Kevin's blood cells

155
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,641
from last week and from yesterday and...

156
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,823
There's been a mutation.

157
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,879
Almost evolutionary.

158
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,372
Nathan, not "almost."

159
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,800
Nathan, he read my mind.

160
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:10,953
What?

161
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,846
Last night, Kevin knew
exactly what I was thinking,

162
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,106
before I even said it.

163
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,820
I guess if his blood cells are evolving,

164
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,019
his brain cells are too, but telepathy?

165
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:24,331
Carter's not gonna give up
his investigation.

166
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,899
He wants Beverly's GD file.

167
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:28,485
Give it to him.

168
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:32,165
He'll need to talk to Beverly
to make a case.

169
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,160
He'll never find her.

170
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,493
How can you be so sure?

171
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,080
Trust me.

172
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,554
You notice anything
different about the statue?

173
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,213
What's to change about a statue?

174
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,743
What were you using on it?

175
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:55,147
The same cleaner that I use
on that statue every year.

176
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,792
We're gonna need a sample.

177
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:58,988
It's expensive.

178
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,052
It's evidence.

179
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:05,480
It's outside.

180
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,943
I will bring it from the truck.

181
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:12,746
Happy guy.

182
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,460
Probably wasn't allowed to have
a social life as a child.

183
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,137
Come on, Jo.

184
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:20,036
I can't let her have a boy-girl
sleepover while I'm gone.

185
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,229
Do you really think
she's gonna do anything?

186
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,209
It's not her I'm worried about.
It's hair boy.

187
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,285
Would you be less worried

188
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:33,466
if there were adult supervision?

189
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,177
Well, yeah, but she's not gonna
have a party if I'm there.

190
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:38,555
What about me?

191
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:40,894
You?

192
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,060
Three brothers, always wanted a sister,

193
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,187
and besides, she'll think you're a god

194
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:47,563
if you say yes.

195
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,773
Yeah.

196
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,246
And perhaps no one will tell
a certain dry cleaner

197
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,153
that you've never been fly-fishing

198
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:55,379
a day in your life.

199
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:57,130
I've been fly-fishing!

200
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,093
Once.

201
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,699
Bring it back. If it turns anything
to gold, I could use a new truck.

202
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,509
Is there anything else you can tell us
about the statue?

203
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,842
It's too tall.

204
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:12,898
Anything strange about
the metal's composition?

205
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,367
You want to know more?
Go talk to the artist.

206
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,020
Christopher Dactalos.

207
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,000
He will give you a three-hour lecture

208
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,181
on why his hangnail
should be in the Smithsonian.

209
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,290
Can't wait.

210
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:26,619
Thanks.

211
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,642
I thought you moved
all your research back to GD.

212
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,133
- Nathan, what are we doing here?
- Giving you some peace of mind.

213
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:50,167
Transfer papers need to be signed
in order to complete the delivery.

214
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,088
The package is now
under your jurisdiction.

215
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,426
The DOD has hereby disavowed
all knowledge of it.

216
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,267
Understood.

217
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,162
Nathan, what is going on?
Why are you involved with the DOD?

218
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:13,633
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

219
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,133
Oh, my God. Who is that?

220
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,923
There is no place like home.

221
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:49,900
Where did you find her?

222
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,808
Solitary at Guantanamo.

223
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,511
From the looks of her,
it wasn't too pleasant.

224
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:58,583
Again, Nathan, why have you been
talking to the DOD?

225
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,446
I bargained with them.
Gave them evidence to prosecute Beverly

226
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,344
in exchange for letting us talk to her.

227
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,759
- What evidence?
- A recalibration device

228
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,374
Henry found on Kim's computer,

229
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,080
and video of Beverly putting it there.

230
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:13,863
Nathan, you said we were in this
together. Why didn't you tell me?

231
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,633
Plausible deniability.

232
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,376
Why do you think your signature's not
on the transfer form?

233
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:22,830
Now...

234
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,671
I think you should talk to her first.

235
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,532
She might trust you more.

236
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,153
Mr. Dactalos?

237
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,206
It's sheriff Carter.

238
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:39,442
Hello?

239
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:42,852
Hello?

240
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,826
Newton's third law of motion.

241
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,296
For every action there's an equal
and opposite reaction. You...

242
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,799
push something here and it creates chaos
where you never expected it.

243
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,469
So I presume you're here
about Pythagoras.

244
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:10,139
- Yeah, yeah. You, you sculpted him?
- Cast-iron mold.

245
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:14,688
The mold's on display at the Smithsonian
as an inspiration to young artists.

246
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:18,186
Well I guess it'll be more famous
now that it's turned into gold.

247
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,316
Any idea how?

248
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,608
Gold would never be my medium of choice.
It's far too malleable.

249
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,878
What do you know about alchemy?

250
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,932
Some say it was the first science.

251
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,609
Practiced by intellectual
leaders throughout history.

252
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:37,502
In the Middle Ages it even incorporated
an occult component

253
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,627
and many alchemists
were burned at the stake.

254
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,504
What's the crime
in trying to create gold?

255
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,864
The crime of trying to control nature.

256
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,244
The age-old struggle
between man and God.

257
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:49,386
Anything like that at GD?

258
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:51,977
The last of the known alchemists
were Eastern European, but the

259
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:55,757
fall of Hitler and the rise of
particle physics hastened their demise.

260
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:58,132
And that should save you
the Google search.

261
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,730
- Yeah.
- Now, if you don't mind,

262
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,257
I've got a piece in the furnace. So...

263
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:04,046
Sure, sure. Thank you.

264
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,658
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

265
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,709
Looks like I'm not the only one
surprised to find me back in Eureka.

266
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:22,599
Why, Beverly?

267
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,257
Why would you betray your government?
What could possibly be so important?

268
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,599
Oh, come on, Allison.

269
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,559
You haven't had
the big office for that long.

270
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,034
There are obligations.

271
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,267
We have that go beyond governments.

272
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,743
Things we need to protect.

273
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,556
The way you protected Kim Anderson.

274
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,483
Things did not turn out
the way I planned.

275
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,815
I never meant for her to die.

276
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:48,737
Well, tell that to Henry.

277
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:59,167
I need you to tell us
what you know about the Artifact.

278
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,288
Now, why would I tell you

279
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,945
if I didn't tell those nice men
at Gitmo?

280
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,492
Look, I never want
to go back there again.

281
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,477
If you help me,

282
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,708
I will help you.

283
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,037
The only way you can help me
is to get me a deal.

284
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,988
And the only way you can do that
is by using your position to protect me.

285
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,210
But you would never do that, would you?

286
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,078
Depends on what you know.

287
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:43,560
So if I tell you everything,

288
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,615
you will use your influence
with the DOD on my behalf?

289
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,299
I'll think about it.

290
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,258
Why, Allison?

291
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,383
Why would you betray
your own government?

292
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,843
What could possibly be so important?

293
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,984
So the handyman is from Slovenia?

294
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:14,489
Used to be Yugoslavia,
part of the Medieval Holy Roman Empire.

295
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,575
History in witchcraft
and ancient practices.

296
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,379
What, like alchemy?

297
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,619
Rudolph was born there in 1959,

298
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:25,172
learned his trade from his grandfather,

299
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,498
and he owes the bank of Eureka $68,000.

300
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,546
Texas hold'em online.

301
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,586
Maybe Rudolph's working
on a way to settle that debt.

302
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,609
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

303
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,582
- Oh, I'm glad.
- You're the best.

304
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,328
Almost god-like, I'd say.

305
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:44,033
And I promise, no, no sex,
no drugs, no rock and roll.

306
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,739
You... You can have rock and roll.

307
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,629
Oh, and whatever Jo says, goes.

308
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,650
Yeah, and she's gonna be armed,
so Lucas stays

309
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,318
3 feet away from you at all times.

310
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,423
- Three feet.
- Dad, he's... He's not like that.

311
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,916
He's respectful, and kind, and generous.

312
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,785
Sounds like you're dating the Pope.

313
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,371
Oh, and look what he gave me.

314
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,660
That looks expensive.

315
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,060
That wasn't gold before.

316
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,547
Vincent? Calm down.

317
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:14,256
We're on our way.

318
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,258
They're looting Cafe Diem.

319
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:17,971
All right, stay here.

320
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,356
Where were you raised?

321
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,673
Prison?

322
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,450
Hands off my bundt!

323
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,658
That's telling him, Vince.

324
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,859
What happened?

325
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,985
Okay, first,
the utensils turned to gold,

326
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:33,180
then the counters, then the silverware.

327
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,411
And that's when they turned against me.

328
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:36,942
Like vultures.

329
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,630
Like greedy little genius vultures.

330
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,979
I thought intelligent men
were above such things.

331
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,056
Really?

332
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,760
It's just so shiny.

333
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,143
Hey. Please tell me
you got a handle on this,

334
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,058
cause I got a town
full of petty larcenists.

335
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,853
- Everything metal turned into gold?
- No. Only in certain places.

336
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,321
The kitchen, the counters,

337
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:14,065
- some stuff on the tables.
- But nothing in that half of the room.

338
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,040
So it's probably not airborne,
or everything metal would've changed,

339
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,132
because the substance
we found on the statue

340
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,262
works like bacteria, converting

341
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,500
the molecular structure
of metal into gold.

342
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,077
So I'd say it's a contact issue.

343
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,856
One infected metal touches another,
and then it spreads.

344
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,255
Okay, so if the bacteria
was on the statue,

345
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:35,217
something touched the statue,
and that something was brought here...

346
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:36,472
- Exactly.
- Okay.

347
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,026
I'm gonna need a list of everybody
who came in here yesterday,

348
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,498
and if you can remember
if they were wearing or carrying

349
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,422
- something that touched the statue.
- Okay.

350
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,650
Thanks.

351
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,046
What uh-oh?

352
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,432
Zoe's bracelet.

353
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,270
We were sitting right here
when she showed it to me.

354
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:52,887
She said Lucas gave it to her.

355
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,447
And they were by the statue.

356
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,721
That would do it.

357
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,070
Yeah, but she's safe, right?
I mean, people are safe.

358
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,904
It's metal to metal only. She's fine.

359
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:05,320
It looks like we have
a gold epidemic on our hands.

360
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:08,734
We just became the richest town
in the world.

361
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,551
Well, that's one way to look at it.

362
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,888
Gold is a soft metal, so it doesn't bear
the same weight as steel,

363
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:16,129
so our infrastructure
could be collapsing.

364
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,421
We'd be rich, but dangerously unstable.

365
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:20,937
Like Paris Hilton?

366
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:25,463
Now what?

367
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:34,395
- Excuse me! Excuse us!
- Excuse me!

368
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:35,934
Excuse me, sorry.

369
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:38,941
<i>Stand back, please.</i>

370
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,754
- This is corrosion.
- Ma'am...

371
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,663
How's that even possible?

372
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,512
It could be some kind of...

373
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:51,603
Parasite, feeding off its host,

374
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,330
mutating into a

375
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:56,417
metal-eating bacteria,

376
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,195
which means,
any structures made of metal,

377
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,672
could deteriorate just...

378
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,947
We've an outbreak on our hands.
The town's been sealed 2 miles around.

379
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,084
No one in. No one out.
I've called for backup.

380
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:16,770
There has to be a massive energy source
to be doing this.

381
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:20,524
No, Henry says it's a bacteria. Changed
the metal into gold, now consuming it.

382
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,602
- Henry?
- Yeah, Henry.

383
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,320
He did the initial tests, and...

384
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,789
Look, whatever's going on between
you two, I need him on this one.

385
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,231
Tell us you know what this is.

386
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:38,420
Definitely a mutation
on the original strain.

387
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:43,005
It's like someone flipped a switch and
turned it into a voracious metal-eating

388
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,304
bug.

389
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:47,084
How fast will things
continue to deteriorate?

390
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,347
The answer lies in determining
when and where it started.

391
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,973
Good. Cause Jo and I have
to figure out where it went.

392
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,455
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

393
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:02,741
Hello, Nathan.

394
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:14,494
You've become quite
the man behind the woman.

395
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,955
Let's not pretend
like we were ever friends.

396
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,569
Fair enough.

397
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,581
I presume you're here
to offer me a deal too.

398
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,070
Tell me what you know
about the artifact,

399
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:27,519
you're free to go.

400
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:32,053
I know what you know.

401
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:38,101
Maybe I'll come back in a few days.

402
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,244
I do know it's capable
of human interface.

403
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:49,195
But you know that too, don't you?

404
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,871
How do I disconnect it?

405
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:52,019
I don't know.

406
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,835
But the energy release
can be life-threatening

407
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,299
if the cellular mutations are reversed,

408
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,456
which is why
he is probably already dead.

409
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,152
I don't accept that.

410
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,878
How do I help him?

411
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:06,830
Help who?

412
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,911
I was talking about Carl Carlson.

413
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,320
Who are you talking about?

414
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:21,686
Rudolph, you in here?

415
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:34,198
Looks like the refurbisher
needs some refurbishing.

416
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:38,244
And the tools that
crumble like the statue.

417
00:22:38,364 --> 00:22:40,129
And this entire shed.

418
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:45,221
Carter, over here! It's Rudolph.

419
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,786
- He's pinned.
- Hey, there. Are you all right?

420
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,046
It's not safe.

421
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,756
- I'll lift, you pull.
- Leave me.

422
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,158
You have to get out now.

423
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,292
Swing...

424
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,570
There you go.

425
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:07,831
Going down.

426
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,511
You got it.

427
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,801
<i>Rudolph's cleaning solution
couldn't be the source.</i>

428
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:32,131
<i>It was stored in a metal can,
that hasn't been affected,</i>

429
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,967
- and neither has his truck.
<i>- Well, I've cobbled together a</i>

430
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,158
rough time line

431
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,139
which seems to indicate that the statue
wasn't the initial source either.

432
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:41,616
So...

433
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,560
Something touched the statue,
and then moved into Cafe Diem.

434
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:45,893
Right.

435
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,730
At approximately...

436
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,398
3 to 4 pm.

437
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,908
Right as school got out.

438
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:55,074
- Man.
<i>- What?</i>

439
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:56,828
No, I'm...

440
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,608
I'm about to lose my god-like status.

441
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:04,079
This is the most humiliating thing
you've ever done to me.

442
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,999
Give me time. I'll top it. I need
to know everything you can remember

443
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,992
about where you got it
and who sold it to you.

444
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:10,704
I didn't buy it. I made it for her.

445
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:13,171
She likes blue.

446
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,470
Eyes front. So you made it.

447
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:22,764
What, by yourself? Out of what?

448
00:24:22,884 --> 00:24:24,975
- Scrap metal.
- He's really talented.

449
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,978
It's a... Interesting hobby.

450
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,451
It's not a hobby, it's a class.
Metallurgy.

451
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,142
I take it at school.

452
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:33,949
So the scrap metal came from Tesla?

453
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:37,112
No. The advanced class goes
to the professor's studio.

454
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,990
Would that be professor
Christopher Dactalos?

455
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:42,742
One of the greatest artists
of the 21st century.

456
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:45,578
That's all for right now. Thanks, Lucas.

457
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,742
- So is my boyfriend un-arrested?
- He was never arrested.

458
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,824
Boyfriend?

459
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:54,176
Yeah, well. Play your cards right.

460
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,176
New piece?

461
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,682
Destined for a museum in Prague.

462
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:07,475
Sounds important.

463
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,453
What would be the point of creating
something if it wasn't important?

464
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:11,604
Or perfect?

465
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,845
One of your students 
used a piece of scrap metal

466
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,231
he found in this studio
to make a bracelet.

467
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,447
He washed it in hydrochloric acid and...

468
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,073
It transmuted.

469
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:27,673
Sheriff, I cannot be held responsible
for the mistakes of a novice.

470
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,037
Hydrochloric acid, you say?

471
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:31,934
Interesting.

472
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:33,703
I know alchemists work in secret,

473
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,084
but I need to know what you did to that
piece of metal before Lucas washed it.

474
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,163
I need to search the premises.
Starting...

475
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,158
with that cellar right there.

476
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:43,957
Well, I presume you have a warrant.

477
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,139
No.

478
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,888
I just have this.

479
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:53,361
This is what's happening to your statue.

480
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:55,947
That gold is transforming.

481
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,440
Be careful with that, Sheriff.

482
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,754
You could be responsible for unleashing
the destruction of Eureka.

483
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,036
Somebody already has.

484
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:07,805
Yes, apparently my student.

485
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:11,499
Albeit by accident, he tampered
with a formula historically designed

486
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,687
to destroy whoever tried to master it
without the proper knowledge.

487
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,308
So it's a trap.

488
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,140
It's called the alchemist's curse.

489
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,173
It's designed to trigger
chaotic mutation.

490
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:23,453
So...

491
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,970
Metal to gold, gold to rust...

492
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,447
Rust to god knows what.

493
00:26:28,513 --> 00:26:30,755
Now, if legend is correct,
it will change again,

494
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,862
and again, and again, till it eradicates
the civilization that fooled with it.

495
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:36,763
Babylon.

496
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:38,482
Atlantis.

497
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:40,576
The Maya.

498
00:26:41,218 --> 00:26:43,862
They all came close,
and look what happened to them.

499
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,392
We know it behaves like a bacteria.

500
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:49,118
And we have 99%
of the answers right here.

501
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:52,663
It would take a genius of an unnatural
kind to come up with the last 1%.

502
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,088
I'm afraid the alchemist's curse
has found its next victim.

503
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Us.

504
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,883
<i>Okay, right there.</i>

505
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,477
See that? yeah.

506
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,383
Perfect.

507
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,158
You're getting good at this, Kev.

508
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:17,396
Maybe one day you're gonna be
the head of GD just like your mom.

509
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,875
It makes her worry too much.

510
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:22,437
Well, it's a big job.

511
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,389
She's worried about me.

512
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,781
You both are.

513
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:34,212
We just wanna know what's
making you change, that's all.

514
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,998
And you think she can help?

515
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:40,071
Do you?

516
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,186
Your mom told me what you can do.

517
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:46,385
I think it's pretty cool.

518
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:48,323
Sometimes.

519
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:51,930
Can you do it now?

520
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,933
Can you tell me what
Dr. Barlowe's thinking?

521
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:58,021
What she knows about
what's going on with you?

522
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,317
Guests usually knock.

523
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:06,444
Friends don't usually care.

524
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,970
Jack found the metal source,
which could quite possibly help us

525
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,910
come up with an antidote
for the bacteria problem.

526
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:17,010
- Okay. I need to get Kevin home first.
- I'll take care of him.

527
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:19,874
Jack needs your biochem skills
right now far more than mine.

528
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,631
I'm sure he'll need us both.

529
00:28:23,372 --> 00:28:24,372
Come on, Kev.

530
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:25,954
Let's go see your mom.

531
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:35,575
We found the source of our problem.
All we have to do...

532
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:38,103
Is deliver it into the hands
of the genius who can abuse it.

533
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:41,121
- It's good to see you too, Christopher.
- You two know each other?

534
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,746
Yes, we started at Global together.

535
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,089
- We had similar interests.
- But different approaches.

536
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,124
He thought the future held answers.
I believed in learning from the past.

537
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:51,521
I'm really into the present, so
let's continue this reunion downstairs.

538
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:57,537
I've read about these.

539
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,648
Secret workshops where alchemists are
protected from arrests and even death.

540
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,877
But that was back in the day
before the enlightenment of science.

541
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,672
Modern science is not that enlightened.

542
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,751
Then magic's for losers. And...

543
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,967
wizards. And has no place in science.

544
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,637
Well, this is fascinating. We have
a town that's about to collapse.

545
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,385
I mean, can we fix this?

546
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:20,017
He says that if we do something
wrong, the bacteria will

547
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,353
mutate like a...

548
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,117
A built-in curse.

549
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:25,815
Or a built-in security algorithm?

550
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:28,234
- Or that.
- Why do I recognize this?

551
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,810
It's related to the r-process
of the supernovae,

552
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,856
which creates heavy metals
from lighter ones.

553
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,826
Like gold from lesser metals,
but this one's incomplete.

554
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:40,987
No, Lucas added, hydrochloric acid.

555
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:42,506
If that helps.

556
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:47,659
Maybe, I might be able to figure out
an antibody if I work backwards.

557
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,714
The great Nathan Stark.
Always coming to the rescue.

558
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,285
Finally you understand the importance
of things that came before you.

559
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:59,021
But you know, you're under arrest for
withholding information and obstruction

560
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,243
of justice.

561
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,597
You're gonna have to come with me.

562
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:05,062
Lupo! He's on his way up!

563
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:07,959
- If we got what we need, we gotta go.
- Give us a minute?

564
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:09,403
Yep.

565
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,865
You know where I saw this before.
It's Kim's research on the artifact.

566
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:19,622
- Leave it, Henry.
- Nathan, I can help you.

567
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,356
<i>Guys! We gotta go.</i>

568
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:22,595
No.

569
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:23,857
You can't.

570
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,460
The Cafe Diem outbreak infected
the buildings on Main Street,

571
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,853
then tainted vehicles spread
the mutation through the town

572
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:40,065
and forced the closure
of the Da Vinci Bridge.

573
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,533
- What about Global?
- The building frame is steel,

574
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:45,614
but it's encased in concrete,
so we should be fine.

575
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,857
Maybe it was an earthquake?

576
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,232
<i>Code orange.</i>

577
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,789
<i>Engineering team
to Allison Blake's office.</i>

578
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,223
<i>Code orange.</i>

579
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,710
<i>Security breach. Unauthorized entry.</i>

580
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,981
I knew you'd find a way in
once you knew I was here.

581
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,220
After what I discovered?
You're damn right.

582
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:24,015
You mean after you found
what I left for you.

583
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:27,810
Come on, Henry. Give me a little credit.

584
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,709
You don't think
I accidentally left behind

585
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,981
the one thing that
could explain Kim's death, did you?

586
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,419
I knew you'd find it.

587
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,945
- Why?
- Because you deserve to know.

588
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:41,616
And because you're the only man
in this town who could understand

589
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,440
why I had to do what I did.

590
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,957
Understand?

591
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:47,914
You killed the woman I love,

592
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,006
and there is no reason in this world

593
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,419
that I shouldn't do the same to you.

594
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,795
It was an accident.

595
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:59,276
And you already know the reason
or you wouldn't still be talking to me.

596
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:01,366
It is the same reason Allison took

597
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,721
Kim's research from you
and gave it to Nathan Stark.

598
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,827
The Artifact is capable
of human interface.

599
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,700
Carl Carlson proved that.

600
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:13,939
And now it's connected to someone else.

601
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:16,108
And you know who it is.

602
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,355
Yes.

603
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,368
He's the receiver now.

604
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,955
He's connected to the akashic field.

605
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:33,471
All the collective knowledge
of the universe?

606
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,336
It's real, Henry.

607
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:39,771
And that kind of energy
cannot be contained for long.

608
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,575
It could kill him.

609
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:51,282
So that's what Nathan's been working on.

610
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:52,744
Trying to...

611
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,819
separate Kevin...

612
00:32:57,787 --> 00:32:59,140
from the field.

613
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,049
There are some things

614
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,455
we aren't meant to control.

615
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:08,940
Because it's in our nature
to abuse power.

616
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:12,469
We're not ready for the responsibility.

617
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:15,941
So what is it you're asking of me?

618
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,257
That creaky noise.
Louder to the left or to the right?

619
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,472
Never mind.

620
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,915
Nathan, are you any closer
to figuring this out?

621
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:37,533
It all makes sense until I get
to the end of the equation, and then...

622
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:40,118
If I make a mistake, it'll mutate again.

623
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,944
- What's going on? Where's Kevin?
- He's fine. Wanted me to give you this.

624
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,441
He's been obsessed with it for hours,

625
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,195
like he's channeling something.

626
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,751
And he's convinced
it's going to help you.

627
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:52,911
Well, it's the formula.

628
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,415
He finished it.

629
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,707
But...

630
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:00,920
He's never seen it. How?

631
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,504
I don't ask those questions anymore.

632
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:24,444
Help.

633
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,931
Help!

634
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:31,208
Evacuate all non-essential
personnel right now.

635
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:33,782
Give project heads
and emergency crews one hour.

636
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:36,386
- What happened?
- The ceiling collapsed in section four.

637
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,417
If the floor goes next,
no one will make it out.

638
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:40,418
- Stark found anything?
- Works on the antibody

639
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,628
- for the metal-eating-bacteria.
- Allison.

640
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,901
Look, now is not
the time to get into it,

641
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:47,467
but... Henry and Stark are involved.

642
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,470
- I heard them talk about Beverly.
- There's a collapse in section four

643
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,636
we need to stay focused on right now.

644
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,807
Fargo is down there. Please find him.

645
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:17,434
Eureka.

646
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,931
Can you hear me?

647
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:24,378
- Please tell me it's not just you.
- You're welcome.

648
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,181
How you doing? You in pain?

649
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,841
My leg's stuck,
but I don't think anything's broken.

650
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,761
Okay.

651
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,307
<i>Carter, what's going on?</i>

652
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,351
I found Fargo and
what's left of section four.

653
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:42,188
We're gonna need a rescue team
down here as soon as we can, okay?

654
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,611
Better send them quick,
before the beam corrodes.

655
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,090
Happy thoughts, Fargo, happy thoughts.

656
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,831
<i>Carter, Nathan's got
something to stop the rust,</i>

657
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,201
<i>but it'll take a while
to culture enough for the town.</i>

658
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:59,747
Just gonna need to shore up the beams
under Fargo before the floor collapses.

659
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:02,529
That's not a happy thought.

660
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:03,978
Hang on.

661
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,403
I repaired the beam
in section two last year.

662
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,176
Dangerous job. We can't go from the top.

663
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:14,473
Any more weight would compromise it.

664
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,805
So we go in from the bottom?

665
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,256
There is a crawl space big
enough for a person

666
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:23,425
to slide in and apply
the antibacterial solution, but...

667
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:26,773
The whole thing could collapse
while the repair is being made.

668
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,694
I wouldn't do it.
Even if my leg wasn't broken.

669
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,504
Crap.

670
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:42,295
I'm right underneath the section four
collapse. Can you hear me, Fargo?

671
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:43,859
<i>Still here.</i>

672
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:47,801
<i>You should be coming up
on to the first beam now.</i>

673
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,341
Yeah. I see it.

674
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,844
- <i>It's pretty bad already.</i>
- Thanks for the update.

675
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:59,306
Yeah... how do we know this stuff
isn't gonna make it worse?

676
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,591
Worse?

677
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:04,503
My information comes from
a pretty reliable source.

678
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:08,565
It's weight bearing.
Go ahead and spray it.

679
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,541
How much of this metal-eating
bug spray do I use?

680
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:15,096
As much as it takes.

681
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,365
If we die... At least we die together.

682
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,577
Lucky me.

683
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,497
- <i>Carter.</i>
- It's not working!

684
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,096
- Give it time.
- Easy for you to say.

685
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,008
<i>It's working, Fargo.</i>

686
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:37,427
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

687
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:41,392
Well, Fargo, now you and Carter
can live happily ever after.

688
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,975
You wanna know
what my happy thought was?

689
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:47,904
Some things are better left unsaid.

690
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:15,471
Not a bad turnout.

691
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:20,541
Yeah, if there's one skill that comes
naturally to me, it's party planning.

692
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:23,302
I can think of other things
that come naturally to you.

693
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:26,592
<i>Welcome to the party, Sheriff.</i>

694
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,613
<i>Sorry your getaway was cut short.</i>

695
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:31,353
Yeah, thanks, SARAH.
How's... how's security?

696
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,922
<i>No physical damage to the property.</i>

697
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:35,342
And...

698
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,111
Other stuff?

699
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,809
<i>Small dancing, couch sitting,</i>

700
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:41,630
<i>and two people currently
in the front closet.</i>

701
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,260
What are you?

702
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:53,447
You're supposed to be watching...

703
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:58,215
Well, I was watching her,
and she was watching me, so...

704
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,348
Yeah, okay.

705
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,161
- Henry. What's up?
- <i>We still have a problem.</i>

706
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:09,852
<i>Bring your biohazard suit.</i>

707
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,914
<i>This man only died a week ago.</i>

708
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,734
<i>And this is all that's left.</i>

709
00:39:15,308 --> 00:39:16,620
<i>Bone fragments,</i>

710
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,616
<i>ceramic dental crown,</i>

711
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,937
<i>and a plastic stent implanted
in this dead man three years ago.</i>

712
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,533
Don't like where this is going.

713
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,674
What if the metal-eating
bacteria mutated again

714
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:29,079
before we caught it all?
Right here in the morgue?

715
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,165
<i>It started jumping to people?</i>

716
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:34,876
<i>I think it's attacking the iron
in our cells, and this body</i>

717
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:36,882
<i>is ground zero for the next stage.</i>

718
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:39,123
<i>I hate this day.</i>

719
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:42,467
<i>Now, I'm gonna run some tests, and
hopefully it'll remain a contact germ,</i>

720
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,095
- <i>but if it goes airborne...</i>
- <i>Yeah, I gotta tell Allison.</i>

721
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,425
<i>I already told her, and Stark.</i>

722
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:48,849
<i>Now, I'm sure he's on it.</i>

723
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,675
<i>We'll take care of the science.
You take care of the town.</i>

724
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:54,463
<i>People may have to get
out of here real fast.</i>

725
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,882
That's it.

726
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:25,282
You ready? I need to get Kevin home.

727
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,324
<i>Are you okay without me right now?</i>

728
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,764
You need to get some sleep too.

729
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,875
Allie, I am looking at the formula,

730
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:35,114
and if I can figure out a way
to shut down Kevin's progression

731
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:37,704
the same way I shut down
the rusting bacteria, I...

732
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:41,374
- Allie, I'm close.
- I know you'll find a way.

733
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,606
<i>Yeah, I'll come up.
I'll help you get him to the car.</i>

734
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:44,765
Okay.

735
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:02,793
Henry, what are you doing here?

736
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:04,031
It's late.

737
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,532
How is he?

738
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:11,013
Kevin is fine.

739
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,588
I know what's happening to him.
Same thing that happened to Carl,

740
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,502
same thing that killed Kim.

741
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,784
Exposure to the Artifact.

742
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,856
Leave this alone.

743
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:22,775
Too late.

744
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,987
Why? Because of Kim?

745
00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:29,649
Because of me.

746
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:38,470
Any luck with the second antibody?

747
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,903
For?

748
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:41,749
For... the new mutation.

749
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:44,716
The flesh-eating bacteria. You know,

750
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,153
your first antibody
triggered another change.

751
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,701
What? Impossible.
I know that formula was correct.

752
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,353
And why do you think
there was another mutation?

753
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:54,744
Henry said he told you.

754
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:56,965
Dammit.

755
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:00,942
<i>Evacuation protocol initiate...</i>

756
00:42:01,092 --> 00:42:02,502
Is that Beverly?

757
00:42:06,382 --> 00:42:08,591
- Oh, no.
- What's happening?

758
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:12,428
- It's a red level security breach.
- The bacteria mutated again.

759
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:15,890
It's lethal to anything organic,
and it's airborne.

760
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,680
Oh, my God.

761
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:34,909
Well, that can't be good.
