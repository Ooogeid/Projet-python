00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:01,306
<i>Previously on Eureka...</i>

2
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:02,574
I got offered
early admission

3
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:05,492
to an undergrad premed
program at Harvard.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,244
I still can't believe our
little girl is leaving home.

5
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,290
This isn't how I pictured
it going for us.

6
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:13,066
Yeah, bad timing.

7
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,303
Come here, Tess.

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,640
A private funder is building

9
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:17,779
a new, ultra large
radio-telescope array,

10
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,921
and they need
someone to run it.

11
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,357
And where is it?

12
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:22,898
Australia.

13
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:24,301
That's far.

14
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,709
I don't have you here.

15
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,057
But it's not just
the distance, is it?

16
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,297
I just don't know
if I can do it anymore.

17
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,075
Bye, Jack.

18
00:00:37,142 --> 00:00:38,845
Bye, Tess.

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,644
Hey, Henry!

20
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,647
Nice ride!

21
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,049
Jack.

22
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,484
A classic.

23
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:01,722
1947 Chrysler New Yorker.

24
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,224
- Wow.
- Isn't that something?

25
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,325
Yeah.

26
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:05,927
Sadly not mine,

27
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:07,694
and at the moment
not running.

28
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:09,428
Where's your tow truck
when you need it, huh?

29
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,796
Yeah, if only there
were two of me.

30
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,098
Ah, don't tempt fate.

31
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,434
Wow, engine parts
I can actually name.

32
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,372
Yeah, there's no fusion
power cells in this one.

33
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,274
I'm getting it ready
for Founders' Day.

34
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,877
Ah, right.

35
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,913
Right.

36
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,782
Come on, 60th anniversary.
It's gonna be a big party.

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,218
Yeah.

38
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:31,055
No, I'm not in a party
sort of mood.

39
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,223
Oh, yeah?

40
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,760
Everything okay?

41
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,895
Yeah.

42
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,197
Yeah, no, Tess and I just...

43
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,566
Oh, no, what happened?

44
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,202
Oh, oh, don't worry.

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,906
It's just, I think,
a clogged fuel filter.

46
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,675
Oh, well, it's no wonder.

47
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,544
It's been sitting in the museum
for the last decade.

48
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,012
Well, you can't have
Founders' Day

49
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,614
without the founder's car,
so I'll give you a hand.

50
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,316
Great.

51
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:57,420
Uh, uh, sheriff Jack Carter,

52
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,754
this is, uh...I'm sorry.

53
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,323
- Grace Monroe.
- Grace Monroe.

54
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,493
I was volunteered
to organize Founders' Day.

55
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,329
- That's a big job.
- Oh, you have no idea, Sheriff.

56
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,464
How... think I might just...
[phone rings]

57
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:08,933
Oh, yeah?

58
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:11,269
- Allison.
- Yeah, sure.

59
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,037
- So we'll talk later.
- Yeah. Hey.

60
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,873
All right, so the filter's down there.

61
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,943
[Marching band plays]

62
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,013
Hey, Allison, what's up?

63
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:23,451
Oh, oh, oh,
my blood pressure.

64
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,020
I need you to help me
with logistics

65
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,855
or Founders' Day is going
to be the end of me.

66
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,590
Yeah? Startin' to see why.

67
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,225
Yeah, all this
plus we're testing

68
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:31,994
dozens of projects
at Global Dynamics.

69
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:33,362
Kevin started
with a new rec therapist,

70
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,997
and Jenna,
she still hasn't slept

71
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,532
through the whole night.

72
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,901
You're trying to break
mama's brain, aren't you?

73
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,303
The joys of being
a single working mother

74
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,539
in charge of the most dangerous
minds in the world.

75
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,374
It's a scientific think tank, Carter,

76
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,676
not an insane asylum.

77
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:48,111
Yeah, tomato, "tomahto."

78
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,279
Hey, guys.

79
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,613
Cold war cappuccino?

80
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,082
- No, no thank you.
- No thanks.

81
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,551
- Okay.
- Thanks.

82
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,454
So I heard about Tess.

83
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:58,855
Oh, come on,
that just happened.

84
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:00,223
That just happened!

85
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,025
I know, I called the house
to talk to you,

86
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,927
and S.A.R.A.H. answered.

87
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,996
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:07,898
- Thanks.
- You okay?

89
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,933
Um, yeah.

90
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,835
Yeah, I mean, Zoe's coming home
from Harvard after finals,

91
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,003
and the house
has been really quiet,

92
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,271
so that'll be great.

93
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,539
Oh, well, if you need noise,

94
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:16,940
you can always come
to my house.

95
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:18,609
I'd be happy to take
the kids if you need a break.

96
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:19,910
No, no, no, that's okay.

97
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,546
I actually finally
found a nanny.

98
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:24,815
- You... a nanny?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,284
A nanny?
What has a nanny got...

100
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:29,353
What has a nanny got
that I don't have?

101
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,555
Yeah, like a PhD
in early childhood development

102
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:34,492
with an emphasis
on organic nutrition?

103
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Lightweight.

104
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,596
Yeah, even Kevin seems
to like the guy,

105
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,698
which is unusual with autism.

106
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,333
He's usually uncomfortable
with technology and people.

107
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:45,002
Hey, baby, how you doing?
You working hard?

108
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,437
He sure is.

109
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,373
These classics aren't gonna
reassemble themselves.

110
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,275
Nice stache!

111
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,278
Thanks. Just showing
my town spirit, sheriff.

112
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,881
Founders' Day celebrates
Albert Einstein's vision

113
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,549
of building a creative haven

114
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:58,150
for the world's
greatest thinkers

115
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,051
to live and create.

116
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,553
Create havoc.

117
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,454
Well, not all the time.

118
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:07,390
I mean, these early inventions
are a testament to that vision.

119
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,658
What's this one do?

120
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,192
That's a Van de Graaff
generator.

121
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,395
Turned way down in case
someone's crazy enough

122
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,830
to actually touch it.

123
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:16,097
Look at my arm,
look at my arm!

124
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,698
What... oh...
[chuckles]

125
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,200
How old are you?

126
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,168
All right, I'm gonna take
Jenna back to the house.

127
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:23,203
Fargo, he's all yours.

128
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,171
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

129
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,706
All right, we're gonna need
some traffic control,

130
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,041
nighttime security
for the science exhibits,

131
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:33,577
and if you could put on
a '40s era uniform,

132
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,345
that'd be super.

133
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:38,514
We strive for authenticity.

134
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,015
Yeah, can I finish my run first?

135
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,117
Um, sure.
I'm not unreasonable.

136
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:43,485
Oh, man, cold war cappuccino.

137
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,752
This is gonna stain.

138
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,354
Same Eureka,

139
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:48,889
different day.

140
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,124
Day's not over yet.

141
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,260
Morning, Jo.

142
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:59,297
Zane, what are you
doing in my cell?

143
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,432
Reminding you
how we first met.

144
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,801
Hmm.

145
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,771
I got you something.

146
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,874
Did you now?

147
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,442
Hmm.

148
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,278
Huh.

149
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:17,016
And I suppose you'd like
me to try this on for you?

150
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,720
Something like that.

151
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,099
Zane.

152
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,501
Well, you already made
an honest man of me.

153
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,136
So let's make it official.

154
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,808
Marry me, Jo Jo.

155
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,942
Zane, I...

156
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:51,346
I don't know what to say.

157
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,649
How 'bout "yes"?

158
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:58,085
Hey, Jo!
Fargo's got a job for...

159
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,356
No!

160
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,624
[Laughs]

161
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,493
Well, congratulations.

162
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,627
Congratulations.

163
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,529
Yeah, not so much.

164
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:13,699
Um...

165
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,834
Zane, I...

166
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:21,939
Oh, Jo.

167
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,011
Not right now, Carter.

168
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,013
- Okay?
- Sure.

169
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,251
If you need anything,
you just call.

170
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,721
All right?

171
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,656
Yeah.

172
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:52,564
[Celphone rings]

173
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,799
Jo?
Jo, is that you?

174
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,874
[Sighs]

175
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,743
Oh, it's gonna be
one of those days.

176
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:16,178
Ah.
Hey, Henry!

177
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,248
Yeah, I...

178
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,816
Oh!

179
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,084
[Chuckles]

180
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,351
Sorry, thought you
were Henry Deacon.

181
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,453
No, Dr. Trevor Grant.

182
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,653
Nice to meet you, Trevor.

me a lift back into town?

362
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,042
It's a new technique.
I learned it in nursing school.

363
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,844
You don't say.

364
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,479
Oh, he doesn't have a pulse.
I need a crash cart.

365
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:11,847
Isn't crashing what did this
to him in the first place?

366
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,282
Electricity to jump start his heart.

367
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,716
Soldier!

368
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,384
Soldier, do you have jumper
cables in that thing?

369
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,785
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,086
Okay, I need you to hook it
up to the engine coil,

371
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,554
ground it, then hand me
the other end.

372
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:23,589
- Now!
- Don't look at me.

373
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,560
She said now!

374
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,328
I hope to God you know
what you're doing.

375
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,396
Me too.

376
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:36,302
Back up.

377
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,678
[Gasping]

378
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:50,547
Oh, my chest is on fire.

379
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,649
But you're alive to feel it.

380
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,217
You're gonna be okay.

381
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,718
Get you to the infirmary.

382
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:57,887
Medic!
I need a medic!

383
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,123
Okay, okay.

384
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,428
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

385
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,130
Allison.

386
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,966
You learn that in nursing
school too, Allison?

387
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,535
Not exactly.

388
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,604
As you were.

389
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,607
We have the woman in custody.

390
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,043
After she took down how many
of your men, Ryan?

391
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,945
Clearly she's been
well-trained.

392
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,980
She was carrying this.

393
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,981
Look familiar?

394
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,982
It's disabled, just like the others.

395
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,517
Counting the guy in the stockade...

396
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,318
That's three.
That's three.

397
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:40,819
Right.

398
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,190
Nurse.

399
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:47,325
Aren't you gonna stay
with your patient?

400
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:49,894
Of course.

401
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,795
Hey, maybe you should focus
a little less

402
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,297
on the pretty nurse
and more on the fact

403
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,100
that we just had
a major security breach.

404
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,335
We still have no idea
who these people are.

405
00:17:57,403 --> 00:18:01,640
Right now I'm more interested
in where they came from.

406
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,975
Keep searching, Ryan.

407
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,514
Let's get this mess
cleaned up!

408
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,451
That the best you got?

409
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,053
I was just getting warmed up.

410
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,527
Where the hell am I?

411
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,729
Jo?
Is that you?

412
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:29,930
Fargo?

413
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,132
Oh, my...

414
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,500
I thought I was gonna die alone.

415
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:37,135
Fargo, why are you naked?

416
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:41,505
Funny story.

417
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:52,948
[Dramatic music plays]

418
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,524
[Imitating Schwarzenegger]
Your clothes.

419
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,692
Give them to me now.

420
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,762
Seriously?

421
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,163
Fine.

422
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,865
I was changing my costume
when the phone rang,

423
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,733
and then I was standing naked

424
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,670
in the middle of a road
surrounded by soldiers.

425
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,939
Completely traumatizing.

426
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,274
Not just for you.

427
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:26,743
So what's your story?

428
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:30,613
I was trying to reach Zane.

429
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,182
He asked me to marry him.

430
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,583
He what?

431
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:39,086
[Casually]
I mean... he what?

432
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:41,689
He proposed.

433
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:44,825
God, and I... I froze.

434
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,335
What's happening to us?

435
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,737
Based on the photos
from Founders' Day,

436
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:04,241
I'm, um, I'm pretty sure
we're in 1947.

437
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,711
I have no idea
how to get back.

438
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,384
What a bunch of hype
Robinson turned out to be.

439
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,986
Yeah, well, you know he's been
under a lot of pressure, so...

440
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:20,188
Oh, crap.

441
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,023
You know, I wouldn't count
him out just at the moment.

442
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:23,825
Uh, you're all set here.

443
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,727
Henry!

444
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,635
[Clears throat]

445
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,937
- You're here.
- Yeah.

446
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,573
Working.

447
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,208
Hiding in plain sight.

448
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,877
I mean, Eureka was always
progressive,

449
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,779
but nobody looks twice
at a black mechanic still.

450
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:49,183
Oh, man. Amazing, isn't it?

451
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,719
You do realize that you,
me, Allison, and Jo

452
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,254
are all struck here.

453
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:55,256
And Fargo, they caught him
streaking through the camp.

454
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,924
Of course they did.

455
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,759
They're holding him with Jo,
which is a shame

456
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:01,429
because he loves swing and
they're having a dance tonight.

457
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:03,898
Henry, why are you
not more concerned about this?

458
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,299
I'm very concerned
about this,

459
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,600
but we have the opportunity

460
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:08,302
to view Eureka
before its founding,

461
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,203
when a few visionaries
changed the future.

462
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,038
Well, until "a"
we destroy that future,

463
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,873
or "b" we get...
Shot for treason.

464
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,308
Okay, yes, there is a downside.

465
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,476
Okay, so...

466
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,577
How did we get here?

467
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,212
I was working under the hood
of that Chrysler

468
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,546
with that woman, um...

469
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:26,780
- Oh, Grace.
- Right.

470
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:28,014
And then my phone rang,

471
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,383
and I was under the hood
of that Jeep.

472
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,617
My phone rang too,
as did Allison's.

473
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,285
They're all fried.

474
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,718
So is mine,

475
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,553
possibly an electromagnetic pulse.

476
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
But whatever made this happen
would have to put out

477
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,723
a tremendous amount
of negative energy

478
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,826
in order to transfer matter
in a closed time-like curve.

479
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:47,227
Well, Tess was
saying something

480
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,096
about more solar flares
than they'd seen in decades,

481
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,298
putting out tons
of negative energy,

482
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:55,468
ironically right before
she broke up with me.

483
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,537
- It was, you know...
- Sorry, Jack.

484
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,771
Yeah.

485
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,408
But I think she was right.

486
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:03,809
That's not very supportive.

487
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,977
No, I mean about the solar flares.

488
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:07,012
They cycle every 11 years.

489
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,017
The last peak of this magnitude
was in the late 1940s.

490
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:12,952
Well, that's it.

491
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,753
I mean, that can't be
a coincidence, can it?

492
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:15,888
But still, it would take

493
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:18,090
a massive satellite antenna

494
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,458
to harness that kind of energy,

495
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,360
and satellites
haven't been invented yet.

496
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:24,361
You sure about that?

497
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:26,795
Yeah, last time I looked.

498
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,596
Look again.

499
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:36,498
Okay.

500
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:39,266
Um, we need to go in there.
Come on.

501
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,066
[Coughing]

502
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,967
Henry.

503
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,306
Hello again.

504
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:51,774
Oh, hello.

505
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:53,375
How's the patient?

506
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:55,743
Well, he's critical,

507
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,311
but I think he's gonna make it.

508
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,646
You know, I'm more of
a physicist than physician,

509
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,913
but from where I stood,

510
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,515
you pulled off a minor miracle.

511
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,983
Sometimes you just
have to improvise.

512
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,384
Improvise, I see.

513
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,089
So tell me, Allison,

514
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:12,626
how is it
somebody with your...

515
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:15,395
skills is, uh,
is still only a nurse?

516
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,701
So you think nurses
are less valuable than doctors?

517
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,369
No, ma'am.

518
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:26,271
Just less appreciated.

519
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,605
Look, we have
a woman in custody.

520
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,073
She needs her injuries treated,

521
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,609
and there's this naked kid,
needs some clothes.

522
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,911
I would be happy
to take a look.

523
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,851
At the injuries,
not the naked kid.

524
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,086
Glad you clarified that.

525
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,023
You keep searching.
I want him found.

526
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,724
Go!

527
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,559
Major Ryan.

528
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:56,062
I just found these hidden
in the supply room.

529
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,130
And this.

530
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:07,105
Oh, wow!

531
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,273
Well, do we know what
we're looking for?

532
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,545
I've seen this equation before.

533
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:17,146
Yeah, and I've seen this before.

534
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:18,413
This is the machine
that Kevin was fiddling with

535
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:19,448
on Main Street.

536
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:20,849
Oh, my God!

537
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,184
Is that good "Oh, my God"

538
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,285
or... we're screwed
"Oh, my God"?

539
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,386
Well, if that transmitter's
what I think it is,

540
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:28,787
Kevin may have created a link,

541
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:31,456
a network between us
and the machine.

542
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:33,591
Could he have used
our cell phones?

543
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:35,425
Well, they all rang
before we were transported.

544
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,693
They acted like beacons.

545
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,829
Henry, could he have
done this on purpose?

546
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm not sure,

547
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:44,332
but I know who built this.

548
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,334
Hey, sport.

549
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,535
You boys want to tell
me what you're doing

550
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,369
in Dr. Einstein's lab?

551
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:59,350
Okay, gents, start talking.

552
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,851
Make it snappy.

553
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,719
Okay.

554
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:05,221
You remember me,
Jack Carter.

555
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,689
First-time caller,
longtime fan.

556
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,861
Uh, Henry Deacon,
Dr. Grant.

557
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,896
Wait, um...

558
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:16,464
Trevor Grant?

559
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,032
Yeah, he prefers "Doctor."

560
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,567
He's kind of sensitive about it.

561
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:21,035
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

562
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,502
I mean, Einstein
got all the press,

563
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,137
but your work is critical
to how we understand

564
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,873
21st century
theoretical physics.

565
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:33,044
Did you say my work
and 21st century?

566
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,512
We're not from around here.
Well, not yet anyway.

567
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,515
Einstein proposed that
two points in time-space

568
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,751
could be bridged with
a lorentzian wormhole.

569
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,019
Well, you helped build

570
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,255
the Einstein-Grant bridge
to test the theory.

571
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:47,624
What, that?

572
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:49,959
We were working on it for years.

573
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:51,761
I've gotten close,
but I've never been able

574
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:52,995
to harness enough
of the sun's energy

575
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,462
to make it work.

576
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,361
Well, maybe energy
wasn't your problem.

577
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,095
Jack, you saw Kevin with this
same machine on Main Street.

578
00:25:58,162 --> 00:25:59,996
Maybe half an hour
before we arrived.

579
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,632
If he activated it in 2010

580
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,899
with the solar flares
we were seeing,

581
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,167
then maybe the machines
created a link

582
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:06,802
between the two times.

583
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,104
Until then, you were building
a bridge to nowhere.

584
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,705
We built the other side.

585
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:12,206
Do you seriously expect
me to believe

586
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:13,507
that you're from the future?

587
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:14,908
I think you already believe,

588
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,642
otherwise you would have
called the MPs by now.

589
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,815
That strange naked kid,

590
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,551
that terrifying woman,

591
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,585
they're with you.

592
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:26,852
Fargo.

593
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,120
That was Fargo
and Jo Lupo, yes.

594
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:29,455
And the nurse
with the unorthodox training

595
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,557
and the amazing gams.

596
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:32,791
- Oh, easy on the gams.
- Allison, yes?

597
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,492
Whatever.

598
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,394
You're all together.

599
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,462
Well, we're all
from the Eureka

600
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,696
that you help create.

601
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,498
Now we need your help
to get us back.

602
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,900
[Scoffs]
If I can.

603
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:46,702
The device is powered
by solar flares.

604

just after 11:00 P.M.

605
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,206
After that, bridge closed,

606
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:52,573
ain't nobody going nowhere.

[Loud knocking]

608
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,409
Dr. Grant, it's Major Ryan.
Open the door.

609
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:57,776
'Cause that's exactly
the kinda day I'm having.

610
00:26:57,844 --> 00:26:59,044
Hide.

611
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:01,280
I'm just on the phone with...

612
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:03,148
Professor Einstein.

613
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:06,151
[Knocking]

614
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,554
I thought I said conduct
the search quietly.

615
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:10,689
Dr. Grant,
we may have another spy.

616
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:15,526
I found these and this.

617
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,127
That means
we have two in custody

618
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,730
and another two on base.

619
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,665
Any idea who these belong to?

620
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,501
I'm narrowing the search.

621
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,770
Listen to me, Ryan,

622
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:31,607
I'm not entirely convinced
these people are spies.

623
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:32,675
- Really?
- Really.

624
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:33,976
I am.

625
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,478
I'm gonna find them,
prosecute them,

626
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:38,814
and anyone who attempts
to protect them.

627
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:49,356
[Swing music playing]

628
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:52,557
[Knocking]

629
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,192
Dr. Grant asked me
to check her injuries.

630
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:03,299
Can you open the cell, please?

631
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,666
You can treat her
through the bars.

632
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,566
She's surprisingly strong.

633
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:10,734
She'll need to disrobe.

634
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,068
Can we get some privacy,
please?

635
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,203
Sure.

636
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:18,171
I could use a smoke anyway.

637
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:23,776
Are you guys okay?

638
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:25,111
Do we look okay?

639
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:26,212
Well, I brought you some clothes.

640
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,113
Thank God!

641
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,548
Henry and Carter are here too.

642
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,017
They went into the concrete
bunker under the dish.

643
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,019
Here. We're gonna get
you guys outta here.

644
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,354
What's that?

645
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,488
Magnesium powder
from the fireworks

646
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:37,856
for the big swing dance
on base.

647
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,257
Really?
I love swing dancing.

648
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,259
Fargo, focus.

649
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:42,860
The powder should burn
hot enough to melt the lock.

650
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,628
What about the MP?

651
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:47,231
I'll distract him
for as long as I can.

652
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,203
All finished.

653
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,271
So going to the dance?

654
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,943
Okay, the lock is packed.

655
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,178
Try not to burn the place down.

656
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,285
That's it?
This is gonna take forever.

657
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,487
Can't we blow on it or something?

658
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,555
No, but if we spray it with water,

659
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,457
the hydrogen and oxygen
atoms will split

660
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,025
and intensify the heat.

661
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:23,292
Yeah, well, we're in jail.

662
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,393
Where are we supposed
to get water from?

663
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:26,895
Well, from us.

664
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:30,298
Tell me you are not suggesting
that I pee on the flame.

665
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:32,834
Fine, I'll do it.

666
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,735
But turn around.

667
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:36,670
I can't go if you're watching.

668
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,739
Hmm. My hero.

You hear that?

675
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:57,524
It must be the dance.

676
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:02,827
Well, the batteries are dead,

677
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:05,563
but the computer chips
are still good.

678
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:08,232
This technology is astonishing.

679
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,334
It's just astonishing.

680
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:12,970
We've been developing
prototype transistors

681
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,405
for satellite communications.

682
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:15,906
Where are they?

683
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:17,674
Yes, yes.

684
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:20,144
We may be able to adapt these
to the telephones.

685
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:21,612
Well, if we set them
to the same frequency

686
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,680
as the bridge device,
we can set up a network.

687
00:30:23,748 --> 00:30:25,649
A network.
Yes, exactly.

688
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:27,717
So did you really
set a satellite in orbit

689
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,152
a decade before
the world knew?

690
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:30,686
Uh, yes, we did.

691
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:32,454
It wasn't even that hard.

692
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:33,788
Wow, you rule.

693
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:35,123
But we still have a big problem.

00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,649
Just some minor scrapes
and bruises.

709

710
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:07,285
Just give her a few minutes.

for all your help.

Thought maybe you could
wear them at the dance.

905
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,392
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I'll see you at home?

906
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,293
- Yeah.
- Okay.

907
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:17,362
Don't forget this.

908
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,872
Kevin, honey?

909
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,108
Where are you?
Kevin!

910
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:34,043
Relax, mom, I'm right here.

911
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:38,280
Uh, nice hat.

912
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:42,050
Uh, I...

913
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:46,485
Um, where's your sister?

914
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:48,053
The "manny"
is giving her a bottle.

915
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:49,554
I'm going to Dre's house.

916
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:51,823
He asked me to play Xbox,
and I finished my homework.

917
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,558
So can I go?

918
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,892
What?

919
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,660
Xbox, Dre's house, me.

920
00:41:57,728 --> 00:41:59,629
I'll be home before dinner.

921
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:01,530
Thanks, mom.
Love you

922
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:15,008
S.A.R.A.H., are you there?

923
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,043
Yes, Sheriff.

924
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,315
S.A.R.A.H., is Zoe still at Harvard?

925
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:27,085
Of course she is, Jack.
Where else would she be?

926
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:29,688
Look at you, handsome.

927
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,991
[Giggles]
Hi!

928
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,396
I thought you'd never get here.

929
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:40,231
Yeah, me neither.

930
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:41,966
Can I get you a drink?

931
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:44,069
Yes, please.

932
00:42:57,683 --> 00:42:59,184
Pardon me.

933
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:01,185
Hi, wow, nice clothes.
Vintage?

934
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:02,786
Yeah, you might say that.

935
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:04,121
I wonder if you
could help me out.

936
00:43:04,688 --> 00:43:06,823
I'm looking for Allison Blake.
