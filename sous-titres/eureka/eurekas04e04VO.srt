00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:03,000
I got offered early admission

00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:06,142
to an undergrad preMed
program at Harvard.

Kevin, honey? Where are you?

00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,459
Relax, mom. I'm right here.

7
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:15,770
He's different.

00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,362
He doesn't have autism.

I'm running G.D.?

00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:25,340
- Yes, I will marry you.
- Me marry you?

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,280
In what universe?

13
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:28,755
So Zane un-proposed?

In this reality,
nothing's ever even happened.

15
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:33,638
He's that snarky jerk I first met.

16

How's deputy Andy?

17
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:39,021
Fargo says he needs to be
re-skinned and reprogrammed.

You and Grace.

23
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,187

She asked but there's
the problem of the hotel room.

27
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:00,510
Yeah, married life
gets complicated like that.

- You have a great trip.
- Thanks.

Yeah.

00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:32,233
Yeah, a little nervous.

43

I'm sorry I'm gonna miss
your big launch today, Kev.

Stop it. Your design is brilliant.

00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,781
Did you weld the pre-igniter
in the tail service mast?

47

No, mom, I decided to use
duct tape and bubble gum.

he gets excited about,

54
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,773
but his test burns
have been a little iffy.

55

I wish I could do more to help him.

56

Oh, that's what you're
afraid of with Zoe.

Never crossed my mind.

Sure, Pilar, what is it?

It is the latest in metamaterial cloaking.

Okay, say...

80

You want your shirt
to match this napkin.

to match a napkin?

Have you re-tuned the E.M. field?

93
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,316
Per your orders, sir,

94
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,185
our rocket plumes
will be undetectable.

95
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,555
Good. I don't wanna spook
the North Koreans.

96
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,857
Last year they mistook
your little soapbox derby

97

106
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,733
I thought everyone needed
to decompress a little.

to operate the sky cruiser

Wouldn't want to disobey
you or the enforcer.

Donovan to operate

147
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,623
Mr. Donovan's the only person
who can actually fly it.

148
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,491
And I did design the thing.

170
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,953
but that was a very impressive launch.

171
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,388
Glad you enjoyed it, General.

172
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,357
As you can see, we have
everything under control.

- What?

174
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,126

181
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,456
It was awesome.

Do you realize what you've done?

185
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,198
You destroyed the prototype.

186
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,067
Prototype, as in only one.

187
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,135
It musta malfunctioned.

188

Malfunctioned.

189
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,272
You're inebriated.

195
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:56,319
Hey, I am not drunk.

196
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,322
I was flying back to G.D.

and then I went...

200
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,030
And came... Came down.

to federal prison.

205
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,111
No, I need to complete
a formal investigation.

206
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,979
Of what?

207
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,413
He was hot-rodding under the influence,

208
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,181
and he just obliterated

209
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,449
a multimillion dollar project.

210
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:24,150
But he said he wasn't drinking,

211
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,852
right, Zane?

212
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,288
Zane!

213
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:30,290
Sorry, I spaced out there.
What?

214
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:36,526
Lupo, I'm surprised at you.

215
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:39,830
How are you gonna handle this?

216
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,933
Fargo, everyone, even Zane,

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,735
is entitled to due process.

218
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:52,174

out what happened here.

Uh, hi.

Sorry, I'm looking for Zoe Carter's room.

Dad?

227
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:37,771
Surprise.

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,139
Oh, my God, hi.

229
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,973
Hey.

230
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,373
Is everything okay?

231
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,408
Yeah.

232
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,746
Yeah, everything's great.

- Yeah.

235
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,588
I mean, I can get used to it.

236
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:55,089
[Chuckles] Oh.

237
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:57,424
So what are you doing here?

238
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,492
I was gonna ask him the same question.

239
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
Oh, this is my partner,

240
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,328

Hey, Mr. Carter.

Okay.
[laughs]

246
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,904
We were just experimenting.

247
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,306

- Right.

248
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,474

in behavioral psych.

Oh...

254
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,483
Well, let you two catch up.

00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,619
I'll, see you at the Baker house tonight?

256
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:32,953
Uh...

257
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,189
Oh, no, no, if you have plans,

258
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,823
by all means, no, go on.

259
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:38,791
No, it's fine. There'll be other parties

260
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,593
when I'm not at the library studying.

261
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,494
Just tell everyone hi for me.

262

here's the care package

Oh, right, metamaterial cloaking.

273
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,215
Cool.

274
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:11,650
Yeah.

275
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:14,320
You hungry?

276
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:16,688
I'm starving.

277
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,922
Great, lead me to the best
burger joint in Cambridge.

278
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,024
Okay.

[Spraying sound,

280
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,302
And we have ourselves a race!

281
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,004
Okay, people, get your wallets out.

282
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,139
No stingy mindys.
Come on, the game is afoot.

Okay, I've got you.

Ow! Why'd you do that?

290
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:59,021
Well, just hold still.
I have a race to get to.

291
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,322
You're pretty.

292
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:01,990
Okay, he's obviously on something.

293
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:06,394
Okay, Zane's anti-anything
that can mess with his brain.

294
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,028
This Zane?

295
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,863
Yo, Lupo, check the engines.

296
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:13,131
One of those crazy-assed birds
musta gotten sucked in.

297
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:19,403
Jo, I know that dealing
with him in this reality

298
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:20,638
has been tough on you,

299
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,140
but you might be letting

300
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,608
your feelings for the Zane you knew

301
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:26,876
affect your judgment.

302
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,578
This room is spinny!

303
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,915
I knew a part of him
that was good and honest.

304
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,251
I have to believe that it's still there.

305
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,486
Please,

306
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:38,888
can you just run the tests again?

307
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,422
See if you find anything.

308
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,957
Okay.

309
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:50,030
Well, the engine is sound.

310
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:52,899
No bird strike.

311
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,334
But I'll keep looking.

312
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,472
If it's not this, it'll be
some other fiasco with Zane.

313
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,573
He's trouble.

314
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,108
I just want to be sure.

315
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,909
Well, that's odd.

316
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,278
I mean, that's close to impossible.

The fuel tank?

318
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,650
That's a gas tank?

319
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,251
Yeah, it holds enough for
ten hours of continuous flight.

320
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,655
- Is it damaged?
- No, it's empty.

321

The genius bad boy ran out of gas?

322
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:18,460
That doesn't make any sense,

323
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,430
and it also doesn't explain
why he was blitzed.

324
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,698
Don't want an explanation.

325
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,699
I want him gone.
Make it happen.

00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,533

- Andy, it's Jo.

I need a favor.

333
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,644
At your service, miss Lupo.

334
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:45,978
Can you go up to the launch site

335
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,013
and see if you can find any crows.

336
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:49,848
They may be acting drunk.

337
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,250

You're certainly Mr. Nostalgia today.

340

Yeah, well, you know,
seeing you here at college,

341
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,891
it brings back memories
that we share.

342
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,559
- Okay.
- It's sort of a nice thing.

343
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:07,529
- Hey, Zoe.
- Hi.

344
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,363
That's another lab partner?

345

Dad, they're just friends.

346
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,967
Ah, you still friends with Lucas?

347
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:16,469
Lucas? Yeah, he's great.

348
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,837
But, you know,
he's been swamped at M.I.T.

349
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,472
Oh. How's your course load?

350
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,575
I mean, are you okay?
You still want to be a doctor?

351
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:25,512
Yes. Lots of questions.

352
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,349
Sorry.

353
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,284
I just want to make sure you're okay.

354

You know, and that your...

00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:37,656
That your plans for the future are secure.

356
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:39,157
Oh, my God.

357
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:41,059
What... Are you dying?

358
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm not dying.

359

Well, all the reconnecting
and the reminiscing

Mabel, what did you do?
Where is she?

366
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,214
Here, kitty.

367
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:10,116
[Cat growls]

[Distant growling]

369
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,787
That isn't good.

370
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,127
Mmm.

371
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,468
Hey.

372
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,903
You sound sober.

373
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,339
I've been sober. I wasn't drinking.

374
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,773
But whatever messed
with my head just went away.

375
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,208
[Cell phone rings]

376
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:42,276
- Lupo.
- Yo, it's Ramsey.

377
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,311
Somebody's been messing around
in my lab.

378
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,380
Could you, like, come and check it?

379
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:48,681
Yeah, as soon as I can.
[phone beeps]

380
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:51,183
Gotta go.
Andy, did you find anything?

381
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,751
Negative on the drunken crows,

382
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,219
but I did find a dead one.

383
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,320
Bag it and bring it back to G.D.

384
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,588
I want it autopsied.

385
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:59,457
I can save you time there.
Hold please.

386
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,025
Well, that's curious.

387
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,727
This corvus brachyrhynchos
has recently detached retinas.

388
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,328
It went blind before it died.

389
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:06,529
Can you tell why?

390
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,631
Inconclusive. Old age maybe.

391
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,666
Possibly environmental.

392
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,034
Andy, take a really good look around

393
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,602
and just see if you
can find anything unusual

394
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,903
and report back to me.

395
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,638
Will do.

396
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,608
We may be onto something.

397
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,309
There's got to be a reason
you and those crows

398
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:24,644
dropped out of the sky.

399
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,246
I don't get it.

400
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,682
You love busting me.
You've busted me tons of times.

401
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,618
Why do you give a crap now?

402
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,021
Because you don't have to be that guy.

403
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,689
And this time they're sending
your sorry ass back to prison.

404
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,797
Lupo...

405
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,432
You're wasting your time.

406
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,604
Fine.

407
00:17:57,672 --> 00:17:59,606
Then take off.

408
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,774
I won't stop you.

409
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:10,311
Or you can stay
and fight to clear your name.

410
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,983
It's your choice.

411
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,448
Rust.

412
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,150
I'd say that qualifies as unusual.

413
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:00,559
Hmm, I seem to be conflagrating.

414
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,460
Oh, dear.

415
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:08,636
So check it,

416
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,137
somebody stole my TAP.

417
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,805
That stuff you wanna use up on Mars.

418
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:14,040
That stuff is like gold, man.

419
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,608
It takes forever to produce,

420
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,009
and someone came in here
this morning

421
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,278
and helped themselves
to 522 milliliters of it.

422
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:21,646
Well, all it does is make air, right?

423
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:23,248
Really?

424
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,949
That hurts me, man.

425
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:28,085
It turns into self-propagating oxygen,

426
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,953
if it's activated.

427
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,222
And then you gotta be careful
not to inhale it.

428
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,160
Oh, that is one nasty high.

429
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:40,031
You mean people can use it
recreationally?

430
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:41,365
Stupid people.

431
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,966
Yeah, you can huff it like nitrous

432
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,600
if you're not gonna miss the brain cells.

433
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,335
Do you think those kids took it?

434
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:49,336
What kids?

435
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,139
Those meddling kids.

436
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:53,406
I'm working with a bunch of interns

437
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,808
from the Tesla school.

438
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:58,878
No, I think I have an idea who took it.

439
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:00,212
You've reached deputy Andy.

440
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,014
Please leave a message
after I make this tone.

441
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,148
Beep.

442
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,716
Andy, Jo. Where are you? Call me.

443
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:07,051
Jo, you were right.
I found something.

444
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,286
Zane's blood tests indicate hyperoxia.

445
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:11,221
He has an excess of oxygen
in his system.

446
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,421
Oxygen?

447
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:13,855
Yeah, I don't know how
he was exposed.

448
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,324
Most likely it's what caused
his disorientation.

449
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:17,959
- Right.
- Jo, Zane's lucky.

450
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,061
Higher levels can lead
to cell damage,

451
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:21,962
seizures, retinal detachment.

452
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,230
Blindness.

453
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:24,997
I need to do a more thorough examination.

454
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,165
No.

455
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,234
I mean, it really isn't necessary.

456
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:31,636
He's back to his old self.
I gotta go.

457
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:33,204
I have to tell you something.

458
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,571
Later.

459
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,173
Go get Zane, preferably in shackles.

460
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,875
- I can't do that.
- Jo, we've been through...

461
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,309
Zane isn't here.

462
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:40,777
What do you mean he's not...

463
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,879
You've made the arrangements
to transfer Donovan?

464
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:45,081
Yes, absolutely,

465
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,950
but he's still being debriefed by my team.

466
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,286
So why don't you and I
grab a mochachino?

467
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:52,388
Good.

468
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,632
Okay, it's intermission now,

469
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:06,035
as the rockets move around
the dark side of the Moon.

470
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,403
So tell me, Kevin,
as one scientist to another,

471
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,370
what was your inspiration?

472
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,872
Actually, it was my skateboard.

473
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,273
Well, you see I needed
to catch more air off the ramp,

474
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,873
so I came up with
a hydrogen-peroxide booster.

475
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,040
But I'm working on
an even better launch

476
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,506
for next year's race with this,

477
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,642
super-compressed hydrogen balloons.

478
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,010
They're gonna launch
my rocket even higher

479
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:25,644
into the atmosphere.

480
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,012
That's pretty ingenious, pal.

481
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,480
Thanks.

482
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:29,948
So you only used hydrogen-peroxide

483
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,349
to fuel this rocket?

484
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,285
Well, different mixtures
for different stages.

485
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:35,319
Here, check it out.

486
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,623
Here, Mabel.

487
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:42,891
Here, girl.

488
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,260
Pilar, just tell me how this stuff works.

489
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:46,794
Duh, how do you think?

490
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:49,029
It's a plasmonic spray,
causing negative refraction.

491
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:51,131
Great, the spray diverts light waves,

492
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:52,498
so we won't see Mabel.

493
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,266
We'll just see what she's in front of.

494
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,600
Well, that narrows it down.

495
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:57,201
Pilar, how long does it last?

496
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,502
I don't know.

497
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,936
It's designed to set on fabric.

498
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,538
It's not gonna stabilize
on a live animal's fur.

499
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,172
So in other words,
she'll just keep changing.

500
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,373
I don't know.

501
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,575
Thanks, Pilar, super helpful.

502
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:07,843
Bye.

503
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,411
That cat was 80% of my final grade.

504
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,146
Ahh!

505
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:12,847
There's something in there.

506
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,415
Sorry.

507
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,483
Found her.

508
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:26,058
Reacquiring signal.

509
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:27,861
And signal reacquired,

510
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:29,629
and we are back
from the dark side

511
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,997
with Kevin Blake
still leading the way home.

512
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:33,165
I'm number one!

513
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:36,834
[Cheers and applause]

514
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,736
Allison, can I have a word
with you for a minute?

515
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:42,772
Yeah, sure.

516
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I don't know
how to tell you this, Allison.

517
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:49,178
It's possible Kevin may
have had an unfair advantage.

518
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,013
What? What are you saying?

519
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,682
I'm saying Kevin's a brilliant kid,

520
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,217
but he may have felt pressured
into boosting his propellant

521
00:22:57,284 --> 00:23:00,119
with something outside
the race parameters.

522
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,954
Like what?

523
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,489
Well, I don't know.

524
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:04,924
But the formula he claims he used

525
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,125
wouldn't result in a flare
with that color.

526
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,194
I'm so sorry,

527
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,961
but I thought you should know.

528
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,275
Andy, you're a robot.

529
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,776
How can you be unavailable?

530
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,877
I need you to help me find...

531
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,845
Zane.

532
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,313
What changed your mind?

533
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,847
I don't know.

534
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,349
Nobody's ever stuck their neck
out for me before.

535
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,451
Did you steal Dr. Ramsey's tap fluid?

536
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,688
What are you talking about?

537
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,190
Well, if you didn't take it,

538
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,958
then there's gotta be more to this.

539
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,526
I'm going up to the crash site
to find Andy

540
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:52,261
and see if I can figure this out.

541
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,397
You wanna come with?

542
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,567
You'd be aiding an escaped prisoner.

543
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,002
[Chuckles]

544
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,637
I'll arrest myself later.

545
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:07,107
Why'd you let me go?

546
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:09,109
Maybe I give you too much credit,

547
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,244
but I think under the snarky posturing

548
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:12,879
there really is a decent guy.

549
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,881
The real me sounds boring.

550
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:16,215
[Chuckles]

551
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:17,950
Well, you're too irritating to be boring.

552
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,952
Funny.

553
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,154
You're always busting my ass.

554
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:26,824
Every once in a while
I get this feeling about you.

555
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:29,192
What kind of feeling?

556
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,228
Um...

557
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,329
Dizzy.

558
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,466
Me... Me too.

559
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,073
I wouldn't start 'er.

560
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,708
One spark and she could blow.

561
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:04,276
What happened?

562
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:06,445
The area's a tad combustible.

563
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:07,746
You hang tight.

564
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:09,046
I'll have you back at G.D. in a jiff.

565
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,326
We're so lucky you found us, Andy.

566
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:27,361
I'm sorry you burst into flames.

567
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:29,663
Fortunately, I managed
to extinguish myself.

568
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,832
The curious thing is Andy can't burn.

569
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,567
I assure you, I ignited, sir.

570
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,269
And before my sensors melted,

571
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,270
they detected an unusually
high level of oxygen.

572
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,439
Inhale.
[breathes deeply]

573
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,106
Not to mention, the steel gantries

574
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,474
on the launch site had rusted.

575
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,309
That could be the result
of rapid oxidation.

576
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,110
How does that happen?

577
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,145
Well, normally
the atmosphere concentration

578
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,547
of oxygen is 21%.

579
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:53,416
But if there's too much oxygen,

580
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:56,785
then material that
is usually not flammable,

581
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:58,219
like Andy,

582
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,022
catches fire very easily.

583
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,024
Just takes a spark.

584
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,293
Like from my cell phone.

585
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,760
So Zane got loopy and crashed

586
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,962
because there was too much
oxygen at the launch site?

587
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,297
Yeah, which would
probably also explain

588
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:12,065
why he burnt up so much fuel
so quickly.

589
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:14,768
Well, if it was the oxygen,
then I'm off the hook.

590
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:16,002
We still don't know why

591
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:16,969
there's such a high concentration.

592
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,570
Henry, Dr. Ramsey said

593
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:20,405
that his tap fluid is missing.

594
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:23,207
He said that it could become
self-propagating.

595
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,541
That's a problem.

596
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,109
It could be a big one.

597
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:27,710
Tap fluid is very stable.

598
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,812
The electromagnetic wavelength
necessary to activate it

599
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,514
is precise.

600
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,849
But if it has been activated somehow,

601
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:36,085
then everything around Eureka
will become as explosive

602
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:38,754
as Andy.

603
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,655
Can you see her?

604
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:43,257
Nope, I see tile.

605
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,626
[Cat meows, hisses]

606
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:46,793
Ah, it's her!

607
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:49,595
[Groans]

608
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,429
Oh, hey.

609
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,798
Should you be in here?

610
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,399
Dad, these are co-ed bathrooms.

611
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,467
[Cat meows]
Is Mabel with you?

612
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:01,170
No, she is in my room.

613
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:02,905
You look cold.

614
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:04,606
You should put a shirt on.

615
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:08,376
Okay, will see you later.

616
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,614
You seriously like that guy?

617
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,983
Enough of the comments.
You shouldn't even...

618
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,018
What?

619
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,053
Be here.

620
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:24,823
You show up,
you make a mess of my project,

621
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,624
and now I'm stuck in a bathroom

622
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,759
when I should be out with my friends.

623
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,661
Well, it's just we haven't
seen each other in so long.

624
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,429
Then call first.

625
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:33,963
I'm not a little girl anymore.

626
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:36,032
I have my own life.

627
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:42,036
Oh.

628
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:44,272
Well, you're right.

629
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:45,806
You...

630
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,207
Yeah, you should go to the party.

631
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:48,975
Don't give me a guilt trip now.

632
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,243
No, no guilt trip, I promise.

633
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:52,546
You... I'll take care of the cat.

634
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,816
No, I... I just tried...

635
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:02,921
[Exhales deeply]

636
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,260
Well, that went well.

637
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:11,496
The greatest concentration of oxygen

638
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:13,964
is up here within the highest
point of our E.M. field

639
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:15,365
spreading lower and lower,

640
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,532
first reaching the launch site,

641
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,999
then lower down the mountain

642
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:20,235
until eventually it will hit the town.

643
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:22,303
Then stop it from expanding.

644
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,271
Yeah, turn off the E.M. field
and air it all out.

645
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,073
Whoa, man, what are you smoking?

646
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,641
You can't just release it.

647
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:30,343
My tap's designed to work
on a planetary scale.

648
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,679
It'll just keep leeching oxygen
from the environment.

649
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:34,881
Dr. Ramsey, what would possess you

650
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:36,916
to create something
so potentially catastrophic?

651
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:38,584
Man, don't blame the tap.

652
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,186
Okay, it's harmless on Earth.

653
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,888
To be activated, it would
have to be irradiated somehow

654
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,522
with a very specific wavelength.

655
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,325
Until then, harmless!

656
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,993
The first place there was
trouble was at the launch site.

657
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,131
Guys, that tap fluid
would make awesome rocket fuel.

658
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,332
Oh, boy.

659
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,034
When we adjusted the E.M. field,

660
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,368
we must have hit just the right...

661
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,337
Or wrong frequency to activate the tap.

662
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,705
I love it. It's your fault.

663
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:04,407
Zane.

664
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:05,808
The question is:

665
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,577
Who used it to boost their rocket?

666
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,283
I said I didn't use it.

667
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,284
Kevin, it's okay.
There's no way you coulda known

668
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,886
the E.M. field was retuned.

669
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:19,322
But now this crazy amount
of oxygen is building up,

670
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,656
and we need to know
exactly what you did.

671
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,024
What's going on here?

672
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,393
They think I used
Dr. Ramsey's tap fluid

673
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,594
to boost my rocket, but I didn't, mom.

674
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,595
I swear, I didn't.

675
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:27,796
I know you didn't, Kevin.

676
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:30,130
How can you be so sure?

677
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:32,431
Because I did.

678
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,598
What?

679
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,432
Honey, you had put so much
effort into your rocket,

680
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,865
and your test burns weren't going well.

681
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:41,599
So you cheated?

682
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,068
It was just so important to you.

683
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:46,136
So? This is my thing, ma.

684
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,571
You been acting
like a freak for weeks,

685
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:49,505
on me all the time about
everything, and now this?

686
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:51,140
Honey, I just didn't want
you to be disappointed.

687
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,409
I'd rather lose the race
than win it like this.

688
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:55,612
And you should know that about me.

689
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,547
Kev...

690
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:59,316
Hey, Vin, take my name out of the race

691
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,151
and put my mom's in.

692
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,253
Allison, I know you meant well,

693
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,553
and you couldn't have known

694
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,319
that we re-tuned the E.M. shield.

695
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:10,086
But there's a cloud of
self-propagating oxygen

696
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:12,388
spreading toward town

697
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,256
and a bunch of rockets
on their way home.

698
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:16,358
Those engines are burning
until they hit the ground.

699
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:18,794
So if we don't figure out
a way to stop them,

700
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,063
Eureka's gonna be toast.

701
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,465
Code orange.

702
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,500
All personnel report
to secure sectors three, six...

703
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,869
Should I initiate evacuation
protocols in town, sir?

704
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:41,871
No, it's safer if people
don't move around,

705
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:43,338
but I want a complete power down

706
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,673
of any potential ignition
sources outside of G.D.

707
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:47,808
That means no cars, no computers,

708
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,976
and you!

709
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:51,010
No wool sweaters!

710
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,251
Oh, no.

711
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,153
What...

712
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:19,102
[Chuckles]
It washes out.

713
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,004
It... Oh.

714
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:23,472
[Cat meows]

715
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,875
Yeah, hear that, Mabel?

716
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,777
Someone's gonna get wet.

717
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,980
It washes off.

718
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:36,648
You still have to catch her.

719
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,148
True.

720
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:39,815
Cheddar cheese maize kernels,

721
00:31:39,883 --> 00:31:41,082
irresistible.

722
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,988
You look so grown-up.

723
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,925
Isn't there a frat party
you should be at or...

724
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,192
And miss this?

725
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,426
Pssh, not a chance.

You want to blow them all up?

735
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:24,487
By activating the rockets'
self-destruct mechanism,

736
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:26,088
we eliminate the immediate threat.

737
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:27,956
That still leaves us
with too much oxygen.

738
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:29,792
We know the oxygen is the problem,

739

There's not enough delta-v
left for a return trajectory.

If we can't stop the rocket,

then let's focus on reducing
the oxygen level.

We can neutralize the problem.

I feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

909
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:27,757
Zoe, this is one Eureka situation

910
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:29,458
that I can't tell you about,

911
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:32,828
but you don't have to worry.

912
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:34,028
Okay.

913
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:36,497
But if you ever want to talk,

914
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:38,298
you know where to find me.

915
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:40,233
Yeah.

916
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,943
I like your hair.

917
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:54,046
Thank you.

918
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,929
Oh, don't tell me Andy arrested you.

919
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:16,564
Welcome back.

920
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:17,999
Evening.

921
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:21,335
Andy's my hero.

922
00:42:22,437 --> 00:42:23,670
He's off being repaired

923
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:25,638
and re-skinned.

924
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:28,140
So you just miss the office then?

925
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:30,974
I miss my house.

926
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:35,242
Larry's rocket went boom.

927
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,944
No home, no Zane.

928
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:41,047
Everything pretty much sucks.

929
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:44,583
Come on.

930
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:46,251
Get your stuff.

931
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,621
With Zoe gone, S.A.R.A.H.
could use the company.

932
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:54,825
And, so could I.

933
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:56,893
Suppose I could tolerate you.

934
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,995
Oh, don't get excited.
It's not permanent.

935
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:06,200
Thanks, Carter.

936
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:09,900
Let's go home.

937
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
