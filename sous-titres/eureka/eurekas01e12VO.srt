00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,200
Previously on Eureka

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,900
Walter was our top quantum physicist.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,500
Walter created some sort of tachyon accelerator,
then time, as we know it,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,300
ceases to exist.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,500
Stark covered me a position at GD.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
You'll have 15 seconds to view the artifact.
Believe it or not, it's terrestrial in origin.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,200
Carl, please. I have to know. What is it ?

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
One day you will know. Will you be ready ?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
All rover/computer links are up and running.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
Mark the time and date.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,400
9:27 AM. October 3, 2006.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's take her for a test drive.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
Allison Blake.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
Jack Carter, what's up ?

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,700
You had my blood pressure.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,400
It's the suit isn't it ?

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Nah. It's Nathan Stark, he's trying to
dodge jury duty by climbing scientific community.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,300
That's sounds like Nathan.
He's down at section 5 with Kim overseeing some big test.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, what kind of test ?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,100
Do you care ?

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
Not really, just come in.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Ready when you are.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,200
Open the door.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
We are at marginal proximity now.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,300
No change in core temperature or anbium admissions.

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
Let's proceed.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Igniting photon drill.

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,500
Extreme proximity now.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,600
Still no reaction from the artifact.

30
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,900
Moment of truth.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,200
What was that ?

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,700
I don't know.

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
What's happening in there ?

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know. Systems are off-line.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Get 'em back on-line !

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
I'm trying.

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh my God.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,200
Good morning, Jack.

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,800
Morning S.A.R.A.H.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
It's 7 a.m.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,500
Ten more minutes.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
You said that ten minutes ago and ten minutes before that.

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,300
It's time to get up. Today is a big day.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Every day is a big day, Just... I need ten minutes to face it.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Sounds like someone doesn't want to face the reality.

49
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm happy with my reality. Just not ready for it to change.

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Well... that's a little late for that, don't you think ?

I like things the way they are.

55
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,266
That's all
I'm saying.

56
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,568
Taking a little trip
down denial, are we ?

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,650
Look who's talking,

58
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,551
Little Miss "I don't think
Kevin should play football."

59
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,350
That was not denial.
That was responsible parenting.

60
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:52,251
It was touch football,
intramural, and I was the coach.

61
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,251
Shut up.
Just hand me my robe.

62
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:03,618
You know, at my house,
I had a real shower,

63
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,317
not this sonic bombardment
nothingness.

64
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,251
I miss the feel of actual
wet water.

65
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:09,683
Yeah, but your house won't
spiral into depression

66
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:10,618
if you move out.

67
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,884
True.

68
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,783
<i>(S.A.R.A.H.)
I heard that Jack.</i>

69
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,017
Oh, my God !

70
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,850
What ?

71
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,384
You're huge !

72
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,850
That's nice.
Very supportive.

73
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:24,518
No, I'm just--
You know, for--

74
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,351
Might have to build a new wing
on the bunker.

75
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,884
Do twins run in your family ?

76
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,584
Does male pattern baldness
run in yours ?

77
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:32,050
Well-played.

78
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:35,117
Hey, seriously.

79
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,650
Seriously,

80
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:42,050
you've never,
ever looked more beautiful.

81
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,417
You barely saved yourself
with that one.

82
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,484
Morning.

83
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,251
S.A.R.A.H., wheat grass,
please.

84
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,950
Hey, does my hair look, um--

85
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,484
Never mind.

86
00:05:57,518 --> 00:06:00,917
Dad, I really think you should
cut down on your caffeine.

87
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,783
I'll stop drinking caffeine
when you stop drinking the lawn.

88
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,551
So you ready for
your big day ?

89
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,184
No.

90
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,884
You ?

91
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:19,251
Um, no.
Not even a little.

92
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:21,518
So have you decided
on the ultrasound yet ?

93
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,783
Yeah.

94
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,351
And I wanna be surprised.

95
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,384
It makes life
a little more interesting.

96
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,618
Well, life is plenty interesting
around here.

97
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,618
I just think
you're in denial.

98
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,217
Yeah,
that's what Allie said.

99
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,884
Great minds.

100
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,050
Yeah.

101
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:42,284
Yes, they are.

102
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,251
Hey, Zo.

103
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:48,950
You're gonna be great.

104
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:52,151
Thanks.

105
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:54,783
So are you.

106
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:05,117
Thank you to our distinguished
salutatorian.

107
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,251
And now it gives me
great pleasure

108
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:12,584
to present the valedictorian
for the class of 2010.

109
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:14,683
Zoe Carter.

110
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,683
You know,
nobody is as surprised as I am

111
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:29,117
to see me standing here today,
except maybe my father.

112
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,050
<i>When I first came to Eureka
four years ago,</i>

113
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,084
I was in the back
of a police car.

114
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,584
And luckily for me,
my father was driving.

115
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:37,984
<i>And being a man, he refused
to stop and ask for directions,</i>

116
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:40,384
<i>or we have actually reached
our destination.</i>

117
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:45,683
When I first came to Eureka,
I was on my way home.

118
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,284
And the irony is
by crashing here,

119
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,084
I found one.

120
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:52,683
<i>Thank you
for having faith in me.</i>

121
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:56,817
Thank you for making me and
my dad a part of your family.

122
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,850
I promise to do
my share of the chores.

123
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:02,551
And I'll try not to blow up
the world if you don't.

124
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,351
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

125
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:13,017
may I present to you
the class of 2010 !

126
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:32,351
So how'd I do ?

127
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:35,050
Not bad for
a nutty professor.

128
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:36,783
I'm sorry I have
to miss the reception.

129
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,217
But I have to get back
to the lab.

130
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,518
You're just afraid that
your boss is gonna find out

131
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:40,683
you've been slacking off.

132
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:42,117
No, I am not.

133
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,284
I have him wrapped around
my little finger.

134
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:44,251
Is that right ?

135
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:50,351
See ya later.
Love you.

136
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:51,518
Zoe,
congratulations.

137
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:53,750
Thank you.

138
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:56,884
I've gotta get back
to the station.

139
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,151
Someone needs
to be on duty.

140
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:01,917
I'm sorry your mother
couldn't be here.

141
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,884
Thank you for coming.

142
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,683
You're coming to the party,
right ?

143
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,384
With bells on.

144
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,050
Not just bells, right ?

145
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,484
Never know.

146
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,310
 ? ? ?

147
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,351
Nice speech, sis.

148
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,783
All my coaching paid off.

149
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,850
Yeah, right.

150
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:25,151
Congrats.
Thank you.

151
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,717
I'm gonna head over
with Wendy and Pilar.

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,284
So I'll meet you there.

153
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,984
All right.
Bye.
Bye.

154
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,950
Congratulations.
Here, babe.

155
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,584
Thank you.

156
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,950
The college thing
is gonna be easier, right ?

157
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:42,417
No, just more expensive.

158
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,184
Yeah.

159
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:49,518
I know this isn't
environmentally correct,

160
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:52,217
but I really miss
my old jeep.

161
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,084
Oh, well, next time
you won't ignore

162
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,551
the "Tornado Crossing" sign.

163
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:01,683
You feel that ?

164
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:04,050
Yeah.
Earthquake ?

165
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,151
No, I don't think so.

166
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,850
Jack Carter.
Allison Carter.

167
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,417
It's Jo.
Fargo.

168
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:16,384
Who's lab ?
Section five ?

169
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,217
Okay, yeah.
Be right there.
We're on our way.

170
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,117
One day.
Is that too much to ask ?

171
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,184
There's always tomorrow.

172
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,950
Rad sensors picked up a surge
of exotic particles.

173
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:30,584
And thermal scans
are detecting

174
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,717
something
in the containment area

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,817
that wasn't there before.

176
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,050
What kinda something ?
We're not sure.

177
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,417
It's organic,

178
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:36,950
but the visuals haven't
come back on-line.

179
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,484
Okay.
Is anyone else in there ?

180
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,017
I don't know.
You're not sure ?

181
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,117
No.

182
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,417
Jack,
maybe you should wait.

183
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,551
I can't.

184
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,650
There could be somebody
in there.

185
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:46,451
Be careful.

186
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:48,451
Hard to be carefuler.

187
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:49,551
What ?

188
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:52,317
I know
it's not a word.

189
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,217
I don't like this.

190
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,817
What's the matter, Jo ?

191
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,117
<i>Scared of a little
trans-dimensional radiation ?</i>

192
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,417
Yeah.

193
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,750
You guys take the computers.

194
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,417
Spencer, come with me.

195
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,518
Go and take the hallway.

196
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:53,650
Jo ?

197
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,618
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,501
He's waiting for us.

199
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,834
What did he say ?

200
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,401
Well, we found a body fused
into a wall

201
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,900
of a top secret area
of Section Five.

202
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,933
He was concerned.

203
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,933
Is that sarcasm,
Agent Carter ?

204
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,768
Perhaps,
Sheriff Carter.

205
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,067
Isn't this Carter/Carter thing
getting just a little old ?

206
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,801
No.
Not yet.

207
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,667
<i>(Carter)
Hello, Dr. Deacon.</i>

208
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,933
Hello.

209
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:37,067
I'm sorry I had to pull you out
of Zoe's party.

210
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,734
But were we able
to identify the body ?

211
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,734
That's not gonna be
so easy.

212
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:45,100
<i>(Carter)
The weird part--
or weirder part--</i>

213
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:48,300
<i>is that the lab was empty
and then the body was detected.</i>

214
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,501
Whoever this is,

215
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,701
they seemed to have
just appeared.

216
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,200
All right, you two.

217
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,768
Let's see if we can determine
from where.

218
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:15,200
(Fargo)
Dr. Deacon, are you okay ?

219
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:16,701
Fine.

220
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,067
Scalpel.

221
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:38,801
Bones are brittle
to the touch.

222
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,534
Interior chest cavity shows
massive tissue damage.

223
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,200
Organs are all but
disintegrated.

224
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:47,434
<i>Let's get a tissue sample.</i>

225
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm craving red meat.

226
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,100
That's just wrong.

227
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,267
Beef jerky.

228
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,734
Okay, seriously.

229
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,567
I think I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

230
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,234
Try to concentrate
in here.

231
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,734
<i>Doesn't look very encouraging.</i>

232
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,334
What'd you find ?

233
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:20,200
She's been exposed to
an intense dose of radiation.

234
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,434
What kind of radiation ?

235
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:23,734
Exotic particles.

236
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:28,768
It's gonna be really tough
to find an intact DNA sample.

237
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,868
These are the same particles
we picked up

238
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,100
when Carl Carlson breeched the
Artifact containment chamber.

239
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,701
That's simply impossible.

240
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,868
We ran every test, right ?

241
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,634
There was no sign
of containment breech.

242
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:45,900
But there was a radiation surge
just before we found the body.

243
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:49,134
There's only one place
these could have come from:

244
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,634
The Artifact.

245
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,144
 ? ? ?

246
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,834
(Carter)
There has to be some way
to identify the body.

247
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,734
In this case,
the body's far too distorted.

248
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:07,000
Without more to go on,
we'll never know who it is.

249
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,134
Kim.
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,134
Kim has been developing
a DNA reconstruction program.

251
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,768
<i>That could work.
I doubt it.</i>

252
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,734
But it's designed
to reconstruct

253
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,100
entire contiguous
DNA strands

254
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,467
based on partial samples.

255
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,401
But still in the early
experimental stages.

256
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:21,467
Yeah, but if she can put
the pieces together,

257
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:25,601
then we can rebuild our
John Doe on a cellular level.

258
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,234
What ?
I learn things.

259
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,933
Let's go talk to her.

260
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,501
I learn things.

261
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,567
We need you to identify
the body found in Section Five.

262
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,734
What happened ?

263
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,000
That's what we need
to figure out.

264
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,933
It's a long shot.

265
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,267
So if you think
it's impossible--

266
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,967
Anything is possible.

267
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,367
I'll just have to modify
the existing software.

268
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,634
Great.

269
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,768
Look, why don't you guys go back
to Zoe's party ?

270
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,033
If we get something,
we'll call you.

271
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,100
Okay.
Great.

272
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,334
What's wrong ?

273
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,967
Nothing.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,501
Just, um, concerned
about all this stuff.

275
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:01,900
Well, don't worry.

276
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:05,067
I'm sure I can figure
something out.

277
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,434
One Newton Appletini

278
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:23,367
and a virgin Margaret Mead
'cause you're on duty.

279
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:25,100
Mead ?

280
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,167
Water ?

281
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,601
<i>Yeast ?</i>

282
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,933
Honey ?

283
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:33,601
Seriously, I don't know
why I bother.

284
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,801
Unbelievable.

285
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,234
Well, I don't work for
the Consortium anymore.

286
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,567
So if you want me,

287
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,100
you'll have to do better
than that.

288
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,100
[crash]

289
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,434
Wait here.

290
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,067
Wait here.

291
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,501
Oh, no.

292
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,401
That's my jeep.

293
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:03,033
Hey, you okay ?

294
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,501
I don't know what happened.

295
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,334
I came out of nowhere.
Literally.

296
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,067
One second it wasn't there,
then, poof, it just appeared.

297
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,768
Okay, okay.
Just sit tight for one second.

298
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,701
Carter ?
Yeah.

299
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,768
Wasn't this crushed
by a runaway tornado ?

300
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,367
About six months ago.

301
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:29,467
The security sticker
is three years old.

302
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:32,634
Don't be there.

303
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:41,634
No way.

304
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,334
why am i getting deja vu ?

305
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,734
<i>(Fargo)
It's a lot of the same
equipment</i>

306
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,067
<i>we used to test the aftermath
of our last temporal anomaly.</i>

307
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,133
<i>(Allison)
Temporal anomaly ?</i>

308
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,834
<i>(Fargo)
We have completed
our analysis yet,</i>

309
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,868
but it looks like a fundamental
quantum instability.

310
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,534
You mean, like,
back what happened

311
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,734
with Walter Perkins'
time machine ?

312
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,100
A tachyon accele--

313
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,501
[clears throat]
Accelerator, Sheriff.

314
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,567
Tomato, tomah-to.
That was years ago.

315
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,434
You really think
that's what's happening now ?

316
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,367
<i>(Deacon)
No.</i>

317
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,467
<i>Walter's machine's been locked
up in the vault for four years.</i>

318
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:19,267
<i>Couldn't he have built
another one ?</i>

319
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,734
Walter's under house arrest.

320
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,067
Even if he could get his hands
on the right equipment,

321
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,200
he's not reckless enough
to do something like this again,

322
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,734
especially
given his condition.

323
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,100
<i>Well, maybe he didn't do it,
but he might know what it is.</i>

324
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,267
Either way,
it's worth a check.

325
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,834
Waste of time.

326
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,934
Call me if you come up
with something better.

327
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,601
Can I get you something ?

328
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:50,968
Coffee, tea, red bull ?

329
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,534
Uh, no thanks,
Walter.

330
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,200
This isn't a social call.

331
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:00,901
Didn't your mother ever
teach you

332
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,434
it's rude to stare ?

333
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,501
Sorry.

334
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:08,601
A little disconcerting.

335
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:10,868
I'm the only 40 year-old
teenager in town.

336
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,200
Don't tell me about
disconcerting.

337
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,934
Look, Walter.

338
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,167
There's been strange activity
in town and--

339
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
You think it's a result of
a temporal anomaly.

340
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:23,467
Yeah.

341
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,801
Which you think I have something
to do with ?

342
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,267
<i>Well, I hate
to disappoint you, Sheriff,</i>

343
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,367
but it wasn't me.

344
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,801
I'm under house arrest.

345
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,200
<i>The temporal stabilizer
keeps me</i>

346
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,434
<i>from getting any younger.</i>

347
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,167
But one foot
outside that front door,

348
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,701
and it's set to shut off.

349
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,534
I don't wanna end up
in diapers.

350
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,968
Well, do you have any
side projects

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,367
you're working on
that maybe I should know about ?

352
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,801
My last side project cost me
my marriage and my family.

353
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,300
Susan was pretty understanding

354
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:56,033
about the whole
cloning her thing.

355
00:19:56,067 --> 00:20:00,400
But no woman wants
to be married to a 16-year-old.

356
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:04,033
Well, it's a tad creepy.
Not to mention illegal.

357
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:08,267
Besides, part of my sentence
is no technology

358
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,267
above a Class 2 rating.

359
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,901
<i>Hell, I had to file
for special dispensation</i>

360
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:12,968
just to get that Xbox.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
It's only a 360.

362
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,834
Well, who,
besides you in town

363
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,701
could be causing
something like this ?

364
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:22,567
I suppose anyone who knows
their quantum physics

365
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,868
and has access to
my accelerator.

366
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,767
How much longer ?
I have to get going.

367
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,501
Why ?
Got a hot date ?

368
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,334
<i>I date.
Okay.</i>

369
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,000
I do !
I believe you.

370
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,801
No, you don't.

371
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,767
I know.

372
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:44,267
I'm almost done here
if you wanna take off.

373
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,434
Any luck ?

374
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,834
Not in love.
What ?

375
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't ask.

376
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:59,968
I finished the body scan.
It's reconstructing the DNA now.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
Hmm.

378
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,467
What's wrong ?

379
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,467
I don't know.
Something's...off.

380
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:08,334
This looks distorted to me.

381
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,968
<i>I think it looks
pretty good.</i>

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,534
It's just gonna take
a little time.

383
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,901
Maybe, but just try adjusting
the base pair algorithms.

384
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,367
Henry, I'm sure
that's gonna slow us down.

385
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,434
Please.
Trust me.

386
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,868
I do.

387
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,434
Okay.

388
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,501
I don't know
what I would do without you.

389
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,200
Giving young Walter's
situation,

390
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,567
I don't think he could possibly
have started this.

391
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,234
I'm finalizing your list
of everyone

392
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:15,567
with quantum physics background
and Section Five clearance.

393
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,701
Hopefully, that'll narrow down
our list of suspects.

394
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,734
It narrowed it down all right.

395
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,133
How many ?

396
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,868
Take a look.

397
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:27,734
Oh, man.

398
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,934
Kim's made some progress.
Not very encouraging.

399
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:31,434
Hey, how'd it go
with Walter ?

400
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,767
He didn't do it.

401
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,767
<i>You sure ?
Yeah. Positive.</i>

402
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,367
But I made a list
of all the people

403
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,534
who had access
and the ability

404
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,601
to cause something like this.

405
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:39,634
And how many are on it ?

406
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,868
After eliminating Walter, two.

407
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,634
And one of them
is Nathan Stark.

408
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,100
Well, he's been gone
for four years.

409
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,167
Who's the other one ?

410
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,667
Kim.

411
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,901
What ?

412
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:53,801
I have something
to show you.

413
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,133
This has to be a mistake.

414
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,467
Maybe the sample
was contaminated.

415
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,601
I've checked.
It's no mistake.

416
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,033
What we are looking at
is definitely--

417
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,901
You.

418
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:17,300
Then again, you knew that,
didn't you, Henry ?

419
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:19,767
Henry ?

420
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:23,734
He was the other name
on the list.

421
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,834
Henry, what did you do ?

422
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,834
So the body we found fused
to the wall--

423
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:35,567
That body right there--
That's you ?

424
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:37,334
That's me.

425
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:39,267
Which means you died
four years ago

426
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,434
Apparently.

427
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:45,100
But you're here right now.
It doesn't make any sense.

428
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,434
It does if Henry changed
the outcome of the event,

429
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,934
<i>using Walter's time machine.</i>

430
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:51,501
Henry ?

431
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:55,467
I lost you the first time
to Jason.

432
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,100
But we got a second chance.

433
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,601
I couldn't let you go.

434
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:08,200
They, uh--

435
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:10,067
<i>They couldn't identify
your body,</i>

436
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100
<i>so they brought me in
to see if I could...</i>

437
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:22,767
It took...days.

438
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:27,167
So you used Walter's tachyon
accelerator to change history ?

439
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,501
That's insane.

440
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,834
You lobbied for Stark's job
to gain access.

441
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,434
It was the only way.

442
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,234
Nathan was not gonna
let me try this.

443
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,968
<i>He knew the risks.
What risks ?</i>

444
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:39,434
Creating a paradox.

445
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:44,734
An alternate timeline
with a different outcome.

446
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,200
What we're witnessing is

447
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,901
two intersecting
realities colliding,

448
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,734
competing for
the same space-time continuum.

449
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,000
One where you died--

450
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,834
and one where I lived.

451
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,601
<i>But if that's true,</i>

452
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,501
we're living
in the wrong timeline.

453
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:01,167
Yes.

454
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,734
None of what we've known
for the past four years

455
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,534
was supposed to happen.

456
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:08,934
No, but this is life now.

457
00:25:08,968 --> 00:25:12,133
Our life.

458
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,534
Do you really want me
to change it ?

459
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,968
Henry, you gotta fix this.

460
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,801
If you don't,
things could get worse.

461
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,334
Or they could equalize.

462
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,801
Is that a chance
you're really willing to take ?

463
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,501
I already did.

464
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:38,901
Josefina, it's the most natural
thing in the world.

465
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:42,467
You just gotta relax
and be open to it.

466
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,801
Trust me.

467
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,501
<i>I do trust you.</i>

468
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:51,434
But the whole idea
just freaks me out.

469
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:58,701
Lupo.

470
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,901
You saw what ?

471
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,234
Where ?

472
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,400
What the hell was that ?

473
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,767
It's just the beginning.

474
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,410
 ? ? ?

475
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,551
Fused into the wall
of the Artifact chamber.

476
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,617
<i>And you're sure
it's Kim Deacon.</i>

477
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,117
Yes.

478
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,718
Can we talk about my mom now ?

479
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:43,718
I'm afraid
we're out of time.

480
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:46,784
When I snap my fingers,
you'll wake feeling refreshed

481
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,718
and remember nothing about
what we've discussed here today.

482
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:52,217
One, two...three !

483
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,250
Which is why it's not possible
for me to be hypnotized.

484
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:59,883
Well, Fargo, we'll just
have to keep working on it.

485
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,684
Any injuries ?

486
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:02,751
Okay, good.

487
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,950
Yeah,
we're working on it.

488
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,484
I'll call you later.

489
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,617
Remember that tornado
that took out my jeep ?
Yeah.

490
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:10,451
It just popped up on Main Street
and took out half the block.

491
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:11,751
Okay, Henry has to stop this.

492
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:15,050
I know.
But he won't.

493
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:17,050
But there is one person
who might.

494
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:20,150
I'll make the call.
Okay. Thanks.

495
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,551
<i>Dr. Stark ?</i>

496
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,284
Yes, Marla.

497
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:34,651
Allison Carter's on the line,
and she says it's urgent.

498
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:38,751
Should be interesting.

499
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:42,351
Allison.
What a surprise.

500
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,417
You okay ?

501
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:45,950
I really don't
want him here.

502
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:47,317
Neither do I.

503
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:48,718
But I also don't want
the universe to unravel.

504
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,484
No.

505
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:53,684
I mean, I don't want him
to try to fix it.

506
00:27:53,718 --> 00:28:00,484
I know it's selfish,
but I love our life.

507
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,317
I love this baby.

508
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:04,818
I know.

509
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,150
Me too.

510
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,217
Well, well, well.

511
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,983
If it isn't the Carters.

512
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:12,484
And little Carter to be.

513
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:14,784
<i>Pregnancy suits you.</i>

514
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,784
Yeah, it does.

515
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:19,651
Hello, Sheriff.

516
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:22,050
You ready to save world.

517
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:29,084
You ready ?

518
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:32,417
No.

519
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:47,184
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

520
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:49,517
I got fired for cutting corners
on the Artifact.

521
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:53,217
But Henry gets to play with
the space-time continuum.

522
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,784
We didn't know what he was doing
until after he did it.

523
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,317
Do you realize that was
a rhetorical question ?

524
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:00,184
I do now.
Yeah.

525
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:01,684
So what are
we dealing with here ?

526
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,584
A mess.

527
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:07,917
Time is supposed to be fixed.

528
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,117
Straight line.

529
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,117
Start here, you end here,

530
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,351
experiencing everything
in logical order.

531
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:23,184
Henry went back
and changed history,

532
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:24,917
thereby creating a paradox.

533
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,718
A completely separate
and different timeline.

534
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,417
<i>We know that much.
What do you do about it ?</i>

535
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,917
Not do.
Undo.

536
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,150
We need to stop Henry
from saving Kim,

537
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:40,850
thereby erasing this timeline
completely.

538
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:42,017
Okay, how do we do that ?

539
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,950
Someone's gotta go back.

540
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,417
Someone.

541
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:50,084
Okay.

542
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:53,084
Me.

543
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:55,651
Glad we got that straight.

544
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:58,150
Nathan, thanks
for doing this.

545
00:29:58,184 --> 00:30:02,050
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

546
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:18,417
<i>(Jo)
You were right.
This feels really nice.</i>

547
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:21,117
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

548
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,284
I can't believe it took me
four years to get you naked--

549
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,384
outdoors, anyway.

550
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,417
What convinced you ?

551
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,684
I just knew it was time.

552
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,017
You found me.

553
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,551
Well, it's a big glass office.

554
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,784
It wasn't hard.

555
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,983
You heard about
what happened downtown ?

556
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:33,217
I thought
I could fix this.

557
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,484
I can't.

558
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:41,117
You had to know
this could happen.

559
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,250
You weren't gonna tell me.

560
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:49,284
I hoped
I'd never have to.

561
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,950
You know now there's
only one way

562
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:54,284
to make things right.

563
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:05,117
I barely survived losing you
the first time.

564
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,451
I can't.
I can't.

565
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:15,184
I can't do that again.

566
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:17,651
This isn't just about you...

567
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:20,284
or me.

568
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,551
I can't.

569
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,284
You have to.

570
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:37,284
Well ?

571
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:38,517
Working on it.

572
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,184
Work faster.

573
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:45,284
Would you like
to try...Sheriff ? ?

574
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:50,983
All the algorithms are correct.
I do not know what is wrong.

575
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,883
Maybe you're missing
something.

576
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,850
<i>I'm not missing anything.
(Henry)
Yes, you are.</i>

577
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:57,250
This.

578
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:58,351
What's that ?

579
00:32:58,384 --> 00:32:59,584
Nathan ?

580
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,950
The fragment
I took from the Artifact

581
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,718
four years ago.

582
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,184
<i>You know something I don't,
Henry ?</i>

583
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,883
It's transdimensional.

584
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,084
It exists completely outside
our space-time continuum.

585
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,751
<i>So none of the rules apply.
Right.</i>

586
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,584
Okay, and now
for those of us

587
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,084
who aren't
astrophysicists.

588
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:17,417
If the big bang was
a plane crash,

589
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:19,317
the Artifact is the black box.

590
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:21,117
It's the last remnant
of whatever universe existed

591
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,417
before our own.

592
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:25,017
Technology light-years
beyond our own.

593
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,384
But billions of years old.

594
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:27,584
At the moment,

595
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,584
physical time travel
is impossible.

596
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:31,150
The transfer of consciousness

597
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:33,384
from one temporal plane
to another...

598
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:36,917
isn't.

599
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,417
So you sent your mind
back in time ?

600
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,617
More or less.
Yes.

601
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,317
Now we have to do it again ?

602
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:45,384
<i>Now you have to do it again.</i>

603
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,850
<i>Nathan, I'm gonna leave this
in your hands.</i>

604
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:50,317
Can't saying
I'm loving that plan.

605
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,718
Where you going, Henry ?

606
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:55,050
Say goodbye.

607
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:05,917
Maybe, um--

608
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,117
Henry's right.

609
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,917
Maybe things will equalize

610
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,818
and things can stay
the way they are.

611
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,184
Henry knows things can't stay
the way they are.

612
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:20,284
Aren't you even a little afraid
to lose me ?

613
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:22,751
To lose us.

614
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:25,351
Listen to me.

615
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:27,184
There's no time,
no space, no way

616
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:31,684
that we don't end up
together.

617
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,451
You just have to have
a little faith.

618
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,684
Even knowing
what I know now,

619
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:48,584
I would do it again.

620
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:50,684
I know you would.

621
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,718
run out of time. carter

622
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,694
good morning shriff carer

623
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,500
Morning,S.A.R.A.H.

624
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:44,734
<i>(S.A.R.A.H)
I'm detecting an odd tone
in your voice.</i>

625
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,767
<i>Is everything all right ?</i>

626
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Um, what day is it ?

627
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:55,234
<i>Tuesday,
October 3, 2006.</i>

628
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,034
Zoe.

629
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,567
Don't freak out, okay ?

630
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,167
I swear I was up
studying at Pilar's house.

631
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,633
And I fell asleep and--
Oh.

632
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,800
Okay.

633
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,834
Now I'm kinda freaking out.

634
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:18,067
I'm just glad
you're home safely.

635
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:23,800
So you're not gonna ground me
till I'm 30.

636
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:28,800
No.
Not today.

637
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,867
Cool.

638
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:39,201
Zoe.

639
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:46,434
Look, I'm not sure
how this is going to play out

640
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:48,900
or if I'm even gonna
remember it.

641
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:53,533
But I want you to know that
I will always be there for you.

642
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,934
Okay.

643
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:03,301
Is everything okay ?

644
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,800
It will be.

645
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:10,767
Good morning, Nathan.

646
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Morning, Beverly.

647
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,434
Do you have
something for me ?

648
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:15,967
I sure do.

649
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,767
I finished the psych evaluations
on the global employees.

650
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,867
Dr. Stark ?

651
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,834
There waiting for you
in Section Five.

652
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:42,001
The big test.

653
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:48,334
Uh, excuse me.

654
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:52,301
Allison.
Hey, Carter.
What's up ?

655
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,401
Just looking for Henry.

656
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,067
I haven't see him.
You okay ?

657
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:58,967
Yeah.
Yeah.

658
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,767
Hey !

659
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,834
You look great.

660
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:05,967
Thanks.

661
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:14,867
All rover/computer links
are up and running.

662
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,334
Let's mark
the time and date.

663
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,600
9:27 AM.
October 3, 2006.

664
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,468
Let's take her
for a test drive.

665
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:45,101
Jack.

666
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,267
What are you doing here ?

667
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,334
I'm stopping you, Henry.

668
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:58,867
We are at
marginal proximity now.

669
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,734
Let's proceed.

670
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,934
Igniting photon drill.

671
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:09,533
<i>You can't do this.</i>

672
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:10,667
Get outta the way !

673
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:17,500
If you do this,
the world will unravel.

674
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:19,067
I can't let her go.

675
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,334
I know.

676
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:23,867
Moment of truth.

677
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,800
That's why I'm here.

678
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,468
Jack, I have to save her.

679
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
You can't.
It changes everything.

680
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,001
What's happening in there ?

681
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,934
I don't know.
Systems are off-line.

682
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,334
Get 'em back on-line !

683
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:49,533
I'm trying.

684
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:56,500
Jack, get the hell out
of the way !

685
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,667
I can't let you do this.

686
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,834
If you don't, Kim dies !

687
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,567
If I do, we all die !

688
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:44,600
<i>(man)
What kind of accident ?</i>

689
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,368
A breech of the Artifact.

690
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:49,234
A core sample was taken,
and Kim Anderson was killed.

691
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:50,800
<i>Do you have the sample ?</i>

692
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,034
Not yet.

693
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,734
But the biodegradable
microtransmitter

694
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,767
I planted on Stark,
worked perfectly.

695
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,900
Security scans
never detected a thing,

696
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:00,500
and now we know
what we're dealing with.

697
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,567
<i>The Consortium will be
very pleased.</i>

698
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,267
Do you have a plan
for obtaining the sample ?

699
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:08,567
I always have a plan.
That's why I'm here.

700
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,101
<i>You're here
because we want you here.</i>

701
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:15,900
Do not forget
who you work for.

702
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:22,368
<i>(Allison)
Hey.</i>

703
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:25,468
Hey.

704
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,700
Doing okay ?

705
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,700
Yeah.

706
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:30,734
Yeah.

707
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,500
Well, I'm better than Henry.

708
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,401
Yeah.

709
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:42,600
I just hope that
he can...

710
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,767
forgive me.

711
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,567
It was an accident, Carter.

712
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,767
There's nothing
you could've done.

713
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,434
Yeah, I keep
telling myself that.

714
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:53,034
Look, I know
it's hard to believe now,

715
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:56,301
but things'll get better.

716
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:59,234
You just have to have
a little faith.

717
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:04,301
Allison...

718
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:06,401
there's, uh...

719
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,734
What ?

720
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:11,667
Nothing.
Come on.

721
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,867
I'll let you buy me
a cup of coffee.

722
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,134
It's free.

723
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,633
Oh.

724
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:21,334
Well, in that case,
I'll buy.

725
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:23,767
You know,

726
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,434
I think this is definitely
becoming a thing.

727
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:29,734
We don't have a thing.

728
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:37,867
We might.
