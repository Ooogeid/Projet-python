1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,122
Sorry.

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,726
What's going on?
It's been doing this all morning.

3
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:11,473
Yeah, I had it noticed. You know,
maybe you should chuch that dinosaur.

4
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:15,393
No way.
This is the XL44.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,814
I got this when I was a rookie.
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

6
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,080
I can't imagine why.

7
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:25,994
You know,
you could just turn it off.

8
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,401
Sheriff, you got a minute?

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,171
Can you please talk to your sister?

10
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,439
This obviously belongs
with metal alloy.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,686
This with cellulose.

12
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:41,286
And this...

13
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,339
Complex non-irradiated silicon.

14
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:48,093
- I was recycler of the month.
- Good for you, Doug.

15
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:50,114
- Hi, Lex.
- Hey.

16
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,773
Jack, do you know they recycle
absolutely everything in this town?

17
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:57,565
If I could just get Vincent
to be a smidge more conscientious.

18
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:59,439
Could you do it someplace else?

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,524
I don't think eggs over garbage
is on the menu.

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,901
Garbage?

21
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:06,842
What century are you from?

22
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,247
Chuck's the majordomo
for Eureka's recycling program.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,685
- "Why throw it when you can chuck it?"
- Chuck it.

24
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:17,246
I'll meet you at the office.

25
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,753
That can there is actually
full of violations.

26
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:22,377
I hope there's gonna be
some pretty hefty fines, Sheriff.

27
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:26,422
How about we just give him
a warning this time?

28
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:28,326
Okay.

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,134
But I'm watching you.

30
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,693
See ya later, Lexi.

31
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,181
Vincent, can I have
a green tea, please?

32
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:36,996
Aunt Lexi.

33
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:39,941
Look at you.

34
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,282
- You like?
- Oh, it's om-mazing.

35
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,087
- You're taking a class?
- I found this program.

36
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,742
An amazing program.

37
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:49,385
It's a three-day workshop
with Swami Goldstein.

38
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:51,650
I'm dropping her off this afternoon.

39
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,607
Remember?
We talked about this.

40
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:58,037
Yeah, you said you wanted to try yoga,
not miss three days of school.

41
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,688
Well, I mean, the swami's
at the ashram only this week,

42
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:03,459
and I talked to all my teachers,
who said I could make up my school work.

43
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,853
And I told her it was fine.

44
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,546
This is a once-in-a-lifetime's
opportunity.

45
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,055
- You told her it was fine?
- Zoe's a wise young woman,

46
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,895
and she can make her own decisions.

47
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,764
Sweetie, I know you really
want to go,

48
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:20,143
but you're not skipping school
to go to yoga, okay?

49
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:23,247
Fine.

50
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,772
You know, I just hope Eureka yoga
gives refunds on clothes.

51
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:35,825
Jack, you put that uniform on, and you
think you can tell everybody what to do.

52
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,105
Green tea.

53
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,126
- No cellulose.
- That's the spirit.

54
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,577
I'm late for my tour
of the Eureka recycling center.

55
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,836
Why don't you do everyone a favor and
take the day off from helping people?

56
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,385
Be careful what you wish for.

57
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,718
How did you find this thing?

58
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:57,507
Trust me, I've been researching this
for a long time.

59
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,312
All right,

60
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:02,018
let's get to work.

61
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,606
It was my understanding
that one single incorrect entry

62
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,692
could freeze this lock, permanently.

63
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,445
Only if you believe the research
on these little security systems.

64
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:17,034
Come on, there's only 6.8 billion
possible combinations.

65
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,996
I designed a code-breaking program
for this cryptex.

66
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,721
What's that?

67
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,397
Zane...

68
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,727
you've done the impossible.

69
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,852
It's an elevator shaft.

70
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,372
That's a hell of a drop.

71
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,109
There's a lot of debris.

72
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,341
It's gonna be dicey.

73
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,499
Radios aren't gonna work down there,

74
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,884
so now's the time to tell me
what I'm looking for.

75
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,736
Another entrance.

76
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,518
If one exists.

77
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:26,811
Stupid algae,
why do you only grow in the basement?

78
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,219
Come on, Pilar,
can't you just tell us what it is?

79
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,322
I don't know what it is.
That's the whole point.

80
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,215
It's a door.

81
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,382
You think, Mr. Third Highest IQ
ever measured?

82
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,478
They must have sealed it off
when they built the basement.

83
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,049
Let's look inside.

84
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,712
Don't you think
we should tell someone about this?

85
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,677
Like a teacher?

86
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,912
- Someone old?
- We'll just look around a little.

87
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:13,211
We're old enough to make
our own decisions, don't you think?

88
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,664
Talk about old.

89
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,348
What is this place?

90
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,226
We gotta save her.

91
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:31,040
It sounds like some kind
of ambient interference,

92
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:34,293
but I won't be able to really tell
until I open her up.

93
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:37,096
But she'll be fine.
I'll do everything I can.

94
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:39,613
Carter.

95
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,445
Fantastic.

96
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:50,663
Took you long enough.

97
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,688
Hello.
You need some help?

98
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,631
Could you just get me out of here?

99
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,484
Sorry. Somebody told me
to take the day off.

100
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:00,980
You okay?

101
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,063
I think you should get
out of the car, Lex.

102
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:08,077
I just can't open the door.
It's like some big, nasty aura.

103
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,017
It's a reactive perimeter field.

104
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,915
The more you move,
the harder it holds on.

105
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:15,225
Great, what's it doing in the middle
of the driveway to the recycling center?

106
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:19,505
No, this is a secure GD antenna station.
Obviously you have the wrong clearance.

107
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,968
If there's a force field on the road,
maybe they could put up a sign?

108
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:25,237
- There used to be signs.
- Get me out of here.

109
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,680
It's starting to squish me.

110
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,204
- How do we turn it off?
- The switch box up there.

111
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,270
Can I be of any assistance?

112
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:37,733
- What the...
- Happy to oblige, Miss.

113
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,776
Well, you don't see that every day.

114
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,236
This should do it.

115
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,704
<i>You are approaching a secure area.</i>

116
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:53,499
- It's crushing me!
- <i>Please withdraw your vehicle.</i>

117
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,833
That's a laser turret.

118
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:57,345
You're not powering down.
You're expanding the perimeter field.

119
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,921
- You're making it worse.
- <i>Withdraw your vehicle immediately.</i>

120
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,627
<i>You have five seconds to comply.</i>

121
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:02,758
Lex, get down!

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,037
That's not five seconds!

123
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:10,349
Drop the amperage!

124
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:17,272
Drop the amperage,
then power it down!

125
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:25,464
Come on, quick. Easy.

126
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,491
Come on, a little effort.

127
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,409
- You all right?
- I think...

128
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,128
Here we go.

129
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:38,258
- You all right, Miss?
- Yeah. Thanks.

130
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,212
On my Jeep?

131
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,260
Take care, little lady.

132
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,264
Just a moment.

133
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,726
Not the Jeep!

134
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,914
Not to worry.

135
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,343
Just a small technical glitch.

136
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,963
Who was that masked man?

137
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,177
Trouble.

138
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,717
Season 3 Episode 06
Phased and Confused (v 1.00)

139
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,912
Sadgeezer & Team Projet-SG.

140
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:36,433
http://projet-sg.net

141
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,695
They're hydroponic strawberries
dipped in organic chocolate.

142
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,552
I grew them myself.

143
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:48,697
Lexi, I heard you were...
down here.

144
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,937
I brought you these.

145
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,409
Oh, Chuck.

146
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:54,411
Are these recycled?

147
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:58,560
- Well, someone's popular.
- Always.

148
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:01,103
Okay, boys,
I think visiting hours are over.

149
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:03,686
- After you.
- No, no, no. After you.

150
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,044
- No, after you, really.
- No. It would be really awkward.

151
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:08,049
Oh, for the love...
Both of you, go.

152
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,003
Just...

153
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,254
Well, everything seems fine.

154
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:15,890
No residual particle halo,
no radiation echo.

155
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,827
How much radiation
was she exposed to?

156
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,004
Your average microwave oven.

157
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:24,189
She's... she's fine.
Why?

158
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,790
What Sheriff subtle
is trying to tell you

159
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,695
is that I'm pregnant.

160
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,817
His unmarried sister is knocked up.

161
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,685
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

162
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,939
- You too, uncle Jack.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,439
By the way, we have a problem.

164
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,294
There's a guy running around
out there with a funny costume.

165
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:42,723
You mean you?

166
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,317
He saved me.

167
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,945
The only problem you have
with captain Eureka is

168
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,757
you think
he's gonna steal your thunder.

169
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,756
My problem is that
he's gonna save someone to death.

170
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,428
Wait, wait.
Captain Eureka?

171
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:56,285
How about "Captain Incompetent"?

172
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:59,684
Because the guy wears a mask and a cape
doesn't mean he's a dangerous lunatic.

173
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,690
Yeah, it sorta does.

174
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,522
Okay, it does sound a little concerning.
You have any idea who it might be?

175
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,173
Well, he can fly,
if that narrows it down.

176
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,353
Flying has always been
the dream of man.

177
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,008
- By the way, how's Lexi feeling?
- Oh, she's fine.

178
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,566
- Did she get my balloons?
- Yes, I'm sure she did.

179
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:17,628
I have some questions
about flying machines.

180
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:19,940
Machines are the past.

181
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:24,347
We've developed a therapy to create
biological gravity-wave repulsion.

182
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,384
And I'm sure I'd be impressed
if I knew what that meant.

183
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:28,938
The holy Grail!

184
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,554
Independent flight.

185
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:33,463
Up, up, and away.

186
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,498
Behold.

187
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,468
The door said human flight.

188
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,877
We're a decade away
from human trials.

189
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,814
But our work with rabbits
has been extraordinary.

190
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,505
Well, they look normal enough.

191
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:48,305
I mean, no wings or propellers.

192
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,760
Yeah. All the changes
are on the inside.

193
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:52,688
I'll show you the serum.

194
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,950
Well, the guy that I saw had,
like, rocket boots, you know?

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,118
Burned the paint off my car.

196
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,872
Must have been my skywalker 2000s.

197
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,688
They're incredible.

198
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:07,558
Makes you feel like a bird, a plane.

199
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,434
Or Superman?

200
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:13,131
Dr. Gaz, can you tell me
where you were this morning?

201
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,501
Here, in the lab.

202
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,278
I like to come in early.

203
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,743
The rabbits get lonely.

204
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:23,002
And does anyone else have access
to the rocket boots?

205
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:27,496
Sadly, no. All projects involving
rocket-powered footwear were shut down.

206
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,626
Spotty performance.

207
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,776
We singed more than a few toes
with those buggers.

208
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,097
But man, when they worked.

209
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,684
Oh, no.
They got out again.

210
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:44,775
Well, that's new.

211
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,149
The place is like
an underground City.

212
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,690
We've been walking for, like, an hour.
We should really go back.

213
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:53,801
But don't you want to know
what this place is?

214
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,576
I know it's creepy.

215
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:58,451
Do you hear that?

216
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,437
Yes, it's common sense saying get out
and go to chemistry class.

217
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,401
I think it's coming from in here.

218
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,379
Come on, you never go
toward the creepy noise.

219
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,586
Have you never seen a horror movie?

220
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,672
Oh, my God!
Did they get you?

221
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,852
Yeah, Pilar, the rats tripped me.

222
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:56,261
- Are you okay?
- No, yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

223
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,614
Okay, please can we go now?

224
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:01,824
This way?

225
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:04,293
Okay...

226
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:06,465
which way's out?

227
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,617
- This way.
- That way.

228
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,713
Oh, that's just perfect.

229
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,905
Dr. Gaz admitted
that he'd love to be a superhero

230
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,195
and he had access
to flying technology. What?

231
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,378
Carter, everyone at GD
wants to be a superhero.

232
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:23,063
It's part of being a scientist,
of dreaming up this kind of technology.

233
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,242
Really? Everyone?

234
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,593
Wonder Woman.

235
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,000
Was it the lasso,
or the bustier, or...

236
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,623
Sheriff, Sheriff.

237
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:37,250
Heard about your radio woes,
and I have the answer to your problem.

238
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,370
An aspirin?

239
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,405
- I could use it.
- It's a cyberkinetic comlink.

240
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,061
Say good-bye to your old
broken-down radio and cell phone

241
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,617
and hello to modern convenience.

242
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,254
- I don't like the sound of that...
- You're on the list of beta-testers.

243
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:51,457
She figured you could give it
a real-world workout.

244
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,139
Put it behind your ear.

245
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,560
It burrows into the skin.
Isn't that cool?

246
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:05,805
No. Not cool.

247
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,849
It's actually amazing technology.

248
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,619
It taps into the synapse activity.

249
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,878
Just think about the person
you want to call and say their name.

250
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:16,315
Like what?
Like, call Fargo?

251
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:21,946
Douglas Fargo speaking.

252
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,750
I can hear you in my head.

253
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,123
Yeah, neat, huh?

254
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:26,838
Creepy.

255
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,369
Call Zoe.

256
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:33,056
- It shocked me.
- Yeah, there are still a few kinks.

257
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:36,543
Just avoid names
that start with a "Z", or an "A",

258
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:38,712
and anything with an umlaut.

259
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:41,797
Fargo, get this out of me.
Now.

260
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,377
You know what?
Just try it out for a few days.

261
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,226
You're gonna love it.

262
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:55,370
You gotta take this more seriously,
Lex, it's different.

263
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,190
I am taking it seriously.

264
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,187
I'm just saying
that you're gonna be a mom,

265
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,443
and your whole life is gonna change.

266
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:05,572
Hopefully I'll be the kind of mom who
trusts her kids to make good decisions.

267
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,307
That can't be good.

268
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,744
What's that?

269
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:23,352
It smells like bad eggs.

270
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,760
It's gotta be some kind of gas leak.
Call Henry.

271
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,930
Henry, hey, yeah. I need the fire
department out here on Magnesium Road.

272
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,002
There's a pipe that ruptured
at some sort of pumping station.

273
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,746
That's a rocket fuel pumping station,
Jack, so stay back.

274
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,269
Even the slightest spark
could set it off.

275
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,520
Zane might be able
to shut it down from GD.

276
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,360
- Okay, thanks.
- What'd he say?

277
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,502
He said even the smallest spark
could set it off.

278
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:46,732
Call Zane.

279
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:58,147
- You okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,628
Wait here.

281
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,834
Oh, no. Don't help, man.

282
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:07,217
Seriously.

283
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,683
Please, stand back.

284
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,791
You're making it worse!

285
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,709
Amazing!
He did it again!

286
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,931
Thank you, Captain Eureka!

287
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,297
So you still think
he's Captain Incompetent?

288
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,457
Yes, I do.

289
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:41,126
All in a day's work, little lady.

290
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:48,091
So he's a bird,
and a fireman, and a ghost?

291
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,648
I want to know
how a fueling pipe suddenly bursts.

292
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,020
As far as I can tell,

293
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,773
the fuel pipe was fractured
by a plasma surge,

294
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:05,067
which I've never seen before.

295
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:09,696
- You think someone did it deliberately?
- Someone, like, in a cape?

296
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:12,770
He's a vigilante, and he's dangerous,
and he's a klutz.

297
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,748
Unless I catch him,
this ends one of two ways.

298
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,583
Either he hurts himself,
or he hurts someone else.

299
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,382
So please, tell me about your
cutting-edge firefighting technology.

300
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:24,084
We have projects including
temperature-resistant fabrics.

301
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,392
Fireproof gasoline.

302
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,964
Do you have anything
that really blows?

303
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,644
We have the best blowers.

304
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:34,396
- And that's for scuba diving?
- For Maureen.

305
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,523
Our robotic whale.
She tracks migration patterns.

306
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:39,705
We developed high-energy
air jets for her blowhole.

307
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,206
I mean, they're small enough
to fit in the palm of your hand.

308
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:45,305
- Okay. Can we see Maureen?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

309
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,140
Here we are in Cape Cod.

310
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,648
And, oh, look,
this is us at Sea World.

311
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,036
We had such a good time.

312
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,077
Now she's in the South China Sea
migrating with a pod of sperm whales.

313
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,147
She's a bit of a flirt.

314
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,997
- Where do you keep the spare blowholes?
- She has the only working prototype.

315
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:06,309
Does your sister like
whale watching, by any chance?

316
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,007
Work, you stupid, stupid cell phone.

317
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,706
Concrete absorbs
the digital signals, okay?

318
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:23,973
- You're wasting your time.
- Thanks for the tip, Mr. Wizard.

319
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:26,143
Any ideas on how to get us unlost?

320
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:27,957
- That's not even a word.
- Guys...

321
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:30,084
Okay, I speak six languages.

322
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,894
What's "bite me" in Chinese?

323
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:33,405
Guys, seriously,

324
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,283
freaking out on each other isn't
gonna help us get out of here, okay?

325
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:40,662
Zoe, let me look at your leg.

326
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,572
You are not okay.

327
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,017
Oh, it's the rats.

328
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,301
They've come to finish us off.

329
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,806
Okay, guys, can we please just go?

330
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,770
What's with the screaming?

331
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:08,596
Zane, what are you doing here?

332
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:10,567
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

333
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:12,817
Well, it looks like GD's
only blowhole

334
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,147
is currently vacationing
in the South China Sea.

335
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,772
Oh, I miss Maureen.

336
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:18,293
I ran a full inventory check.

337
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:21,118
Every nut and nuclear reactor
is accounted for.

338
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,277
- How'bout the rocket boots?
- Dr. Gaz was telling the truth.

339
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,905
All prototypes were discarded
when the project was shelved.

340
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,892
And he was in his lab all morning.

341
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,894
Well, they had to come
from somewhere.

342
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:32,893
Most superheroes
make their own equipment.

343
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:36,018
He's not a superhero.
He's super dangerous.

344
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,177
Yeah, but most superheroes
are also misunderstood.

345
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:41,955
That's why they hide their identities.
Plus, the ladies love the latex.

346
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,161
That's true.

347
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,770
- There is always a girl around.
- Okay. I have real work to do.

348
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,425
No, hear me out.
I mean, Superman had Lois Lane, right?

349
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,524
Spider-man had Sally Jane.

350
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:54,646
- Mary Jane. Don't you read at all?
- Okay, Carter, what is your point?

351
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:57,957
We find the damsel in distress,
we find Captain Clumsy.

352
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,159
This is truly sad, Jack.
Sad, sad, sad.

353
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,769
Lex, this isn't about me.

354
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,357
He's not a threat to your manhood, Jack.
You help people, so does this guy.

355
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:09,250
Of course, he does do it anonymously,
which is a tad more noble.

356
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:13,337
It's not gonna be so noble when somebody
gets hurt. Especially if it's you.

357
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:17,308
- He's just trying to keep people safe.
- How safe was it to start that fire?

358
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,319
Henry said that the pipe was heated
from the outside until it ignited.

359
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,700
- So of course, you assume...
- I also checked the road

360
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,100
where you got trapped in the car, and
somebody did remove the warning signs.

361
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:30,281
I think that this guy
wants to impress you,

362
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:34,734
and given his talent for screwing up,
eventually you're gonna get hurt.

363
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:45,370
I think this is
the fastest way back.

364
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,954
This is awesome.

365
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:50,096
This place goes back to the'30s.

366
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,187
These are analog computers.

367
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,296
Look. Don't touch.

368
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:59,815
Okay, it's a prehistoric
apple store.

369
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,548
Can we please go now?

370
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:04,764
The emergency power's holding out.

371
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:08,887
- We can rest here a minute if you want.
- No, I'm fine.

372
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,729
I think that might be broken.

373
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:14,424
Maybe. Let's just keep moving.

374
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,390
No, wait!

375
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,530
What? Maybe it still works.

376
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:26,494
No, no, no!

377
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:28,788
Damn!

378
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:31,842
What's happening?

379
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,555
Security system.
It's locking us in!

380
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,098
What happened?

381
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,017
It's a drop-lock security system.

382
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:54,766
When the power runs out,
the doors shut tight.

383
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,568
You knew about this and you didn't bring
some sort of extra power supply?

384
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:00,903
What kind of a bonehead
do you think I am?

385
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:02,530
It's in my bag.

386
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,787
On the other side of that door.

387
00:22:09,143 --> 00:22:12,623
Jack thinks this trap for Captain Eureka
is really going to work?

388
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,039
Carter put out the word
you were hurt in the fire

389
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,503
and you blame Captain Eureka
for the whole thing.

390
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,214
He put out the word?
How, bat signal?

391
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:22,136
No, better.

392
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:25,136
He told Vincent and made him
promise to keep it a secret.

393
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:27,919
The crew of the space station
probably knows by now.

394
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,829
- Have you heard from Zoe today?
- I'd answer that, but I'm in a coma.

395
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:33,452
I'm serious, Lex. I called Tesla.

396
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:36,060
She never showed up for school.
I called her. She's not picking up.

397
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,073
Do they even let you use
cell phones at this ashram?

398
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,231
You think she went?

399
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:44,320
- Good for her.
- Good for her?

400
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,664
I need a coffee.

401
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,639
You can't just show up in her life
and superimpose your own morality.

402
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:53,388
You don't even want her to have
a little bit of independence. I do.

403
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,897
She's not your daughter.
And I want her to be safe.

404
00:22:56,017 --> 00:23:00,004
She's not lost in Baghdad.
She's an hour away at a yoga retreat.

405
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,268
- And she's mad at you.
- I don't know if she got there.

406
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,508
- Do you?
- I'm sure she's fine.

407
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,887
Well, this retreat was your idea. So you
can drive up there and bring her home.

408
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:10,139
Okay?
I'm gonna go find Jo.

409
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,388
This whole ambush is a bust.

410
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,316
How are you feeling?

411
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,935
Oh... not so good, actually.

412
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:27,468
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

413
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:31,870
- How did you get in here?
- I move like a jungle cat.

414
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,006
I'm sorry that you got hurt.
I hope you can forgive me.

415
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:38,913
I'm fine.
I'm... coma-free.

416
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:40,317
Honest.

417
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:44,130
Okay, Jo will drive you...
home.

418
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,341
So sorry.

419
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,500
- Hold it.
- Take care.

420
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:57,019
That's the creepiest thing
that's ever happened to me.

421
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,807
I can't believe it.

422
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:00,314
He's gone.

423
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,126
Not all of him.

424
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,679
Is that what I think it is?

425
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:13,994
Looks like Captain Eureka
gave us the finger.

426
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,594
What don't you understand
about look, don't touch?

427
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,037
I'm really sorry.

428
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,710
Why?

429
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:24,922
You just left us in here to suffocate.
No biggie.

430
00:24:25,623 --> 00:24:28,005
It's okay.
You didn't know.

431
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:31,345
- How much air do we have?
- Plenty.

432
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:32,930
An hour, maybe two.

433
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,473
An hour?

434
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:37,688
Maybe longer.

435
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,128
We'll be out of here
way before then, right, Zane?

436
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:41,756
You're working on a plan.

437
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,272
I found the ULF transmitter.

438
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:47,442
It can only send numeric messages,
but it's a chance,

439
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,128
if we can get power to it.

440
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:51,068
The emergency batteries are dry.

441
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:52,448
What about these lamps?

442
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,440
They aren't electric.
They're chemical.

443
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,056
Peroxyacid ester.

444
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,192
What... hey!
I was writing my will.

445
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,000
Is this enough power?

446
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,218
Maybe.

447
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:08,013
If we can network them.
Come on, give 'em up.

448
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:15,442
If this works, it'll only give us a few
seconds to transmit to the outside.

449
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,609
And we can only send numbers?

450
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,127
Yeah.

451
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:20,936
Okay, so...
what do we say?

452
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,356
You better figure that out.

453
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,283
No prints.

454
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,317
The collagen in the skin ridges
has merged with the wall,

455
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:37,031
and even the DNA has been
mangled beyond recognition.

456
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:42,130
Well, it shouldn't be too hard to find
a nine-fingered man in this town.

457
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,717
Yeah, or one who can walk
through walls.

458
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,907
- Any idea how he pulled that off?
- Well, it's just theory,

459
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:49,981
but...
given the state of this finger,

460
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:53,051
I'm gonna say that he's using some kind
of quantum phasing.

461
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:57,005
And... now's the part
where I ask you to say it in English.

462
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:00,229
All matter in our universe
exists on a single quantum frequency.

463
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,066
It allows us to interact physically
with things around us.

464
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,777
Our man might be able to shift
his frequency just enough to allow him

465
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:10,193
to pass through solid objects
like water through a strainer.

466
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:13,530
That didn't work too well
for Captain Nine Fingers.

467
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,925
Well, part of him must have shifted
back to our frequency

468
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:19,494
as he passed through the wall,
and it got stuck.

469
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:23,635
- Any chance we can reconstruct the DNA?
- Doubtful, but... I can try.

470
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,752
We don't have a quantum
phasing department, Carter.

471
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:31,002
Well, he didn't buy his walk through
walls machine at walk-through Wal-Mart.

472
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,950
Someone in this building is working
on something like that.

473
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,558
Well, section two was developing
a device a couple of years ago,

474
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,515
but the project was scrapped, they never
built a fully functional prototype.

475
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,130
Well, his machine
wasn't fully functional either,

476
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,360
and we have a finger to prove it.

477
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:48,774
Seems to specialize
in outdated GD technology.

478
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,730
Wait. What happens
to a program when it's scrapped?

479
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,129
They lose their funding,
scientists move on to new projects.

480
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:59,991
No, no... to the things.
The jet boots, the old blowholes?

481
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,662
You said they build prototypes.
Where are they?

482
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,414
They're gone.
They're discarded.

483
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,250
Discarded... or recycled?

484
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:11,129
Why throw it away
when you can chuck it?

485
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,595
- Hey, hey, Jack.
- What, is that the DNA?

486
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:34,402
No, no, your police radio
picked up a transmission

487
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,401
from an old military frequency.

488
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:41,368
- Numbers...
- First set of numbers I've seen before.

489
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:43,553
Longitude and latitude,
and it's the same location

490
00:27:43,673 --> 00:27:46,016
where Thorne had me
scan for radiation.

491
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,648
- What's the last number?
- 4891. I don't know.

492
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,618
I thought it was an altitude
or a Z axis point,

493
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,338
but none of that makes sense.

494
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,404
I know that these two sets of numbers
are trying to tell us something.

495
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,973
I just don't know what or from whom.

496
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,875
Okay. Well, thanks. Keep at it.
Let me know what you find.

497
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,470
I have to go catch
a nine-fingered superhero.

498
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,210
- Sure.
- Yeah.

499
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,498
Chuck?

500
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,904
Anybody home?

501
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:17,904
"Prototype graveyard."

502
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:32,210
I'm guessing
we're in the right place.

503
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,212
Yeah.

504
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,228
Chuck, can you give us a hand?
We got a recycling emergency.

505
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:40,947
Yeah, so do I.

506
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,477
Could use a hand here.

507
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,789
What is this...

508
00:28:58,273 --> 00:28:59,487
tanning therapy?

509
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,439
No, the hollow cathode lights

510
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,909
are holding him
in our quantum frequency.

511
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:09,437
Wasn't easy getting him in one piece,
but this should keep him for a while.

512
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,967
Make sure you recycle these bulbs.

513
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,044
Mercury nitrate's
terrible for the planet.

514
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,245
All right.

515
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:22,231
Can you not tell Lexi about this?

516
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:25,577
There's not many... girls...

517
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,064
there's not any girls who talk
to me like she does, you know?

518
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,173
And I don't wanna ruin that.

519
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,493
She's gonna want to see you, Chuck.

520
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,211
You guys were saving
the world together.

521
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:40,320
It's just not
as much fun as saving the girl.

522
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:42,485
Hang in there.

523
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:48,506
He actually incorporated
the phasing device into the vest.

524
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,045
The stolen phasing device.

525
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,624
But it's still a neat piece
of textile engineering.

526
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:54,695
I mean, press a button
and walk through walls?

527
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,750
But he wasn't wearing
the suit when we found him.

528
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,282
Which is why
the original project was discontinued.

529
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,909
The device uses molecular vibration
to change the quantum frequency.

530
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:06,297
Now, after enough exposure,
the body adopts the new frequency

531
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,097
and then starts phasing
uncontrollably.

532
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:12,057
He's already lost a finger. He's not
gonna leave pieces all over town?

533
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,061
Each of his molecules
is phasing randomly.

534
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:17,625
Now, fortunately for him, electricity
can bridge quantum frequencies.

535
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:21,194
The only thing holding him together
is the current within the cells.

536
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,936
That's not gonna be enough for long.
He's headed for full decoherence.

537
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,064
I mean, he will
literally fall apart.

538
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:28,201
We gotta be able to do better
than grow lights.

539
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:30,805
Well, this is every file
from the original project.

540
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:33,873
Every test subject ended up
phasing uncontrollably.

541
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:37,563
- Well, how did they save them?
- They didn't.

542
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:40,463
They tried everything
from point energy treatments

543
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,715
to graviphotons...
nothing worked.

544
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:45,885
But that doesn't mean
we're gonna give up trying.

545
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:46,809
Right.

546
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,305
That's obnoxious!
What's that beeping?

547
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:51,449
The... you know, the phone.

548
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,743
Never gonna get used to this.
Answer.

549
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,772
- Carter.
- <i>I can't find her, Jack.</i>

550
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:04,687
Hey. I called the number
12 times... nothing.

551
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:07,657
And I've emailed the Vashti retreat.
Zoe never got there.

552
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,627
Do you think she ran away?

553
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:11,874
No. No, I think we're beyond that.

554
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:13,061
I... think.

555
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,456
She was just really mad,
and I think I just made it worse.

556
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:18,837
- I'm gonna be sick.
- We... we'll go looking for her.

557
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:22,922
If she didn't want to talk to you,
I wish she'd have left you a message.

558
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:24,994
Yeah. Well...

559
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:27,685
wait.

560
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,653
I think she already did.

561
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,393
- What are you looking for out there?
- I'm sorry?

562
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,833
123 north, 39 west.

563
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:40,789
What's there?

564
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,902
Sheriff, my office is involved
in a number of sensitive projects...

565
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:46,974
listen to me, would you tell him,

566
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,573
or I swear to God,
I'll claw your eyes out.

567
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,093
You must be the sister.
The resemblance is uncanny.

568
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:56,439
My daughter's missing. Henry picked up
a message on an old military band.

569
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,738
It was a longitude, latitude,
and 4891.

570
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:02,872
That's Zoe's birthday.

571
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,089
Can you help me?

572
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,176
Of course.

573
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:13,811
This complex is massive.
Prewar.

574
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,373
- What, late'30s?
- I believe.

575
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,509
That's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?

576
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:20,627
These are the only remaining records.
The entire complex was buried

577
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:23,691
- and forgotten a long time ago.
- Well, till Zoe found it.

578
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:26,193
And the only access
was a collapsed elevator shaft.

579
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,028
No, if we extrapolate
from these plans,

580
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:30,043
there has to be a utility shaft
out from here.

581
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,992
- It would have been sealed off.
- No. It's right under Tesla.

582
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:34,798
Where the kids got in.

583
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,758
- If we open the doors...
- Done.

584
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:38,812
It's a huge facility.
We don't know where she is.

585
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:42,125
They sent a ULF signal,
which means the transmitter

586
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:43,711
has to be... right here.

587
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:45,810
In the control room.

588
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,383
If you only got one signal,
they probably lost power.

589
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:51,468
How do you know so much about it?

590
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:59,188
Okay, so it's a drop-lock system,
standard security before World War II,

591
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:02,210
which means that if the complex
is under attack and loses power,

592
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,810
the doors drop and lock.

593
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,276
According to the plans, the doors
are 20 inches of titanium and steel.

594
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,180
Okay. So we gotta cut through.

595
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,529
No. Not enough time.

596
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,930
- Time for what?
- Carter, they're running out of air.

597
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,533
Those doors are airtight.

598
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:16,660
And I got the message an hour ago.

599
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:20,978
- We gotta figure out how to get there.
- If we restore power,

600
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:24,159
we can open the doors, we have to turn
the switch on in the main generator,

601
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,143
which is...
here in the generator room,

602
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:29,631
which means you have to get
through four doors.

603
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,300
We can't cut that fast.

604
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,804
What if we don't cut?

605
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,876
I've got a crew pulling the Nd:YAG laser
from the fusion reactor.

606
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,474
We'll have it in place in a few hours
to melt the doors.

607
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:42,533
Too long...
with this I can go right through 'em.

608
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,780
But once you use the device, your body
will start changing frequencies.

609
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,567
Eventually, you will be
in a permanent phase state.

610
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,235
I'll get in there, I'll fire up
the generator. You can fix me later.

611
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:53,863
But we don't know how.
We're working on it.

612
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,534
- Look, Carter, I can't lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

613
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:01,563
If I don't come out,
I'll be stuck in a door. Easy to find.

614
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,683
Okay, it's not funny.
People have already died

615
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:06,166
because they couldn't find a way
to stop the phasing.

616
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:09,440
They didn't have Henry
and you to work on the problem.

617
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,866
I'll go.

618
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,267
Chuck, stay under the lights.

619
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,637
Those photons are the only thing
keeping you together.

620
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,742
No, I can make it.
I wanna help.

621
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:22,558
Easy, Chuck.

622
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:26,597
Let me take this one.

623
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,348
It's Zoe.

624
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:32,778
Okay.

625
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:35,706
I'll be back.

626
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:41,748
He'll do fine.

627
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,266
I always felt really brave
in that suit.

628
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,179
It's not the suit.

629
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:53,097
We reprogrammed the transmitter
for ULFs,

630
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,967
so we should be able to talk to you.

631
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,011
And the chances for decoherence increase
with the density of the material.

632
00:34:58,996 --> 00:34:59,929
Got it.

633
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:02,186
- What'd he say?
- You're gonna end up like Chuck.

634
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:05,089
Going through steel walls
is only gonna make it happen faster.

635
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:06,943
- Got it.
- The steel will adhere to you.

636
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,767
No matter how much it hurts,
keep moving.

637
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,624
If you stop, you're gonna
leave pieces of yourself behind.

638
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,000
- Good tip.
- Once you're inside the room,

639
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,622
the generator switch
will be straight ahead.

640
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:17,742
And Jack.

641
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,702
- Please don't screw up.
- Thanks.

642
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,686
- You okay?
- All in one piece.

643
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:04,305
That really hurts.

644
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:06,071
That hurts.

645
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,573
Think they got our message?

646
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:21,444
I don't know.

647
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:27,790
Two down.

648
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,746
<i>The interior doors are made
of a thinner alloy.</i>

649
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:34,017
<i>So you should have less
of a problem going through them.</i>

650
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:41,742
The generator room should be
straight ahead about, oh, 90 meters.

651
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:44,307
<i>Jack, this door is much thicker.</i>

652
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:46,496
<i>It's gonna hurt.
Don't stop.</i>

653
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:47,743
Last door?

654
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,464
I'm in.
I'm turning the vest off.

655
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:00,383
The activation switch should be
somewhere on the panel.

656
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,028
<i>I'm looking.</i>

657
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:07,411
Intrinsic field generator "A".

658
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:08,863
I got it.

659
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:11,036
Start.

660
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,861
That's my kind of button!

661
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:21,030
Tiny problem.
My hand just went through the console.

662
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,865
- He's phasing on his own.
- Didn't think it would happen so soon.

663
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:27,305
- It did, so what do we do?
- Working on it, Jack.

664
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,579
Hey, guys, I'm pretty far in.
Can I just call Zoe?

665
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,932
- What was that?
- Nothing.

666
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:36,447
Just Fargo's stupid phone.

667
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:40,057
I swear, if I still have hands
when I get outta here, I'm...

668
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:42,920
gonna... kiss you.

669
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:45,637
Pardon?

670
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:50,432
Henry you said that electricity
can jump quantum frequencies, correct?

671
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:52,394
Yeah. That's what's
holding you together.

672
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:55,179
Could I use the spark
in this implanted phone

673
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:56,981
to jump the start button?

674
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,181
That could close the circuit.

675
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:01,181
Yeah, or short out
the panel permanently.

676
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:03,530
But you know what,
we don't have time to fight about it.

677
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,656
So just try it.

678
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,493
Okay.
Here's to flipping a coin.

679
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,419
Call Zoe.

680
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,875
Doors are open!

681
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:42,068
Zoe?

682
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:43,783
Dad?

683
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,789
I'm hallucinating.
Anyone else?

684
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,120
Please tell me you're really here.

685
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:04,050
I'm really here.

686
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,259
I'm a little...
out of phase, but...

687
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,498
I'm here.

688
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:19,311
I'm so sorry I went in there.
I was mad and...

689
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,216
stupid and...

690
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,239
- I was trying to prove something.
- Honey, it's not that bad.

691
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,809
And when things went wrong,
you kept a clear head.

692
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,283
I'm... proud of you.

693
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,485
But that doesn't look good.

694
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,414
We've isolated a frequency
that will stabilize the phasing.

695
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,548
So you did solve it.

696
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,496
We just needed the right motivation.

697
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:44,130
It was a tricky problem.
Had we been off by one cycle per second,

698
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,799
we would have accelerated
the decoherence.

699
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:50,556
- Oh, I'm a guinea pig!
- No. No.

700
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,723
- We've already tested it.
- He insisted that we try it on him.

701
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,236
Brave man.

702
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,812
Sleep well, Captain Eureka.

703
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,056
- Oh, and Jack?
- Yeah.

704
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:05,049
I fixed your old radio.

705
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:21,689
Well, I guess I made it out
in one piece.

706
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,622
Yeah.

707
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,207
You okay?

708
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,428
When I didn't know where she was,
I was just really scared.

709
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,455
Oh. She's okay.

710
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:34,102
I don't know if I'm ready
for this, seriously.

711
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,995
I don't know if I'm ready to be a mom.

712
00:40:36,115 --> 00:40:37,256
You'll be fine.

713
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,910
It gets easier?

714
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:41,619
No!
No, not in the least!

715
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,550
It...
But you adapt, you know?

716
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,111
And...

717
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:50,100
and you're right.
Look, she can take care of herself.

718
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:54,491
- I hear Zoe's gonna recover.
- She's fine.

719
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:56,687
Thank goodness for that.

720
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:58,043
Ms. Thorne...

721
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:04,293
ever since you got to this town,
you've been looking for something.

722
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,090
Now, I believe that everyone
has the right to their own secrets.

723
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,689
But today...

724
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,804
four kids almost died.

725
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,449
Tell me what's going on.

726
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,236
No.

727
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:26,737
That's it?

728
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:28,927
Just no... no?

729
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:32,598
Sheriff Carter, I'm very sorry
for what happened to Zoe.

730
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:35,560
I never wanted anyone
to be hurt by this.

731
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,701
You've got to believe that.

732
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:39,751
I do.

733
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,284
And you gotta believe...

734
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:45,960
that I'm not gonna let this go.

735
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:48,045
Good day.
