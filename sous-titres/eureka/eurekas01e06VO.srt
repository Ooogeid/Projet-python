1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,530
this place rots.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,540
Stupid boring,quiet boring,one-horse boring town.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
Why do I have to burn my saturday volunteering?

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,770
You're not volunteering.
It's called community service.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,110
And you wouldn't be doing it if you didn't
pull the fire alarm during your I.Q. Test.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,200
I wouldn't be doing it if you hadn't arrested me.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,250
Sometimes it sucks having a dad
who's the town smokey.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,770
Sometimes it sucks having a daughter
who's the town delinquent.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,240
I take it back.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,710
Gee,thanks.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,710
It always sucks.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,950
please don't make me do this.I hate old people.

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,760
you don't do this,you won't live to be one.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,950
Can't we just discuss this?

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,370
You're going.End of discussion.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,750
I will do jail timE.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,500
Go. Scoot.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,690
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this,sir.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,140
No need to thank me,fargo.You've earned it.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,190
Having your own office is a right of passage.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,360
It's a symbol of status and rank.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,030
It tells the world you've arrived.

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,000
Not yet.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,840
Section five?

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,080
Pace yourself.

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,940
What's down here?

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,410
You...

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,030
and your new office.

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,390
Congratulations,fargo.

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,880
You deserve every square foot of it.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,920
Thanks.

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,750
what did you do to get put down here?

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,210
I earned it.

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,380
Having your own office is a right of passage.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,750
It's a symbol of status and rank.

36
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,680
Rank's the word all right.

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,240
It smells like something died in here.

38
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,560
Like,say,the 1970s.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,800
You have no vision.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Once all this junk's gone,
this will be an exemplary office space.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,520
- Just lacking - a woman's touch?

42
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,830
Style.

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
well,you got a lot of great stuff in here.

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,600
It just deserves our respect.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,490
The dumpster's down the hall to the left.

46
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,430
Dumpster? No-no-no-no.

47
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,510
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

48
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,750
Been nice doing business with you.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,580
Check this out!

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,410
What do you think?

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,640
Stereo?

52
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,310
Sure.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,130
First generation ipod.

54
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,820
how do you turn this thing on?

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,900
On?

56
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,110
It's got key holes.

57
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,890
And we got keys.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,210
I saw some in his desk over here.

59
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,590
Hey,these two match.

60
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,730
Here.Go unlock your side.

61
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,660
Ready...set...go.

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,730
Just another old piece of useless junk.

63
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,710
primary firing sequence initiated.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,920
Weapon will deploy in 24 hours.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,850
I don't think I like this station.

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,500
Car or no car,this is a 30 mile an hour zone.

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,020
Don't you have anything better
to do than harass me.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
No. Not really.

69
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,780
Now you do.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,130
Yeah,that can't be good.

Eureka S01EP06

75
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,390
what's going on,sheriff?

76
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,710
I was hoping you could tell me.

77
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,410
This sort of thing happen often?

78
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,500
Not to my recollection.
I've never seen anything like it.

79
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,670
It's some sort of I.C.B.M.

80
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,910
I. C. B.M?

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,540
Please.

82
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,870
Look at the circumference.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,510
Clearly,that's an I. R. B.M.

84
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,040
So you guys have seen this before?

85
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,290
- Nope. - Nope.

86
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,540
Thanks,guys.

87
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,580
Big help.

88
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,800
What do you think it is,sheriff?

89
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh,I know exactlywhat it is.

90
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,760
Trouble.

91
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,430
Carter.

92
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,320
It's allison. We've got trouble.

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,030
That's exactlywhat I said.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,730
Trouble.

95
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,280
Well,hello.

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,470
I'm doris stokes,the director.

97
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,770
You must be zoe.

98
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Unfortunately.

99
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,650
I've heard a lotabout you.

100
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,660
But everyone deservesa second chance,right?

101
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,520
Or a third or fourth.

102
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,260
Let's put you right to work,okay?

103
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,490
Actually,doris,I usually ease into my day
with a latte,maybe some sort of pastry.

104
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,300
Funny.

105
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,860
I understand we have youfor the next 13 saturdays.

106
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,290
13?

107
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,570
100 hours dividedby eight-hour shifts.

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm afraid thatthree months of saturdays
is not gonna work for me.

109
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,570
So why don't we say we'll justget the
whole thing over in one fell swoop?

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,460
let's start with the rec room.

111
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,570
Holy crap!

112
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,230
This is the rec room?

113
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,970
It's a nice placeto die.

114
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,870
Even nicer placeto live.

115
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,610
The residents of eurekagive so much.

116
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,480
This facility is our wayto give back.

117
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,550
run out of tennis balls?

118
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,460
I guess all the massagesin the world
can't stop you from losing your mind.

119
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,060
So,doris,are there any age restrictions
on getting a room here?

120
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,800
You've got a darlingsense of humor.

121
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,100
Come on.I've signed you to eugenia.

122
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,810
Eugenia,this is zoe.

123
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,630
She's going to assist you today.

124
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,090
If I desired assistance,
I'd be living inan assisted living facility.

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,110
Don't mind her.

126
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,110
She has a teence ofan attitude problem.

127
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,530
do not!

128
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,780
You two should get onjust fine.

129
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,030
You smoke?

130
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,840
No.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,650
Drink?No.

132
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,080
You lying?

133
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,940
Maybe.

134
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,950
What kind of a nameis zoe anyway?

135
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,810
It's a popular one.

136
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,410
You know,probably as popularas eugenia
was back inthe great depression.

137
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,660
For once,doris may be right.

138
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,470
How's my hair?

139
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,960
Your hair?It's fine.

140
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,130
How's my hair?Why are we whispering?

141
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,530
What matters most is the matterof
how we handle anti-matter.

142
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,350
That used to be me.

143
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,900
Anti-matter,unlike matter...

144
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,570
you used to talk to yourself?

145
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,830
No.

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,100
He used to talk to me.

147
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,400
It had to comefrom somewhere.

148
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,420
Keep looking.

149
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,610
Yes sir Dr.***

150
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,270
Allison.Glad to see you.Sheriff.

151
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,480
Scientist.

152
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,390
Which of your guysis responsible for
the cuban missile crisispopping up all over town?

153
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,090
They're not missiles.

154
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,400
Really?

155
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,960
Cause I have a town fullof extremely anxious
people who think they looka lot like missiles.

156
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,890
what are they,nathan?

157
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,980
And why do they looka lot like missiles?

158
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,330
We're working on it.

159
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,470
So you don't know?He doesn't know.

160
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,020
Don't touch the buttons.

161
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,560
I have to call this into the D.O.D.

162
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,610
Not yet.

163
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,160
We have plenty of timeto figure this out.

164
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,480
I can only wait so longand
I'll need to have answers.

165
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,090
Cause I have a town fullof extremely anxious
people who think they looka lot like missiles.

166
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
give us a little room,people.

167
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,120
Sir,henry's a lot smarterand faster than me

168
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,420
fargo,that's the best decisionyou've made all day.

169
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,470
Henry.

170
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,470
It's definitely a weaponand
this machine controls it.

171
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,990
- Tell me you knowmore than that.  - It's set to discharge a  hugeionosphere particle beam.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,670
- oh,jeez.
- Okay,thision-beam-thingy.That is what exactly?

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,810
Irradiated,uranium isotopes.

174
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,980
oh,god.

175
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,270
Oh,death ray.

176
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,540
Why didn't you just say"death ray"?

177
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,120
I searchedyour entire database.

178
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,020
There's not one single recordof silos,
irradiated isotopes,or ionosphere particle beams.

179
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,820
Try "death ray"?

180
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,060
It's as if the machinenever existed.

181
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,420
Did you try turning it off?

182
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,020
Why didn't I think of that?

183
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,790
Fargo,turn the machine off.

184
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,860
And that's a stupid question?

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,560
I mean,you did justturn it on,right?

186
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,850
That was an accident.

187
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,190
Jack,this machine was built atthe
height of the cold war.

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,460
There is no off switch.

189
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,800
Could you cut the power source?

190
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,070
And risk there's a fail-
safeand it fires immediately?

191
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm gonna take thatas a no.

192
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,440
How much timedo we have left?

193
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,100
weapon will deploy in 23 hours.

194
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,850
Finally,a straight answer.

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,720
we need to arrangefor transport trucks
and establishevacuation routes.

196
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,850
make emergency contingenciesfor
every location that could be hit.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
area hospitals should
be preppedfor emergency overflow.

198
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,150
and we'll need to estimatecollateral damage in
and aroundthe target perimeter.

199
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,890
Good.

200
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,590
You can hear us right?

201
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,640
Unfortunately.

202
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,340
You're panicking.

203
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,470
We're not panicking.We're reacting.

204
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,170
You say "death ray",we have a reaction.

205
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,720
You said death ray.

206
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,160
It's a ray,right?It causes immediate death?

207
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
Yes,it could causeimmediate death.

208
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,590
It could simply blow up
and people here wouldimmediately die.

209
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,340
It could strike moscow and people
there wouldimmediately die.

210
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,620
Then moscow would retaliate
and people everywhere wouldimmediately die.

211
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,980
Evacuation is moot.No place is safe.

212
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,030
You choose a great timeto be indifferent.

213
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm not indifferent,sheriff.

214
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,100
I'm focused.

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,460
We have 24 hoursand we happen to be in the most
advanced scientificfacility in the world.

216
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,470
Housing the largestsupercomputer in the world.

217
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,610
Populated by the smartestscientists in the world.

218
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,200
We have plenty of timeto figure
this out as long as we don't panic.

219
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,990
but we've downloaded,scanned,
and decrypted every file every schematic,

220
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,090
and every piece of paper of every
projectever developed here.

221
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,300
And there's nothing.

222
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,180
Well,maybe not everypiece of paper.

223
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,100
This is every piece of paper
I pulled from fargo's office.

224
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,650
This has to tell us about that machine.

225
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,420
Come on!Scientists are so smart.

226
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,260
How come they don't know
anything about penmanship?

227
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,270
Pardon the alliteration,but which would prefer?

228
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,970
Penmanship or progress?

229
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,100
Tequila.

230
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,990
Scotch.

231
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,030
Really?

232
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,430
What's "it"?

233
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,360
It what?

234
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,600
I.T.

235
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,340
It's scribbled at the bottomof all these pages.

236
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't know.Maybe information technologyperhaps

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,250
from the department from
which these documentsoriginated?

238
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,140
Looks more like someone'sinitials.

239
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,240
Well,you are the detective.

240
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,130
Marshal. Sheriff.

241
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,730
That sounds like a demotion.

242
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,680
Hand me some pics.

243
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,350
What's the shiny thing?Is that a solar flare?

244
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,250
that shiny thing is a mirror.

245
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,120
You do rememberthe moon landing,right?

246
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,110
Do not tell methat didn't happen.

247
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,620
No,it happened but we didn't
goto the moon just to walk.

248
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,770
We put mirrors all over the moon
to bounce signals back to the earth.

249
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,770
Telescopic images,satellite communications.

250
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,430
Death rays?

251
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
They weaponized the moon.

252
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,040
I mean,they can bounce a laser off the moon
and wipe out any targetthey want.

253
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,280
What,like tanks and stuff?

254
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,660
No,cities and stuff.

255
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,800
So you're telling me while the world watchedneil
armstrong take one small step for man

256
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,220
N.O.R.A.D. Took a giant leapfor themselves.

257
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,230
With the help from someoneat global.

258
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,830
Someone with the initials I.T.

259
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,550
I.T.

260
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,560
Oh!

261
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,130
Irvin thatcher.

262
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,250
It has to be irvin thatcher.

263
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,410
Irvin thatcher was thisbrilliant
scientist behind M.A.D.

264
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,850
M.A.D.D.?

265
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,670
Mothers against drunk driving?

266
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,180
Mutually assured destruction.

267
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh,that M.A.D.

268
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,220
You said he wasa brilliant scientist.

269
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,550
Was...or is?

270
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,420
this is Xplained.

271
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:06,310
The atom nucleus is comprised of positively-
charged protons and neutrally-chargedneutrons.

272
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:14,280
When a nucleus is bombarded by a neutrally-
chargedparticle,the result is fission.

273
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,320
Um,you lost me right after"
this is easily explained".

274
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,030
Okay.Let me try it another way.

275
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,620
Your father is a proton.

276
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,710
Your mother is a neutron.

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,190
You are a free radical.

278
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,130
You're caught stealing cds in the mall.

279
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,330
You hit your parentswith that news.

280
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,690
What happens?

281
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,560
They go nuclear?

282
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,600
Exactly.

283
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,650
And spliT.

284
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,210
You think that I'm the reasonmy parents split?

285
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,610
no-no-no-no.

286
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,910
zoe.

287
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,240
Zoe.

288
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,800
What? I'm doing the job.I'm helping people.

289
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm assistinG...people.

290
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,640
Be right back.Please...carry on.

291
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,860
This isthe "oppressive jerk
who's all up in yourbiznezz?"

292
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,770
I see you've found somethingto talk about.

293
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,960
Hi.Sheriff carter.

294
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,830
Nice to meet you.

295
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,900
I'm looking fora retired scientist.

296
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,870
Swing a cat.

297
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,310
A dr. Thatcher?

298
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,900
Irvin? Room 101.

299
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,260
But why do you want--

300
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,580
Wait for it.

301
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,890
Hey,room 101.That would be?

302
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,780
room 101?Right this way.

303
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,220
What do you need him for,sheriff?

304
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,610
There's a situation.

305
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,050
Even the brainiacs at globalcan't figure it out.

306
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,720
But there is one guyin town who can.

307
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,660
And apparently,this is the guy.

308
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,020
Dr. Thatcher?

309
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,070
this is the guy?

310
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,130
The question remains,fusion of fission?

311
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,450
Fission?Certainly not.

312
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,510
I haven't been fishin'since I lived on lake erie.

313
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,530
You think that's erie?

314
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,670
How do you explainquasar energy paradox?

315
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,460
Or baldness among musicians?Hmm?

316
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,360
This is the guy.

317
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,500
right this way,dr. Thatcher.

318
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,910
Right this way.

319
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,810
give the doctor some room.

320
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,750
Sir,sir!Right this way.

321
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,850
Dr. Thatcher,it's an honor.

322
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm henry deacon.

323
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,090
This machine of yours.It's really something.

324
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,060
It's like a riddleinside an enigma wrapped
in ten inchesof titanium alloy.

325
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,520
It's like a riddleinside an enigma
wrapped in ten inchesof titanium alloy.

326
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,970
using a singlechannel transponder package.

327
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,470
Or maybe asurvivable low frequency
communication system.

328
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,650
In which casewe'd have
to reassess certain aspectsof our approach.

329
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,210
Guys...go easy.

330
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,370
we need that launch code,sheriff.

331
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,420
Easy's not gonna get it.

332
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,430
Neither is browbeating the man.
Just give him a minute.

333
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,060
dr. Thatcher?

334
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,970
We think the controls arebehind this panel.

335
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,400
I just can't figure out how to get to them.

336
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,220
These locking bolts.

337
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,090
Are they some kind ofproprietary threading?

338
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,710
Reverse the hex.

339
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,670
Excuse me?

340
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,530
If you want sex,reverse the hex.

341
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,990
Sheriff,at any pointwhen you picked him up,

342
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,550
the car ride,the long walk down here--

343
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,250
Yeah,there may have been signs.

344
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,540
Righty loosey,lefty tighty.

345
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,640
Got it.

346
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,080
Bang up job.

347
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,560
Reverse the hex.

348
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,620
The screws recede.

349
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,760
It's brilliant.

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
Okay,dr. Thatcher.

351
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,850
All I need is a code to suspendthe launch signals.

352
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,760
Charlie,tango,lima.

353
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,650
No.Charlie never tangoed in lima.

354
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,740
you must be tired. Have a seat.

355
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,460
Don't give up.

356
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,770
Up,down.

357
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,660
Up,down.

358
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:04,600
The windows on the bus goup and down up and down
- any luck?

359
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:17,110
Windows on the bus goup and down up and down

360
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,980
is there gonna bea missile strike?

361
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,100
do we need to evacuate?

362
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,550
No reason to panic,folks.

363
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,900
I heard it was a death ray.

364
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,780
That's ridiculous.

365
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,150
That's obviouslya rumor.

366
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,230
Started by an idiot.

367
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,820
Who's he?Is he responsible?

368
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,410
Folks,listen up.Just go on home.

369
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,040
Situation's completelyunder control.

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,970
It could also bethermal conductive resistance.

371
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,370
Let me take a look.

372
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,380
Yeah,it look likethey used the classic formula.

373
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,780
Red for hot,blue for not.
Yellow's usually the ground.

374
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,300
So I guess...it's pretty safeto cut the blue.

375
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,890
- What do you think? - weapon will deploy in 20 hours.

376
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,330
Do it.

377
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,650
launch code override initiated.

378
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,740
Yes!

379
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,950
weapon will deploy in seven hours.

380
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,590
No.

381
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,640
Let's not cutany more wires.

382
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:50,650
dr. Thatcher,I know it's in there.
Just give us a hint.

383
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,510
Gravity.

384
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,930
The natural force of attractionexerted by a
celestial body upon objectsat or near its surface.

385
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,530
That's great.

386
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,260
Give me a second.

387
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,390
Look,we have our best peopleworking on this.

388
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,890
You don't know nathan,
but he will find a wayto shut it down.

389
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,380
Nothing againstyour husband--

390
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,440
ex.Soon to be ex.

391
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,910
But the man with the
answersis sitting right there.

392
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,460
We just need to figure out
how to get them out of him.

393
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,170
What?What what?

394
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,810
You got that look on your facelike you know
something I should know,but you're not telling me.

395
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,850
Spill!

396
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,930
I can'T.It's classified.It's nathan's turf,

397
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,000
- and there's no waythat he is gonna - allison,if we don't stop this thing,
there won't be any turf.

398
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,720
What is it?

399
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,700
Okay.Gravity. Got it.

400
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,530
What?

401
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,150
Hey,allison.

402
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,210
Absolutely not.

403
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,770
That technology is highlyexperimental
and far too dangerousfor anyone to

404
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,140
carter?Really?

405
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,720
That's just a riskwe may have to take.

406
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,620
So this is basicallya vulcan mind meld?

407
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,680
The px-24 allows one personto probe
the consciousnessof another.

408
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,350
In theory,anyway.

409
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,710
In theory?

410
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,330
Well,we haven't performeda human test run yet.

411
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,600
Oh.

412
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,360
"In memory of skippy."

413
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,470
Oh,he was everyone's favoritetest chimp.

414
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,530
Did he die on this thing?

415
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,230
No.

416
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,130
Autopsy was inconclusive.

417
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
Carter,listen.

418
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm not gonna thinkany less of you
if you don't wanna do this.

419
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,490
What am I looking for...again?

420
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,810
Sequences,equations,codes.

421
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,530
A kiss for luck?

422
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,490
Oh.

423
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,030
Last chance to be a hero,doc.

424
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,330
You just say the word.

425
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,350
Eh,worth a shot.

426
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,970
- the wheels on the bus go round and round carter,
- are you okay?

427
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,030
The wheels on the bus go round and round

428
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,650
eugenia.

429
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,050
Okay,I'm stopping this. No!Keep going.

430
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,830
stockholm.

431
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,630
Linus pauling.

432
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,470
Eugenia.

433
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,670
Eugenia.

434
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,640
Who is eugenia?Carter.

435
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,590
Did you see howto stop it?

436
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,520
No.

437
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,700
But I saw what happensif we don'T.

438
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,270
Irvin,we're gonna goand see that girl of yours.
Would you like that?

439
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,730
All right,don't play coy with me,okay?

440
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Ve been inside thatbig brain of yours.
I know how muchyou love her.

441
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,390
That doesn't go away,does it?

442
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,350
Well,I don't thinkit does.

443
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,110
And I know that whenyou're not thinking
about nuclear holocaust,

444
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,500
you're thinkingabout eugenia.

445
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,900
That's what I thought.

446
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,030
Got you with the nuclearholocaust thing,didn't I?

447
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,830
I put a trace on the hot wire.

448
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,360
The power source leadsout the back.

449
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,700
That's where the machineis vulnerable.

450
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,320
Now,if we can reach that,

451
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,800
then we can getto the guts of the thing.

452
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,200
I got a team in section 5working on
a laser bombardment drillthat

453
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,620
will bore right throughthe titanium shell.

454
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,710
Yeah,unfortunately,your guys in
section 4 tell me it's not titanium.

455
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,730
It's arconium carbonide,which is--

456
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,120
impenetrable.But.

457
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,580
I believe we can getthere from here,

458
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,770
through the baseof the machine.

459
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,460
If we tunnel down,under,and up,

460
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,940
we'll be directlybehind it.

461
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,450
And then I thinkwe got a shot.

462
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,530
Tell fargo to give youanything you need.

463
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,000
And not to touchanything you don'T.

464
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,580
bad news,good news.

465
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,120
We didn't get anythingfrom thatcher.

466
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,200
But carter wasn't hurtin the process.

467
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,870
And the good news?

468
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,670
Here you go,buddy.Take a seat.

469
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,360
I'll go lookfor eugenia,

470
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,490
and you enjoy,uh,the view.With a room.

471
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,580
Where is that?

472
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,170
Linus pauling.

473
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,460
Uh,royal palace.Uh,stockholm.

474
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,120
Sweden.

475
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,020
How do you know that?

476
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,230
I don't know.

477
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,610
I was there. When?

478
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,360
Recently.

479
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,480
Uh,um,do you knowwhere eugenia is?

480
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,380
She's notto be disturbed.

481
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,820
Her words,not mine.

482
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,470
Come on.

483
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,120
This is her.

484
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,520
Eugenia?

485
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,490
Eugenia,it's zoe.

486
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,300
Has she donesomething wrong?

487
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,280
No,no.

488
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,550
Eugenia,it's sheriff carter.I need to talk to you.

489
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,380
Is there somethingI should know?

490
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,230
No.

491
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,890
There is,isn't there?

492
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,880
Actually,yeah.

493
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,550
Yeah,that crack I madeabout
your being a delinquent.

494
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,710
Yeah.

495
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,780
Didn't mean it.

496
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,920
You're my girl.

497
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,780
It's really bad,isn't it?

498
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,630
No.

499
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,810
eugenia!

500
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,510
Eugenia?

501
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,100
Eugenia?

502
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,360
eugenia.

503
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Come in,jo.

504
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,150
Where are you,jo?

505
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,000
Come on,jo,talk to us.

506
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,110
We all live here.We have a right to
knowwhat's going on.

507
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,950
What is the trajectoryof the weapon?

508
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,650
is there a sea-basedboost phase intercept?

509
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,430
have the launch protocolsbeen initiated?

510
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,290
Don't know.

511
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,490
Don't know,don't know.

512
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,310
Go home.

513
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,560
We've got everythingunder control.

514
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,760
Except for that.

515
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,380
zoe,think.Did she say anythingabout
going anywhere,doing anything?

516
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,090
- Not that I remember.
- Well,how about family?

517
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,490
Some kidspicking her up,something?

518
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,700
It never came up,okay?

519
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,410
Where is that?

520
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,590
the mensa thing.

521
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,390
Yeah,I seriously doubtyou can compete.

522
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,550
No,the sundial.Where is that?

523
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,170
- Copernicus park.
- I can s

524
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,390
it's on the south sideof
the distilled water tower.

525
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,600
Come on,that's wherewe find my girl.

526
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,130
I thought I wasyour girl.

527
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,220
Wait,that sounded weird.

528
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,380
Henry,how's--

529
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,210
Henry,how's the--

530
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,530
Henry,how's the drillinggoing?!

531
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,520
This laser bombardment drill cuts
through quartz like butter.

532
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,530
I should be done drilling in,what,

533
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,430
uh,five hours.

534
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,790
Weapon will deploy in four hours.

535
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,730
Drill faster.

536
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,930
Yeah.

537
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,900
oh,my god.

538
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,280
Eugenia,what--

539
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,480
what are you doing?How--how'd you even get here?

540
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,080
Henry souped upmy chair.

541
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,160
I can go 50 milesbetween charges.

542
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,100
So why have I been pushing youaround all day?

543
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,150
I wanted you to feel goodabout yourself.

544
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,220
Like you were assisting.

545
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,360
Fine.

546
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,100
I didn't hatethe company.

547
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,770
Dad,are you okay?

548
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,460
eugenia.

549
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,570
Dad,what the hellare you doing?

550
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
Why did you do that?

551
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,110
Uh...I'm not sure.

552
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,360
Mind your own business,zoe.

553
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,450
Uh,sorry.

554
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,210
Uh,your anniversary.Our anniversary.

555
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,030
Anniversary.

556
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,020
Of what?

557
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,000
You and me.H-him.

558
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,730
Thatcher.

559
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,350
Anniversary?

560
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,980
He never even proposed.

561
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,880
Yes,he did.

562
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,960
Uh--

563
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,350
I saw it.

564
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,440
Trust me.Never happened.

565
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,500
Is dementia contagious?

566
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,270
No--uh,okay.

567
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,020
In--in--in his mind,he proposed.

568
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,420
I mean,right here.That's why you come here.

569
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,210
I come here...

570
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,760
for lunch...

571
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,270
every day.

572
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,860
This is wherewe first met.

573
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,730
We'd sit...

574
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,820
and look at the sky.

575
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,570
He told me howthe stars shined,

576
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,700
how the planets revolvedaround the sun.

577
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,420
How his universe revolvedaround me.

578
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,260
And then his universecame
crashing down and mine with it.

579
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,750
What happened?

580
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,310
We were goingto get married in
stockholm after irvin won the prize.

581
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,070
The nobel prize?

582
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,840
No one imaginedlinus pauling
would win a second nobel.

583
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,840
It was devastatingto irvin.

584
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,840
He had a completemental break
the dayof the announcement.

585
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,170
The day he was goingto propose.

586
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,410
The day I lostthe love of my life.

587
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,520
The picture.

588
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,360
The virtual stockholm.

589
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,100
You must thinkI'm a fool.

590
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,800
Pining over a lovethat's gone.

591
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,390
It's not gone.

592
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,220
We just have to pick upwhere we left off.

593
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Did I say we?Mm-hmm.

594
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,720
Sorry.

595
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,410
weapon will deploy in three hours.

596
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,380
Well,there's gottabe something.

597
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,780
I mean,use explosivesto blast
through the rest of the bedrock.

598
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,810
This machine was programmedas
a second-strike,dead man's weapon.

599
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,900
Any kind of explosion and--

600
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,180
I cannot believewe built
this thing to protect ourselves.

601
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,070
I'm gonna have to puta call in to the D.O.D.

602
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,000
- You can'T.
- I have to.

603
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,780
You can't!

604
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,860
I think that they'll notice
if we startworld war iii.

605
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,570
allison,think about it.

606
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,450
What are you gonna say?

607
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,830
"We may accidentallyblow up
"moscow,beijing,pyongyang,and stockholm?"

608
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,070
Okay,I know how fondyou are of stockholm,nathan.

609
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,310
But this is biggerthan you.

610
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,050
If you tell themthat we can't stop it,

611
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,280
they're gonna tryand stop it.

612
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,290
They'll nuke us and--

613
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,620
and,I know,any kind of explosion
can trigger the device.

614
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,590
I get it.

615
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,100
But we're runningout of options.

616
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,060
Beg to differ.

617
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,410
Gonna need to borrowyour nobel.

618
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,470
It was open.

619
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,440
Oh. Sorry.

620
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,660
What in the hellare you doing?

621
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,050
We're gonna partylike it's 1962.

622
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,500
I miss sheriff cobb.

623
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,990
You should wear that dressmore often.

624
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,190
Do you think this'll work?

625
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,800
Works for me.

626
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,350
Let's hope so.

627
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,240
Oh,sheriff.

628
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,210
When a light bulb goes offin your head,
what are we talking?

629
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,830
15,20 watts?

630
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,060
If you have a better idea,I'd love to hear it.

631
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,180
No? Yeah.

632
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,650
Better get started.

633
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,540
Jo? Wow.You look--

634
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,580
no,you look.

635
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,380
...Joining us here in stockholm.

636
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,740
Robert oppenheimerfamously said,

637
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,760
"the atomic bomb"made the prospect of
future war unendurable."

638
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,690
One man never forgotthose words.

639
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,220
A man we welcome among us today.

640
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,220
A man whom

641
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,160
the nobel committee and the norwegian parliament

642
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,860
have selected for this year's
awardof the nobel prize,

643
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,400
dr. Irvin horatio thatcher.

644
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,980
Fargo.

645
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,000
Dr. Thatcher.

646
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,160
I got that.

647
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,950
Thank you.

648
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,180
He's been carryingthat speech for 40 years.

649
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,590
The wheels on the bus go round and round

650
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,000
round and round round and round

651
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,170
the wheels on the bus go round and round

652
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,690
round and round round and round

653
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,780
a simple littlechildren's song.

654
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:18,220
But it was this songthat inspired
my concept of mutually assureddestruction.

655
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,510
We build an a-bomb,they build an a-bomb.

656
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,770
We build an h-bomb,they build an h-bomb.

657
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,050
Round and round,round and round.

658
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:33,580
The wheels on the busleading us towards
an unending escalationof newer,

659
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,160
more powerful,more deadly weapons.

660
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,380
Which is what led me to my greatestachievement.

661
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,060
The ionosphere particle beam.

662
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,170
In order to ensure peace on earth,

663
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,510
I built the deadliest weaponin the universe.

664
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,520
But that's the endof the story.

665
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,970
Let me take you backto the beginning.

666
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,910
We don't have timeto go back to neverland.

667
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,450
Uh,dr. Thatcher.

668
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,850
There's an urgent situationwith your weapon
that needs your attention.

669
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:11,820
Oh.Sorry.

670
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,930
I would just like to end by thankingthe committee.

671
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,350
And eugenia,my love,

672
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,900
without whom this achievement
would nothave been possible.

673
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,910
We have a lotof catching up to do.

674
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,080
I don't like that look.What's wrong?

675
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,180
My crew.

676
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,190
I've gotta get my crew to fix the device.

677
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,640
Your crew?

678
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,340
Eastern world is exploding violence flaring

679
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,890
and bullets loading you're old enough to kill

680
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,260
but not for voting you don't believe in war

681
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,390
what's the gun you're toting

682
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,330
even the jordan river has bodies floating

683
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,200
don't you tell me over and over

684
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,300
and over again my friend

685
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,770
- that you don't believe
-oh,my god.

686
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,860
30 secondsand counting,guys.

687
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,140
Ready.

688
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,620
Set.

689
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,510
Go!

690
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,680
launch code override initiated.

691
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,430
yes!

692
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,520
Oh,crap.

693
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,410
dead man's protocol activated.

694
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,160
Launch sequence initiated.

695
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,830
Weapon will deploy in five minutes.

696
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,720
Did somebody cutthe blue wire?

697
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,640
Not good.

698
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,810
Very not good.

699
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,410
This is the onethat assures mutually
assureddestruction.

700
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,800
How do we stop it?

701
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,200
You can'T.

702
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,830
It can't be shot down.

703
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,490
Henry,how much timedo we have left?

704
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,730
30 seconds.

705
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,870
*******

706
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:34,070
********

707
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,510
- ten.
- Will it work?

708
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,750
I think desperate timescall
for desperate measures.

709
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,650
Henry,when you outfittedmy jeep,
did you put inany air bags?

710
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,840
Carter.Carter,where are you

711
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,370
4.3.2.

712
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,250
Zap!

713
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,530
Henry,you got it?

714
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,500
I got it.

715
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,420
It missed!

716
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,200
We missed the moon!

717
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,260
carter,carter!

718
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,730
Great job,man.

719
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,430
We missed the moon.We missed the moon.

720
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,440
We missed it!Ha,ha,ha!

721
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,390
Little help?

722
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,170
But where did it go?

723
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,090
the zephyr rover is making
its final approach to jupiter.

724
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,000
pasadena,we have a problem.

725
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,470
That's gonna be a shiner.

726
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,850
Yeah,well.

727
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,460
One small step for man,one giant weltfor me.

728
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,970
So,when are you gonna
tell him my nobel isn't histo keep?

729
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,300
I don't know.He saved your .I think he earned it.

730
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,430
No,I earned it.

731
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,440
It's mine.

732
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,770
Take it away.Lose a great scientist.

733
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,190
It's not a difficult equation.

734
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,040
You never know,you might need thatcher to
dismantle the nextticking time bomb.

735
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,030
Good point.

736
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,580
Really?

737
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,400
You did a good job,carter.

Thanks.

739
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,400
I had a little helpfrom my crew.

740
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,700
You remember that feeling?

741
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,480
Yeah.

742
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,150
It's nice to knowthat it lasts a lifetime.

743
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
Yeah,kind of depressing.

744
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,540
A little.Yeah.

745
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm just grateful that wefinally got together.

746
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,610
I said "we" again,didn't I?

747
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,370
Yeah.

748
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,690
How long is this supposedto last?

749
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,170
