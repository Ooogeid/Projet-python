1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,970
It was just crossed the road and--

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,860
This is what happens 
when you don't look both ways.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,250
He's lost a lot of blood.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,920
-Why don't we take him to a real vet? 
-We are,the best in the world.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,590
He's got a labin section 3.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,160
Hey,hear that,buddy?

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,530
We're gonna fix you right up.

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,770
 you're gonna love this.

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,400
Well,after three years of development
I hope so.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,190
Have you decidedon a name yet?

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,740
I like mental mouse

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,270
because it formsa direct neural link

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,590
between your cerebral cortexand the 
computer mainframe.

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,930
Bluetooth for the brain.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,920
It looks likea melanoma.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,010
Well,that's because

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,000
it's not turned on.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,320
So this transmitsmy thoughts 
directly to the computer.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,980
That's right. 
No need for a keyboardor a mouse.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,170
You think it here,comes out there.

21
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,240
Fantastic.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,910
Except it doesn't work.

23
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,300
What do you mean?

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm trying to accessyour personnel file
and it's not working.


25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,730
Why are you tryingto access my file?

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,580
To see if you'reremotely qualified

27
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,540
to be tapping into mycerebral cortex.

28
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,860
It's not working because 
it hasn't finished mapping your brain yet.

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,660
In an hour or so,things will start popping up
before you even know you want them..

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,990
Now,these lines representdifferent emotions.

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,850
Red for anger,blue for happiness,

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,990
green for depression.

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,140
So you've equipped me

34
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,570
with a very expensivemood ring.

35
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,950
I'll take it from here.

36
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
It's not a mood ring.

37
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,110
It maps emotionsto better 
convert brain activityinto commands.

38
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,620
-If you think about it,it's actually-- 
-fargo.

39
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,470
Look at the screen.

40
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,930
Uh,yeah,you--you can take it from here.

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,820
My thoughts exactly.

42
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,310
Taggart's your world-renowned vet?

43
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,920
Graduated magna from the university 
of melbourne.

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,670
I thought you werea cryptozoologist.

45
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,570
Well,the studyof unknown species 
is more of a hobby.

46
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,290
Which means he knows moreabout animals

47
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,640
than any normal vet.

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,780
It means he knows more about pretend animals.

49
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,910
I can't fix this.

50
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,110
Okay,let's take him to a real doctor.

51
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,900
I said i cannot fix it.

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,000
But my little friends can.

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,320
You've made friends with sand now?

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,890
Not sand.Nanoids.

55
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,090
Remember carl carlson?

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,060
We've been ableto reverse engineer

57
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,930
some of his discoverieson cellular
regeneration

58
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,190
and adapt them to nanotechnology.

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,570
Normally,I'm opposed to animal testing.

60
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,190
But in this case,

61
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,050
I'll makean exception.

62
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,990
So you're gonna treat lowjack

63
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,230
with itsy-bitsy robots?

64
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,820
They've been programmed to analyze and mimic

65
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,330
biological structuressuch  
as bone tissue and hair. 

66
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,970
They're activatedand controlled

67
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,110
by ultra-low-frequencyradio signals.

68
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,390
Man,that's a little creepy.

69
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,300
Told you he was good.

70
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,300
Their programming's simple.

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,140
Repair and replicate.

72
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,920
Just like human cells.

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,340
They'll serve as sort of a living band-aid

74
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,880
until his tissuescan heal.

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,170
I assume I can trust you to let low  
jack go once he's healed?

76
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,370
There's no sportin catching him 
in this condition.

77
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,910
Sc-- Scout's honor.

78
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,610
Mmm,there are no scouts in australia.

79
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,610
Oh,yeah,there are.And believe me.

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,810
I assume I can trust you to let low  
jack go once he's healed?

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,720
I could tell you stories.

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,760
Prefer you didn'T. 
Just take care of the dog.

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,510
Will do,sheriff.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
-See you,jo. 
-Later,tag.

85
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,740
-Tag? 
-Shut up.

86
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,090
-Tag. 
-Shut up.

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,160
I've got you now,my furry friend.

88
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,840
All the years you've tormented me.

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,210
Mocked me.

90
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,570
Yeah,look who's laughing now.

91
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,440
All right.

92
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,560
Truce,then.

93
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,480
But just till you'reup and about.

94
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,490
-Dr. Stark? 
-Kinda busy,larry.

95
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,540
You having anycomputer problems?

96
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,530
Not till now.

97
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,530
You should probably get that mole checked.

98
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,540
Could be a melanoma.

99
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,840
Do you need something,larry?

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,170
I picked up a computer glitch in this area.

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,090
It may require shutting downsections  
of the mainframe to isolate the problem.

102
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,760
I'll need your authorization.

103
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,590
It's always somethin.

104
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,960
Just pray it's notthe lorena bobbitt virus.

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,850
I'm sorry?

106
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,300
Turns your hard driveinto a 3 1/2-inch floppy.

107
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,370
Guess I'll get to it,then.

108
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,450
Please.

109
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,990
Lorena bobbitt virus.

110
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,220
Kills me every time.

111
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,490
I still rememberour first encounter.

112
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,300
Here we go.

113
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,720
Ironic that animal testing created you.

114
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Now it's saved you.

115
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,980
But for a dog with a 130 I.Q.,

116
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,640
You should know to watch out for cars.

117
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
Need to paycloser attention,mate.

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,850
You'll wind up dead.

119
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,180
That's how I've survived all these years.

120
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,430
Attention to detail.

121
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,630
What the--

122
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,070
How'd you get in here?

123
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,260
Aaagh!

127
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,890
I'm telling you,fargo,it's not working.

128
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,170
It keeps bringing up stuff  
I'm not even looking for.

129
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,460
 Like what?

130
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,040
What differencedoes that make?

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,560
The subconscious is extremely 
open to suggestion.

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,610
When I first tried it out,it kept   
bringing up buffy fan sites.

133
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,030
Wh--which I'm totallynot into.

134
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,060
Even on a-- um--

135
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,780
-a subconscious level. 
-Am I interrupting something?

136
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,640
Actually
Dr. Stark and iwere just discussing--

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,410
not even remotely.

138
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,140
If you're hereto invite me

139
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,650
to the lise meitner dance,

140
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,340
I might still be available.

141
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,660
Okay.You are not here 
to invite me to the dance.

142
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,990
No.

143
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,150
What's in the envelope?

144
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,300
Oh.

145
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,450
I see you've signed them.

146
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,740
I just thought that,uh, 
seeing where we areright now...

147
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,500
That,um,maybe it was time.

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,580
Okay.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
I mean,unless you think that--

150
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,720
I think we should've done 
this a long time ago.

151
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,050
I've just gotten so busy,sometimes,uh,

152
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,760
little things get lost in the shuffle.

153
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,420
Little things,right.

154
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,410
And with everything that's happened

155
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,420
between you and carter--

156
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,740
this has nothing to dowith carter.

157
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,020
Well.

158
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll just put them in your box

159
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,530
when I'm done.

160
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,760
Fine.

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,830
I guess that's it,then.

162
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,590
Unless there's something elseyou needed.

163
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,070
No.

164
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,550
I think I,uh,got what I came for.

165
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,730
Remember,jo,call me in two minutes.

166
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,910
Not a second more.

167
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,630
 hey!

168
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,690
What are you doing here?

169
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,720
They asked me to helpset up for the dance.

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,700
-What are you doing here? 
-Sound check.

171
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,270
For--?

172
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,090
The finale.

173
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,310
I represent the band.

174
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,150
You represent the band?

175
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,450
Spencer.Yeah
he's actually a really good musician.

176
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,790
Groundbreaking beats,

177
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,270
like moby meets devo.

178
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,270
Moby...devo...

179
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,040
spencer?

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,650
No,not feel in it.

181
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,900
We're still working on a stage name.

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,500
But I have him booked monday nights at caffdiem.

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,400
And I'm working on a deal with itunes.

184
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,590
And,as his manager,I get 15%.

185
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,310
And what's he get?

186
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,490
Well,nothing so far.But--

187
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,520
jack.

188
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,780
Hey,henry.

189
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,860
-How you doin'? 
-Good.

190
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,080
-How you doin'? 
-All right.

191
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,100
So you got ropedinto this too,huh?

192
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,670
This is eureka's mostimportant 
event of the year.

193
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,540
Are you really hereto help set up?

194
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,690
Uh,oh,yeah.Absolutely.

195
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,060
I'd like nothing more.

196
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,990
In that case,and on behalf of lise meitner?

197
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,920
I thank you.

198
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,410
And if I knewwho that was,

199
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,730
that might mean something.

200
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,780
She was an austrian physicist

201
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,480
who discovered nuclear fission.

202
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,460
Which then led to the inventionof 
the atomic bomb.

203
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,160
Oh,well,by all means,

204
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
let's celebrate that.

205
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,250
Meitner refused to workon the bomb,dad.

206
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,410
Tonight's dance is a tributeto her ingenuity,

207
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,570
not what others choseto do with it.

208
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,120
Her passion for exploration,

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
her commitmentto bettering the world

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,360
is the ideal eureka is meantto strive to meet.

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,950
That's what we're celebrating.

212
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,700
And celebrate we shall.

213
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,730
Check out the subwoofer on this bad boy.

214
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,440
That little thing?

215
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,350
Hey,bigger isn'tnecessarily better.

216
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,230
Keep tell in' yourself that.

217
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,820
The next soundyou'll hear

218
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,520
is me blow in your minds.

219
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,800
Mind or eardrums?

220
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,470
Moby.

221
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,660
Devo.

222
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,920
Hey,partner,what's up?

223
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,660
Oh,hey,Allison.

224
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,820
No,I was expecting someone,uh...

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,850
else.

226
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,080
What?

227
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,210
Seriously?

228
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah,yeah,I'll be right there.

229
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,750
Um,sorry,everybody.

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,540
I can't stay and help.Duty calls.

231
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,180
Your dad is the worst liar.

232
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,050
Well,luckily,I take after my mother.

233
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,290
Larry called security
but they only caught part of the call.

234
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,640
What did he say?

235
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,820
"Nice."The rest was garbled.

236
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,830
-That's it?- 
-That's it.

237
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,520
Yeah,that's what I thought.

238
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,700
What?

239
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,640
It's really creepyin there.

240
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
That's some really sharppolice work,carter.

241
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,030
Sure he didn't justgo out for a smoke

242
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,240
or to his carfor a nap?

243
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,840
-Carter. 
-Some people needtheir afternoon nap.

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,460
Like me,for example.

245
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,640
-Carter. 
-It's well documented,allison.

246
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,650
A siesta works.

247
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,680
It increases worker satisfactionand productivity,

248
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,420
and it is a dying art.

249
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,020
Napping is not an art.

250
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,520
You haven't seen me nap. 
I take itto a whole new level.

251
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,370
Stop stalling and get in the tunnel.

252
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,280
I'd be more effective with the proper amount  
of rest.That's all I'm saying.

253
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,980
Sheriff.

254
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,690
I heard about larry.

255
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,940
And I'm coming with you.

256
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,140
Not that I don't enjoy your company,but why?

257
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,810
He's one of my dearest friends.

258
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,790
Uh--really?

259
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,010
Are we talking about the same larry?

260
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,130
Just because you choose not to fraternize

261
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,520
with the support staff doesn't mean others don't.

262
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,000
Which is your loss.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,800
Because larry happens to bea very sensitive guy.

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,230
You wanna try out one of your new toys,don't you?

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,720
I--I've--I got a new G.P.S. Locator

266
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,930
and night-vision goggles.

267
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,560
I brought me hand-me-downs for you.

268
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,560
Lucky me.

269
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,190
See anything?

270
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm in a long,dark tunnel.

271
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,900
That's becauseyou don't have

272
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,950
ultra-infraredvision goggles.

273
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,730
Got me there.

274
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,730
Not like larryto leave his post.

275
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,960
I've got a bad feeling.

276
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,690
Given where we are,I have a bad feeling.

277
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,910
About ten more feet,we should hit a junction.

278
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,150
We can split up there.

279
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,040
Whoa,hang on.

280
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,770
Fine,you baby.

281
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,120
We'll stick together.

282
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
But it's far more efficientif we split up.

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,610
Taggart,shut up.

284
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,120
You shut up.

285
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Just listen.

286
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,000
What is that?

287
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Sounds insectoid.

288
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,010
Is that even a word?

289
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,030
Yeah,I think so.

290
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,780
What's that?

291
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,220
I don't know.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,610
But it got larry.

293
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,550
We're going to need more fire power.

294
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,600
Gopher carter.

295
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,010
Hey,you guys need to come back. 
We have an problem.

296
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,750
Yeah,more than one.

297
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,060
A person is missing.

298
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,820
We found his equipment in the service tunnel.

299
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,730
I don't careif I'm missing.

300
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,770
You don't go poking arounda billion-dollar  
mainframe without asking me.

301
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,080
And you do not

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,770
send a copand a glorified vet

303
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,780
into the brainof global dynamics without  
following protocol.

304
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,140
They're not even wearingcleansuits.

305
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,110
Well,larry's still missing.

306
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,460
What do you propose we doabout it?

307
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't care what you do.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,420
Just do not compromisethe safety 
of this facility

309
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,550
while you do it.

310
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,920
Look,I didn't want to go in there

311
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
in the first place.

312
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,600
W-what is that?

313
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,950
It's my thresholdfor incompetence.

314
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,860
Looks like a melanoma.

315
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,140
Get out.

316
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,790
Your hubby's in a mood.

317
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,750
He's not my hubby anymore.

318
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,220
I know,I know,he's your estranged husband.

319
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,820
No,I gave him the divorce papers to sign.

320
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,930
Which is why he'sin the mood.

321
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,820
Seriously?

322
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,760
Seriously.

323
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,550
Uh,I'm just gonna gocheck on the pooch.

324
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,340
Call meif you need me,sheriff.

325
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,220
Yeah,I'll do that.

326
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,100
Are you okay?

327
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,110
Yeah,let's just focuson larry.

328
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,590
Sure. Um--

329
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,780
we'll startwith the security footage,
and then we'll doa floor-by-floor sweep.

330
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,540
If he's in the building,we'll find him.

331
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,410
I'm fine.

332
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,580
There you are.

333
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,690
People are looking for you.

334
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Lowjack?

335
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,140
How'd you get out of your cage?

336
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,120
I told 'em they were over reacting,but,um,

337
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,770
you should probably tell 'em you're here.

338
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,900
Get back here,you mutt!

339
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,210
Where the hell did he go?

340
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,480
Did you hear that?

341
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,510
The last footage we have of larry is  
entering the service corridor.

342
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,440
Then the abbreviated message.

343
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,370
He never came out.

344
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,590
He must bein there somewhere.

345
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm starting to wonder what else is down  
there with him.

346
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,180
I've got an idea.

347
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,760
Here's lowjack,locked in his cage.

348
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
But I just saw him up on section 1.

349
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,090
Or at leastI thought I did.

350
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,320
Gave me the slip.

351
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,590
That's the leastof our problems.

352
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,680
You lost your nano-bugs?

353
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,740
I didn't lose them.They escaped.

354
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,650
-Where did they go? 
-Could they have gone there?

355
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,870
That's where larry went.Taggart.

356
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,220
I don't know how they got out.

357
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,350
They were in deactivated sleep mode.

358
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,070
It's not in their programming 
to initiate commands.

359
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,270
Well,can't you use your
um,remote control thingie

360
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,610
and make 'em march home?

361
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,800
I tried that.

362
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,510
They're not responding.
They must be out of range.

363
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,240
Then you need to getwithin range.

364
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,760
Inside the many miles of dark
creepyservice tunnels.That's great.

365
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,800
They can't get too far.

366
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,300
The E.M. Umbrella will keep them inside global.

367
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,120
What--what's that?

368
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,600
Global dynamics is protected

369
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,060
by an electromagneticbarrier.

370
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,350
It prevents anyone from broadcasting

371
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,490
any non-secured signals outor sending them in.

372
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,240
The nanoids can't breachthe barrier

373
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,250
without fryingtheir circuitry.

374
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,120
We just need to get within range 
of the remote control.

375
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,560
You better get to it,then.

376
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,290
Where are you going?

377
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,880
To tell nathan I wantto lock the facility down.

378
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,180
The less area they haveto move around in,

379
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,760
the faster we'll be ableto catch them.

380
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,410
Dr. Stark.

381
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,170
Is there somethingI can help you with?

382
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,840
Dr. Stark,what are you doing?

383
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,840
Why are you deactivating the E.M. Barrier?

384
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,540
Dr. Stark? Oh no no---

385
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,900
Where is he?

386
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,190
This is allison blake.

387
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,600
I need to initiatesecurity protocol  
lockdown,level three.

388
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,840
Dr. Stark is unavailable.This is my call.

389
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,100
What was that?

390
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,470
Lock down.

391
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,550
That's comforting,considering 
we're stuck down here.

392
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,480
Yeah.E.M. Burst gun,just in case.

393
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,490
Just in case what?

394
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,750
Mm-hmm,exactly.

395
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,890
These nanoids,um--

396
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,270
How many are we looking at,exactly?

397
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,780
I don`t konw.

398
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,610
They're programmedto self-replicate,

399
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,800
using any available sourceof carbon as fuel.

400
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Well,where do they getthe carbon?

401
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,280
This,uh,computer stuff?I think.

402
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,360
No,carbon's in anything living.

403
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm something living.

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
So am I.

405
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,480
This just getsbetter and better.

406
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,560
Nathan,where have you been?

407
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,030
There's a situation.Escaped nanotechnology.

408
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,110
I had to put uson lockdown.

409
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,320
Carter and taggartare searching now.

410
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,200
Okay,please don't give methe silent treatment.

411
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,700
It's obvious that you're upset with me.

412
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,840
You know,I'm upset,too. 
Why don't we just talk about it?

413
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,290
Some indication of 
how you're feeling would be nice.

414
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,580
That would bean indication.

415
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,980
Nathan.

416
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,460
Why is your skin so cold?

417
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,080
You hear that?

418
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,320
I've got something.

419
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,190
Yeah? We're getting closer.

420
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,160
I think we're there.

421
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,460
What is it?

422
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,090
It's,um...

423
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,440
their carbon source.

424
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,880
Larry.

425
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,080
Or what's left of him.

426
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,700
Oh,no.

427
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,510
You know,if you have 
that nanoidremote control handy

428
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,320
now would be a really good time to use it.

429
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,660
Anytime.

430
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,920
I don't know how to say this.

431
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,690
-It's not working? 
-That's how.

432
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,200
Getting movement.

433
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,110
Where?

434
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,510
Right...

435
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,690
There.

436
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,990
Lowjack?

437
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,040
This isn`t Lowjack

438
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,340
There will never beenough showers

439
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,090
for me to feel clean again.

440
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,620
Did you know that was gonna happen?

441
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,530
Absolutely not.

442
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,300
Maybe a bit.

443
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,270
Get the hell off me!

444
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,360
What--sto--

445
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,540
na--nathan,what's wrong with you?

446
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,530
Nathan,stop it.

447
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,780
Nathan.

448
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,930
Nathan,stop it.

449
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,120
Yeah.That wasn't nathan.

450
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,170
What the hell was that thing?

451
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,060
Things.Taggart's nanoids can apparentlymake  
copies of us now.

452
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,460
You've gotta be kidding me.

453
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,390
No,they're on a binge.We found larry.

454
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,480
Or what's left of him.

455
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,790
-He's dead?
-Devoured.

456
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,540
And they're using his bodyas a carbon source.

457
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,560
Then where's the real nathan?

458
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,030
Caution.Electromagnetic barrier  
is disengaging.

459
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,360
Dead or alive,we have to find him.

460
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,430
We will.I promise.

461
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,510
How do these things work?

462
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,080
I mean,one is harmless,

463
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,220
but a millioncan eat larry?

464
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,270
It's calleddistributed computing.

465
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,030
Each individual nanoidis like a brain cell.

466
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,050
The more there are,the smarter they become.

467
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,460
They communicate with each other

468
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,070
over very low frequencies

469
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,850
and sharethe thinking workload.

470
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah,but they're justtiny computers,right?

471
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,830
I mean,they runoff of programming.

472
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,510
Right.Repair and replicate.

473
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,740
So they need fuel.

474
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,620
Exactly.

475
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,850
Wow,excellent.

476
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,940
So that's whatit was gonna do?

477
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,370
Take my carbon and run around looking like me?

478
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,760
I don't think so. I mean
the nano-starkkissed you,right?

479
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,790
I mean,kissing. 
That can't be a partof their programming.

480
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,350
No,but it shows 
their exponential leapin intelligence.

481
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,700
And a great tastein women.

482
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,940
No,it knew it was me.I could feel it.

483
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay.

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,740
So stark is the key,and--

485
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,570
--Uh,that monitorin his office

486
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,420
is still working
which meanshe's still alive somewhere.

487
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,810
You're right. They just found him in section 3.

488
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,960
Where is he?

489
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,190
The master control room.

490
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,660
Thank god.Open the door

491
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,480
He's locked himself inside.

492
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,000
No,he's locked us outside,

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,110
or one of him has.

494
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,760
You gotta get this door open.
What's in this room?

495
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,850
The computer mainframe.

496
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,650
Uh,would the security systembe in there?

497
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,440
And the E.M. Barrier.He could turn it off.

498
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,130
Not without help.Even with the codes
 it has to be shut down manually

499
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,440
from three differententry points

500
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
by someone with fullsecurity clearance.

501
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,120
Someone like stark?

502
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,440
-We're good. 
-All right.Back me up.

503
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,090
Aw,man.

504
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,300
This is really bad.

505
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,120
They've got dr. Starkat exit 5.

506
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,510
Wait--exit 7.

507
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,600
And exit 9.

508
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,710
Those are the shutoff points.

509
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,500
They're making a break for it.

510
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,830
The E.M. Barrier's down.

511
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,000
There's nothing to prevent them  
leaving the building.

512
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
Sir,all exit points have been breached.

513
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,650
We have multiple starksoutside of the building.

514
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,880
And I thought one starkwas bad.

515
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,300
There's no stopping them now.

516
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,670
We have to find them.

517
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,450
They're replicating exponentially.

518
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,370
Well,you knowthe program.

519
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,480
What kind of numbersare we talking about?

520
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,670
By this time tomorrow,there--

521
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,530
there could bethousands.

522
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,770
Next week,millions.Millions of starks?

523
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,980
That's horribleto think about.

524
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,610
Well,we obviously can't wait that long.

525
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,210
Okay,weapons.What do you have  
that can knock 'em out?

526
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,670
The reverse gunsare short-range.
We'll never get all of them.


527
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,800
-Do you have anything bigger? 
-Aside from a nuclear bomb,no.

528
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,410
You have a nuclear bomb?

529
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,290
I didn't say that.

530
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,710
Sound the warning system.

531
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,710
Eureka's on lockdown.

532
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,950
No one goes outsideuntil every stark is stopped.

533
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,380
-Carter? 
-This is the answer

534
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,020
-What 
-Stark.

535
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,560
I think we've establishedthat,mate.

536
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,250
No,I mean,why replicate stark?

537
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,420
Why not larryor the it worker,

538
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,250
or lowjack?

539
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,630
They foundthe perfect specimen.

540
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,270
You're not going backto dogs after that.

541
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,460
But he's not perfect.

542
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,970
Have you seen his abs?
Damn close.

543
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,560
My point is we can't stopevery stark out there.

544
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,310
But we can stopthe one stark in here.

545
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,680
Well,every minutewe're looking for him,

546
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,040
they're out there multiplying.

547
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,380
But if we can find the original,

548
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,250
if we can find nathan,

549
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,280
then maybe we can figure outa connection.

550
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,130
Well,where do we start to look?

551
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,100
I know.I know.Don't even say.

552
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,890
I never,ever wantto come down here again.

553
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,170
Looks like they'veall gone.

554
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,910
Well,he's gotta be in here somewhere.

555
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,410
At this rate,it could take us all day.

556
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,260
Yeah.

557
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,850
Hang on.I'm getting something.

558
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,440
More nanoids?

559
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,300
A different signal.

560
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,370
Dead ahead.

561
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,380
And it's not moving.

562
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,310
Here we go.

563
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,460
Stark!

564
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,360
He's still alive.

565
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,020
The last thing 
I remember was larry attacking me.

566
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,880
And after that,it's all a dream.

567
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,550
I mean,one minute I'm kissing allison,

568
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,690
and then next...

569
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
I was a dog.

570
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,740
I think somehow your dream sare becoming reality,

571
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,300
and I think it has something to do

572
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,340
with that little glowing mole thing.

573
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,800
Neural interface system.

574
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,480
Transmits my thought commands

575
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,150
directly to the computer network.

576
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,350
Is it possible that the signals got crossed?

577
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,960
Gonna kill fargo.

578
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,710
Get back here.

579
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,360
How was I supposedto know

580
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,270
that my mental mouseand taggart's nano-bugs

581
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,590
shared the same frequency?

582
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,990
Okay,so turn it off.Problem solved.

583
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,430
No,wait.

584
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,750
What? We need to severthe connection.

585
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,280
Well,unless it's ouronly connection.

586
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,090
I mean,think about it.

587
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,170
Your doublesare still out there,

588
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,390
and they're no longer responding to  
taggart's remote control.

589
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,020
So that gizmo might beour  
only way of reaching them.

590
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,520
Your thoughts,your subconscious thoughts,

591
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,830
your dreamsmust have been transmitted

592
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,810
into their programming.

593
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,760
Okay,so they're respondingto the last command

594
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,410
that they gotbefore the signal went weak?

595
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,240
Uh,in theory,yeah.

596
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Okay.

597
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,590
What was the over all them
of your last dream?

598
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,560
Oh,come on,stark. 
This is no time to be bashful.

599
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,700
W-well,there was some wish fulfillment,
fantasies in there.

600
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,570
Like?

601
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,160
Allie.

602
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,380
And some other stuff.

603
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,710
I need specifics.

604
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,290
The usual.Power,
success control over...everything.

605
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,890
You dreamabout world domination?

606
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,060
Not all the time.

607
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,770
Yeah,gopher carter.

608
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,040
Everyone's off the streets,

609
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,920
except a whole lotof nathan starks. 
You may wanna get down here.Over.

610
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,080
-How many now? 
-Too many to count.Over.

611
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,340
Uh,we're working on it.

612
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,430
Hang tight.

613
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,880
So,assuming that we cancontact 
these things through stark...

614
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,480
what do we do?

615
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,820
Stop them from communicating with each other.

616
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,890
They'd be reducedto single cells.

617
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,240
No threat at all.

618
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,780
So how do we do that?

619
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,980
Interference.

620
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,290
A loud enough low-frequencyblast of sound.

621
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,620
Uh,we--something below human hearing.

622
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,390
Say in the two hertz range.

623
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,860
Two hertz?

624
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,050
To generate any volume 
you'd need a massive speaker

625
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,810
at least eight feetin diameter.

626
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,330
No.

627
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,570
Bigger's not always better.Come on.

628
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,610
We're running out of time. 
You sit here.Allison,you ready?

629
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,190
I still don't understand what we're doing.

630
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,220
Good.

631
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,410
You four,I need youto go in the booth,

632
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,610
shut it,lock it,wait for my signal. 
Thanks,henry.

633
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,540
I need you to focuson bringing 'em here.

634
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,170
Focus,nathan.

635
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,660
Command them with your mind.

636
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,820
Summon them with your will.

637
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,530
Conjure them wi--

638
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,170
seriously?

639
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,840
Sorry.

640
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,670
Just concentrate.

641
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,080
It's not working.
I can tell it's not working.

642
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,010
He's too focused.

643
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,080
His rational mind'soverruling his subconscious.

644
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,520
All ego.No id.

645
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,630
Hey.

646
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,940
You are a stupid,

647
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,720
selfish,egomaniacal

648
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,000
sack of crap,and I am astonished

649
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,530
that you've gottenas far as you have.

650
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,030
Coming from you,that's a compliment.

651
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,280
Okay,slight change of plan.

652
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,350
Well,it's good to know the fate of  
the world depended on your last one.

653
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,200
Hey,spencer,could you play something,

654
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,920
uh,romantic?

655
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,730
Psh.No problem.

656
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,750
We're gonna serenade them into 
submission now?

657
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,480
Just sit and watch.

658
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,380
May I have this dance?

659
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,620
Um,right place,

660
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,620
very wrong time.

661
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,030
Just roll with it.

662
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,960
Might be our last chance.

663
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,730
Could--maybe--I lead?

664
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,220
I'm sorry.It's--it's habit.

665
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,110
Have--have I ever told youhow 
amazing you are?

666
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,490
Um...no.

667
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,860
You're strong.

668
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,550
Independent.

669
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,160
And smarter than ten women put together.

670
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,380
And I think another ten times as beautiful.

671
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,570
That's really flattering.I-I--

672
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,440
just realized what you're doing.

673
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,160
I mean every word.

674
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,540
what I'm about to do...

675
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,500
I do for god and country.

676
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,170
All right,you can stop.It's not working.

677
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,250
It's working.

678
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,880
I said,you can give i ta rest.

679
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,490
It's having absolutely no effect.

680
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,200
They're coming your way,carter.

681
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,760
I repeat,they're headed your way.

682
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,140
Do you copy?

683
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,420
Hello?

684
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,180
-It worked. 
-Yeah.

685
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,240
No,no,no. They're coming.

686
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,390
Yeah,right.

687
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,620
I-I-I hope you have a plan.

688
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,190
be careful,carter.

689
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,960
Oh,my god.Look at all of them.

690
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,630
It's a miracle.

691
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,980
-Wait for it.
-We don't have that much longer .

692
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,770
Few more seconds.Carter!

693
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,220
Wait!Carter!

694
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,600
that's it. They're all inside,carter.

695
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,090
Now,spencer,now!

696
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,850
Dr. Stark,are you all right?

697
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,980
Fargo,

698
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,150
never,ever,

699
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,070
ever mess with mycerebral cortex...

700
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,870
again.

701
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,960
Okay,we'll get the wraps over here,please.

702
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,080
And,fruit,come with me,please.

703
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,070
You okay?Good,good,good.

704
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,940
Having a good time?

705
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,630
great.
I think we'll dropsome fruit here, please.

706
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,170
You know,I hate to admit it, 
but spencer's pretty good.

707
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,620
The kid's my ticket.

708
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,800
The kid's your ticket?

709
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,940
Way to be supportive.

710
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,130
You're gonna beyour own ticket.

711
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,170
Think vincent's out done himself,huh?

712
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,840
You've out done yourself.

713
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,410
-What? 
-Allison.

714
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,980
It was quite a kiss.

715
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,550
It was just for show. Just,uh
to make stark angry.

716
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,150
Do I look that naive?

717
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,450
Honest,it was nothing to worry about.

718
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,250
I'm not worried.

719
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm--I mean,I'm not happy,either.

720
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,700
But...

721
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,340
I don't know.I mean...

722
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,350
maybe it's time.

723
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,120
To generate any volume 
you'd need a massive speaker

724
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,510
Just... don't ever make out in 
front of me again.

725
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,590
Thanks.

726
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,290
What do you think?

727
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,460
It's nice.

728
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,380
Nice?

729
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,030
Well,with this crowd
I expected,you know,

730
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,800
a little more than centerpiecesand 
linen napkins.

731
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,390
That sounds like you're starting

732
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,110
to get used to this crowd.

733
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,580
Spencer!

734
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,280
Ready?

735
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,900
Only in eureka.

736
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,450
Guess that kiss made him realize 
what he was missing,eh,sheriff?

737
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,320
Yeah,I guess.

738
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,770
No explainingsome relationships.

739
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,180
You look unbelievable.

740
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,920
Thank you.

741
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,550
Do you...wanna...dance?

742
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,050
I'd be honored.

Hey,buddy.

Looks like it's just you and me,huh?

748
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,300
That is...the real you,isn't it?

749
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,660
Ah,never mind.

750
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,130
I don't wanna know.
