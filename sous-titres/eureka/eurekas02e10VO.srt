1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,562
Previously on eureka...

2
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:03,568
<i>You may get to him
but you won't get to me.</i>

3
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:06,446
There's only one thing
I want from you, Jojo.

4
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:09,584
- What is that?
- It's a modified version

5
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:12,160
of the memory neutralizer
that I designed years ago.

6
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,537
Can I borrow this?

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,131
Sure.

8
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:18,041
We've been searching for a...

9
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:20,627
unifying theory of everything.

10
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,962
You're talking about the akashic field.

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,965
Just wish I could see
what was going on inside of his head.

12
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:27,800
Why this is happening to him.

13
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:30,365
His brain is wired like no one else's.

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,645
He's created a connection to the field.

15
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:41,856
<i>Albert Einstein said science
without religion is lame,</i>

16
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,519
and religion without science is blind.

17
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,685
But is there still a place for faith

18
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,858
in a world of science?

19
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,368
Has our ability to

20
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,649
unravel the mysteries of rainbows

21
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,094
made them any less miraculous?

22
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,580
Science may be the method
by which we give name

23
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:06,797
to God's miracles.

24
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,814
But faith is the question that arises

25
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:12,534
every time an old mystery is solved.

26
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:15,800
The elegant explanations

27
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:18,186
discovered every day in Eureka

28
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,833
are the very reason to believe
in something greater.

29
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:23,939
Something beyond mathematics.

30
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,716
Something divine.

31
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,346
Dad!

32
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,477
Hey! What are you doing here?

33
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,675
I was just cleaning out my closet
for donations, as requested.

34
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:07,816
And... I brought you breakfast.

35
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,182
Thank you.

36
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,528
Now... What is it?

37
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,570
Scrambled egg whites
with spinach and tofu.

38
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,949
SARAH said your cholesterol's
been running high from too much pizza.

39
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,328
That's crazy talk.

40
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:22,122
Almost forgot.
I got you your sunday paper.

41
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:23,657
Here you go.

42
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,545
- What do you want?
- Who said I want anything?

43
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,638
It's sunday morning.
You're up before noon.

44
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,647
You do chores.
You bring me the morning paper.

45
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,051
What do you want?

46
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,513
I wanna get a tattoo.

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,769
No!

48
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,351
Okay, I'm being serious.

49
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,561
Oh, okay.

50
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:45,562
No.

51
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,812
- Can we talk about this?
- Sure, yeah.

52
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,525
We can talk about it.
And the answer is...

53
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:51,647
No.

54
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,528
Are you amused with yourself?

55
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:55,697
I'm pretty amusing.

56
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,766
Gotta drop this off.

57
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,704
I am so telling SARAH.

58
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,422
Thought-provoking sermon, Reverend.

59
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,612
I mean, the most beautiful
emotion we can experience

60
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,010
is the mysterious.
I couldn't agree more.

61
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,228
Unfortunately, I'm literally
preaching to the choir.

62
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,890
You knew you were gonna have
a small crowd when you took the job.

63
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,360
It's not the size
of the congregation that counts.

64
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,144
It's... The commitment.

65
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,771
Still, a little more size could be nice.

66
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,617
Mom?

67
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,089
And a little more time.
Excuse me, Reverend and Henry.

68
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,945
Diane, another lovely
musical arrangement.

69
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,429
Thank you very much, Reverend.

70
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,584
How are you?

71
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,318
Hanging in there.

72
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,003
- You know, working helps.
- Tell me about it.

73
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,005
Anytime you need to talk, drop by.

74
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,049
I will. Thanks.

75
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,839
- Bye, Henry.
- Bye-bye.

76
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:03,431
How many people could understand
the pain of losing a spouse?

77
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,434
Well, we all deal in our own way.

78
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,352
I'm glad you've been there for her.

79
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,979
Yeah, me too. Thanks.

80
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,772
- See you next sunday?
- Absolutely.

81
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,239
Sheriff Carter.

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,891
Hi.

83
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
You're early...

84
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,871
For next sunday.

85
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:28,852
Yeah...

86
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,038
It... It's Jo's day off,
and I drew the short straw.

87
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,879
So... what have we got there?

88
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,779
Donations... Spring cleaning.

89
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,717
We'll make sure we get these
to those in need.

90
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:41,330
A lot of need.

91
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,624
It's not even mine.

92
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:50,436
<i>I blame you for her death.</i>

93
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,396
<i>I can't look at you</i>

94
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:54,064
<i>without thinking that you did this.</i>

95
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,358
<i>That you're the one
who took her away from me.</i>

96
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,168
You okay, Sheriff?

97
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,905
Yeah, I just... remembered
who I borrowed this from.

98
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,323
Well,

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,951
if you ever want to borrow my book...

100
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:10,038
- Yeah.
- See you next sunday, maybe?

101
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,915
I'll work on it.

102
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,690
I'll put these up front...

103
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,029
For you.

104
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,301
I kind of wish I hadn't even told him.

105
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:30,934
<i>I don't understand the appeal
of painting oneself permanently.</i>

106
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:34,396
Maybe because, in your case,
it would be considered graffiti.

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,649
I thought every kid
from LA had a tattoo.

108
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,235
Oh, yeah, and preschoolers
have body piercings.

109
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,613
Haven't you guys ever been to,
like, a big city?

110
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:44,864
Nope.

111
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:47,837
Oh! We did have that one
wild weekend in Vegas.

112
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,015
We did.

113
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,282
- Really?
- Okay, so it was a virtual Vegas,

114
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,916
- but it was like we were there.
- You really need to get out.

115
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,360
I'll tell you what. This weekend,
we'll take my car and we...

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,551
Well, what?
Don't leave us in suspense. Spit it out.

117
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,180
- Zoe, what's wrong?
- I can't talk.

118
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,141
Should I alert sheriff Carter?

119
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:19,357
<i>Zoe? Pilar?</i>

120
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:20,716
<i>What's happening?</i>

121
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,023
<i>- What's happening to me? -</i>

00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,417

00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:00,191
- Season 2 | Episode 10 -
God is in the Details (v. 1.03)

128
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,257
What exactly are you doing?

129
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,824
It's a portable MRI.

130
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,743
Allows me to see inside her throat.

131
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:19,292
- You're making her nervous.
- Just tell me what's wrong with her.

132
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:21,750
I don't know, it's not laryngitis.

133
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,587
They're suffering from some sort sort of

134
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,631
vocal cord paralysis.

135
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,799
From what?

136
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,301
I'm not sure yet.

137
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:31,387
Okay, I'll... Hang out while you tinker
with her voice box.

138
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,173
I don't tinker.

139
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:37,852
Carter, just... Give him some time.

140
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,427
Yeah.

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,224
I know.

142
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,110
I know. Me too.

143
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,028
Everything's gonna be all right.

144
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,996
He's pretty good at what he does.

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,149
We're gonna keep Zoe and the other girls
here for observation at GD.

146
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,726
Until we have an answer.

147
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,156
I'm gonna check out the house.

148
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:59,117
Just... See if I can find anything.

149
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:00,887
I already sent a science team.

150
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,225
They can handle it.

151
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:04,044
Yeah, I'd prefer to do my own digging.

152
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,404
It's...

153
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,132
I'll see you soon. Okay?

154
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,751
What is that?

155
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:16,692
What...

156
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,893
What?! You...

157
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,235
God! So you weren't asking
for permission to get a tattoo.

158
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,608
You were just
covering your ass, right? Is...

159
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,866
You know, I'm just gonna do
everything I can to get you healthy.

160
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,151
And then we're gonna talk about that.

161
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,336
So... sunday special
is fallout flapjacks.

162
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,876
That's pumpkin pancakes with radioactive
swirl of cream cheese and nutmeg.

163
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,600
That sounds great, Vince,
but I'm waiting for somebody.

164
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:53,799
Really?

165
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,178
Who's the lucky lady?

166
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,177
No!

167
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:04,563
Yes.

168
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,314
I'm impressed.

169
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,440
Yeah, so am I.

170
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,855
And just a teeny bit scared.

171
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:11,976
Yeah.

172
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,605
If all church girls look like you,
I might consider converting.

173
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,245
You should join me sometime
and find out.

174
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,746
Oh, I would, but I'm allergic.
I'd have to...

175
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,368
get a new inhaler.
It'd be a whole... Thing.

176
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,982
- After you.
- Chivalry.

177
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,419
Not something
I was expecting from a felon.

178
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,998
Hey, never convicted,
but the day is still young.

179
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,567
Try anything,
and I'll deviate your septum.

180
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,013
That is so hot.

181
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,223
<i>I'm sorry, Sheriff.</i>

182
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:44,640
<i>It was my responsibility to keep
an eye on them, and I failed.</i>

183
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,318
- <i>Bad house.</i>
- It's all right, SARAH.

184
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,399
<i>One minute, they were talking
about tattoos,</i>

185
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,384
<i>the next, they couldn't speak.</i>

186
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,119
<i>I was against her getting one,
by the way.</i>

187
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,446
Well, not that it helped, but thanks.

188
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,851
Did you run tests on the air?
Did you check the filters?

189
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:00,929
<i>If anything unusual had been detected,</i>

190
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:03,249
<i>I would have sealed off
the affected areas.</i>

191
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:08,484
Where were they?

192
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,397
<i>In the living room.</i>

193
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,222
What is that?

194
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,063
<i>I don't know.</i>

195
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,916
<i>It wasn't there before.</i>

196
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,863
Neither was that.

197
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:45,302
This is truly a mystery.
This shouldn't happen.

198
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,736
Crystalline glass is made of atoms that
bond with more density than ordinary,

199
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:51,209
making windows stronger,
more light resistant.

200
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,212
- More thermally efficient.
- What could do it?

201
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,869
It'd take an incredible heat source.

202
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:57,347
SARAH checked. Said there was
no trace of heat in the house.

203
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,134
Like I said, it's a mystery.

204
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,240
I need help. Zoe can't talk.

205
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:04,506
- You checked... GD's entire...
- Active project roster. Of course.

206
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,639
But nothing would cause
a problem like this.

207
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:09,958
- Well, something caused it.
- Jack, we're doing all we can,

208
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,480
as fast as we can.

209
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,735
<i>So why does a special forces bad-ass</i>

210
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,947
quit a life of excitement to become
the deputy of Sleepy Hollow?

211
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, same reason
an anti-establishment anarchist

212
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,744
agrees to a cushy consulting job
at Global Dynamics.

213
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,247
The money... You wouldn't believe
what they're paying me.

214
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:30,001
Well, the opportunity.

215
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:32,459
You know, this isn't
just anywhere, it's Eureka.

216
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:36,463
True... If I'd come here sooner,
things may have turned out differently.

217
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,480
Like you wouldn't have gone
to MIT when you were 15?

218
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,134
Actually, MIT was great.

219
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,916
I could spend weeks at a time

220
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,682
focused on a single variable in
a lattice gauge equation. It was heaven.

221
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,646
I had the same feeling assembling

222
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:51,478
a chromium flash suppression barrel
for my grenade launcher.

223
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,447
Yeah, but that's simple mechanics.

224
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,442
Particle and theoretical physics,
that's the real mind, Candy.

225
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,029
Well, some of us like
practical application.

226
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,412
Oh, yeah, no. That's all good.

227
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,702
But, I mean, let's be honest.
The particle accelerator only gets built

228
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,782
after someone comes up with the idea.

229
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,206
Right?

230
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:17,010
So how about a Vinspresso
to top things off?

231
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,948
That's an excellent idea.

232
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:22,832
No, thanks.

233
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,261
- Should be getting back to the office.
- I thought you had sundays off.

234
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,657
Yeah, just remembered, I have
some paperwork I forgot to finish.

235
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,375
Thanks for brunch.

236
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,774
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Still can't find the cause, but</i>

237
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,204
<i>the good news is,
it's not getting any worse.</i>

238
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:51,281
Well, I guess that's something.

239
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:53,748
Are you doing okay?

240
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,635
<i>Yeah, just...</i>

241
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,877
<i>Seeing Carter so worried about Zoe</i>

242
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:59,461
just got to me.

243
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,590
- I know how he feels.
- <i>Well, try and relax.</i>

244
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,747
You been under a lot of stress lately.

245
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,090
I'll keep at it 'till
I figure something out.

246
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:08,471
<i>I know you will.</i>

247
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,826
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

248
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,232
What in the world?

249
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,322
Hey, there. Welcome back.

250
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,867
- What's happening to me?
- Apparently

251
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:14,616
your inner glow is becoming
your outer glow.

252
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,445
Please don't joke.

253
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,960
What were you doing
before this happened?

254
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,002
I helped Kevin with his homework.

255
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,805
Then I took a shower and...

256
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:25,739
So Kevin was home.

257
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,176
- Yeah. Why?
- I wonder if he was responsible.

258
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,135
- Why would he...
- I don't know.

259
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:33,292
But we've seen
what kind of power he has.

260
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:36,221
If I'm right, and he's tapping
into the akashic field,

261
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,754
then he's...

262
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,446
tapping into a very powerful
energy collective.

263
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,770
Holy crap!

264
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:50,955
What did you do?

265
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,235
I took a shower.

266
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:54,826
You look radiant.

267
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:58,413
We tested the water. Nothing in it
could cause bioluminescence.

268
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,664
How does it happen?

269
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,706
Enzymes in the skin pigment

270
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,562
become oxidized,
and then they emit light.

271
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,880
But that's with insects and marine life.

272
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:08,211
Not anymore.

273
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,717
It may be a kind of bacterial reaction.

274
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,441
Okay, you know what? Glowing or not,
I'm still the head of GD.

275
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,640
- And unless this is contagious...
- No, no, no!

276
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:19,917
- I gotcha.
- The human body is not built for this.

277
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,727
Whatever is causing your bioluminescence

278
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,435
is also attacking your nervous system.

279
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,441
Allison, does GD have

280
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,778
any projects in bioluminescence
in development?

281
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:31,062
Not at GD, but maybe off-site.

282
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,948
And you're not gonna
like who the project manager is.

283
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,044
Why do you automatically assume
I'm responsible?

284
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,893
Are you really surprised?

285
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,505
I work in bioluminescence now, Sheriff.

286
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:45,796
Ever since you torched
my necrosomnium violacea,

287
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,295
I needed a change of scenery.

288
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:49,937
I'm a busy man.

289
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,116
Do you mind getting to the point?

290
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,998
The point is that Allison Blake
is shining like the northern lights.

291
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,389
- Fascinating.
- Seth, what's the new project?

292
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:04,103
Botanical marine cross-hibernization
to create bioluminescent specimens.

293
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,273
I mate plants and fish
to make them glow.

294
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:11,637
Why would you do that?

295
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,108
That's classified.

296
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:17,250
The head of Global Dynamics
is a human glow stick, so unclassify it.

297
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:19,942
I've only just isolated
the mitochondrial strains

298
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,032
responsible for bioluminescence.

299
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:24,040
Phase one includes simple organisms.

300
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,535
Let me guess...
Phase two is human trials.

301
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,721
Well, yeah.
But I'm years away from that.

302
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,171
Still gonna need a sample.

303
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,830
- Waste of time.
- Ah, we'll see.

304
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,290
Until then, don't leave the aquarium.

305
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,084
At least you can't light it on fire!

306
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,924
Sorry I couldn't be here sooner.

307
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,270
You okay?

308
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:02,035
We're still going over the smart house,
and Fargo is running

309
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,996
a full diagnostic on SARAH.

310
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:07,124
Okay, so don't worry...
We'll find something soon.

311
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,839
<i>How'd it go with Zane?</i>

312
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,346
We can talk about that later.

313
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:22,348
<i>Or now.</i>

314
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:24,721
Or now.

315
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:29,898
Bottom line:

316
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:33,817
he's... brilliant.

317
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,331
I'm not.

318
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:41,076
It's the story of my life
trying to get a date in this town.

319
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:45,401
<i>He likes you.</i>

320
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,943
But how long before he realizes

321
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,296
I can't keep up with him?

322
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,004
Anyway, I'm more concerned about you.

323
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,275
<i>I'll live. I'm worried about Allison.</i>

324
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,265
I know.

325
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,131
Me too.

326
00:18:31,774 --> 00:18:33,111
What the...

327
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,546
Why is it every time you show up,

328
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,096
my work gets ruined?

329
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,931
I'm not the one who turned your aquarium
into a theme park for the Shining.

330
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,103
I didn't do this.

331
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,308
This just... happened.

332
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:53,507
This doesn't just happen.

333
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,982
Water doesn't turn into...

334
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,954
Blood?

335
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,387
That's what you're thinking, right?

336
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,478
- Yeah.
- Great.

337
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,479
Then you can deal with this.
I don't do blood.

338
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,738
I'm a plant guy.

339
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:10,421
What's that?

340
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:14,152
It's a filtration system. Or it was.

341
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,390
There was a hole like that
at the smart house.

342
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,858
What does that have to do with this?

343
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:21,710
Exactly.

344
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,810
Hey, who's gonna fix my tank?

345
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:25,026
No one.

346
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:27,140
This just became a crime scene.

347
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,823
- Well, we didn't notice any before.
- Yeah, we weren't really looking.

348
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,327
- Bingo.
- Everything that's happened is related?

349
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:53,289
Yeah. But I'm not sure to what.

350
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,125
<i>What'd you find out?</i>

351
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,217
That the smart house
had a circle of melted glass,

352
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:01,172
as did Allison's house,
and Seth's aquarium.

353
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,548
What happened at the aquarium?

354
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,209
The water in the marine tanks
turned to blood.

355
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,595
- Or a blood-like substance.
- You test the water?

356
00:20:08,364 --> 00:20:11,414
Yeah, it didn't match when
we compared it to her chem panel.

357
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:14,852
- How bad is she?
- Whatever's triggering Allison's

358
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,891
bioluminescence is working
as a neurotoxin.

359
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:20,020
It's shutting down her bodily systems.
Now, the reason I brought her here

360
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,943
is I've been working on a nerve agent
antidote for the military.

361
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:24,422
Can you give it to her?

362
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,156
He can't. It doesn't exist yet.
But you're close.

363
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,430
How much time does she have?

364
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:31,952
- Now, Carter...
- How long?

365
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,580
12 hours.

366
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,207
Maybe less.

367
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,926
Hey... You okay?

368
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:58,437
<i>What's happening?</i>

369
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:02,065
Well, we... We've got
a few more incidents, so...

370
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,344
- <i>A few?!</i>
- Yeah.

371
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,280
We're gonna figure this out.

372
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,559
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

373
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:12,849
But...

374
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,122
About your tattoo.

375
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:20,011
I overreacted.

376
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,836
I didn't hear you out. And...

377
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,239
that's just...

378
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:27,915
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:31,553
I mean, I do think
what you did was wrong.

380
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,724
But...

381
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,056
It's a tattoo.

382
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,186
That's just... not important anymore.

383
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,857
I... think you should
just focus on getting better.

384
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:45,311
Okay?

385
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,529
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

386
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,614
No!

387
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,742
I was trying to... I just...

388
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,575
No, you're not gonna die.

389
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,311
We got it all under control.

390
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,839
Just hang on one second. Okay?

391
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,835
- Hope you have some good news.
- You were right.

392
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,099
All the glass melted
the same way from the inside out.

393
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:09,225
And all the locations affected
were using crystalline glass.

394
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,069
Guess that's why every window
in Eureka didn't go all Salvador Dali.

395
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:14,171
Exactly, so I'm gonna
run this data with Nathan.

396
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,033
- Maybe the break we were looking for.
- Great. Hey...

397
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,977
- Thanks.
- Keep the faith.

398
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,918
Believe me, I'm trying.

399
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,096
Well, Henry just figured something out
that might help us, so...

400
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,029
You just hang in there.

401
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,429
Okay?

402
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:44,695
Hey, Larry.

403
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:47,211
What, studying to be pope?

404
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:48,628
No.

405
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,102
But with what's happening around town,

406
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,207
I thought I should cover my bases...

407
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,427
Religion-wise.

408
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,696
What's religion have
to do with anything?

409
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:58,815
Well, call it what you like.

410
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,440
But girls losing their voices...
That's like the Tower of Babel.

411
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,272
God smote those workers
so they couldn't communicate.

412
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:07,565
And Dr. Blake...

413
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:10,828
Glowing, like saints rising to heaven.

414
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:13,791
That's what the Bible calls trans...

415
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,280
Transfiguration.

416
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,952
What if GD was built over a Hell mouth?

417
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:22,394
- A Hell mouth?
- Say what you want,

418
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,470
but when water turns to blood,
I say it's time to pray.

419
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:27,783
You might wanna run
that by the reverend.

420
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,382
Sure she'll get a laugh out of it.

421
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,880
Considering she's the one
I borrowed these books from,

422
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,394
I think I'll stick to my game plan.

423
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:38,554
- Harper gave you these?
- She's giving them to everyone.

424
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,787
Things are happening all over town...

425
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,279
In case you haven't noticed,

426
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,165
God's come to Eureka.

427
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:47,896
- Thanks.
- For what?

428
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,151
You may have pointed me
down the path of righteousness.

429
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,195
- Hallelujah, my brother!
- Shut up, Larry.

430
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,835
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find the reverend?

431
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:12,504
She just stepped out, but she'll be back
for evening service.

432
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,048
And... All these people?

433
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,592
They just come here
to pray on their own.

434
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:20,095
- Sure.
- People seek comfort in time of crisis.

435
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,472
And reverend Harper's door
is always open.

436
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,808
- How long've you known her?
- I have been the

437
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,900
church's musical director
since day one. So... A while.

438
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:30,677
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I hear the...

439
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:33,275
sunday sermons aren't quite...
selling out.

440
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,546
- Please.
- Sure, sure.

441
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,904
Eureka's built on science.

442
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:40,460
So it's hard for people here
to just open up

443
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:42,754
to something as uncertain as faith.

444
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,612
Reverend Harper
was a theoretical physicist,

445
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:48,024
so she has a way
of bridging that divide.

446
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,334
And, as a churchgoing scientist,
I appreciate that.

447
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:52,752
Do you believe in miracles?

448
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:54,921
- I have to.
- And,

449
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,757
what if they're just being used
to get people in the pews?

450
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:01,052
Reverend's only concern
is helping others.

451
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:03,373
- Sure about that?
- She helped me.

452
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,284
When my husband Daniel
passed away, I wanted to...

453
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:08,827
Join him.

454
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,396
And the reverend showed me
that where there is faith,

455
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,834
there's hope.

456
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:14,963
She saved my life.

457
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:19,070
Okay.

458
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,471
It must be pretty bad.

459
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:49,350
I am running through every variation
of the neurotoxin antiserum.

460
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,136
I will find the solution.

461
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:54,188
Except I probably won't
be around for it.

462
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:58,943
- Let's discuss worst-case scenarios.
- Not yet.

463
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:00,337
I have to.

464
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:02,809
For Kevin's sake.

465
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,909
Nathan, if something happens to me,

466
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:09,453
I need you to take care of him.

467
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,039
You know I would.

468
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,166
And I want you to tell the DOD
what's happening.

469
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,639
No. No, not yet.

470
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:18,420
One more hour, I'll know
if this last trial worked.

471
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:21,960
What if I don't make it through this?

472
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:23,168
You will.

473
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:25,594
You have to.

474
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:30,750
I love you.

475
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,490
I won't let you die.

476
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,150
I won't allow it.

477
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:48,836
We're getting reports all over town.

478
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,672
I promise he'll get to you
as soon as he can.

479
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:55,958
You should really wear
your hair down more often.

480
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,336
Really not a good time.

481
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:01,713
No, I got that impression
when you took off.

482
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,044
Look... Forget it. It's nothing.

483
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,348
I think it is.
Tell me why you're pissed,

484
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,467
or I'll hold my breath until you do.

485
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,218
- What are you, three?
- Hey, I black out, it's on you.

486
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,192
Okay... You didn't do anything.

487
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:24,569
It's me.

488
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,239
It's this whole town.

489
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,994
Is this about the whole miracles thing?

490
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:32,995
'Cause, seriously,
there's no such thing.

491
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:35,659
Right, because only dumb people
believe in something

492
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,958
beyond tachyons
and particle accelerators.

493
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:42,939
Maybe you should think this through
before you start making accusations.

494
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,297
Accusations against who?

495
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,508
I tried to call you, but my radio's out.

496
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:49,510
I think reverend Harper might be
responsible for what's happening.

497
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:51,835
- You're both going to hell.
- No! Look, look.

498
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:55,100
We got an empty church
and a series of alleged miracles.

499
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,465
So I don't think it's crazy
to ask who stands to benefit.

500
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:58,621
God.

501
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,773
- Carter, you're way off base this time.
- I hope so.

502
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,227
But before reverend Harper
took up theology,

503
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,693
she used to be a physicist.

504
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,031
- You still think I'm going to hell?
- Probably.

505
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,678
- I think you're jumping to conclusions.
- Okay, bottom line:

506
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:14,911
if she's responsible,
we're in for a lot more.

507
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,910
Yeah, like, a plague of locusts,
or fiery hail, or total darkness.

508
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,425
You had to say it.

509
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,573
Welcome to the end of the world,
Sheriff.

510
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:53,910
Not if I can help it.

511
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:55,093
Thanks...

512
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,277
Hi, Reverend.

513
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:01,913
Sheriff... Welcome.

514
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:06,545
- We need to talk to you for a sec.
- Actually, he wants to talk to you.

515
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,382
- Thanks for the support.
- You're welcome.

516
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:11,140
- What is it?
- Well...

517
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,804
Obviously, a lot of strange things
have been happening.

518
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,097
One might say...

519
00:29:16,477 --> 00:29:18,057
Religious things.

520
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:20,278
- Some might... Not me.
- Or me.

521
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,242
I'm trying to work here, guys.

522
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,872
What's your point, Sheriff?

523
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:27,000
I was wondering... and forgive this...

524
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:30,690
Who would stand to gain the most by...

525
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,199
the sudden appearance
of apocalyptic-type signs?

526
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:37,868
All of us, I would think.

527
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:41,254
Or maybe someone who's been preaching

528
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:43,728
to an empty church every sunday.

529
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:47,670
You do have a point.

530
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:50,185
- Really?
- Sure.

531
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:53,498
But whatever's happening, divine or not,

532
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,700
I had nothing to do with it.

533
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,566
And as much as I would
love to believe that,

534
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:02,184
you had the motive
and the knowledge to pull it off.

535
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,456
We know about
your background in physics.

536
00:30:04,814 --> 00:30:06,355
Theoretical physics, yes.

537
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:10,025
But there's a reason why
I left research for the clergy, Sheriff.

538
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,778
I... wasn't much of a scientist.

539
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,832
But I am a very good preacher.

540
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,743
Well, we're still gonna have
to ask you in for questioning.

541
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,184
Just relax.

542
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:33,548
What's that?

543
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,472
How do you have music during a blackout?

544
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,519
It's a crystal radio system,
powered by piezoelectricity.

545
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,718
Crystal... Radios...

546
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:55,153
Henry, could radios be responsible
for what's been happening?

547
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:58,323
Radio waves, at the exact
right frequency... Yes.

548
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:01,382
- They might caused the interference.
- Can we test for that?

549
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,344
Reverend, we're gonna have
to borrow that receiver.

550
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:09,785
If this is happening all over town,
how come we haven't heard it sooner?

551
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:12,163
Well, let's see.

552
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:15,308
Sound waves can carry
infrasonic frequencies

553
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:18,176
that occur outside the range
of human hearing.

554
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,005
And this crystalline glass
is the same as we found

555
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:23,348
in all three places.

556
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:02,985
And... Seth's aquarium
is made of the same stuff?

557
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:05,723
Yes... Microorganisms in the water
were sonically agitated,

558
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,600
- creating a red tide effect.
- Okay,

559
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,684
what about Zoe?

560
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,274
Human tissues have the capacity

561
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:12,652
to transduce pressure from sound waves.

562
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:15,524
Infrasonic frequencies may be
putting pressure on her vocal cords.

563
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:16,817
So Allison is--

564
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,429
Sonoluminescence.

565
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:20,465
Sound waves reacting with water...

566
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:22,156
causing objects to glow.

567
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:23,824
So who could pull this off?

568
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:26,785
Anyone with a background
in acoustics and infrasonic research.

569
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,163
- I'm gonna make a list.
- Diane Lancaster

570
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:32,458
is the head of acoustic engineering
here at GD.

571
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,126
I just spoke to her. She's...

572
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:36,337
the music director at the church.

573
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,079
Here's the latest test results
on Allison Blake, Doctor.

574
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:08,682
I'm sorry, Dr. Stark.

575
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,402
All right, what do I do?

576
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,740
You've done all you can.

577
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,536
No.

578
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,777
Alright, is that fireflies?

579
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,608
Bioluminescent fireflies.

580
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,706
This must be the place.

581
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:57,359
Her husband died a few months ago.
She's...

582
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,341
been working at home ever since.

583
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:00,803
Working on what?

584
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,983
- And that would be?
- A temporal rift.

585
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:23,794
Or a portal to heaven.

586
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,396
No! Don't you come any closer!

587
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,623
- She wants to cross over.
- Into what?

588
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:38,082
Eternity.

589
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,056
What you're thinking about
seems pretty permanent.

590
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,437
You wanna talk about it?

591
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,964
There's nothing to talk about.

592
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,640
You don't understand.

593
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,168
I have found where everything meets.

594
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:53,092
The place where different points
in dimensional space-time converge.

595
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:55,641
Where Daniel is waiting for me.

596
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,058
Okay, let's...

597
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:58,644
Stick a pin in that.

598
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,897
- Okay, that can't be heaven?
- Why not?

599
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:03,420
I mean, if she's really discovered a...

600
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,151
a gateway to the multiverse.

601
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,653
- Not helping.
- I have faith that it is.

602
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,864
Revelations, chapter four, verse one:

603
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:12,783
"After this, I looked,

604
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,953
and behold a door was opened in Heaven."

605
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:17,930
You understand,

606
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,420
don't you, Henry?

607
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,887
Mom?

608
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:36,432
Mom's sick, Kev.

609
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,396
And I can't help her.

610
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,011
But you're special, Kevin.

611
00:35:42,147 --> 00:35:43,355
Maybe you can.

612
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,938
Do you realize what you're about to do?

613
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:29,234
I'm going to see my husband again.

614
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,237
He's gone, Diane.

615
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:37,390
And we need you here.

616
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:43,039
There's a lot of people suffering
out there because of your machine.

617
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,530
And your knowledge
might be able to save them.

618
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:47,881
You gonna...

619
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:49,453
Walk away from that?

620
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,487
- You just gonna let 'em die?
- No!

621
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,384
Is that what Daniel would want?

622
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,268
I didn't mean to cause
all these problems.

623
00:37:07,377 --> 00:37:09,983
I just... Wanna be with him again.

624
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,669
And you will.

625
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:22,383
<i>You just have to have a little faith.</i>

626
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,187
Jack, what if...

627
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,622
What if this really is
what she thinks it is?

628
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,372
I mean, Kim could be...

629
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,992
You gotta turn it off.

630
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,159
I'm turning it off.

631
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,656
Dad?

632
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,908
Oh, thank God.

633
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,888
Are you really gonna make me beg?

634
00:39:53,442 --> 00:39:55,393
- You're here.
- Yeah, well...

635
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,730
I had to see if you were lying
about all the babes who go to church.

636
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,813
And you definitely were not.

637
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,077
So... How are you?

638
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,403
I'm miserable.

639
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,038
But I'm here.

640
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:13,498
Have faith.

641
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:15,938
We'll see them again.

642
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,168
I promise.

643
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,672
I know we will, Henry.

644
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,735
It means a lot to me
that you came, Nathan.

645
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:25,183
Anything for you.

646
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,111
You saved my life.

647
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:29,379
It wasn't me.

648
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:32,225
And it wasn't shutting down
Diane's machine, either.

649
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:34,083
What do you mean?

650
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:44,320
He controls the field now, Allie.

651
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,610
He's evolving.

652
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,454
Reverend... For the record,

653
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:05,842
I'm really glad that I was wrong.

654
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,844
So we'll see you next sunday, then?

655
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:12,098
It's a tough one.
The Dodgers are playing the Mets.

656
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:13,318
So...

657
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,434
Have a slice of pepperoni for me.

658
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:16,728
That I can do.

659
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,446
Thanks.

660
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:21,566
See ya.

661
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,180
Hang on for a second.

662
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:27,007
'Scuse me.

663
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,956
- Sheriff.
- Hey, Henry.

664
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:33,798
I borrowed this book from you.

665
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,581
I just wanted to return it.

666
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,667
I don't remember that, but,
I hope you enjoyed it.

667
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,522
Yeah. I mean, it really opened my eyes.

668
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,172
As all good books should do.

669
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:48,259
- Yeah, Henry...
- Yeah?

670
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,053
You're my best friend, you know.

671
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:52,327
Yeah.

672
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,882
Yeah, I know.

673
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,110
Is it a sin that my favorite part
was the music?

674
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:10,030
Well... You stayed awake, right?
You hear the guy snoring behind us?

675
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,689
- Like a chainsaw.
- Yeah.

676
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,206
So, Dad...

677
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,352
You know my rose tattoo?

678
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:17,704
It's fake.

679
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:20,765
- It's fake?
- Yes.

680
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,799
But since you seemed okay with it,

681
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,367
I can get a real one now, right?

682
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:30,077
- Yeah.
- Really?

683
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,624
- Absolutely.
- Really?

684
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:34,930
When Hell freezes over, yeah.
