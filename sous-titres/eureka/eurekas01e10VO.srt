1
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,600
 Henry!

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,760
Jack!

3
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,240
Somebody's been busy.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,280
What do you think?

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,120
What--what should I think?

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,730
That the residents of eureka are 
gonna have the clearest

7
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,480
most secure cellular,satellite,
wi-fi communication system in the world.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,800
Just what i was gonna say.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,900
I knew that.See,I knew that.

10
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,210
Oh,wait a minute.It's late.

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,490
Aren't you supposed to be 
watching the game?

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,840
I was.Um,fargo called.

13
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,620
 Wagner again.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,820
I don't know. 
I get all the conductors confused.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,900
Composer.

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,140
I rest my case.

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,940
-Have a good one. 
-Yeah,you too.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
I love the smell of pesticide 
in the mornin'.

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,670
Smells like grant renewal.

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,910
Biopharmacology's just a fancy 
word for gardening!

21
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,460
Oh,that tears it.

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,900
My bad.

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,520
Trespassing is a crime,fargo.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,930
Now we'll see who the criminal is.

25
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,090
 sheriff,finally.

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,410
Hey,fargo.

27
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,090
You smell like fertilizer.

28
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,850
He sprayed me with that death machine.

29
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,730
God knows what's in this stuff.

30
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,410
Called him a gardener again,didn't you?

31
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,360
The point is I can't take the 
music anymore.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,920
He plays it day and night.

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,580
You try asking him nicely to 
turn it down?

34
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,660
I can't talk to that man.

35
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,360
He's completely irrational.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,020
-No idea what that's like. 
-People do not appreciate my role here.

38
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm the grease on the cogs 

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,250
that turn the gears in this 
machine that is eureka.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,320
Let's go.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,050
While I'm sure you did a great job in 
the last town you worked in

42
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,460
-- america,fargo.

43
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,580
I was a U.S.Marshal.

44
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,470
America was my last town.

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,330
My point is,the foundation of scientific
 exploration in no small part 

46
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,120
depends on me getting the proper amount of sleep.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,500
-I'm the- - Grease!

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,430
Yeah,I've got it.

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,950
Sheriff.I didn't hear you come up.

50
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,680
Can't imagine why,seth.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,310
 Yeah,sorry.

52
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,320
But my night-blooming necrosomnium 
violacea just can't get enough.

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,730
Yeah,well,I've had enough.

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,530
Well,that makes two of us.Half-pint.

55
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,840
You callin' me short?

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,590
If the corrective shoe fits,tiny.

57
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,160
-Oh,you--  -enough,both of you!

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,970
Please,guys.

59
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,720
Now my beer is warm,my steak is cold,

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,230
and I have half a football game 
to get back to.

61
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,380
Do you know what I'm saying?

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,290
 Yeah,not to bother you again.

63
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,700
Exactly.You. Go on home,
and for god's sake,take a shower.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,500
You,no serenading your plants 
after 6:00 P.M.Got it?

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,920
No buts!

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,390
If I have to come back,I'm bringing 
a stun gun and a weed whacker.

67
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,230
You got it?

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,340
Good.

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,970
Oh,well this was unexpected.

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,880
Well,you said kevin was with his 
grandparents.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,150
It's not often you get a night off.

72
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,100
No,honestly,it was nice.

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,550
I'm just--you know,it's been a long time since 
you've done something spontaneous.

74
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,520
You know,I was thinking.

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,900
Maybe we should revise our time 
table on sampling the artifact.

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,510
Um,okay.

77
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,330
Seeing that I know virtually nothing 
about it,what are you asking?

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,690
Well,we saw what even brief exposure can do.

79
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,610
I mean,dr.Carlson evolved beyond 
anything we've ever seen.

80
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,840
I don't know,nathan.We still don't have 
a handle on what we're dealing with.

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Which is why we need a physical 
sample to study.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,060
That's a huge risk.

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,880
Calculated risk.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,190
But we will need to revise the 
safety protocols.

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,900
I should've known.

86
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,850
-What? -That this wasn't just dinner.

87
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,440
That you had an agenda.

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,010
And I actually thought that...

89
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,930
may--Forget it.

90
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,190
-Well,it's important,
-I konw i t's important.

91
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,760
It's always more important.

92
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,100
And I'm tired of being the one
 who has to say no.

93
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,900
-Allie.
-No.

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,370
Welcome back,sheriff carter.

95
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,410
Hey,S.A.R.A.H.Who's winning?

96
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,380
Michigan state up by a touchdown.

97
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,130
What?How'd that happen?

98
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,500
Watch the rush!

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,270
No--fumble?

100
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,680
Fighting irish,my ass.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
Jackson might as well be handing 
them the ball.

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,110
No,he's green. You just gotta 
give him a little-- 

103
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,530
was that my steak?

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,400
It was getting cold.

105
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,280
And before you have a coronary,
that's ginger ale. Your beer's in the fridge.

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,370
Oh,not for long.

107
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,530
So,um,what was the emergency?

108
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,360
Uh,lovers' quarrel.

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,060
I handled it.

110
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,670
Come on!Go,go,go!

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,420
Warren,tonight we sleep like kings.

112
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,650
Oh,it's on now.

113
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
 Music to my ears.

114
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,600
What the hell are you doing?

115
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,330
Taking back the night.

116
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,980
Fargo,I'm gonna change your religion.

117
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,580
Oh,crap.

121
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,050
Allison blake.

122
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,500
No.

123
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,880
I don't wanna talk about this 
now,nathan.

124
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,750
No,it's just way too early to argue.

125
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,410
Oh,uh,I must've overslept.

126
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,640
Okay,look,I don't know.

127
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,630
When I feel like it.

128
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,560
Morning,henry.

129
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,010
Oh,hey.

130
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,600
Thought you'd finished it yesterday.

131
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,290
Didn't realize I was on a deadline.

132
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,380
Oh,no,no,no.

133
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,560
Just making conversation.

134
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,130
How's it work,anyway?

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,350
It,um-- 

136
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
 It just does.

137
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,120
God,do I really have to explain 
everything?

138
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,340
No.Feeling' okay?

139
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,730
Fine!

140
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,240
Just tired.

141
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,470
Well,I'll let you get back to it.

142
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,360
Thank you.

143
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,940
Hey,jo.

144
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,270
Um,you notice people acting a l
ittle,uh,weird?

145
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,950
No.

146
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,950
You look nice. 
You doin' something new with your hair?

147
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh,yeah!

148
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,390
I didn't feel like putting it up today.

149
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,880
No law against that,right?

150
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,870
Right.

151
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,520
Hey,you know what we should do tonight?

152
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,010
We should go dancing.

153
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,440
Sure,you and me.

154
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,680
Thin blue line,brotha.

155
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,320
We could tear it up.

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
Uh-- don't take this the wrong way.

157
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,530
But,um,have you been drinking?

158
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,820
Ooh,drinking!

159
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,440
Yeah,let's do that.

160
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,720
Oh,my god.

161
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,300
You know what would be so good right now?

162
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,820
One of those,uh,caramel cappuccinos,

163
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,800
you know,with the whipped cream 
and the cinnamon sprinkles?

164
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,480
You want?I'll go make a run.

165
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,440
-Well,actually- 
- great!

166
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,870
Back in a jiff.

167
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,810
Okay,something's definitely wrong.

168
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,040
I want that son of a bitch arrested.

169
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,140
Nice to see you,too,seth.

170
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,520
I take it something's happened?

171
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,600
Fargo happened.

172
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,180
That sneaky little misanthrope 
cut my speaker wires

173
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,370
 and knocked me out with a shovel.

174
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,910
Mild-mannered fargo knocked you out?

175
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,530
He ain't mild-mannered.

176
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,970
He's a frickin' lunatic.

177
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,360
And I want him locked up!

178
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,780
Okay.I'll go talk to him.

179
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,740
He's not at home.

180
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,570
When you find him,
I want you to arrest him.

181
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,560
Yeah.If I deem that necessary,
then I will arrest him.

182
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,150
In the meantime,
just go on home,okay?I'll handle it.

183
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,670
You better.Or I will.

184
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,510
Seth.

185
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,090
Is that a threat?

186
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,410
-No.
-Oh,good.

187
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,290
 It's gonna be one of those days.

188

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,230
Morning,fargo!

189
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,560
Go away.I'm trying to sleep.

190
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,940
Yeah.Talked to seth osborne.

191
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,530
Heard you had a busy night.

192
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,330
Arrest that maniac.He's a menace.

193
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,010
He says the same thing about you.

194
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,970
Me?I unplugged a couple speaker cables.

195
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,320
He freaks out.Next thing I know, 
I wake up in a pool of my own spittle.

196
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,420
Wait a second.He knocked you out?

197
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,190
Yeah,so why don't you go bother him 
and let me get back to sleep?

198
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,440
Oh,you can sleep in my cell.

199
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,850
You're coming in for a statement.

200
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,220
Aw,man.Why me?

201
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,830
Well,for starters,you just confessed 
to trespassing and vandalism.

202
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,410
Everyone always blames me for everything.

203
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,820
This is so not fair.

204
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,610
I know.Life generally isn'T.Let's go.

205
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,300
The answer is no.

206
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,280
You're answering a question 
that isn't being asked. 

206
00:13:44,280 -->00:13:45,550
He's coming with me.That's a statement.

207
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,920
Good morning,boys.

208
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,280
Hi.You look...nice.

209
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,560
Thank you.I feel nice.

210
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,620
-You're late. -You're never late.

211
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,690
Well,there's a first time for 
everything.

212
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,300
So.What's going on?

213
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,700
-Well,osborne was playing his music way too
-shut up.

214
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,310
There've been some very serious 
allegations leveled against fargo,.

215
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,420
and I'm taking him in

216
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,630
And I need him here to work.

217
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,110
So you're gonna have to tell the good 
sheriff that this will have to wait.

218
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,330
Don't the two of you ever get 
tired of bickering?

219
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,350
-Not really. -No.

220
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,970
Lookif fargo has done something illegal,
carter has to take care of it.

221
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,100
-Thank you. -Well,there's a surprise.

222
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,070
-What? -You taking his side.

223
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,930
I'm not taking anyone's side,nathan.

224
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,950
Oh,please.

225
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,910
You could never separate the 
personal from the professional.

226
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,980
Like your problem with carter is 
strictly professional.

227
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,370
I hate the way he looks at you.

228
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,690
Oh,I don't look at her.

229
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,310
Oh,please.Like a shark eyeing chum.

230
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,570
Really.No--I mean-- well,
yes--I mean,you look good,yeah.


232
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,480
But you-- we gotta stay on topic here.

233
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,660
Am I supposed to ignore that 
mayberry's hitting on my wife?

234
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,110
You do realize I'm standing right here.

235
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,640
First of all,nathan,
you and I are separated,

236
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,880
so carter or anyone else can make 
a move any time they want to.

237
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,550
Second of all,I'm not the one

237
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,690
who turned a perfectly pleasant 
dinner into a business proposal.

238
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,440
And most importantly,
I didn't leave you for a job in D.C.

239
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,070
And it always comes back to this.

240
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,250
Wake me when it's over.

241
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,910
Reminds me of the last time 
we slept together.

242
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,990
Well,at least you can remember it.

243
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,070
You're an ass.

244
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,110
Wanna know the truth,allison?

245
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,770
We were having our problems long 
before I left eureka.

246
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,760
But you refused to see it because 
it wasn't framed in your pretty little picture.

247
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,130
I never needed perfect,nathan.

248
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,640
I just needed someone to be there.

249
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,830
Well,here he is.Go for it.

250
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,860
I got work to do anyway.

251
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,160
I don't care what you do.

252
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,970
I'm tired of playing den mother 
around here.

253
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,890
You know,we're just gonna 
give you guys a minute-- 

254
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,020
oh,no,no,no,no.

255
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,030
You stay here.

256
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,520
I'll go.I quit.

257
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh,allison.Hold on.

258
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,620
All yours,sport.Enjoy.

259
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,880
Fargo.

260
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,240
Come on.

261
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,440
This isn't justice.This is madness.

262
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,450
I'm the grease,damn it.The grease!

263
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,460
Shut up for a second.

264
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,710
Hey,allison.It's jack. listen

265
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,960
People are acting a little weird.

266
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,750
And we-- well,frankly,
you're acting a little weird.

267
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,840
Um,but we should really get together 
and sort this out before it

268
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,660
Gets any worse.

269
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,780
Caught him trying to burn down fargo's house.

270
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,150
-Too late. 
- What?

271
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,810
-I'll kill him! 
-Oh,not if I kill you first!

272
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,330
Oh,knock it off.

273
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,070
Wanna lock 'em up together 
and see what happens?

274
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,680
And then I quit.

275
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,370
And it was like this heavy 
weight was lifted.

276
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,720
Like I was breathing for the 
first time in years.

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,860
It was--it was terrifying,yet 
liberating all at the same time.

278
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,310
Like anything was possible.

279
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,740
So-- so what do you think?

280
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,440
I think I've lost my appetite.

281
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,830
I know.I'm sorry.

282
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,270
It's just the first time 
that I've ever done this.

283
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,700
And it just seemed like a 
good time to start.

284
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,130
Yes,because most therapists 
love to work during their lunch break.

285
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,680
I-I'm sorry.

286
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,010
I thought you were supposed 
to be gentle and supportive.

287
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,490
Frankly,that's getting old.

288
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,730
Okay.

289
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,630
Every day,you people come to me 
and bare your souls

290
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,010
hoping I'll tell you what to do.

291
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,560
But that is not really 
what you're looking for.

292
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,600
It isn't?

293
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,290
No.You already know 
what you should do.

294
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,620
You're just looking for 
permission to do what you want.

295
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,450
I guess I could see how that could get tiring.

296
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,850
Yeah,everybody spills their guts to me,
but who do I get to talk to?

297
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,370
I never thought of it that way.

298
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,510
Of course not.

299
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,010
Because you're all too narcissistic 
to consider 

300
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,400
 that no one really gives a crap 
about your problems.

301
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,580
Which aren't really problems at all.

302
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,260
I mean,come on.

303
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,400
 I'm allison blake.

304
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm torn between "my gorgeous,brilliant,

305
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,400
but emotionally "unavailable husband 

306
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,240
and the gorgeous,charming,
but immature sheriff.

307
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,210
What should I do?

308
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,930
" You make a choice.

309
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,820
Commit to it,and live with the 
consequences.

310
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,120
Talk is easy.

311
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,320
Doing is hard.

312
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,040
passed out?You're sure you didn't 
just have one too many?

313
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
No,no,I believe you.

314
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,330
I just,uh-- yeah,I'll be in touch.

315
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,650
Okay,bye.

316
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,990
That's ten calls in ten minutes.

317
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm gonna find allison.

318
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,360
She doesn't get to quit today.

319
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,510
Quit it!

320
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,500
You quit it!

321
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
All right,hit 'em again.

322
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,860
Keep it up,bitches.

323
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,670
I can do this all day.

324
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,790
Okay,jo.

325
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,980
I'm gonna be back shortly.

326
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,500
I need you to stay here and watch 'em.

327
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
You got it,chief.

328
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,570
Stop calling me "chief.

329
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,880
 What are you doing?

330
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,760
Nothing.

331
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,240
Jo!

332
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,030
Okay,this is mine now.

333
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,150
You are no fun!

334
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,210
You know what would be fun?

335
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,200
Ice skating.

336
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
Never mind.

337
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,860
I'm gonna go figure this out.
You stay here.

338
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,370
And do whatever it is you're not doing.

339
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,010
 I don't think I'm following you,sir.

340
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,620
It's not that complicated,dr.Glazer.

341
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,200
I need you to give me access 
codes through the firewall.

342
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,450
There are strict safety protocols in place.

343
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,040
What you're suggesting could be 
catastrophic.

344
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,640
I need this,louis.

345
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,400
The current plan for making contact 

346
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,770
with the artifact follows a progression 
of steps over the next several months.

347
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,010
All carefully designed and approved.

348
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,830
By you.

349
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,170
Thought you were a team player,glazer.

350
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,230
But if you're not with me,I can do it myself.

351
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,390
But dr.Stark--

352
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,760
-I don't need you - very well.

353
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,140
I don't need anyone.

354
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,060
Allison?

355
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,870
 You home?

356
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,920
 Hey,carter.

357
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,030
Whatcha doing here?

358
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,310
I was worried.

359
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,650
You're not answering your cell phone

360
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,040
and things are getting really weird.

361
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,140
I need your help.

362
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,690
Ooh,that's nice.

363
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,700
Are you okay?

364
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,640
Yeah.

365
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,800
Believe it or not,I've been 
spending some time with beverly.

366
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,890
I--y-- in session?

367
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,480
Well,we weren't shoppin'.

368
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,350
Right.

369
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,590
W--uh,was it helpful?

370
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,590
Well,I've had a breakthrough.

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,010
Good.

372
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,960
So does that mean you've reconsidered?

373
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,350
Oh,I have.

374
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh,great!

375
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,130
Cause we gotta figure out what's 
gotten into people.

376
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,720
I mean,have you told stark 
you're not quitting?

377
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,760
Oh,I'm not talking about my job.

378
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm talking about what I want.

379
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,340
I-- in regards to--?

380
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,700
This.

381
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,860
Y-yeah,allison-

382
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,270
 I'm making a choice and 
committing to it.

383
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,540
Talk is easy.

384
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,650
Doing is hard.

385
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,840
Yeah,and what are you doing?

386
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,780
Exactly what I want.

387
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,540
Yeah.

388
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,990
I can'T.

389
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,440
Really?

390
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,690
Oh,no,I mean-- I mean,I can.

391
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm fully capable.But just not--

392
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,460
what are you talking about?

393
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,220
Hey,you're not yourself.

394
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,970
People aren't acting like themselves.

395
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,480
As much as I would love to--

396
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,340
 I completely understand.

397
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,070
Yeah.Good.

398
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,110
-Now get out.  -What?No!

399
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,200
I--if you just think.

400
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,610
Yeah,I'm done thinking.I'm doing.

401
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,140
henry.

402
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,020
Henry,spencer said I'd find you here.

403
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,560
Look,things are getting a little crazy.

404
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,590
I need to pick your brain.

405
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,810
Yeah,you and everybody else.

406
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,190
Uh,I don't follow.

407
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,210
I mean that's all anyone around 
here does is feed on me.

408
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,420
Global dynamics,D.O.D.,You.

409
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,430
I'm intellectual carrion.

410
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,820
 It's all about producing,
getting ahead of everybody else

411
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,150
,but that's not what I signed up for.

412
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,200
Little early in the morning 
for scotch,isn't it?

413
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,540
No.

414
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,920
I came to eureka to create 
without restriction or agenda.

415
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,480
To make the world a better place,
you know,like the new cell tower.

416
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,400
But eventually,it all gets digested 
by the machine 

417
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,190
and re-tasked and turned into 
omething very,very unappetizing.

418
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,820
Henry,I need you to focus for me.

419
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,960
Just for a second.

420
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,080
You need something from me.

421
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,590
Well,there's a shocker!

422
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,650
Okay,I'm just gonna ignore 
that and push on.

423
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,910
Um,people seem to be under the influence.

424
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,500
Doing what ever the hell they want,
like they're drunk.

425
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,820
Some of us are.

426
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,530
Could it be,uh,an infection?

427
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,080
Something like contagious turret's?

428
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,360
How did you get all those big words 
to come out of that tiny little brain?

429
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,670
You know,you're a really mean drunk.

430
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,850
Caribou pepper steak with roasted garlic.

431
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,560
Sheriff,you hungry?

432
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,280
Uh,not anymore.

433
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,690
Okay,well,the seats are for customers.

434
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,350
So either order something 
or get your ass up.

435
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,810
see?

436
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
You see?It's spreading.

437
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,210
So how's it being transmitted?

438
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,760
Is it a virus?

439
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,860
I don't know.

440
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,190
I don't care.

441
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,700
The doctor is out.

442
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,630
Henry,I can't solve this alone.

443
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,830
Well,then,you're really screwed.

444
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,990
Vincent,there's a tuft o
f hair in my food.

445
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,050
There you go.

446
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,550
And this is well done.

447
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,780
You know I like my meat bloody.

448
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,140
I am so sorry.

449
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,250
Let me fix that for 
you quick as a wink.

450
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,450
That bloody enough for you,jackass?

451
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,560
Yeah,I'm screwed.

452
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,830
What happened?

453
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,100
Uh,vincent brained one of the baker 
brothers with today's special.

454
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,600
Nice.Any particular reason?

455
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,930
Other than the fact that it was 
burnt and caribou...

456
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,970
maybe the fact that he's crazy?

457
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,780
We still getting calls about people
 who passed out last night?

458
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,230
Tons.I just stopped answering the phone.

459
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,070
Jo.

460
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,470
You have to answer the phone.

461
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,660
I-I-I don't want to.

462
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,780
It's so boring,and

463
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,840
 I-- I-I--okay.Okay.

464
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,330
Uh,um--people.

465
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,090
Gather round for a second.Quick question.

466
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,560
How many of you blacked out last night?

467
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,280
Put your hand down.Down.

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,580
Any of you woke up someplace 
strange this morning?

469
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,270
Okay,thank you.

470
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,590
Uh,jo,please take vincent back to 
the station and lock him up.

471
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,870
And keep him away from frick and frack.

472
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,320
Okay.

473
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,990
Jo!

474
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,780
Oh,yeah.

475
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,760
Right.Come on.

476
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Zoe,it's me.

477
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,570
Um,I need you to go home 
and stay there,okay?

478
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,130
Oh,and make sure you keep 
your cell on in case--

479
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,810
 oh,that's gotta be it.

480
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,930
Um,on second thought,scratch that.

481
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,530
Turn it off.Turn your cell off.

482
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,960
Devil's plaything.

483
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,050
Taggart?

484
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,750
You're naked.

485
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,810
Au natural.

486
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,010
May I ask why?

487
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,980
Why not?

488
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,070
Unfortunately,that doesn't tell me 
if you've been affected or not.

489
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,920
Why do we find it so impossible 
to live in harmony with nature?

490
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,830
I mean,look at it.

491
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,640
All function.

492
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,420
No form.

493
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,140
Or dysfunction.

494
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,150
Wanna help me take it down?

495
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,140
With pleasure.

496
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,770
And so quixote turns,standing in the field 
of men at the foot of giants

497
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,710
and says aloud,"no more!

498
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,620
 Let's tilt that windmill,shall we?

499
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,190
I was thinking more along the 
lines of an off switch.

500
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,050
Hey,don't make me come in there.

501
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,120
Uh,hey,attention,everyone.

502
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,220
Good news.You're all gonna be fine.

503
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,300
I think I fixed the problem.

504
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,380
Or taggart did.

505
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,150
Really?Because it sure doesn't 
look like it.

506
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,180
Well,maybe 
there's a delayed response.

507
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,110
Did you take away all their 
cells,P.D.A.S?

508
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,200
An hour ago.

509
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,260
Why do they seem worse?

510
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,590
Hello!

511
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,260
That's what I'm asking you.

512
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,710
-Henry .-I told you.

513
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,090
The doctor is out.

514
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm cleaning house.
Take anything you like.

515
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,130
Yeah,um,I know what you told me.

516
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,040
But that,um-- 
the subfrequency cellular...

517
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,930
thingamajig that you built,
that you finished.

518
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,830
I had this theory that it was 
responsible for the strange behavior.

519
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,940
So I had taggart,uh,dismantle it.

520
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,920
Good for you.

521
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,620
Yeah,only no one's getting any better.

522
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,730
Probably because it wasn't online.

523
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,720
You sure?

524
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,900
I built the damn thing,carter.

525
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,990
I should know whether 
or not it was running.

526
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,790
So this thing isn't over.

527
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,930
No.

528
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,960
hello,everyone.This is beverly barlowe.

529
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,480
I want you to know hey,
isn't that your P.A.System?

530
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,740
I gave it to her this morning.

531
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,450
I am canceling all therapy 
pointments for the foreseeable future.

532
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,380
All the secrecy is unhealthy,
and frankly,I can't take any more.

533
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,640
I suggest instead you start 
talking to each other.

534
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,770
So before I go,I thought 
I would give you a few issues to discuss.

535
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,910
I'll start in alphabetical order.

536
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,820
Allison blake.

537
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,350
Oh,crap.

538
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,070
That brings me to walter 
and susan perkins.

539
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,080
Boy,do I have a lot of dirt on these two.

540
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,270
Beverly!

541
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,670
And,quite frankly,it'll be a relief 
to get it all out in the open.

542
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,400
Yeah,let's leave it closed.

543
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,930
-But I am just getting to the good part. 
-Yeah,I know.

544
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,850
Walter and-- 

545
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,690
people are having a little bit of 
trouble controlling their impulses,

546
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,400
so I'm just gonna save you from yourself.

547
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,510
You're a dead woman.

548
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,650
And her.

549
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,270
Okay,okay.

550
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,730
I'm all yours,princess.

551
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,300
 oh,okay.

552
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,850
Is that the best you got?

555
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,300
You have every right to be angry.

556
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,950
But violence is not the answer.

557
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,080
If you guys wanna talk it--that's better.

558
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,510
Now maybe we can talk this through.

559
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,880
Bev,since you're the-- ow!

560
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,950
That's it.

561
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,530
Is that the best you've got?

562
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,060
Allison, what are you doing?

563
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,890
Exactly what I want to.

564
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,170
Well, it's about time.

565
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,250
Bev, not helping.

566
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,030
She exposed my deepest secrets 
to the entire town.

567
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,690
To be fair, I exposed everybody's secrets.

568
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,340
Well, up to the ps, anyway.

569
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm not too happy with you, either.
Now get out of the way.

570
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,710
Allison, listen to me.

571
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,610
You're not yourself.

572
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,340
Something's happening.

573
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,830
And it's happening to everyone.

574
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,060
Everybody but me.I'm not affected.

575
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,930
Why am I not affected?

576
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm pretty sure this will affect you.

577
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,580
Now move out of the way!

578
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,010
You're not gonna shoot anyone.

579
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,050
Really?Why's that?

580
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,480
You're not gonna shoot me.

581
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,660
Okay.

582
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,050
Sorry.

583
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,740
-It's for your own protection. 
-Think I was mad at you before?

584
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,540
I'll make it up to you.

585
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,040
There is nothing that you could possibly do.

586
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,010
Thank you.

587
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,350
Well, that's a start.

588
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,210
Okay.You two keep each other company.

589
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,940
Sure you got a lot to talk about.

590
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,470
 Oh, this isn't good.

591
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,570
Zoe. 

592
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,560
Zoe!

593
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,890
Oh, not you, too.

594
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,660
Me?What about you?

595
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm good.

596
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,270
Yeah?

597
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,340
Yeah.

598
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,560
Prove it.

599
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,830
Well, I-- put down my autographed 
world series bat,

600
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,580
 or I'll ground you till you're 30.

601
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,550
Oh, thank god.

602
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,770
I was freaking out.

603
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,210
You're okay?

604
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,560
Well, considering everyone's gone schizo.

605
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,110
The school's completely out of control.

606
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,080
Kids in fights.

607
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,940
Making out in the hallways.

608
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,820
Teachers apathetic.

609
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,710
So more like a normal school, then.

610
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,900
Exactly.

611
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,290
Weird, huh?

612
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,760
Well, I mean, we're both fine, right?

613
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,040
But why?I mean, what makes us different?

614
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,740
We're from L.A.

615
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,880
Well, that definitely sets us apart, yeah.

616
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,140
But we've been in town for a while.

617
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,300
What makes us different now?

618
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,190
 Maybe a massage would help clear 
your head so you can think.

619
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,800
How come you never offer me a massage?

620
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,280
That's it.

621
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,370
A massage.

622
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,180
No.

623
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,960
S.A.R.A.H., Door.

624
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,150
-W-where are you going? -Nowhere.

625
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,330
S.A.R.A.H., Door.

626
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,950
That hissing sound.

627
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,980
S.A.R.A.H., This bunker is 
hermetically sealed, right?

628
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,510
Technically, 
I'm a smart house.But yes.

629
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,140
Okay, and, uh, where does our 
air come from?

630
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm equipped with oxygen and carbon 
dioxide tanks in case of emergency.

631
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,830
However, most of your breathable 
air is filtered from the outside

632
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,670
through a 0.1 micron particle filter.

633
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,420
Okay, and I bet you keep 
track of every micron.

634
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,500
Of course.

635
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,190
All right, I'm gonna need an 
analysis, and fast.

636
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,210
Whatever happened happened last 
night while we were sleeping.

637
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,900
The only abnormality in the last 24 
hours is a spike in the pollen count

638
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,820
 from 11:53 P.M.To 6:23 A.M., Sunrise.

639
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,980
Pollen.What kind--
what kind of pollen?

640
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,460
Searching.

641
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,140
Material in question is 
exotic in nature.

642
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,850
It will take me some time to 
collate that data.

643
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,200
Okay, great.Well, you have about 
20 minutes before it gets dark.

644
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,810
So, um, S.A.R.A.H., Door.

645
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,590
Where are you going?

646
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,850
Back to where it started.
You stay here.

647
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,640
Okay, I'm in.

648
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,140
Be careful.

649
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,770
I got nothing.

650
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,190
S.A.R.A.H., You say a plant's 
causing this?

651
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,950
The filter log registered positive 
for pollen from the violacea family.

652
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,940
 yeah, yeah, yeah.

653
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,590
It's, um, night-blooming 
necro-something violacea.

654
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,770
That's osborne's genetic hybrid.

655
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,830
Necrosomnium?

656
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,330
Yeah, that's it.What is that?

657
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,020
According to the eureka quest 
search engine

658
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,770
it's latin for "death sleep.

659
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,890
Of course it is.

660
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,480
Why--why would somebody plant that?

661
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,660
Says here it's potentially an 
organic sedative, 

662
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
an alternative to general anesthesia.

663
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


664
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,580
There's a picture.

665
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,770
Hey, do you see any purple flowers or plants?

666
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,500
Uh, no.Nada.

667
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,300
"Hybrids may not share "the same 
characteristics as their parents, 

668
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,260
and often present radically 
different visible traits.

669
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,180
So maybe it's a different color?

670
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,530
No, it's purple.Gotta go.

671
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,470
Nature, one.

672
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,810
Man, nil.

673
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,140
Striking back for mother nature.

674
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,450
Taggart?I know what you're up to, sheriff.

675
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,650
You're gonna burn these beautiful plants.

676
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,960
For good reason, you jackass!

677
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,830
Unless you want me to roast your 
chestnuts, back off!

678
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,350
You wouldn't dare.

679
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,800
Try me.

680
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,880
all right, folks.Freeze-dried 
astronaut soup.

681
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,780
I have no clue what it is, 
but get it while it's hot.

682
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,180
Got room for one more?

683
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,980
Sorry, mary.Manger's full.T
ry the caf?

684
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,080
 yeah, it's packed.

685
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,000
Besides, I want taggart where 
I can see him.

686
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,910
Or smell him.

687
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,930
Yeah.

688
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,940
Hope the pollen effect wears off before
 we have to start to bathe these guys.

689
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,210
Too late.

690
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,320
What?

691
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,570
Fargo missed bucket time.

692
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,790
Oh, that's disgusting.

693
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,720
But the good news is, is that 
the swearing has gone down considerably.

694
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,130
And nobody's tried to spit in my 
face for the past couple of hours.

695
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,180
Well, that's progress.

696
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,640
No.

697
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,850
So is this everybody?

698
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,620
One more stop.

699
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,420
Is it safe to come in?

700
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,190
Relatively.

701
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,600
Might've been nice 
if you'd chained us to a bed last night.

702
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,770
-Stop it. 
-Didn't say anything.

703
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,730
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

704
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,800
Again, I am so sorry.

705
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,490
Guess I have a few apologies to make.

706
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,840
And thank you for stopping me.

707
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,850
You're welcome.

708
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,120
 I guess I should thank you 
for stopping me, too.

709
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,370
That was pretty heroic.

710
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,890
Oh, you mean here at beverly'S.

711
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,540
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

712
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,980
Here.

713
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,290
Oh, oh, oh, I quit my job.

714
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,870
I'm not looking forward to 
that conversation.

715
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,360
Where's nathan?Chained to 
a radiator or something?

716
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,110
I have no idea.

717
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,300
Sorry, I've been a little busy 
saving the world, 

718
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,030
so-- you know, again.

719
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,890
Security breach in section 5.

720
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,900
Come on.

721
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,280
Damn it.

722
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,840
so what exactly are
we dealing with here?

723
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,420
All I know is that 
here's something inside section 5 

724
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,150
that nathan is obsessed with.

725
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,890
Something that he thinks 
will change the world.

726
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,270
Of course, it's incredibly dangerous.

727
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,810
Have you ever known anything 
to change the world that wasn't?

728
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,170
Velcro.

729
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,300
You're right.Not the right time.

730
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,210
Wow, so everybody's 
left the building.

731
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,360
Biohazard containment system's 
been activated.

732
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,780
They must evacuate.

733
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,770
One guess who's responsible.

734
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,800
 Allison

735
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,490
He might still be affected, 
and he's not too happy with you.

736
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,570
No, I can reach him.

737
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,730
I know I can.

738
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,480
Can't let you take that risk.

739
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,060
I need to.Please.

740
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,380
Nathan.

741
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,190
You need to leave now.

742
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,600
Listen, please.

743
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,620
There's nothing you can say.

744
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,300
I need to do this.

745
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,580
No, you don'T.

746
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,400
I want to do this.

747
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,700
you don't have anything to prove.
Not to me.Not to anyone.

748
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,590
I lost you.

749
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,390
Artifact's all I have left.

750
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,580
That's not true.I'm here now.

751
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,590
You don't know 
what's inside that room.

752
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,830
But you know what's out here.

753
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,510
We need you.The town needs you.

754
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,960
I need you.

755
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,410
I need you, too.

756
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,280
It's okay.It's okay, honey.

757
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,230
You're okay.

758
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,900
It's okay.

759
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,090
so I guess that's it, then.

760
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,730
And hopefully, we can all now return 
to our normal routines.

761
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,120
The crazy rainforest plants have been,

762
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,130
 uh, let's just say recycled.

763
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,570
And, um, fortunately, no lives
 were lost in the process.

764
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:23,640
So while someone you know may have 
done or said something that, uh,

765
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,570
 you didn't like, please remember 
that you probably said 

766
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,160
or did something 
you're not too proud of, either.

767
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,970
Let's try to put all this behind us.

768
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,600
Forgive and forget.

769
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,810
And let bygones be bygones.

770
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,990
Fellow eurekans, I just wanna touch base 
and tie up a few loose ends.

771
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,600
-You like my speech? 
-It was great.

772
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,870
Thanks.

773
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,150
Look, I just wanted to, 
you know, thank you for, 

774
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,200
you know, not taking advantage 
of the situation.

775
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,870
Oh, yeah.

776
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,140
This whole debacle has raised 
a few questions for all of us.

777
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,520
And I'm no exception.

778
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,150
You are a gentleman, and I, uh, 
I appreciate it.

779
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,530
Thank you, carter.

780
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,340
Aw, we're back to carter now?

781
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,990
Just take it slowly.

782
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,500
None of us are going anywhere.

783
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,660
this was a difficult decision 
for me to make.

784
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,270
And it's been...

785
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,260
quite a journey.

786
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,360
But it's time for me to leave eureka.
