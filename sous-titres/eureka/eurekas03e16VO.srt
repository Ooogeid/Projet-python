1
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,609
- It looks like a snow globe.
- It's a storycatcher.

2
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:12,440
You hold it in your hand,
you look into the lens,

3
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:15,306
and you describe a memorable event
about living in Eureka.

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,184
- Have we had any of those?
- No, nothing comes to me.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,062
So it's basically
a glorified video recorder?

6
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,105
More like a brain recorder.

7
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:27,260
It creates a wireless neural connection
through the optic nerve

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,570
to see memories as you recall them.

9
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,947
Can it help you find something lost,
like a wallet?

10
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:35,159
You're cute. No, it's for the Eureka
time capsule project.

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,663
All the stories will be collected
and preserved in a living video diary.

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,414
So no pressure?

13
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,250
Okay, so what am I supposed to say?

14
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:46,837
Maybe something about
your first time in Eureka.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,090
Your arrival
was definitely memorable.

16
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:51,759
Thanks, Vince.
That's a nice way to put that.

17
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:54,700
Well, I've kind of blocked
all that out of my head, so...

18
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,975
Here, let me refresh your memory.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,642
Here we go.

20
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,880
When you first got here,

21
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,483
we didn't exactly click.

22
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:21,330
- Pretty impressive, Jo.
- It's deputy Lupo.

23
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,084
- Where'd you learn to do that, anyway?
- US Army, special forces.

24
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,627
That explains some things.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,725
What things?

26
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:31,507
Nothing, none of my business.

27
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,926
You got something to say, say it.

28
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,265
It's just the whole tough-girl image.
I mean, it's fine and everything,

29
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,445
but some guys might find it
intimidating.

30
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:45,744
Unless you're into chicks.
That's fine too.

31
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,019
Stop talking.

32
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,518
Like a little blonde
ray of sunshine.

33
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:55,150
Well, you know, on the plus side,

34
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,240
if this whole waitressing thing
doesn't work out,

35
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:59,660
I can always fall back
on my life of crime.

36
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:01,355
That's a good plan.

37
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,165
So now that's recorded on this?

38
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,990
As you talk, it translates
your synaptic impulses into images

39
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:10,450
that can be downloaded
onto my computer in my lab.

40
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:13,325
So they're, like,
happy little memory balls.

41
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,275
Yeah, just like that.

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,965
And this is fun,
but I got birthing class with Allison.

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,223
Oh, yeah, she's in
for the home stretch, huh?

44
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,541
Yeah, I'm on call 24 hours a day.

45
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,210
Can I get another story thing?
I think mine overloaded.

46
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,108
You think? You've been the center
of every disaster this town's ever had.

47
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:32,695
Not all of them.

48
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:35,695
Death ray, homicidal smart house...

49
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,700
- Force field bubble.
- Keep a tally. We can start a pool.

50
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,155
- That's not funny.
- Come on.

51
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,122
- I got to go.
- Wait, wait. Don't forget yours.

52
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,336
Think of something good, will you?

53
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,185
I'll try.

54
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,375
Anyone else talk about me?

55
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,724
That's classified.

56
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:18,065
- I thought you were closing up.
- Do I have to do everything?

57
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:22,230
- How's it going?
- Hey, I just tried to page you.

58
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,353
Why... You didn't get my message?

59
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,151
I must've left it at the cafe.

60
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,982
That pager has an encrypted signal
that could reach you in a cave in China

61
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:35,506
if I go into labor,
but only if you don't lose it.

62
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,950
I'll pick it up 
after the birthing class. How's that?

63
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:40,700
See? That was the message.
Class has been canceled.

64
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,556
They do a sonic cleaning
of Global Dynamics once a year.

65
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,308
The entire facility is shut down
for the long weekend.

66
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:50,835
But it's graduation day.
I've been practicing my breathing.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,567
Well, you'll get to use it soon enough.
Hey, and it's my breathing.

68
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:56,825
Right.

69
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,025
Oh, boy...

70
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,365
You know, this place is gonna
seem empty without you.

71
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,815
Well, I'll only be on maternity leave
for six weeks.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,078
I'm sure that
you won't even miss me.

73
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,875
What is a sonic cleaning, anyway?

74
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:13,045
Only the most sophisticated
sterilization process ever created.

75
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:16,705
- Carter, this is Dr. Kinison.
- Hi. How are you?

76
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:18,735
Why are you yelling?

77
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,790
Dr. Kinison pioneered
an acoustic cleaning process

78
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:25,681
that will sterilize this facility
in 48 hours.

79
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,309
I like that way that... sounds.

80
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,620
Final checks, Dr. Blake.
We've got three stragglers.

81
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:35,649
Ashe, Bubay, and Fargo.

82
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,318
I'm sure they're still locking up.

83
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,232
We have to make sure
that any biological experiments

84
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:43,825
have been removed or contained

85
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,619
and any volatile GD projects
have been secured.

86
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,945
You know what? You can help me.

87
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,414
Excellent. You can practice
your breathing on the way.

88
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,910
<i>Attention, sonic cleaning
to commence in 90 minutes.</i>

89
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,985
<i>Please evacuate the building.</i>

90
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,961
Let's check the mainframe
and see how other people remember me.

91
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,000
Show me Douglas Fargo.

92
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,314
<i>Memory output, halo engaged.</i>

93
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,774
<i>Begin transmission.</i>

94
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,485
This is Eureka!

95
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,039
- Fargo, what are you doing with that?
- Nothing.

96
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,166
Never seen it before.
I found it in my pocket.

97
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,543
- But you did turn it on.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:38,796
- Why?
- It's what I do.

99
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,105
Go.

100
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,428
<i>Primary firing sequence initiated.</i>

101
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,932
<i>Weapon will deploy in 24 hours.</i>

102
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,062
It's the mummy queen!

103
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,731
They're not backing away
from the vehicle.

104
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,858
Happy place, happy place.

105
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:01,985
You're a great bodyguard, Fargo!

106
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:07,282
Welcome, I'm a self-actuated
residential automated habitat...

107
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,355
SARAH, for short.

108
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,845
Is that you talking like a girl?

109
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:29,888
What are you doing?

110
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,424
Dr. Kinison...

111
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:36,165
I was just grabbing this
for Dr. Fontana.

112
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,975
You better clear out.
Sonic sterilization will turn you

113
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,700
from a solid to a liquid
in no time flat.

114
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,278
Point taken.

115
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,425
<i>Files updated.</i>

116
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:58,276
Dr. Bubay.

117
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,254
Why are you still here?
The cleaning's about to start.

118
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,428
Right. I have this nagging feeling

119
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,384
there's something
I was supposed to do.

120
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,845
Like securing your experiment?

121
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,425
That sounds familiar. Now...

122
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,185
What experiment
would that be exactly?

123
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,795
I guess that experiment.

124
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,422
Projet-SG (1.00)

125
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:50,145
Unbelievable. What happened?

126
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,150
If I had to take a guess,
I'd say that

127
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:57,075
someone's chemical mixture
became unstable and ignited.

128
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:00,400
You're supposed to monitor these things
so that this doesn't happen.

129
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:01,825
In my lab, sure.

130
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,565
This is your lab.

131
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,783
You and Dr. Ashe are GD's
finest seismic chemists.

132
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:11,740
I know the name,
but I can't place his face.

133
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,910
- Her. Her face.
- She's your partner.

134
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,650
You created
an aliphatic polyurea prepolymer

135
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,706
that could revolutionize
earthquake safety.

136
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,584
An ali... alip... what?

137
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,152
- Unbreakable glue for brick mortar.
- What a great idea.

138
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,258
Say, can I get in on that project?

139
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,428
Okay, we have an off-site infirmary.
I'll have him checked out.

140
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,056
All right, I'll find Ashe.
Maybe she knows what's going on.

141
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,224
Come on.

142
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:44,306
God, trying to think
of something worthwhile to say

143
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,694
just highlights how little
I've really done.

144
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,193
You're overthinking it, Zo.

145
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,054
Really? That's easy for you to say,
Dr. Three PhDs.

146
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,975
- I mean, I'm not even a scientist.
- Well, Vincent's not a scientist,

147
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,703
and I'm sure he's got a unique
perspective on this town, right?

148
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,873
Actually, I have a PhD
in molecular gastronomy.

149
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,001
See? Okay, you know what?
You just go first.

150
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,837
All right, Vincent, what you got?

151
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,962
All right.

152
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,500
You think Iron Chef is exciting?

153
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,625
They got nothing on cafe Diem.

154
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,305
I remember it like it was yesterday.

155
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,934
Everybody down!
Invisible drone on the loose!

156
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,943
You may want to lay off
the vinspresso, Sheriff.

157
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,196
Oh, boy, I think I got everything.

158
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,750
What took you so long?

159
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,419
I was lost. I'd still be in there
if your Cylon-shuttle thing

160
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,953
- hadn't shown me the way out.
- What Cylon-shuttle thing?

161
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,624
It was just behind me.

162
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,385
You guys go in the corner.
Go. You guys, down.

163
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,010
Really?

164
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,868
Jo, stand down.

165
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,504
You remember me?

166
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
Piggybacks?

167
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,638
Good times.

168
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,512
- Very surprising...
- Martha's here.

169
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:36,635
How did she...?

170
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:39,763
Look out!

171
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,117
That's the story
you're gonna tell for all posterity?

172
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:02,034
What?

173
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,318
Beats the hell
out of a book of recipes.

174
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,457
Oh, Lord.

175
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,136
Dr. Ashe.

176
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:12,962
Oh, great.

177
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:16,340
I seem to have lost my lab.

178
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:17,821
You've...

179
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,661
Do you still know
what a prepolymer glue is?

180
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:22,574
Of course.

181
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,226
In fact, just now I had an idea about
a new kind of aliphatic-based epoxy.

182
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,063
Yes, yes, I was just talking
to your partner about that.

183
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,284
But I don't have a partner.

184
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:35,359
Dr. Bubay? He's got red hair,
sort of looks like Opie.

185
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,238
I don't know
what you're talking about.

186
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,261
Look, my name is
Sheriff Jack Carter, right?

187
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,906
I need you to come...

188
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,946
- Is this yours?
- Thanks.

189
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:47,496
I was wondering where that was.

190
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,711
Why don't you come with me?
We're gonna check you out, okay?

191
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,509
So I spoke to Henry.

192
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:58,008
They're suffering from lacunar
amnesia... Selective memory loss.

193
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,094
So they can remember their work
but not each other?

194
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,915
Well, so far, but if the pathways
in their striate cortex get infected,

195
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,911
this could turn
into retrograde amnesia.

196
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:09,227
So what could cause it?

197
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,314
It seems odd that they'd suffer from
the same thing at exactly the same time.

198
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:16,570
I don't know. Trauma, injury, maybe
exposure to chemicals in their lab.

199
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,220
All clear, Dr. Blake.

200
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:21,239
I found Fargo in lab 511
and hustled him out.

201
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,076
That's Tess' lab.
What's he doing down there?

202
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,120
Is that where she keeps
the time capsule thingy?

203
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,246
Yeah. Why?

204
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,511
Can you hold the cleaning
till we get back?

205
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,445
- No problem.
- Oh, thanks.

206
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:33,839
There you go.

207
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,196
Well, I don't understand.

208
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,252
I found one of Tess' memory balls
inside Dr. Ashe's pocket,

209
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,384
and Henry said
that Dr. Bubay has one too.

210
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,887
Everyone has one.

211
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,143
Is it possible that
the recording of these memories

212
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,759
- somehow makes people forget them?
- It doesn't work that way.

213
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:51,415
The neural link copies memories
to the storynest.

214
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,008
It doesn't erase them.

215
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,259
It's through that that you guys
can watch the recordings?

216
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,718
Well, you just input a memory
and put the halo interface on.

217
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:03,507
Awesome.

218
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,135
<i>Sterilization protocols initiated.</i>

219
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,098
- You told me to put it on.
- No, no, no, not you.

220
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,560
Kinison must've started the sonic
cleaning. I'll hit the fail-safe.

221
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:24,747
Tell me the fail-safe
didn't just fail.

222
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,534
Well, it should've been activated
as standard safety protocol.

223
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,885
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
to commence in 60 minutes.</i>

224
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,895
What does sonic sterilization do?

225
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, it fires a blast
of coherent phonons

226
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,157
that vibrate any organic matter
at a subatomic level.

227
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:42,279
Sounds uncomfortable.

228
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,745
It will completely dismantle any germs,
allergens, or biological impurities,

229
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,184
including us.

230
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,197
No one's answering.
Everyone's left the building.

231
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,946
Let's try to call someone outside
the building. You want to try Henry?

232
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:06,195
Section Five blocks
standard cell signals...

233
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Security issues.

234
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:11,695
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
to commence in 50 minutes.</i>

235
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:15,509
There's a way to contact someone.

236
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,492
The GD communication network
shuts down

237
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:19,815
to minimize electrical
interference during the cleaning,

238
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,487
but the fail-safe should've sent
an emergency alert to Kinison.

239
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,983
Let's hope he can hear it.

240
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:38,570
You're beeping.

241
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:39,835
Right. Sorry.

242
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,235
- Could I get a refill, please?
- Sure.

243
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:49,596
- I wonder what that means.
- Here you go.

244
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:53,308
Jo, your soup's coming right up.

245
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,685
I ordered soup?

246
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,063
White bean with truffles?

247
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,016
Sounds good.

248
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,318
You okay?

249
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:08,782
Aside from being painfully average,
yeah, I'm super.

250
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,068
What?

251
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,828
She's having a little trouble thinking
of a story for the time capsule.

252
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,134
Because I haven't done
anything that exceptional.

253
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,960
As entertaining as they may be,
no one wants to hear about my mistakes.

254
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:24,339
Well, you know that mistakes
make exceptional possible.

255
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:26,568
Well... well, here, look.

256
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,640
For example, when you
and your dad came into town,

257
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,015
I was tinkering in my garage.

258
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,591
Here goes nothing.

259
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,229
That failure changed our approach

260
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:20,262
to creating artificial gravity
for space travel.

261
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,477
So here in Eureka,

262
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,613
mistakes can lead to new directions.

263
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,907
Sometimes the wrong path
leads to the right path.

264
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:37,495
So just give it time,
and you will find your own path.

265
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:40,165
Thanks.

266
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,934
When did I order soup?

267
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,148
I just don't understand how Kinison
could forget that we're down here.

268
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,889
Well, everyone was given
a storycatcher, right?

269
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,380
My God, including him,
which means the amnesia is spreading.

270
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,960
- We have to get out of here.
- We're gonna break our way out.

271
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:04,356
Through a titanium door that can take
20 tons per square inch of pressure.

272
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:09,147
Why is everything
such overkill with you people?

273
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,196
Well, it's supposed to keep us safe!

274
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:15,867
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I just...
I just don't know how this happened.

275
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,461
It's okay.

276
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,379
I mean, we're gonna figure it out.

277
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,947
But first...

278
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,397
I'd like to figure out
what Fargo was doing down here.

279
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,083
How do I use this?
I just put it on?

280
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,049
Yeah, just close your eyes
and say a name.

281
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,310
Show me Douglas Fargo.

282
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:20,897
There's only one memory,
and it's a shared dream

283
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,244
with Fargo as a hero.

284
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,798
What were you expecting?

285
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:26,802
Lots.

286
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,125
He never met a button
he didn't push.

287
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,433
He is pathological.

288
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,467
And I mean, Fargo was irritated
this morning

289
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,471
when he found out that people's
memories were gonna make him look...

290
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,594
Like Fargo.

291
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,198
What would make him think that?

292
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,098
Well, me.

293
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:45,809
Great. Good job.

294
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,355
You're right. Dozens of files
have been deleted from the mainframe.

295
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,681
If he erased memories from the storynest
while the connection was still active,

296
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,736
it could start wiping
people's minds.

297
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:59,614
Okay, do we need him to fix it?

298
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,493
You know, actually, if the neural
connection is still active,

299
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,730
I might be able to use the storynest

300
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:08,010
to make contact
with people outside of GD.

301
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,770
Great. And you know how to do that?

302
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:13,695
Yeah, I have to access the mainframe,
then I should be able to...

303
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:16,965
What?

304
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,991
I'm sorry, what was I saying?

305
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,778
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
to commence in 30 minutes.</i>

306
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:26,496
- My God, we have to get outta here.
- That's what we're trying to do.

307
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:29,702
You don't understand. The sonic cleaning
will dismantle any organic matter.

308
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,062
On a subatomic level.

309
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,606
Yeah, that's right.
Who told you that?

310
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,645
You.

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,820
Right before you started
losing your memory.

312
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,005
All right, one more time.

313
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:59,632
We're about to be vibrated to death,
and not in the good way.

314
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,218
This is crazy, Carter.
I am not losing my memory.

315
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:05,972
That's the fourth time you've told me.
You check your right pocket again?

316
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,977
What...
Where'd this come from?

317
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,855
That's from Tess' project.

318
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,816
You recorded your memory, and now
you're starting to forget your life.

319
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,522
This is crazy, Carter.
I am not losing my memory.

320
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,170
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
will commence in 25 minutes.</i>

321
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:25,345
Sonic sterilization?
We have to get outta here!

322
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,940
Allison, you got to focus.

323
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:30,320
You were attempting to access
the neural net to make a call for help.

324
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,082
- Okay, that's really difficult.
- If anyone can do it, it's you.

325
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:37,755
- You are the head of Global Dynamics.
- I am? When did that happen?

326
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:40,757
Oh, my God, when did that happen?

327
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,305
There you go.

328
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,805
If you can't remember your life...

329
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,349
- Then let me show it to you.
- I can remember my life just fine.

330
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,095
Allison, trust me.

331
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:57,065
You do have kind eyes.

332
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,765
I want you to put this on.

333
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:05,995
Close your eyes,

334
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,371
And say, "Show me Jack Carter
and Allison Blake".

335
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:17,877
Show me Jack Carter
and Allison Blake.

336
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,550
We just never hang out.

337
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,468
I don't know what's going on with you.
What's going on with Allison?

338
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,637
No, Allison, don't!

339
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,440
- What are you doing?
- No, I'm just trying...

340
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,777
- I think that I can. Let me just...
- Stop it. Stop the...

341
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:47,699
A kiss for luck?

342
00:22:57,421 --> 00:23:01,425
- Thought you were into young brunettes.
- No, no, I'm into old brun...

343
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:04,173
- Didn't come out right, did it?
- No, no.

344
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,210
Actually, you know what?
I could use you.

345
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:10,337
I don't know. I'm not a piece of meat.
I mean, I got feelings, emotions.

346
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,849
Time's a-wastin'. Drop them.

347
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,458
There'll be no pant-dropping
without a nice dinner

348
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,105
and many, many cocktails.

349
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,023
Allison, can you hear me?

350
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,145
<i>I can do more than hear you.</i>

351
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:25,635
Sorry.

352
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,406
Can you put that away?

353
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,509
- I'll let you buy me a cup of coffee.
- It's free.

354
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:35,685
Well, in that case, I'll buy.

355
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,832
I think this is definitely
becoming our thing.

356
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:39,542
We don't have a thing.

357
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:41,615
We might.

358
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:46,635
Well, I remember your face.

359
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,761
I just can't place your name.
We work together, right?

360
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,929
Well...

361
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:54,140
We more than just work together.

362
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:58,255
You're my friend,

363
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:00,560
and you're our birthing coach.

364
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:01,685
And...

365
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,320
You even gave me a pager so that you can
reach me 24 hours, around the clock.

366
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:08,071
What?

367
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,070
You gave me a pager.

368
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,535
It has a super signal so that
it can reach me in a cave in China.

369
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,200
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah, I remember that you forgot it.

370
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,175
Right, at Cafe Diem. Now...

371
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,667
Is that on the same network as GD?

372
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:25,129
No, I think it has
its own frequency.

373
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,847
Great, give me yours.

374
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:28,815
What for?

375
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:32,925
We have a shot
at getting outta here.

376
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,544
Vin, I'm still waiting
on that cordon bleu.

377
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:43,815
My goodness, that sounds delicious.
I'll take one.

378
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:45,645
What?

379
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,180
Dr. Kinison, please,
that PDA is driving me crazy!

380
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,155
What are you talking about?

381
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,450
That.

382
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:56,355
That's not me.

383
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:58,913
For the love of God...

384
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:11,445
"911, trapped in S5-L511. Help"?

385
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:13,252
What are you talking about?

386
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,203
It's my dad's pager. He got this
from Allison. She says she's trapped.

387
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,890
What's S5-L511?

388
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,730
That's Section Five, Lab 511.
That's my lab.

389
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,729
But they just shut GD down
for a sonic cleaning today.

390
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,649
Tess, my dad didn't come back
after that birthing class.

391
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,890
Have you guys seen
Allison or Carter?

392
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:34,699
- Who's Carter?
- Allison?

393
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,325
Are you serious?

394
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,004
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

395
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:41,429
Henry, we have to get to GD.
Something is really wrong.

396
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:43,245
Sorry, what's GD?

397
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:49,792
Kinison, you need to use your PDA
to shut down the sonic cleaning at GD.

398
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,257
There are people in there.

399
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:54,343
Sonic cleaning?

400
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,861
Okay, never mind.

401
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:59,675
- I'm gonna borrow this. Is that okay?
- Sure. It's not mine.

402
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,085
Zoe, come on. Let's go.

403
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:07,899
- What was all that about?
- I have no idea.

404
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,435
So you come here often?

405
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
to commence in 20 minutes.</i>

406
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:20,102
Well, hopefully,
somebody will find my pager.

407
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,377
Well, watching the memory helped.

408
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,465
It did?

409
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,001
We can focus on the ones
that had the most impact,

410
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,510
and those memories
could bring back others.

411
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:32,089
Well, the strongest memories
are tied to emotions.

412
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:35,051
Well, we've definitely been witness
to a lot of those.

413
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,595
All right, well, you better show me.

414
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,675
Allison Blake and Nathan Stark.

415
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:58,282
Allison Blake and Nathan Stark.

416
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:05,456
- I swear I was just about to call you.
- You're moving back to Eureka?

417
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,200
Moved, actually, yesterday.

418
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,025
Same office, same house.

419
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,628
Surprise.

420
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,050
- Thank you.
- Now you're official.

421
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,775
- I've made up my mind.
- So have I.

422
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,605
Hey, guys.

423
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,085
Kind of busy.

424
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:27,428
- I need to talk to Allison.
- About what?

425
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,875
Global needs you.

426
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:33,505
I need you.

427
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:36,225
Really?

428
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:40,680
Carter's right, the two of you
do work well together.

429
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:43,077
You just know
how to ruin the moment.

430
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,830
And I won't be happy
until we're together.

431
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,900
Marry me, Allie...

432
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:52,044
Again.

433
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:57,967
You ready?

434
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:01,585
Momentous, huh?

435
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,643
I'll always be here for you.

436
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:10,545
You know that, right?

437
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,295
No matter what.

438
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,775
Are you okay? You look...

439
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,275
pale.

440
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,874
Where's Nathan?

441
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,295
I remember.

442
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,658
I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

443
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,385
You'll never lose me.

444
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,365
<i>Warning,
sonic sterilization to commence</i>

445
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,270
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

446
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:17,046
Allison, if that page
didn't reach anyone,

447
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,548
you're the only one
who can get us out of here.

448
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,461
So...

449
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:22,955
Okay, I'll try.

450
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:35,147
You're crushing the bones
in my hand.

451
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:40,355
That was a contraction.

452
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,675
I just started my labor.

453
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,135
Oh, boy.

454
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,293
If we don't get out,
there's gonna be three of us.

455
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:01,298
You were saying you thought you could
call for help using the neural net?

456
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,634
Yeah, if I could remember
how it works.

457
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,975
Breathe, just like in class.

458
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,415
I know, Carter.

459
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,225
Classes were for you, not for me.

460
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:16,125
<i>Sonic sterilization
to commence in 12 minutes.</i>

461
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,742
- This is really bad.
- Well, we've been through worse, so...

462
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,390
That is an unfortunate
choice of words.

463
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,988
We've been through a lot,

464
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:33,030
and I need you to remember everything
if we stand a chance of getting out.

465
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,605
Okay, show me more.

466
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,282
Say, "Show me Eureka".

467
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,592
Show me Eureka.

468
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:49,335
Here's to scientific leaps
and the beginning of the universe.

469
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,193
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

470
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,355
Nevermind!

471
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,504
Vince, freezer!

472
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,342
Hang on!

473
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,761
- We're at 1,000 degrees.
- You have to do it now.

474
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm trying!

475
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,558
How hard is it to push a button?

476
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,155
You wanna do it?

477
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,198
You're right, we've had
some rough times, but this is worse.

478
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:51,116
But I'm getting my memories back.

479
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:55,419
<i>Warning, sonic sterilization
to commence in ten minutes.</i>

480
00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:56,789
And that's not helping!

481
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,834
You can do this. You can do this.
What do you need?

482
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,485
Just give me the keypad. I'll try.

483
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:06,695
Wait, get this thing off of me.

484
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:12,001
- Wait, you know what to do?
- Check your lab for Allison and dad.

485
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:15,410
- While I shut off the sonic cleaning.
- Wait, hold on. I don't have clearance.

486
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:18,230
You had to override security
just to get me through the front door.

487
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,655
Okay, come here.

488
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,275
Press your thumb down right there.

489
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:29,640
You now have complete access
to section five.

490
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:32,491
- Really? Awesome.
- Just don't touch anything.

491
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,243
I'll be in Allison's office.

492
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,930
I've tried to override the system,
but this isn't working.

493
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,055
I'm sorry.

494
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,625
It's okay.

495
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,105
We will...

496
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,125
find another way.

497
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,065
This isn't how
I pictured things going.

498
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:51,955
I know.

499
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,535
It's...

500
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:55,435
bad timing.

501
00:32:57,655 --> 00:32:59,393
I'm really happy that you're here.

502
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,238
I'll always be here for you.

503
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:15,545
No matter what.

504
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:20,789
You know, this isn't how I pictured
it going for us either.

505
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,337
Bad timing.

506
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,745
- Dad.
- Zoe, how'd you get in here?

507
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:34,376
Tess violated
about a dozen security protocols.

508
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:35,638
Awesome. Where is she?

509
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,057
- She's shutting down the cleaning.
- Thank God.

510
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:44,521
<i>Sonic sterilization
to commence in five minutes.</i>

511
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,732
- You said she was shutting that down.
- She was.

512
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:51,381
- Where were you when you two split?
- In the rotunda, five minutes ago.

513
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:53,394
It takes five seconds
to get to my office.

514
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,616
Something's wrong.
You better go find her.

515
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,674
And I'm in no shape to move.
You have to stop the sonic cleaning.

516
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:00,419
I'll stay with her, go.

517
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:03,144
Time the contractions.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

518
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:05,495
Come here.

519
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:08,835
Are you okay?

520
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,251
Thank God.

521
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:16,325
How's it going?

522
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,682
Hi, I'm Tess.
And you would be...?

523
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,335
Totally screwed.

524
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:30,565
My name is Jack.

525
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:32,415
And Fargo...

526
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:34,695
You know Fargo. And...

527
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:38,367
He messed with something of yours
called a storynest.

528
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:42,590
Now, what it's doing is making
the entire town lose their memories.

529
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:46,625
You have two minutes to shut off
a sonic sterilization.

530
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,419
Sonic ster...

531
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:53,257
Your name is Tess Fontana.

532
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:57,340
You run section five,
and right now you are the only one

533
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:59,680
who can save the lives
of everyone in this facility.

534
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,808
Okay, you're really starting
to freak me out.

535
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:07,020
Do you even remember
arriving in Eureka?

536
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:13,680
Do you remember being caught
in another dimension?

537
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:14,805
Another...

538
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,197
- Globidium.
- What?

539
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,603
Do you remember the meteor shower?

540
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,827
Go on.

541
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,873
It was you and me.

542
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,885
We were on the hood of my jeep.

543
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,589
I held your hand.

544
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,217
- It was dark.
- Okay, wait.

545
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,935
Wait, this is starting
to come back to me now.

546
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,431
Keep going. Give me more.

547
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,600
Give me...

548
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:53,295
Anything?

549
00:36:05,305 --> 00:36:09,155
- <i>Sonic sterilization...</i>
- We have to shut off the sterilization.

550
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:10,834
<i>29...</i>

551
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,085
<i>28...</i>

552
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:13,595
<i>27...</i>

553
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,155
<i>26...</i>

554
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,548
<i>25...</i>

555
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:19,015
Hold on, it'll come to me.

556
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,178
It could be a code

557
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,555
or a sequence or a protocol.

558
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,168
- You tend to love protocols.
- I love protocols.

559
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,435
<i>18...</i>

560
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,936
<i>17...</i>

561
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:32,022
- What? What is it?
- Kinison's PDA.

562
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,625
<i>13...</i>

563
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,780
I think if I swipe it, maybe...

564
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:37,905
<i>10...</i>

565
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:39,055
<i>9...</i>

566
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,535
<i>Sonic procedures canceled.</i>

567
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:44,409
<i>Sterilization protocols deactivated.</i>

568
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:47,531
- That's it?
- I'm sorry. I just forgot.

569
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:51,030
This isn't over.

570
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,340
Unless we permanently reverse
what Fargo has done,

571
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:55,128
everyone is gonna lose their memory.

572
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:58,257
- Fargo, he's at the cafe.
- Get him here as quick as you can.

573
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,910
- Where are you going?
- I got to deliver a baby.

574
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:01,885
A baby?

575
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:08,058
- So how far apart are they?
- 90 seconds. You're in transition.

576
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,269
How in God's name do you know that?

577
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,980
Tesla's sex-ed classes
can be pretty thorough.

578
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:16,358
I'm gonna have to start pushing soon.
Don't forget to breathe.

579
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:18,610
Yeah, you too. Here we go.

580
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,946
- You sure you're up for this?
- I'm your partner.

581
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:26,618
I got him.

582
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:30,914
- You could warn a guy.
- How'd you get his memory back?

583
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,709
Remote Halo.
Jo's storycatcher had some doozies.

584
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:36,753
And now I remember all my failures.
Thanks for that.

585
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:39,620
Just fix it so I don't forget
the birth of my daughter.

586
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:41,466
Now's your chance
for redemption, Fargo.

587
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:44,177
But I'm not exactly sure what I did.

588
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,016
She started doing something with
the neural net, the neural connection.

589
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,419
Right. Maybe we can reverse
the neural flow.

590
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:55,981
That is making it very difficult
to concentrate.

591
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:57,962
I'm sorry for distracting you.

592
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:59,776
Okay, she's coming.

593
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,944
Ready?

594
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:01,987
Push.

595
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,198
Oh, my God. I see her.

596
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,243
What are you doing?

597
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,234
Trying to generate
a large-scale upload.

598
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:13,225
If it works, all the recorded memories
should be transmitted back to everyone

599
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,000
in one giant burst
through their storycatchers.

600
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,295
Fargo, that is brilliant.

601
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:20,672
Or it'll permanently erase them.

602
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:25,218
- I don't want us to forget this.
- We won't, we won't.

603
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,056
- All right, this is it.
- You can do it, Allie.

604
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,774
You can do it, Fargo.

605
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,061
But what if I push this button
and permanently erase

606
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,450
the greatest scientific minds
of the 21st century?

607
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,065
Push the button, Fargo!

608
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,734
- It's a lot of pressure!
- Push the button!

609
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,487
But Eureka might forget itself.

610
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:46,115
Push the damn button, Fargo!

611
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,183
One more time.
She's almost here, okay?

612
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,101
Big push.

613
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,005
What are you...

614
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,615
All right, easy, easy.

615
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,208
Crap.

616
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,635
Get everybody out of there now!

617
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,974
- These are the moments we'll remember.
- Not if we're lucky.

618
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:11,560
- When did you get here?
- I'm not sure.

619
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:15,995
But you know what?
That soup smells good.

620
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:19,365
I'll get you some.

621
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,875
Has anyone seen my PDA?

622
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:28,605
- I think you did it, Fargo.
- I did, didn't I?

623
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,665
Take that, posterity.

624
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:36,255
Oh, God.

625
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,812
Say hello...

626
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:43,284
to your daughter.

627
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,775
Hey, there.

628
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,110
That was amazing.

629
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,071
You were amazing, both of you.

630
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,364
I don't even remember.

631
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,275
Hey, that's not funny.

632
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,485
She is beautiful.

633
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:58,747
What's her name?

634
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:00,585
This is Jenna,

635
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:02,385
Jenna Stark,

636
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:04,544
after Nathan's mom.

637
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,446
Well, hi, Jenna.

638
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:11,664
I guess I'm officially
on maternity leave.

639
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:14,012
You've earned it.

640
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,875
So what do you think, Tess?
You think you can handle this place?

641
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,900
Me?

642
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,325
Well, you're already doing
a great job in section five,

643
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:24,856
and clearly you can handle a crisis.

644
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:29,225
Yeah, I'll try to keep those
to a minimum while you're gone.

645
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,571
Well, I'd appreciate it.

646
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,161
You okay?

647
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:43,500
- That's a memory I wish I could forget.
- We will pretend that you did.

648
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,605
She's so wrinkly.

649
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:47,129
I mean, but cute.

650
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,755
I know, I know.

651
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:52,505
You okay?

652
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:54,865
I'm better than okay.

653
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,475
I think I might've found my path.

654
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:02,945
So much for the time capsule.

655
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,629
Yeah, well...

656
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:08,191
When you fix it, I think I know
what memory I'd like to use.

657
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:10,195
What's that?

658
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,235
I think this one.
