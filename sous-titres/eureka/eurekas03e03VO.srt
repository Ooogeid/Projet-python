1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:03,058
But sweetie,
it's an advanced class.

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,322
It's great, you studied hard,
and it paid off.

3
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:09,066
Thanks, Dad, but I mean, normal physics
in this school is hard enough.

4
00:00:09,186 --> 00:00:11,857
Maybe I don't want to be accelerated.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,268
I don't wanna put myself under pressure.

6
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,107
Well, pressure can be good for you.

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,939
My mother used to say
that pressure can make diamonds.

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,422
I mean,
don't you want to be a diamond?

9
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:26,196
Well, can't I just be a sapphire
who has time to hang out with friends?

10
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,573
If you don't have time
to take opportunities like this,

11
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,327
- then we should revisit the job thing.
- Dad, don't even...

12
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,010
Okay, you know what,
that's fine.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,387
I'll make it work.

14
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:37,707
Yay, physics!

15
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,472
That's the spirit.

16
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,630
Sparky, mind your manners.

17
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,266
Sorry, he's not a morning dog.

18
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,123
Hey, Jo,
what's with all the dogs in here?

19
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:05,784
They're biomimetic.

20
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,321
I don't care what breed they are,
it's unsanitary.

21
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,606
It means artificial, Carter.
They're robots.

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,743
That biomimetic.

23
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:17,163
So what, the DOD has some program
to create armed robot dog soldiers?

24
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,791
No, but that would be so cool.

25
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:23,962
No, this isn't a GD thing.
People build them for fun.

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,715
They get really competitive
about it too.

27
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:29,344
I just don't want anything too big.

28
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,262
Last time was you and me at city hall.
It wasn't exactly very memorable.

29
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,305
Yeah, but the wedding night...

30
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:36,774
- Don't mind us.
- That was my plan.

31
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:41,445
How 'bout this: I take care of all,
and you just show up?

32
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:44,524
Yeah, with my hair done, my makeup.
My God, I need a dress.

33
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,289
I'll go shopping with you.

34
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,155
It's a wedding gown,
not a flak jacket.

35
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:53,384
I happen to like weddings.
You got a problem with that?

36
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:55,415
Okay, I'm not even insulted

37
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:58,121
that you didn't ask me
to cater your reception.

38
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,943
- Vincent, would you like to...
- Twist my arm!

39
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:03,652
Uncle!

40
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:08,548
Got a possible break-in on Feynman road.
If you want, I can... I can take it.

41
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,050
No... Hey, I'd love to sit
and talk weddings all day,

42
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,701
but... duty calls.

43
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,495
Guys, let's talk menu and theme.

44
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,974
I'm picturing Elizabethan ball.

45
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:30,907
Doggie!

46
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,564
Don't worry, Carter.

47
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,381
Robotic dogs don't...

48
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,786
ruin your pants.

49
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,471
Well, it's a scientific advance.

50
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,879
That's our reigning champion, Fifi.

51
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,012
Hello!

52
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,947
Two years in a row, best in show.

53
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,382
We're going for the triple crown.
Aren't we, baby?

54
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,555
Well, looks like the bitch is back.

55
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:02,519
Careful, Thunder, I wouldn't want you
to catch a programming worm.

56
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,939
Is that mange on Thunder?

57
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:11,027
- Control your tinker toy!
- You stay away from her.

58
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:19,828
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,214
Oh, my... Fifi!

60
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:33,466
Did Fifi make a mess on the grass?

61
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,761
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

62
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,808
This woman killed my dog!

63
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,670
Dr. Deacon,
good to see you back where you belong.

64
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,560
And it is good to be home.

65
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,614
I've been trying to find a way

66
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,913
- to say thank you.
- Good, because I have a task for you.

67
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,671
Good.

68
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,065
This is Dr. Mendel's.

69
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,993
He thinks he knows who did it.

70
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:13,692
Those people are ruining this town.

71
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:17,350
And who would
"those people" be, Dr. Mendel?

72
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,053
Those dog lunatics.

73
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,600
They're the ones
that broke into my lab.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,057
They'll do anything to win.

75
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,560
Was there something here they can use?
What do you make?

76
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,270
Synthetic mucus.

77
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,647
Why?

78
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,145
How 'bout to cure every airborne
pathogen known to man?

79
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:33,991
My brew stops 'em dead.

80
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,572
But those fanatics just want to build
a more realistic dog nose.

81
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:40,283
All right, what makes you think
somebody's been in here?

82
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,674
Beakers don't jump off tables
by themselves, Sheriff.

83
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,853
This could've been a disaster.

84
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,429
I grow my mucus in super-colonies.

85
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:54,341
If those criminals had spilled
even a small amount

86
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,007
of the wrong compounds...

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,401
It would've been bad.

88
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,935
Okay...

89
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,094
I'll take a look at your evidence.
Jo, you wanna walk Dr. Mendel inside,

90
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,899
see if anything's missing?

91
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:16,186
Yeah.

92
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,105
Don't touch anything.

93
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,928
Oh, that's bad.

94
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,938
Season 3 Episode 03
Best in Faux (v 1.00)

00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:56,133
Teams Projet-SG & 6th-Race.

97
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,343
- What happened?
- Mucus happened.

98
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:12,208
- Is this stuff toxic?
- If there was any justice in the world,

99
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,502
it would be.
You're wearing my whole batch

100
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:17,588
of "misty green!"
What did I say about touching things?

101
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,591
I didn't touch anything!
They fell in the quake.

102
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,452
You must've felt it.
It shook the whole lab.

103
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,630
No... we didn't... feel anything.

104
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,935
None of our instruments recorded
any seismic activity.

105
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,866
That's why GD was built here.

106
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,948
There are no strike-slip faults,
no volcanic activity.

107
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,192
This here is stable.

108
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,632
- You, I'm not so sure.
- What?

109
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,763
I mean, they do let me carry a gun.
And I know what an earthquake is.

110
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:46,679
- What else knocked over those jars?
- Well, it was probably you.

111
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,638
I mean, the lab is full of fumes.

112
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,676
Maybe you just got dizzy.

113
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:54,333
And could you please get cleaned up?
You're dripping mucus on my floor.

114
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:57,795
Runny nose?

115
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,464
No, I'm fine. I'm not light-headed.

116
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,091
That's good to hear.
How's the Fifi situation?

117
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:04,594
The late biomimetic dog?

118
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeah, that was sad.

119
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:11,517
I mean, kind of fun...
No... But sad.

120
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,334
So what's the status
on the investigation?

121
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,230
There isn't one.

122
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,543
I mean, it's not my job
to investigate malfunctioning toys.

123
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:21,238
Carter, they are hardly toys.

124
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,530
The Eureka dog show has led
to some incredible breakthroughs.

125
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:28,087
Artificial skin for burn survivors.
Compact neural computers.

126
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,870
Nasal spray that allows soldiers
to sniff out explosives

127
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:32,830
based on canine nose chemistry.

128
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,240
The dogs themselves
are a great marketing potential.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,884
Just imagine a dog
that never eats,

130
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,796
never urinates,
and never dies.

131
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,237
Fifi died.

132
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,319
The owner thinks that it was sabotage,
and I need you to find out.

133
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,627
I've got corporate R&D people
coming to the show,

134
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,306
and they don't want to invest
in dogs that fall apart.

135
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,557
Excuse me.

136
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,352
Could anything be
a bigger waste of my time?

137
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,859
- I need you, Carter.
- The answer's yes.

138
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,318
Did you get the data
on the seismic motion scan?

139
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,611
Unclear.

140
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,820
Those are the details
I need to go over with him.

141
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:09,117
What do you want to know?
Everything started to shake.

142
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,035
Shut up, Carter.
There was no earthquake.

143
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,237
Jo was 50 feet from you.
She would've felt it. I need a favor.

144
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,449
And that's how you ask?

145
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:18,501
Who raised you?

146
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,056
Yep, the brains
of Global Dynamics.

147
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,616
The computer core.

148
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:33,260
Logic diamond processors
connected with tantalum beams.

149
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,247
If you networked every computer
made in the last 30 years,

150
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,397
it wouldn't come close
to the power in this room.

151
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,681
Dr. Stark,
it's so great to see you.

152
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,563
Usually no one comes down here
unless there's a problem.

153
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:47,530
Here, let me show you
my radial upgrades.

154
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:49,745
Actually, I'm just here
for the clearances.

155
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,058
Oh, yeah, that.

156
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,471
Fargo was supposed
to bring the paperwork.

157
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:56,157
I assume he...
Yeah, I'll go find him.

158
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:01,472
I didn't know
that they use diamonds in computers.

159
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:05,131
The aligned carbon-14 allows
hyper-dense qubit storage

160
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,550
in an optical quantum processor.

161
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,332
Diamonds can store tons of data

162
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,178
and transmit it super fast.

163
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,360
- 'Cause I had no idea.
- No one does

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,064
because they keep them all
locked down here.

165
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,862
Fargo, all ready for the dog show?

166
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:22,013
Don't even start with me, Tracy.

167
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,483
So who are you helping this year?
Jackson's Poodle?

168
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:28,124
- It could use a bigger brain.
- No, I'm actually sitting this one out.

169
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:29,585
A little too competive.

170
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,991
I see. Interesting.

171
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,340
What am I doing here, anyway?

172
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,898
Well, Dr. Fox is kindly giving me
one of her logic diamonds.

173
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,669
They're strictly regulated,

174
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,845
but being science director
does have its privileges.

175
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,955
I just need a law enforcement signature
to take it out of the building.

176
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,510
All right. Big experiment, I'm assuming.

177
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,771
Something hopefully disfiguring.

178
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:53,468
Actually,
it's just a wedding gift for Ally.

179
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,318
A singular diamond
for a singular woman.

180
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,859
It's very beautiful, Dr. Stark.

181
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:01,750
Thumbprint right here.

182
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,031
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

183
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,253
Thanks, Carter!

184
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,236
Sure.

185
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,815
Hey, I heard about Fifi.

186
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,220
Tragic.

187
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,365
Guess the field's
wide open this year.

188
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,998
Actually, I'm investigating
the earthquake.

189
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,412
Yeah, there...
There are no earthquakes in Eureka.

190
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,795
So I'm told.

191
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,953
Well, if you want a second opinion,
you can always ask Dr. Hood.

192
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:26,011
He's retired, but he used to be
the top dog in seismology,

193
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,829
vulcanology, geology.

194
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,401
Pretty much anything dirty{\,
and he was in it}.

195
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,806
All right, thanks.
Nice to meet you.

196
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:34,095
Dougie Fargo?

197
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,772
That wild man?

198
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,265
Did he tell you about the time
we were running those columbian drugs?

199
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,224
- No.
- Yeah.

200
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,362
Columbia med school wanted
to make mineral-based vaccines.

201
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,450
So Doug and I trekked all over Alaska

202
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,962
gatherin' eriochalcite
for those yahoos.

203
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,004
Crazy times.

204
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,525
So what can I do you for?

205
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,058
Well, I was at a farm near the lake.

206
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:02,012
And there was an earthquake,
but nobody felt it but me.

207
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:03,529
Is that possible?

208
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,872
Depends.
How drunk were you?

209
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,050
I'm sorry, man.

210
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,379
It's really not very likely.

211
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:12,591
Because there aren't in Eureka.

212
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,968
This place is rock solid.

213
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,387
I have trouble finding someone
who believes me.

214
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:17,993
I can relate.

215
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,504
I spent the last year of my career
being the guy no one believes.

216
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,110
Anyway, where are we talkin'?

217
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,019
- Around here.
- All right.

218
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,062
Nope. Sorry.

219
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,870
Nothing going on down there.
Dead as Toledo on a saturday night.

220
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:48,677
The next time I feel the ground shake
and see the northern lights inside,

221
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,536
I'll just leave the bar.

222
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,174
Never mind.

223
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:57,011
I gotta get back to the case
of the dead fake dog anyway.

224
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,496
Never mind.

225
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:07,968
Northern lights, huh?

226
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,049
Fifi's owner
still won't release the remains.

227
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,952
She's afraid we're going
to steal her doggie-building secrets.

228
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,033
Well, that case
gets better and better.

229
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:22,105
She still thinks Dr. Young
sabotaged her entry.

230
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:25,058
So you think you wanna talk
to Dr. Young?

231
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,160
No.

232
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,859
You wanna ask around?
See if anybody's dogs malfunctioned?

233
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:32,626
No, because this is stupid.
There isn't a crime.

234
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,509
- People waste thousands of dollars...
- Millions.

235
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,402
Millions of dollars making something

236
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,054
they're giving away for free
in every pound in America.

237
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,725
People need hobbies, Carter.

238
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,850
I used to collect handcuffs.

239
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,405
And meanwhile, there was an earthquake
which no one felt but me,

240
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,892
which is impossible.

241
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,650
Because there are no earthquakes
in Eureka.

242
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:27,619
Sheriff, you were right.

243
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:31,897
There's somethin' brewin' down there
and she's fixin' to blow.

244
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,172
It's just a hole. Just a hole.
Stay to the left.

245
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:44,481
Yeah, no, I already spoke to him.
He understands.

246
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,662
- He is really sorry.
- Sorry?

247
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,914
He could've killed somebody.
Dr. Hood!

248
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,959
Haven't we talked
about your using the tunneler?

249
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:55,591
Talk to him. He's the one that told me
about the triboluminescence.

250
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:58,325
Colored lights.
Rocks under seismic stress

251
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,551
can sometimes release
visible electromagnetic energy.

252
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:02,464
So I dove down. You ready?

253
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,608
All my readings indicate
there's a pressurized

254
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,579
komatiite melt under this town.

255
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,524
- Somewhere.
- Wait.

256
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,054
There's something melting
under the town? What, like a volcano?

257
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:14,523
Not like a volcano.
And it could erupt at any time.

258
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,692
And it's not linked
to any known fault system.

259
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,963
That's why your quake
was so localized.

260
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,615
A spontaneous pocket of magma?
That's impossible.

261
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,117
Did impossible cover my friend
with mucus?

262
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,177
He's got a point.

263
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:29,366
Okay. I'll have the geo lab
look into it.

264
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,729
You stay above ground.

265
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:36,253
So what, should we
start talking evacuation?

266
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,510
Maybe hospitalization.

267
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,884
Carter, there is no magma chamber.
Dr. Hood is unstable.

268
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:44,449
Not so much.
Seems like a smart guy.

269
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,128
Look, five years ago, Hood predicted
a 9.6 on the reelfoot fault.

270
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:49,433
We evacuated Memphis.

271
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,574
- Was there an earthquake in Memphis?
- No.

272
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:54,730
Hood cracked under the pressure.
He left right after that

273
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,274
because he kept seeing things
that just weren't there.

274
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,896
Carter, please, I need you to keep
your eye on him.

275
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,405
Don't let him do any more damage.

276
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,504
Acoustic physics
is a challenging class, Zoe.

277
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:16,794
So don't beat yourself up about it.
It's very complicated stuff.

278
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,737
Let's go back to the beginning.

279
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,870
There's two main sections...

280
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,761
- What are you guys doing?
- Rayl wave dynamics.

281
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,415
Careful, Jack.
It's an acoustic pressure wave.

282
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,067
She's trying to figure out the frequency
to melt copper ore.

283
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,154
So you can really
melt metal with sound.

284
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,967
I don't even understand it

285
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,033
well enough to explain
why I don't understand it.

286
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,170
- Do you want coffee?
- No, thanks.

287
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:51,704
I got somethin'

288
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:53,982
I really don't want to do.

289
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,110
- I can relate.
- Yeah. As can I.

290
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,358
- What are you avoiding?
- Just some troubling errand

291
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,111
I can no longer ignore.

292
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,834
- See ya later.
- Yeah.

293
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:07,116
Could you clear table number 5, please?

294
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,340
Why not?
I'm gonna fail this class anyway.

295
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,390
But that's how diamonds
are made, right?

296
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,851
Well, not unless you crack
under the pressure.

297
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,110
- You are going to have to clean that!
- What are you doin', Dr. Hood?!

298
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,719
I'm droppin' a shear wave probe!

299
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,361
- You want a turn? It's a blast!
- No! I'm good!

300
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,284
Can you shut it off, please?!

301
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,123
You can't drill in here.

302
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:39,846
I need to measure P-waves
if I'm gonna find this magma pocket.

303
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:44,089
This is the best spot
to crack through the igneous uplift.

304
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,552
You sure there's really
anything to find?

305
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,843
Oh, sure I'm sure.

306
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,137
I can hear the roaring,
I just haven't seen the tiger.

307
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,455
Oh, you've talked to Allison.

308
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:58,489
There's something happening here.
This isn't like Memphis.

309
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,607
Maybe. But I still want you
to pack it up and go home.

310
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:03,901
Okay? Just let Global handle this.

311
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,531
And I need your...

312
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,921
tunneling car thingy off the road.

313
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,239
Do you mind if I tow her home?
All above ground, I promise.

314
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,681
I just want to wash her up
before she gets rusty.

315
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:17,801
Sure. Sure.

316
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,359
Okay. Thanks.

317
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,863
That's too bad.

318
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,352
It was fun getting dirty again.

319
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:30,552
This... this map has gotta be, what,

320
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:31,875
70 years old?

321
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,008
What is it you...
you're gonna build here?

322
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,072
A hotel.

323
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:40,966
Our corporate visitors are used
to a certain level of service.

324
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,357
This spot is perfect.

325
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,168
But I found records

326
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:48,904
that showed some traces
of radiation.

327
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,183
Well, you know,
radiation is like penny candy.

328
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:55,879
It comes in...

329
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,163
all different kinds of flavors.

330
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,991
You think you can scan
something for me, correct?

331
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,168
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
You know.

332
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,318
But a wide-spectrum survey,

333
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:09,508
it's a very complicated process.

334
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,485
- You're my man.
- Absolutely.

335
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,680
She's a liar!

336
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,237
She actually accused me of sabotage?

337
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,924
Your name came up.

338
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,111
I wouldn't touch her crappy stuffed
animal with a ten-foot pole.

339
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,024
But you're happy
Fifi's out of contention?

340
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,011
Are you joking?

341
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:31,071
This was my year to finally
crush her in front of everyone.

342
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,026
My dog is perfect.

343
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,789
Yeah, he's a champ.

344
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:43,284
You should see him run.
It's like Seabiscuit.

345
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:44,973
Here. Toss him one.

346
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,291
All right.

347
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,673
Hey, buddy.
You wanna run? You wanna run?

348
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,916
I'm telling you right now,
he's a winner.

349
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,655
What can you say?
He's such a great competitor.

350
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,698
Yeah. And the second one to blow.

351
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,836
I sent Fifi to GD.

352
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,498
Take what's left of Thunder
and see what you can find.

353
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,659
Wa... Wait.
I get to look inside?

354
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:20,454
Yeah. I want a complete dogtopsy.

355
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,171
- Thank you.
- Oh, no.

356
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,552
Just... And down, Fargo.

357
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:27,770
Hello.

358
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,487
Is everything okay in there?

359
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:36,328
I can't believe you convinced me
to try this on.

360
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:39,369
No one wears a big white dress
their second time around.

361
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:40,990
But tell me you don't love it.

362
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,987
It's fabulous for an amazon.

363
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,223
Honey, you can't tell anything
without a fitting.

364
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:48,676
I don't have time for a fitting.
My job is not planning a wedding.

365
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,743
It'll just take a second.

366
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,570
And presto.

367
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:02,621
Aren't you the beautiful bride?

368
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,750
Can I try it on next?

369
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,156
- Was that an earthquake?
- No.

370
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:21,013
A tunnel-drilling lunatic.
Just get me out of this.

371
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,882
It's... It's not working.

372
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,690
Triboluminescence must've
shorted the circuit.

373
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,191
Forget it.

374
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:42,786
You called?

375
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,826
You have something to tell me?

376
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,249
I do.

377
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:50,845
Hood has been tunneling again.
I told you to keep an eye on him.

378
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:52,880
I am. He promised me
he wouldn't do it any more.

379
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,288
Promised? Promised?

380
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:57,932
Okay, let me be perfectly clear here.
I need him to stop.

381
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,370
All right.

382
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,969
Dr. Hood!
We gotta pack it up.

383
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,641
A little fancy for the afternoon,
but you pull it off.

384
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,312
- Do you know why I'm in this dress?
- Laundry day?

385
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:11,022
Because you knocked out
half the circuits on main street.

386
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,502
There was a temblor?

387
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,444
I knew one was comin'.
When exactly?

388
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:16,911
Ten minutes ago.

389
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:19,280
And you knew because
you've been tunneling again?

390
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,698
No. I was here ten minutes ago.
That quake was the real deal.

391
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:26,345
- Pressure's building.
- There is no magma pocket under Eureka.

392
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,658
Please take the nice Doctor home.

393
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:31,914
Hey, Vera Wang, you want proof?
I'm out here trackin' a vent.

394
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:34,880
It's ready to pop.
Come on. Give me 30 seconds.

395
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,598
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

396
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:53,526
A little princessy,
but I like the neckline.

397
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,454
Yeah.

398
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,402
- Okay, your time's up.
- Come on, a little grace period?

399
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,285
I'm trying to nail a fumarole eruption
down to the second here.

400
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:02,074
- Oh, no.
- What's a fumarole?

401
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:06,278
A mud volcano.

402
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:13,852
You see that?
I'm back in the game, baby.

403
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:22,810
All right, you...

404
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,389
You go that way and then meet me...

405
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:28,646
I like the neckline,
but not so crazy about the color.

406
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,022
We're sinking zero-balance
P- wave detectors all along the ridge.

407
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,966
I re-tasked the geo satellites
to look for ground deformations.

408
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:38,846
Sounds good.
What's all that gonna tell us?

409
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:41,330
Nothing.
We just like sounding smart.

410
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:43,715
The fumarole proves
there's pressurized magma down there.

411
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:47,128
We have to find out exactly where it is
and how big of a problem we have.

412
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:48,913
Maybe Hood's our problem.

413
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:52,374
Sure made quite a prediction,
and seems to like being top dog again.

414
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,627
Really?

415
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:58,528
- You think he could cause this?
- The instruments are gonna tell us.

416
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,049
Hopefully
before they reach critical mass.

417
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,171
Carter.
Yeah, look, Fargo, I...

418
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:08,420
Fine.

419
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:11,401
Gotta go.

420
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:13,925
Thorne's... Doggy dissection.

421
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,898
Let me know if your probing
produces anything.

422
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:22,339
Fargo, I have
a lava problem right now.

423
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,990
I don't have time to worry
about fake dogs.

424
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,420
Well, do you have time to worry
about national security?

425
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,512
Logic diamonds.
That's how these dogs always won.

426
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:32,792
They were juicing.

427
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,730
But the neural nets
couldn't handle the load.

428
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,086
But all these diamonds
were supposed to be locked in a vault.

429
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:42,411
Exactly, so not only are they cheaters,
they broke federal law.

430
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,217
Have fun in gitmo, ladies.

431
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:46,650
- Relax. I'll talk to 'em.
- I already tried that.

432
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,430
They said they have no idea
how the diamonds got into the dogs.

433
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,782
Likely story.

434
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:53,435
Okay, first,
leave the interrogations to me.

435
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:54,935
And second,

436
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:58,315
if they both have diamonds,
we need to go to the source.

437
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:05,464
- It looks like a logic diamond.
- Yes! <i>J'accuse</i> Fifi.

438
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,695
I thought all the diamonds
were under your supervision.

439
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,643
These aren't from our lab.
The manufacturing facility in Pensacola

440
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,553
puts a code
on every diamond they make.

441
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,169
The inventory's continually checked.

442
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,293
So someone else can make these?

443
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,276
There's several countries
with covert programs.

444
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:22,916
China, North Korea.

445
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:25,696
I'll check with intelligence,
see if they know of any missing stones.

446
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:27,906
All right, let me know
as soon as you get an answer.

447
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,790
- Stupid.
- Can't find the zipper?

448
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,277
I got an MD.

449
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,177
And two Phds, and I can't get
myself out of this stupid dress.

450
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,334
Thorne wants to see me
five minutes ago.

451
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:51,606
- Can you...
- Yeah.

452
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:53,458
- Can you help?
- Thank you.

453
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:56,957
Used to be pretty good at this.

454
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,181
The micro lock is damaged.

455
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,921
Yeah, it's like...
Super-velcro.

456
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:02,968
I know.

457
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:07,515
So... I should have believed you
when you told me about the earthquake.

458
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:09,953
No, you didn't feel it.
I know it sounds crazy. Lean back.

459
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:13,775
Coming from you, I should have listened.
I don't know. It's just the pressure.

460
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,601
I feel like I've got a million things
pushing in on me.

461
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,941
- Yeah, a little more.
- It's like I can't breathe. Like...

462
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:21,210
Like you're trapped in a wedding dress?
A little more.

463
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,518
Okay, it's just...

464
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:25,152
- Yeah. There. Got it.
- You got it?

465
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:27,669
Oh, thank...

466
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,287
Thank you.

467
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:43,381
So is this why you called?

468
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:46,144
No, I...

469
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:50,106
We haven't been able to pinpoint
the magma pocket yet.

470
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:54,078
But the resonance indicates
that it could be manmade.

471
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,228
You're thinking

472
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:02,314
by a disgraced geologist
looking to fix his reputation?

473
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,734
Well, pressure makes you do
crazy things.

474
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:14,159
There is this remarkable jumble
of radiation.

475
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,577
I mean, here, where you want
to put your hotel, there's everything

476
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:20,523
from x-rays all the way
up through gamma.

477
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:24,461
I mean, I'd love to know why it's there,
but it's very powerful,

478
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:27,172
and the source is right here.

479
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,273
Interesting.

480
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:32,594
And I'll give you all the specific
frequencies once I've run the samples.

481
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:33,962
That's not necessary.

482
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:36,148
You've given me
all the information I need.

483
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:39,517
It seems that my hotel project's
gonna have to go back to square one.

484
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:42,387
Wait.

485
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,829
- That's it?
- Oh, that's it.

486
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,812
All this clean-up
is gonna cost billions,

487
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:52,772
and my intention is to make money,
not waste it.

488
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:54,866
So I'm just gonna have to find
an alternate site.

489
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,646
And Henry, property development
can get very contentious.

490
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,165
So can we keep this between us?

491
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:03,582
For now?

492
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah, don't worry.

493
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:09,853
I'm good at keeping secrets.

494
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,800
- How's it going?
- We could get some nasty lava bombs.

495
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:22,894
It'd be easier to predict
if I could find the pocket.

496
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:26,189
Yeah, unless you already know
where it is.

497
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,221
Allison thinks it's manmade.

498
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:36,728
By some old volcano man who wants
one last ride on the Ferris wheel?

499
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:42,058
- I'm just doing my job.
- Some things you don't mess with.

500
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,527
Well, somebody did.

501
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:48,147
Take a pretty fancy machine
to liquefy bedrock.

502
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,584
Ah, this town loves
its fancy machines.

503
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,021
Yeah, no joke.

504
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,898
They build dogs, they could probably
figure out how to light a volcano.

505
00:27:56,018 --> 00:27:57,512
Well, they both explode.

506
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,927
Some of the owners have been cheating
with logic diamonds.

507
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,059
I got dogs exploding all over town.

508
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:11,868
- That's a dog show I could get into.
- Yeah.

509
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,697
Have you tried finding out
where the diamonds were mined?

510
00:28:16,383 --> 00:28:18,033
Yeah, yeah, no luck so far.

511
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:21,790
Well, I could shoot yours through
the old gas-liquid chromatograph.

512
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:25,140
Only take a second.
Might tell you where they're from.

513
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:26,891
- All right.
- All right.

514
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,955
Every mine in the world
produces diamonds

515
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,746
with a unique molecular structure.

516
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:36,278
- Like a fingerprint?
- Yeah, or a really expensive snowflake.

517
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,817
So it looks like our little friend here
is all the way from...

518
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:48,764
Something's messed up here.
The carbon signature is from Eureka.

519
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,280
Is there a diamond mine here?

520
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,139
No.

521
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,488
But they used to mine coal.

522
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,427
We've been down here an hour.
If we're looking for diamonds,

523
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:06,838
shouldn't we be in a spooky,
old diamond mine?

524
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:09,474
You mean instead of a spooky,
old coal mine?

525
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:14,237
Yeah, but the system told us it came
from this anthracite vein.

526
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:15,865
It's weird, I know.

527
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,737
Sheriff, look at this.

528
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,234
- That's not coal.
- Raw diamonds.

529
00:29:37,162 --> 00:29:38,822
But they're not natural.

530
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:41,110
Someone's transforming
the anthracite

531
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,742
into isometric-hexoctahedral
carbon-14.

532
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,091
Someone's cooking logic diamonds.

533
00:29:47,728 --> 00:29:48,824
Watch out.

534
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:16,715
- I'm okay. It's just my arm.
- What was that? A security system?

535
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:19,297
No, I'm an idiot.
It's an acoustic wave generator.

536
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,078
They're using intermittent bursts.
We just happened to get caught.

537
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:25,195
Somebody's growing these diamonds
with rayl pressure waves.

538
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:26,991
And they're doing it on a massive scale.

539
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:28,679
Hold on. Rayl waves?

540
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,910
Zoe was studying with one
of those things today at Cafe Diem.

541
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,680
And it could melt metal.

542
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,299
Could it melt rock?

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,255
I'm with you, Sheriff.

544
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:39,542
I'm not.

545
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,505
The diamond oven is shooting waves
into the ground.

546
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,440
And rayl pressure waves can melt
iron ore in the rock strata.

547
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,433
Melted rocks make magma,
and where the magma's under pressure...

548
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:50,176
There's a volcano.

549
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:52,507
Yeah.

550
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,072
But who's cooking diamonds?

551
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,685
I talked to Dr. Zedler
at the Pensacola facility.

552
00:30:58,805 --> 00:31:01,688
There are only six people in the world
who know how to make logic diamonds,

553
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:04,699
- and they're all on his team.
- So they're all 3,000 miles away?

554
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:07,832
- Yes. Confirmed by DOD security.
- Your people'll turn up something

555
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:10,181
- from one of the other programs?
- What other programs?

556
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,138
You know. I don't know.
North Korea, China.

557
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:14,323
Carter, no one else
has a logic diamond program,

558
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:16,299
not even in the theoretical stages.

559
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,756
- We are 30 years ahead of the world.
- I gotta see your personnel files.

560
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:22,472
You spent three years in Pensacola

561
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,414
while the neural core
was being designed.

562
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:27,684
Dr. Zedler said you asked questions
about how to grow logic diamonds,

563
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,754
said you became a real expert.

564
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,854
You spend your entire career

565
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:36,648
creating something amazing,

566
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,275
and when you finally succeed,
they just lock it all away.

567
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:41,373
Are there any more diamond farms?

568
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:43,565
I only grew them because
I didn't want to steal them.

569
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:46,457
Don't you see?
These diamonds could change the world.

570
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,700
But the DOD wanted them
to make better weapons.

571
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,371
GD is a science facility,
not a weapons factory.

572
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,664
It's a top-secret lab.

573
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:56,042
I could never test my diamonds.
That's why I put them in the dogs.

574
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:58,592
To test them?

575
00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:01,626
Those dogs have the most advanced
neural processors around.

576
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:04,160
Mimicking a biological organism
is the best way

577
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,653
to test the diamonds
under real-world conditions.

578
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:08,450
I was helping out
a few of the entrants.

579
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,640
I just built the diamonds
into the circuits.

580
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,724
I had no idea they would overload.

581
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,103
Or that you'd caused a volcano?

582
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:17,605
Pardon?

583
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,302
Even though we've shut down
the generator in the mine,

584
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,471
the seismic activity
is continuing to increase.

585
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,383
That magma's under incredible pressure.

586
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:26,648
If it blows, Eureka could be
scattered over four states.

587
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:28,420
There could be thousands of casualties.

588
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,561
- We should begin evacuation.
- No, it could explode at any time.

589
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:34,432
I don't want people out on the street.
It'll be much safer if they're inside.

590
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,559
Could you drill in
and relieve the pressure?

591
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,817
You know, just lance the puppy.

592
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:41,879
Well, we have no idea
where this puppy is.

593
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:45,465
Thermal energy travels along
the rock strata until it finds a pocket.

594
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,509
- Could be anywhere.
- Wait a minute.

595
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,047
What if we cut a tunnel? Get close to
the pocket, bore straight to the lake.

596
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,825
Then use remote explosives
to fracture the containment rock.

597
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,893
- That would divert the magma?
- And we still have to find it.

598
00:32:57,054 --> 00:33:00,055
Well, you guys have got to have a gizmo
in this building that can help.

599
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,498
Right? Start knocking on doors.

600
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,377
Just put a note in the elevator.

601
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:08,156
Yeah, Carter, there's no gizmo
for sniffing out magma 2,000 feet

602
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:11,355
below the earth's surface, but
maybe we can get the director on that.

603
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:13,925
Well, I'm not talking about sniffing...

604
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,224
I got an idea.

605
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:19,125
Just tell me
if it's incredibly stupid.

606
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:20,925
Yes.

607
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,080
Is it possible?

608
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:29,550
This technology can help
soldiers sniff out explosives.

609
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,115
We can fix Fifi to help us.

610
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,899
It's similar technology.

611
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:36,475
But real dogs can't sniff out magma.

612
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:39,786
If we reprogrammed her
and jacked up the sensitivity.

613
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,677
That would take weeks.

614
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,450
Well...

615
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,101
With this.

616
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,618
It's Dr. Mendel's artificial mucus.

617
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,182
It could supercharge Fifi's nose.

618
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:01,719
I think...

619
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,684
Fifi...

620
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:07,099
was born...

621
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,148
to be a hero.

622
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:12,314
Heroine.

623
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,349
Don't you?

624
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,121
Smell the lava. Good girl.

625
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,924
Smell the lava.
Oh, good girl!

626
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:26,294
Smell the lava.

627
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:31,739
I hate to interrupt puppy school,
but the seismic pressure is building.

628
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,354
Fifi's almost ready, although
I don't think she's that thrilled

629
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,331
about carrying
live explosives into a volcano.

630
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,520
I know, but you'll need 'em
to release the magma.

631
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,842
Can't we just poke a hole in it,
relieve the pressure?

632
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,949
Sure, if you wanna be
a charcoal briquette.

633
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,986
The magma's 3,000 degrees.

634
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:48,257
It's gonna break through and fire down
the tunnel to the lake at 80 ft per sec.

635
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,407
You want to be long gone
when that happens.

636
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,708
All right. All right.

637
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,561
Breaking through, bad.
Running away, good.

638
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:54,907
Fifi. Let's go!

639
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,483
In you go!

640
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,194
All right, Fifi. Ready for this?

641
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:13,906
Yeah, she's got a new nose.
It's topped off with mucus.

642
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:16,372
Ready to find

643
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,411
- some lava.
- It's not lava.

644
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:23,567
Which way, girl?

645
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,290
Here goes nothing.

646
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,610
Nathan, what's the status down there?

647
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:17,845
I think Carter's dog
has us chasing our tails.

648
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:21,473
Fifi. Don't make me stop
this tunneler, Fifi!

649
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:25,169
We have methane vents
popping all over town.

650
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,312
Nice, big ones!

651
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:36,641
Still nothing.

652
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,116
Wait... Wait,
we might have something.

653
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:45,977
All right, Fifi.

654
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:50,044
Come on. Come on!
Let's go find some lava.

655
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:51,896
Magma.

656
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,893
It's magma.

657
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,035
It's lava when it's above ground,

658
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:01,180
magma when it's below.

659
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,049
What, you think I'm confusing the dog?

660
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:06,810
- Well, you're exhausting me.
- We got heat.

661
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:13,067
All right, let's just set
these explosives right by the melt...

662
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:21,394
We're not gonna need 'em.
Come here, Fifi. C'mere!

663
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:24,161
Magma's breaking through... Run!

664
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,047
We should be long gone
when this happens?

665
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:37,186
Yes, I did! Drive, Carter, drive!

666
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,313
The pressure's dropping.
Did you find something?

667
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:52,706
Oh, you could say that!

668
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:55,118
Where's the lake?

669
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:57,862
I can't get a bearing.
The instruments are all over the place.

670
00:37:58,256 --> 00:37:59,655
- Smack it.
- Seriously?

671
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:00,883
Smack it.

672
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:05,244
All right!

673
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:06,524
I got a bearing.

674
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:08,122
Turn right 15 degrees.

675
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,509
- Should be straight ahead.
- Should be?

676
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,460
Next time, Fargo's driving.

677
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,124
They made it through.

678
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:10,476
So what do you want to do tomorrow?

679
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:18,504
- Vincent, iced coffee, please.
- On the way.

680
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:20,334
Steamy out there tonight.

681
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,197
Well, get used to it.
That magma's gonna be venting for days.

682
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,658
I think, technically, it's lava.

683
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:29,787
So you guys did good work today.
You should team up more often.

684
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

685
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,255
I'm thinking this town
should buy you boys a drink.

686
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:38,389
Well,

687
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:40,691
you know, it was kind of fun.

688
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:43,075
And besides almost dying,
I can see why you miss it.

689
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,678
Honestly, I don't.
I like the quiet life.

690
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:48,692
Living with that kind of pressure
isn't for me anymore.

691
00:39:48,812 --> 00:39:49,909
Hey, Carter.

692
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:52,133
Good driving today.

693
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,239
Thanks.

694
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:56,924
Thanks.

695
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,733
I'm the king of the world!

696
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:02,068
Hey, congratulations,
robot dog show champ.

697
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:03,591
Thank you, thank you.

698
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:07,091
I'd like to thank everyone who made
this possible. Mostly, myself.

699
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,987
Yeah, well, nothing like
a gracious winner.

700
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,245
I gotta tell you.
He's absolutely amazing.

701
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:12,597
Come here, buddy.

702
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:13,496
Yeah.

703
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:14,732
It's so...

704
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:15,791
real.

705
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:21,839
I thought fake dogs don't...

706
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,841
Yeah, I'll see you later.

707
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,428
That's nice.

708
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:34,516
Interested in a game?

709
00:40:34,636 --> 00:40:36,869
Nah, I should go home
and change my pants

710
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:39,077
because Fargo is a cheater.

711
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:41,706
Sparky?

712
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,280
Well, you know, pressure can be
a very destructive force.

713
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,786
Did... you ever finish
that troubling errand?

714
00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:53,685
I certainly did.

715
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,085
How was Thorne?

716
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:01,568
You're very perceptive, Jack.

717
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,011
I do know the type,
and they don't do good deeds.

718
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:09,482
She had me run a...
radiation survey outside of town.

719
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,535
Now, have you ever heard of

720
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:13,697
baryogenetic radiation?

721
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:15,586
No.

722
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:19,520
Well, that's because it doesn't exist.
It's a theory. At least I thought so...

723
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,546
Until today.

724
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:22,804
- You found some?
- Just...

725
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:23,776
a trace.

726
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,113
Great, great.
Is it dangerous?

727
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:29,698
I have data in my garage.
I'll run you through it tomorrow.

728
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:31,708
- Great. Thanks...
- All right.

729
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:36,274
Thanks for being on my side with this.

730
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:38,499
I do not keep secrets from my friends.

731
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:41,367
Anymore.

732
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:49,748
<i>Sheriff Carter, you planned
to do aerobic exercise tonight</i>

733
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:52,425
<i>from 8:00 to 9:30,
followed by bill paying.</i>

734
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,493
- Yeah, I'm taking the night off.
- <i>Good idea.</i>

735
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,053
<i>Stress is America's number one
health problem.</i>

736
00:41:57,173 --> 00:41:58,310
Oh, drop dead.

737
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,062
<i>Followed closely by sarcasm.</i>

738
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:00,922
Hey!

739
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,421
You want some chips?
I was sit down and watch the game.

740
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,527
No, I had a powerbar at the library.
I'll see ya.

741
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:09,676
Where you going?

742
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:14,106
To study.
There's a physics quiz tomorrow and,

743
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:17,371
I really, really, really
want to get an A.

744
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:18,281
Okay.

745
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,143
Just... do your best, all right?

746
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,065
Thanks.

747
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,173
You need some help?

748
00:42:29,638 --> 00:42:32,886
Sure. How much you know
about calculating electron mass?

749
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,028
Nothing.

750
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,375
But I do know
that everything's a little easier

751
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,267
if you're having some pizza.

752
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:42,422
So...

753
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:45,900
sit down.
Crack the books and I'll order.

754
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:49,640
Okay.

755
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:51,488
I'm proud of you.

756
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,413
Extra mushrooms, right?

757
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,248
You know me so well.

758
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,597
Awesome.
