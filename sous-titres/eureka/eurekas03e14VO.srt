1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:02,578
Previously on <I>Eureka...</I>

2
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,840
Stuff's been going missing
all over town.

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,941
This is who's building it?

4
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,243
The signal that we've been tracking
is getting stronger.

5
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:10,884
Meaning closer?

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,682
It's not a weapon. It's the end point
for a high-velocity space jump.

7
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:26,292
It's one of ours.

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,633
- I didn't see this coming.
- Henry did.

9
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,693
You knew half the town was brainwashed
into building this landing site.

10
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:57,138
No, I didn't. It never even occurred
to me that this ship still existed,

11
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,206
much less that it can find
its way back.

12
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,595
From where?

13
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,470
Who built this thing?

14
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,480
I did. 20 years ago.

15
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,936
- It's the <I>Columbus,</I> isn't it?
- The <I>Columbus?</I>

16
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:10,366
That's impossible.

17
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,284
The <I>Columbus</I> was
an unmanned prototype.

18
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,335
GD's early research
into interstellar exploration.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,972
It was lost 3 years after the launch.
The project was scrapped.

20
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:19,840
The facility repurposed.

21
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,670
We went a completely
different direction.

22
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,610
Apparently so did this ship.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,900
It's amazing.

24
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:27,516
And a little disturbing.

25
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,838
Speaking for those of us
that turned into zombies.

26
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:33,300
Good point. Do I have to worry about it,
telling people to do something else?

27
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:34,588
I don't think so.

28
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:38,327
It was programmed
to send out a pre-arrival signal

29
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,217
to alert ground control.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,518
That's what we started
to pick up a week ago.

31
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,565
Exactly. But it appears that
in the absence of landing facilities,

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,693
the ship improvised

33
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,470
and somehow got us
to build the next best thing.

34
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:55,613
Why didn't we identify the transmission?
Why use a foreign handshake frequency?

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,619
Well, the antenna array is damaged.
Who knows what this ship's gone through

36
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,870
and what other onboard systems
have been affected along the way.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,683
I mean, it's possible that it sent
out the only signal that it could.

38
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:08,596
So I do have to worry
about the zombie problem.

39
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,031
No, no, I don't think so.

40
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:14,018
I mean, now that it's returned,
its mission is over.

41
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:17,221
And its onboard computers
have powered down, yes?

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,775
So it's good, right?

43
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:23,501
Sure. Still, what that thing did,

44
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,770
it definitely left
a bad taste in my brain.

45
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,152
- Let's check these figures.
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.

46
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:42,763
Little disappointed it's an American
flag instead of a Martian one?

47
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:47,500
It's not exactly the first contact
I was hoping for.

48
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,278
But, you know, considering
where this ship has been

49
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,073
over the past 20 years,

50
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,688
this computer could hold answers
to questions we can't even imagine.

51
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:57,468
Secrets of the universe.

52
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,964
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

53
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:03,801
Yeah. It is.

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,601
Well, it's a long-term
project though.

55
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,498
I mean, it's gonna take years
to analyze all that data.

56
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,262
And it blows a hole
in my weekend plans.

57
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:14,203
- But...
- I hear ya.

58
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,856
No, no, I mean,
there's a meteor shower on Friday.

59
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,284
But not like haven't seen
one of those so...

60
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,452
Yeah. Well, yeah...
I mean... I haven't.

61
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,724
- But yes, I get the gist of...
- Really?

62
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,954
- But it sounds cool. They sound great.
- It is cool.

63
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:34,505
Do you wanna go?

64
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,377
I'm gonna...

65
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:52,147
Can you imagine how excited
Nathan would've been to see this?

66
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,298
He fought the decommissioning
tooth and nail,

67
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:56,068
said that we should never
give up hope.

68
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,099
Well, I guess he was right.

69
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,648
You met Kim on this project,
didn't you?

70
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,815
We designed the computer systems.
You know, she had a way of...

71
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,444
of finding a path to a solution
that was just...

72
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:12,668
unexpected.

73
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,266
The way I understand it, it was
the way the two of you worked together

74
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:18,382
that was so productive and unique.

75
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,261
We were a good team.

76
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:30,496
Do you hear that?

77
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,174
- What?
- The... it's making noise.

78
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,024
Jack, I told you, it's powered down.

79
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,192
A protocol's been initiated
to open the door.

80
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,111
- Initiated? From where?
- From there.

81
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,991
Okay, I need security here
right now.

82
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,417
Hold your fire!

83
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:32,706
It's human?

84
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,004
It's Kim.

85
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,982
Projet-SG (1.00)

86
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,935
Well, she is dehydrated.
Her electrolyte count is down.

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,370
Probably the result of plasma
field exposure after landing.

88
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,192
Otherwise, she's fine.

89
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,875
Henry, you said this was
an unmanned mission, right?

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,141
Absolutely. Yeah.

91
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,708
But the DNA tests
match Kim Yamazaki.

92
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,386
Guys, Kim died two years ago.

93
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:27,136
I mean, I saw her body.

94
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:30,059
And her cellular structure isn't human.
That's not Kim.

95
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:31,932
Okay, then.
What's going on?

96
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,127
Well, look, this ship has been traveling
through deep space for 20 years.

97
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,605
That's 20 years of cosmic rays
and primordial particle radiation.

98
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,652
- Who knows what could've happened?
- The biological mainframe.

99
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,029
I mean, it should be able to tell us
what occurred on the trip.

100
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,901
- What's a...
- An organic computer.

101
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,659
Based on neural net architecture
like the human brain.

102
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,536
Instead of circuits and wires,

103
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,916
it processes information
using living cells.

104
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,218
It can modify its structure to solve
any problem that's presented.

105
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,387
Great. How long to boot it up?

106
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,765
<i>Might wanna go to plan B.</i>

107
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:06,050
<i>I tapped into the ship
using my own organic rig.</i>

108
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,342
The onboard computer's completely fried.
There's nothing left.

109
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:10,940
<i>I'm what's left.</i>

110
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,423
I'm what's left.

111
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,464
If a computer can have a baby,

112
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,960
then I definitely missed a day
in Mrs. Sebert's health class.

113
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,510
Like I said, the ship's computer
was made up of living cells.

114
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:26,361
Well, it doesn't exactly explain
where Kim 2.0 came from or why.

115
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,189
The ship's original system was designed
for a shorter mission, right?

116
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,598
That means limited storage.

117
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,367
Maybe when the computer started to run
out of room, it realized it needed

118
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,261
a more complex recording medium
and the human body was the best suited.

119
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,543
Hold... let's take this
one huge step at a time.

120
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,083
Is your bio-lab up and running?

121
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,956
I was expecting a little more ET
and a little less Henry's ex-girlfriend.

122
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,403
Start scanning her all the way down
to the molecular level.

123
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,351
Got it.

124
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,260
I want you to do exactly
the same thing to the ship.

125
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,888
Now, you said the onboard computer
was non-functioning?

126
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,297
- I said it was fried.
- Well, get to work on it anyway.

127
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:58,559
There might be something left,
it'll give us more than we have now.

128
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:02,109
- I'm on it. I'll talk to Henry.
- No, Henry has enough on his plate.

129
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,487
That was something, huh?

130
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,716
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, she's just been...

131
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,931
kicking me all morning.

132
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,412
It's a girl?

133
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:26,755
I found out yesterday.
Yes, I'm having a girl.

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,848
Congratulations.

135
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,526
I love little girls.
I mean, no... no.

136
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:34,779
Here.

137
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:36,900
That's her.

138
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,144
Maybe she likes excitement.

139
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,257
Just like her mother.

140
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,381
Excitement.
Well, that's one word for it.

141
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,322
Well, let me know
if there's something I can do.

142
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,636
Well, actually, there is something
that you can do for me.

143
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,244
It's very important.

144
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,039
I'm your guy.

145
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,661
Hey, you'll get all your stuff back.

146
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,764
Everybody, please, just calm down.

147
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,965
I need a toaster oven,
bagel-capable.

148
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,786
Right, white or chrome?

149
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,387
It's bisque.

150
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:21,935
Okay, I need to just check you off.

151
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,438
The system is totally overloaded.

152
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:26,857
First somebody
steals my toaster oven

153
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:29,109
to build whatever it was
out there in the woods

154
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,945
and now I have to wait here
for two hours to get it back.

155
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:34,825
There you go.

156
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,040
This is better than the one I had.

157
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,897
No, wait.
That's not how this works.

158
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,910
Dr. Lieber.
L-I-E-B-E-R.

159
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,084
And what can we get
for you, Dr. Lieber?

160
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,961
I'm here to pick up
my 200 peta-volt boost converter.

161
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,465
And what would that
look like exactly?

162
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,926
It's about that big.
It's got lots of circuit boards.

163
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,637
Kinda looks like
any other boost converter.

164
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,515
Lieber...

165
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:03,894
I hate this thing.

166
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,797
Probably got a virus.

167
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,338
PCs are very susceptible.

168
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,566
That's why I switched
to an organic computer years ago.

169
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,138
Whoopee for you.

170
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,828
This what you're looking for?

171
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:17,783
Perfect.

172
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,098
- It's gonna be a long day.
- It already is.

173
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,789
- Next!
- What can we get for you?

174
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:27,139
There was a malfunction
with the primary machine.

175
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,862
<i>Primary machine.
You mean the original organic computer?</i>

176
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>The primary machine experienced
voltage irregularities.</i>

177
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:38,136
<i>In order to continue its mission,
it created a replacement.</i>

178
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,181
- You.
- <i>I became the primary machine.</i>

179
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,684
- What do you mean "created"?
- I was grown.

180
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,705
Grown from what? Your ship was
constructed in a clean room.

181
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,014
The primary machine was the only
organic material onboard.

182
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,817
Actually, that's probably not true.

183
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,162
No environment is ever
perfectly clean.

184
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,865
- We took level one precautions, but...
- A few strands of hair, an eyelash.

185
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:00,434
<i>A skin cell.</i>

186
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,786
<i>It was fortunate
that the DNA strands were intact</i>

187
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,606
<i>and I had such a detailed profile
on Dr. Yamazaki</i>

188
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,451
<i>due to her involvement
on the project.</i>

189
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,583
Is this possible?

190
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,628
The computer was programmed
for self-preservation.

191
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,132
To keep itself operating
under any circumstances.

192
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:19,011
<i>So it found a flake of skin
and created a whole other Kim?</i>

193
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,596
Well, it evolved. It adapted.

194
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,433
It made an incredible leap.

195
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,102
But why didn't it model anyone else
who worked on the ship?

196
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,294
<i>Why wouldn't it choose you, Henry?</i>

197
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,379
Kim Yamazaki's sample
was the most viable.

198
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,402
We designed it to improvise...
Kim and I.

199
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,489
<i>I look forward to working
with you, Henry.</i>

200
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:46,747
<i>It was always a great pleasure...
for Kim.</i>

201
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:57,883
<i>I need something to write with.</i>

202
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,239
We're in the home stretch.

203
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:10,503
- I don't wanna see a toaster again.
- I don't wanna eat toast again.

204
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:13,051
But we are gonna have
to do another inventory.

205
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:14,687
Maybe in a few minutes.

206
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,709
So much stuff.

207
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:22,193
Like, so many whack jobs.

208
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:23,654
Very funny.

209
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,885
What do you want?
We already gave you back your thingy.

210
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,429
This is not my thingy.
This has a ZX21 ship.

211
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,822
I don't wanna know about this stuff.

212
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:35,847
My boost converter has a ZY21 ship.
This is clearly inferior.

213
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,299
- You pulled the old bait and switch.
- Look around. There's not much left.

214
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:44,329
We did give out something
that looked like this earlier today.

215
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:45,258
To who?

216
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,642
- God.
- Lieber.

217
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,769
Yeah, that's the guy.

218
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:53,611
He's been eyeing
my converter for months.

219
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:54,979
Easy.

220
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,693
It was absolutely crazy earlier.
Could've been an honest mistake.

221
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,196
There is nothing honest
about Tom Lieber.

222
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,483
I'm gonna get back what's mine.

223
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,554
Have a nice day.

224
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,644
Add it to the "to do" list?

225
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,344
- Brought your blender back.
- Thank you.

226
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,381
- What's that?
- It's my organic computer.

227
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,180
This gel uses electrical impulses
from my hands

228
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,727
to interface with what's left
of the ship's onboard data system.

229
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm using it to try and pull
any remaining data

230
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,091
out of the biological mainframe.

231
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,860
It has a light-pulse
based transfer system.

232
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,362
- It's pretty cool.
- Didn't you say earlier...

233
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,407
Yeah, I know.
I said what was on the ship was DOA.

234
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,617
I can confirm
that what's in there made Kim.

235
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,503
But that's about it.

236
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,638
20 years of discoveries...
more knowledge

237
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,444
than what mankind has learned
since the beginning of time...

238
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,610
is locked inside Kim
and nowhere else?

239
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,313
We've never encountered
anything like her before.

240
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,172
It's not like we can
just download her.

241
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:03,383
Still saying, we need Henry on this.

242
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,761
Now that I've finished
my deliveries,

243
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,607
I think I might be able
to help with that.

244
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:15,571
- This isn't my blender.
- What?

245
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,782
If Lieber says
that that boost converter isn't his,

246
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:35,052
I say we let Fargo and him
settle it in a cage match.

247
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,389
- How 'bout five bucks on Fargo.
- Nice.

248
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,819
He's scrappy.

249
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,651
We got your boost converter.

250
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:53,515
This looks more like a haunted house
than a physics lab.

251
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:04,240
- Do you smell that?
- It's like something's burning.

252
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,322
Or someone.

253
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,915
So looks like
Dr. Lieber there, was electrocuted.

254
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,322
Yeah. Probably.

255
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:37,686
I still have to do an autopsy.
But, yeah.

256
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:40,564
You know which piece
of equipment malfunctioned?

257
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,025
Dr. Lieber was an expert
in electromagnetic physics.

258
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,318
Pick one.

259
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,071
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:52,074
I rebooted the power regulator so you
guys don't have to worry about it.

261
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,675
Fargo might. The boost converter
he accused Lieber of stealing,

262
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,006
it's gone.
Yanked out of the panel.

263
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,509
Tell me he didn't cause this.

264
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:04,295
Well, I'll run a few diagnostics,
but it's possible.

265
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,088
Great.

266
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,641
So how you doing with the whole...

267
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,307
Kim thing?

268
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,050
It's not Kim.

269
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:26,318
I mean, I know it seems that it is,
but it's not Kim.

270
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,648
I'm a scientist.

271
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,623
So whatever happened on that ship

272
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,416
is a scientific issue.

273
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:47,213
Good. Then they're gonna need
your help dealing with it

274
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:48,881
back at GD.

275
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,305
Okay, I took it.

276
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,963
Don't look at me like that.

277
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,389
It's not stealing
when you take something that's yours.

278
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,365
What, was I supposed to ask him?
Lieber? That weasel?

279
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:09,048
That weasel is...

280
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,779
he's dead.

281
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:13,812
Come again.

282
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:17,806
We think that
Dr. Lieber was electrocuted.

283
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:22,666
We're thinking maybe it had something
to do with a missing boost converter.

284
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:31,091
Oh, my God.
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

285
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,702
The big house.
The slammer. The hoosegow.

286
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,339
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
President of the Attia Physics club!

287
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:38,939
Man up, Fargo.

288
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,881
Henry's doing an autopsy right now.
We'll have more information after that.

289
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,901
But if you can walk us
through everything that you did.

290
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,742
And deep breaths, okay?

291
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:57,735
Still no luck coming up
with any kind of data transfer protocol.

292
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,547
We connected people
to computers before.

293
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,964
The prosthetics department
has been doing it for years.

294
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,624
Well, yeah, but the information in Kim
isn't centralized to a brain.

295
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:07,127
Every cell in the entire organism
is a data recorder.

296
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,251
A hundred trillion cells,
each with something to tell us.

297
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:13,270
I mean, how much data do you think
we're talking about here?

298
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:16,928
<i>I'm guessing a lot.</i>

299
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,282
<i> She's been at it for hours.
Ever since you gave her that marker.</i>

300
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,162
<i>Well, that's one way
to access her data.</i>

301
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:24,997
Writing and speech are the slowest
methods of information transfer

302
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,213
on the planet.

303
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,963
Imagine if I asked
you about Shakespeare

304
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,979
and you just started
writing out his plays.

305
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,693
It would take you forever.

306
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:36,784
<i>2,135 year and 69 days.</i>

307
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,612
<i>The time it will take me to download
my data using this method.</i>

308
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,142
<i>I've run alternate simulations,</i>

309
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,859
<i>but so far, this scenario
has the shortest timeline.</i>

310
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,975
Well, we will need
a better solution than that.

311
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,043
Believe me, it'll be worth it.

312
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:50,733
Take a look at this.

313
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:54,359
These are what,
gravity field distortion readings?

314
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:57,562
Exactly.
Taken from beyond the heliopause,

315
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,636
indicating the existence
of four Earth-like planets

316
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,348
within ten light-years of us.

317
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,976
My God.
That's right in the neighborhood.

318
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,895
Pull in any department you need.

319
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,066
I want information transfer options
on my desk as soon as possible.

320
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,811
<i>It might be beneficial to assemble
my original team,</i>

321
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,486
<i>Dr. Deacon and my co-designer,
Kim Yamazaki.</i>

322
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,306
Dr. Yamazaki died two years ago.

323
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:23,860
<i>I'm sorry. </i>

324
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:27,414
That's unfortunate.
I was looking forward to meeting her.

325
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,506
I've examined Dr. Lieber's remains

326
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:43,498
and the electron generator
in his lab...

327
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:44,700
Oh, God.

328
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:48,755
And all the voltage transfer limits
are within material tolerance.

329
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,047
Thank you! Thank you!

330
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,839
And...

331
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,279
Dr. Lieber's machine did not
malfunction or electrocute him.

332
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:00,740
So I guess you're free to go.

333
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,615
Freedom! Lunch is on me, boys.

334
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,168
So what did happen?

335
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:14,462
Lieber electrocuted his machine.

336
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,090
A voltage pathway analysis
indicates that his body generated

337
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,570
a bolt of current that overloaded
everything in his lab.

338
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:23,990
It was like some sort of internal
electrical storm.

339
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,420
Is that even possible?

340
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:28,142
I have no idea. It's one
of the strangest things I've ever seen.

341
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:34,309
An SDS scan will not be effective
in decoding my amino acid construct.

342
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:37,790
I've tweaked the polarities.
I'm thinking we've got a shot.

343
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:40,864
Moreover, there's the risk the procedure
could harm my neural pathways.

344
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,220
Come on. Trust me.

345
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,035
I'm one of the smart ones.

346
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,305
You could damage me and my data.

347
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,375
We'll take it nice and slow.

348
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:54,850
You let me know
if there's a problem, okay?

349
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,645
Lieber produced an electrical charge

350
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,924
strong enough to short out
his entire office and himself.

351
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:04,550
Was he connected to that ship
that landed, or Kim or Henry?

352
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:07,849
No, he wasn't at the landing site.
And he wasn't even at GD today.

353
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,295
Initiating the SDS scan.

354
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,165
- That was a neural spike.
- It wasn't me.

355
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:25,915
What are you doing?

356
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,537
You're creating a feedback loop.

357
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,333
Stop!

358
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,757
Shut the power down now!

359
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:02,163
Last thing I remember, I was trying
to get the data out of her...

360
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,125
and boom.

361
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,200
I hit the grounds seeing fireworks.

362
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,990
- Was it some kind of seizure?
- Not in the usual sense.

363
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,368
His convulsions
were extremely violent

364
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:15,166
and his electroencephalogram
is still off the charts.

365
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,627
Is this the same thing
that Lieber had?

366
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,004
- I'll have to do more tests.
- Wait a minute.

367
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,810
- Didn't Lieber die?
- Lieber was alone. You weren't.

368
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:24,517
We got to you in a matter of seconds

369
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,530
and we were able to dissipate
your internal voltage spike.

370
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,655
So...

371
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,165
Can I get back to work?

372
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:38,110
We're gonna need you to stay here
a little longer.

373
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:39,932
Why? I thought you guys
got it in time.

374
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,600
We're suppressing
his neuro-eletrical activity,

375
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:45,440
but there's another electrical wave
already building.

376
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:46,565
Meaning...

377
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,034
- This is gonna keep happening?
- We're gonna find out what caused this.

378
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,537
I know what caused this.
Kim.

379
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:56,833
- Where are you going?
- To shut it down.

380
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,251
- The information is too valuable.
- It attacked Zane.

381
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:04,841
We're doing an investigation
and there are rules.

382
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,760
Now, we have a suspect there
who we're gonna talk to.

383
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:10,972
Your suspect is a computer
from outer space.

384
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:24,390
I've reviewed the incident.

385
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:27,363
And although I understand
why you draw a different conclusion,

386
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,722
my assessment is that
your colleague suffers

387
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,530
from a congenital brain abnormality.

388
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,745
He was fine until
he got in there with you.

389
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,832
Let's just run through this
one more time, okay?

390
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:40,683
So the spaceship lands,

391
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,490
and you come out.

392
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:47,303
A few hours later,
Lieber's electrocuted in his own lab.

393
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,719
And then the exact same thing
happens to Zane,

394
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,430
right here, in front of you.

395
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:54,720
And if I may say,

396
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:58,245
you weren't too excited
about the test that he was doing.

397
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,465
Perhaps there was a malfunction
with his equipment.

398
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,483
A short in the monitoring module.

399
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,985
That's...

400
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:06,751
a good idea.

401
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,988
We checked that
and the machines were fine.

402
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,491
How would I be connected
with Dr. Lieber?

403
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,165
We haven't figured that out yet.

404
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:18,411
Perhaps proximity is not a factor
in this equation.

405
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,629
Are you saying that you could zap
anyone, anywhere?

406
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,030
That might explain what happened.

407
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,328
And I have no memory of such an act.

408
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:31,052
I'm not programmed for aggression.

409
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:33,554
No, but you are programmed
for self-preservation.

410
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,345
Yes. You're right.

411
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,475
Thanks.

412
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,520
You should shut me down.

413
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:47,318
Eradicate my voluntary functions
and do your best to preserve my data.

414
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,980
Perhaps immersion in a slurry
of liquid nitrogen and argon.

415
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:53,105
That's what I'm talking about.

416
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,065
Is this your way of...

417
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:03,875
admitting...

418
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:05,711
that you attacked Zane?

419
00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:08,815
But a man is dead,

420
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,260
and another man is in danger.

421
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,185
And you just presented
a logical explanation.

422
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,610
Whether due to a programming error

423
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:19,335
or degradation caused
by my journey home,

424
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,605
I might be a serious threat.

425
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:25,606
Terminate me.

426
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:35,985
She really said that?

427
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,825
It was spooky.

428
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:45,845
I mean, you gotta help me out here.

429
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,755
Is there a person in there?

430
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:54,767
I mean, is that Kim?

431
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,470
Yes, I know.

432
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:03,295
It's an organic computer programmed
to act like a human. I get it.

433
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:07,415
But...

434
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,173
what is a person?

435
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,835
Could there be...

436
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,925
a piece of Kim in there?

437
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:22,945
Scientifically...

438
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:26,715
Impossible.

439
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:36,259
But don't you think I've been asking
myself that question since I saw her?

440
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,058
I don't think she did it.

441
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:45,715
Apparently,

442
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:47,595
she does.

443
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:54,409
Bottom line, we've to figure out what's
going on before someone else gets hurt.

444
00:26:56,495 --> 00:27:00,499
Obviously, I'm gonna need you to compare
what you're learning about Zane

445
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,265
to what you know about Lieber.

446
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,945
I'm gonna need you...

447
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,034
to examine Kim.

448
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,305
You know, we don't have to...

449
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:22,765
save Kim...

450
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:28,405
for me.

451
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:31,225
I know.

452
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:34,935
Okay then.

453
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:36,605
Fine.

454
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:10,295
I'm glad to see you.

455
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,480
Sit down, please,
and roll up your sleeve.

456
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:15,855
Yes, of course.

457
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,948
I'm glad they sent you.

458
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,284
Why?

459
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:26,537
It's only appropriate that you would be
the one to terminate me.

460
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm just gonna take
a fresh blood sample.

461
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,480
What type of analysis
are you going to perform?

462
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:36,630
The usual.

463
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:40,435
Will you be requiring
more than one blood sample?

464
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,720
I'd be interested in going
over the results with you.

465
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:44,555
Just, please, let me...

466
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:48,025
- You always liked collaborating.
- Stop it.

467
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,335
This is very confusing, isn't it?

468
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:06,525
What?

469
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:08,905
It hurt.

470
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:16,565
I did a static comparison
of Zane's test result

471
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,923
against everything from Lieber
and there is a connection.

472
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,043
- Well, we know that.
- The electrocutions.

473
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,620
No, no, it's a virus.

474
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:25,763
Wait, what type of virus could cause
this kind of electrical disturbance?

475
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:29,450
Well, just think about it. It doesn't
so much reproduce as it backs itself up,

476
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:33,190
creating identical copies over
and over again without mutation.

477
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:36,044
Every living thing mutates.
That's how nature works.

478
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,360
Is it possible then
that this isn't from nature?

479
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,290
Well, all this talk about electricity
and backups and overloads,

480
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:45,090
I mean, it sounds like
you're talking about a computer virus.

481
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:46,435
And that's exactly right.

482
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,302
A biological organism encoded
with binary information instead of DNA

483
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:52,136
and we have no defense against it.

484
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:56,110
And how does it jump
from computer to living person?

485
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:59,360
Well, you already said it.
It came from an organic computer.

486
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:00,885
A living organism.

487
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:03,550
So it was Kim?
Or did the Kim clone?

488
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:07,220
No, he's been under full bio-containment
protocol since we got her here.

489
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:08,848
But the virus still got out.

490
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,725
I did a full workup. She's clean.
She's not the source of the virus.

491
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,979
Henry, only one organic computer
walked off that ship.

492
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:16,905
True.

493
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,145
But there is another one
still onboard.

494
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,694
Right.

495
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:26,361
<i>Decontamination complete.</i>

496
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,335
- Shouldn't you be wearing a mask?
- I am.

497
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:47,545
It's one of those high-tech ones
of Henry's.

498
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:49,575
We've all got 'em.

499
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,085
So what's all this?

500
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,965
Treats.
I brought your favorite foods.

501
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:01,387
All of your favorite foods.

502
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,925
Olives stuffed with blue cheese.

503
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:05,225
Awesome.

504
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,675
Toasted peanut butter and bacon.

505
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:10,855
Egg salad.

506
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,985
And rocky road ice cream.

507
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:17,005
I love you, Jo.

508
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:21,115
I love you too.

509
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,005
That was heavy.

510
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:39,259
It's the motherboard
from the ship's organic computer.

511
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,564
Or what's left of it.

512
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,765
The entire biological matrix
has been burned up.

513
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,185
Overloaded.

514
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,822
Looks like exactly the same thing
that happened to Dr. Lieber.

515
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,625
It's got the virus.

516
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,160
And we have definitely found
the source.

517
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,539
Zane jacked directly into it. It must
have jumped to his organic computer.

518
00:31:56,846 --> 00:32:00,292
- Well, he was in it up to his elbows.
- How did Lieber get infected?

519
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,044
He went organic years ago.

520
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,347
The computers. Not the food.

521
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,752
If he had a first generation device,
he would have been more susceptible.

522
00:32:07,877 --> 00:32:09,927
The infection is traveling
through the network.

523
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,688
- How many organic computers are there?
- There's 25 labs that are equipped.

524
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:14,913
So that's...

525
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,235
200 people.

526
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,019
200 people?

527
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:22,015
We've got a potential epidemic
on our hands.

528
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:36,954
Well, the virus is causing Zane's
neuro-electrical charge to build up.

529
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:39,590
I'd say two hours
before he has another seizure.

530
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:42,398
And this time, I don't know
if we'll be able to stop it.

531
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,004
So is this all of them?

532
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:48,807
Yeah, it's everyone who had
an organic computer.

533
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,610
We quarantined all the computers.

534
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,610
So far, we've detected symptoms
in 69 people.

535
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:57,433
Now, does that mean all of them
are gonna get sick?

536
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:01,103
Like with any virus, we assume that some
will be affected more than other.

537
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:05,490
The more they get hit, the harder time
we'll have suppressing the symptoms.

538
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,738
Now, what happens when or if...

539
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:11,113
people without organic computers
get sick?

540
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:15,200
If transmission only occurs
with direct contact to the computer,

541
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:18,368
there's no reason to believe
that's gonna happen.

542
00:33:19,895 --> 00:33:21,540
Other than this?

543
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,390
We're all infected.
The virus is jumping from human to human

544
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,469
via touch using
our own electrical impulses.

545
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,952
I'm instituting a level one quarantine.
Entrances to the town need to be sealed.

546
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:39,384
- No one comes in or out.
- What about the people here?

547
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,724
The safest thing that anyone can do
is stay indoors.

548
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:43,977
- Will that keep 'em from getting it?
- Well, for now,

549
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:47,046
but we're dealing with a new form
of infection here, one that is adapting.

550
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,990
Our body has no inherent immunities
and no way to fight it.

551
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:54,119
I developed a crude test.
The infection rate is already climbing.

552
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,790
How long do we have?

553
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,865
Well, based on the timeline
for Zane and Lieber,

554
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:03,895
in 12 hours, you won't be able
to find anyone who isn't infected.

555
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,215
What about Kim?

556
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:10,260
I mean, you tested her, right?
You said that she wasn't the source,

557
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:13,030
so that means she's immune, right?

558
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:14,155
Maybe. Well...

559
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,411
Probably. I mean,

560
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:20,372
the original computer could've written
immunity into its code as a protection,

561
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,351
so he could be our answer.

562
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,850
You're disregarding
your isolation protocols.

563
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:34,196
We realized that you no longer pose
a threat to us.

564
00:34:34,515 --> 00:34:35,665
Are you sure?

565
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,159
Sheriff Carter presented a very logical
and compelling argument.

566
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,781
He worked just as hard to prove
that you had nothing to do

567
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:45,856
with what was happening to us
and that you might be able to help us.

568
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,795
I believe that there are antibodies
in your cells that could save Eureka.

569
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,215
- Do you need more tissue samples or...
- Actually,

570
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,825
I think we should work together.

571
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,175
I'd like that very much.

572
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,926
Just so I know
what I've got to look forward to,

573
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,194
are you experiencing any symptoms?

574
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,373
Tingling in your extremities,
blurred vision...

575
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,526
Being able to power a flashlight
without batteries?

576
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,515
- Yeah, like that.
- No. I'm good.

577
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,865
It's not looking good
for the meteor shower.

578
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:23,420
This will keep you from being hooked up
to a suppression unit for a few hours.

579
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:25,497
- It's an electro-resistant gel.
- Sounds good.

580
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,458
Bad news is it's gonna hurt.

581
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,586
- How much?
- Jo didn't complain.

582
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:32,921
Well, that's not particularly...

583
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:39,303
- Now I got tingling in my extremities.
- I'm sorry.

584
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:41,735
Jack, we found something.

585
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,257
Jack was right.

586
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:47,770
Before the original computer
was destroyed by the virus,

587
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,898
it designs and encodes an immunity
for its replacement.

588
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,166
- Have you been able to isolate it?
- Yes. We have.

589
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,736
Great. What you got?
Booster shots? A patch?

590
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,965
- That's getting old.
- Yeah, it's not gonna be that easy.

591
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,578
There's a difference between our immune
system and that of an organic computer.

592
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,873
Traditional methods of immunization
just aren't gonna work.

593
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,563
What about Zane's goo thing?

594
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:14,239
It was attached to the ship.
He said it used light?

595
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:16,715
The human optic system
is a lot like that of a computer.

596
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,565
It's a light-based
information transfer system.

597
00:36:20,065 --> 00:36:22,471
So can we use eyes
to transfer the information?

598
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:25,808
Our eyes process visual information
and turn it into a series of signals.

599
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,920
That the brain can understand.

600
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:30,333
Which means we might be able
to distribute immunity

601
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,600
- within an intense beam of...
- A spectrum-tuned light.

602
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,750
But hold on, that's a lot of power.

603
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:38,821
Maybe 30 to 40 petavolts per byte
of distributed information.

604
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,573
That's the output of the North American
power grid for a year.

605
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,520
We've got maybe ten hours.

606
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:44,745
Suggestions.

607
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,740
We have fusion cells
in chemical storage,

608
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,240
but it'll take days
to get up and running.

609
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,446
- Antimatter generator.
- Prototype's not ready.

610
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,539
How about plasma? That's good for big,
high energy bursts of power, right?

611
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:58,926
What? I pay attention.

612
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,270
Plasma might do it,

613
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:05,681
but we don't have the components
to build one anywhere near big enough.

614
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,175
I think we do.

615
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:10,365
But I'm gonna need the blender back.

616
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,330
<i>Please form an orderly line.</i>

617
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:18,870
- <i>Your items will be returned to you.</i>
- Next.

618
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:21,451
I am gonna get this toaster
returned to me, right?

619
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,873
Lawn sprinkler. 15 inches.
Looks like titanium alloy.

620
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,417
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Tower three. Fifth bay.

621
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,945
Just above the resonance coupler.

622
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,250
We've had 16 more cases
in the last hour.

623
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,025
We laid the immunization data
into a pulse generator

624
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,775
at 510 nanometers.

625
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,493
- Green light.
- Thank you.

626
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:22,481
I've alerted all departments
to shield their optical equipment.

627
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:24,175
What about our optical equipment?

628
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,506
This wavelength of light won't cause
ocular damage.

629
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:28,680
- It should only affect the virus.
- Here's hoping.

630
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:30,515
All right, here we go.

631
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,184
60%.

632
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:36,188
70%.

633
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,650
It's powering down.

634
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,890
- Power down to 30%.
- Okay, what's wrong?

635
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,653
- We're missing a component.
- Did you collect all the pieces?

636
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:47,565
No, I went...

637
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:50,911
Are you kidding me?

638
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,166
What happened to respect
for personal property?

639
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,086
- What happened to saving people's live?
- Better late than never.

640
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,038
He has some good qualities.

641
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,155
Okay, are we ready
to try this again?

642
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:08,145
Cross your fingers.

643
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:13,185
80.

644
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:16,785
90.

645
00:39:18,015 --> 00:39:19,015
100.

646
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:24,421
All checked out.

647
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:27,841
I was really worried about you.

648
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:29,775
Me too.

649
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,005
How are you feeling?

650
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,205
You tell me.

651
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,225
Any sparks?

652
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:56,955
Just the good kind.

653
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,939
I bought you a change of clothes.

654
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:30,904
Thank you, Henry.

655
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:32,515
You're welcome.

656
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:37,953
What happens now?

657
00:41:40,505 --> 00:41:44,209
Well, there's still an incredible amount
of information locked inside of you.

658
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,571
And we have to figure
a way of getting it out safely.

659
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:50,132
So we have a lot of work to do.

660
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,225
Together.

661
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,865
Then let's get started.

662
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:19,795
Oldest story in the world.

663
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:23,325
Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl.
Boy meets computer.

664
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:26,685
Well, everybody needs
a hand to hold.

665
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,385
This is a really weird town.

666
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:32,485
But I like it.

667
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:34,505
Kinda.

668
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:47,195
Can't believe
I've never done this before.

669
00:42:47,395 --> 00:42:48,395
I mean,

670
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,135
it's amazing.

671
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:52,495
Yeah. It is.
