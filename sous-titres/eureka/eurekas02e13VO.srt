1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,900
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:04,736
The Artifact is capable
of human interface,

3
00:00:04,856 --> 00:00:06,970
- and you know who it is.
- Kevin.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,071
<i>He controls the field now, Allie.
He's evolving.</i>

5
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,596
If they get a hold of Kevin,
he will never have a normal life

6
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,582
well, we have get that thing out of him.

7
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:18,500
Any structures made of metal
could deteriorate just as badly as...

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,631
Definitely a mutation
on the original strain.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,467
It's like someone flipped a switch
and turned it into a voracious

10
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,414
metal-eating bug.

11
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:34,098
<i>What if the metal-eating bacteria
mutated again before we caught it all?</i>

12
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,618
<i>It started jumping to people?</i>

13
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,688
- It's a red level security breach.
- The bacteria... It's airborne.

14
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:42,046
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,928
Is that Beverly?

16
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,741
<i>Biohazard detected, section four.</i>

17
00:00:57,864 --> 00:01:00,295
<i>All personnel move to emergency exits.</i>

18
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,898
- What the hell just happened?
- Code red biohazard activates

19
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,246
the panic room protocol.

20
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:07,048
The director's office becomes a bunker
in case of biological attack.

21
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:09,467
What about an airborne bacteria?

22
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:12,215
- What are you talking about?
- Henry said that the bacteria

23
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,159
mutated and consumed
a corpse in the morgue.

24
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,028
We was afraid
that it had become airborne.

25
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,433
Looks like he was right.

26
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:20,394
Dr. Stark, we've had to quarantine
section four and the people in it.

27
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,675
We need everyone else
into decontamination.

28
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,572
No, we have three adults and a child--

29
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,273
He's right.

30
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,402
We can't help
if you and I are on the menu.

31
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,685
They're in the safest place in this
building, sealed a mile underneath.

32
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,992
If we're gonna help,
we need equipment and a plan.

33
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,738
And we're really not
giving you a choice, Sir.

34
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,473
- Mom?
- It's okay, baby.

35
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:58,928
Something set off the panic room.

36
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:02,183
Well, I don't care what set it off.
We are getting out of here.

37
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,359
I want to know how you got out,
and what the hell you're doing here.

38
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:07,761
Why don't you ask Henry?

39
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:10,961
We're here for Kevin.

40
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,035
My lab has a communications link.

41
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,162
Once the panic room is secure,
a direct line to the DOD is activated.

42
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,199
Allison should've been
in contact by now.

43
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:25,841
I'm on it.

44
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,628
This place would collapse without me.

45
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,853
It already has.

46
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,235
Connecting general Mansfield now.

47
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,714
<i>Ah, Dr. Stark.</i>

48
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,969
General Mansfield,
have you spoken to Dr. Blake?

49
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,388
<i>We've been unable to make contact.</i>

50
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,564
Panic room should've
hooked up automatically.

51
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,470
<i>Well, then I guess we can assume
that the system's failed.</i>

52
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,307
<i>Now we are going to need an acting
director until we can establish contact.</i>

53
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,455
<i>In light of the evidence that you
presented before the review committee,</i>

54
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,287
<i>- I'm appointing you.</i>
- Review--

55
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,386
What evidence? What?!

56
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,393
<i>That Dr. Stark was in no way responsible</i>

57
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:58,245
<i>for the accident
that killed Kim Anderson.</i>

58
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,895
Who was?

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,117
<i>Beverly Barlowe.</i>

60
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,772
She's in that panic room.
You know that, right?

61
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,005
<i>I thought you had her
under control, Dr. Stark.</i>

62
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:09,303
Working on it, General.

63
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,497
We kind of have bigger issues
at the moment though.

64
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:12,621
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

65
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:14,648
<i>The detection system is showing us</i>

66
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:17,816
<i>that the outbreak is
spreading beyond section four.</i>

67
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:21,351
<i>The release of an airborne pathogen
like that would be catastrophic.</i>

68
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,622
<i>Now if we cannot keep it contained,</i>

69
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,654
<i>I will order a thermal cleaning
of that entire facility.</i>

70
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,577
General, a thermal cleaning will
wipe out all organic material in GD.

71
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:32,468
It will set our research back decades.

72
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:34,489
Not to mention kill everyone
in section four.

73
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,114
<i>Well, then I guess we better
get it contained.</i>

74
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:45,917
You had proof that Beverly killed Kim,
and you didn't say anything?

75
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:48,253
- I couldn't.
- You couldn't.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,078
It's complicated.

77
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,141
You knew she was a subject in an
investigation, and you brought her here

78
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,725
behind my back. And now she's locked in
a room with Allison, Kevin, and Henry.

79
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,654
Now...

80
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,391
Does he know that Beverly killed Kim?

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,977
Who do you think gave me the evidence?

82
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,908
Call Taggart. Get him to meet us
at GD. Bring the bio suits.

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,102
Why?

84
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,287
'Cause we're going back in.

92
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,561
I still can't believe
I let you talk me into chaperoning.

93
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:58,291
Hey, no one snapped off your fingers.

94
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:03,027
The ease with which you say that
is almost as disturbing as it is hot.

95
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:04,683
I know.

96
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,815
Hey, chia pet, wanna dance?

97
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,469
Well, when you ask like that--

98
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,946
<i>A biohazard's been detected at GD.</i>

99
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,187
<i>All residents must remain indoors.</i>

100
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,924
<i>All bio preservation lockdowns
are engaged.</i>

101
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,237
Jo, where's my dad?

102
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:28,577
<i>These suits should protect us
from the nasty little buggers.</i>

103
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,354
<i>What do you mean should?</i>

104
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:32,298
You guys ready?

105
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,609
<i>- Roger dodger, Fargo.
- All right,</i>

106
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,958
once you exit the elevator,
radio signals will be jammed

107
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,402
by the building's security system
and we'll lose contact.

108
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:44,031
<i>You have to reach the main communication
center in section four.</i>

109
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,989
If it wasn't damaged by the collapse,
you should be able to contact

110
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,383
the panic room from there.

111
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:49,606
<i>Good luck, guys.</i>

112
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,891
What do you want with my son?

113
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,989
I think you already know, Allison.

114
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,600
You certainly worked hard
enough to keep it a secret.

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,969
You even locked Henry out of Kim's lab
when you thought he might figure it out.

116
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,773
Is that why you've done this, Henry?
To get back at me?

117
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,168
You know we so well.

118
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:19,976
Apparently I don't know you at all.

119
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:21,613
He's doing this

120
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,380
because Kevin now embodies the Artifact.

121
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,952
He's the conduit to the akashic field.

122
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,579
And you people are incapable

123
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,581
of handling this kind
of power responsibly.

124
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,621
Spoken by the woman
who's responsible for Kim's death.

125
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,712
How can you trust her
after what she's done?

126
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:39,484
Because this is more important than me,
more important than Kim,

127
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,049
more important than any of us.

128
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,543
Kevin is connected to something
that needs to be protected.

129
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,848
There have been only a few others
who could access the field.

130
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,850
People whose brains
were tuned just right.

131
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,957
Da Vinci, Tesla, Einstein.

132
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:54,265
Kevin may outshine them all.

133
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,898
We need time with him
to see if we're right.

134
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,859
Well, you have a lot of time now.

135
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:02,203
This bunker is stocked with
enough supplies to last a year.

136
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,763
We're not going anywhere.

137
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:08,792
Okay, your dad is
with Stark and Taggart.

138
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,787
They had to go back into GD.

139
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:12,342
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,457
Dr. Fargo is at the door.

141
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:17,752
Hey, Jo.

142
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,754
I thought you were staying
at Stark's lab.

143
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,181
I was, but it was kind
of creepy in there.

144
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,408
I realized I may have
a way to stay in contact

145
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,178
with the sheriff and Dr. Stark.

146
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:29,226
SARAH'S CPU is tied
to my computer at Global.

147
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:30,489
Down periscope!

148
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:36,811
That's been here the whole time?

149
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,107
- Did I forget to mention it?
- Yeah.

150
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,728
We use SARAH to slip in through
a backdoor to the brain at GD.

151
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,615
- We?
- Once a backdoor link's established,

152
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,426
there's nothing I won't have access to.

153
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,860
I think you mean there's
nothing I won't have access to.

154
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,368
Boys, there's plenty
of backdoor access for everyone.

155
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:55,183
That didn't come out right.

156
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,646
Okay, just make it happen.

157
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:06,912
<i>You got anything yet?</i>

158
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,144
<i>Not yet.</i>

159
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,945
<i>This sensor's designed</i>

160
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,714
<i>to detect any known strain of bacteria.
But if it's a new one,</i>

161
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,103
<i>it may not pick it up.</i>

162
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,268
<i>Oh, very helpful.</i>

163
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:24,146
<i>- I think it's to the left.
- I'm pretty sure it's to the right.</i>

164
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:25,543
<i>Straight ahead, mates.</i>

165
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,376
<i>I told you we should've gone left.</i>

166
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:36,793
<i>You mean right.</i>

167
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,140
<i>Not helping.</i>

168
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,211
<i>A bacteria did this?</i>

169
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:46,090
<i>Well, that was before it found the iron
in our blood tastier than metal.</i>

170
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,130
<i>Looks like we'll have
to go up over the top.</i>

171
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,397
<i>- We'll be electrocuted.
- Just don't touch the wires.</i>

172
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,169
<i>We'll have better access if we go under.</i>

173
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,887
<i>- Yeah, and more unstable.
- You're unstable if you want to go--</i>

174
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,637
<i>Shut it, both of you!</i>

175
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,727
<i>You're like a couple of old women.</i>

176
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:02,420
<i>I've determined the path
of least resistance.</i>

177
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,475
<i>We're going under.</i>

178
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:11,494
<i>I love small spaces.</i>

179
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,742
<i>I hate small spaces.</i>

180
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:15,781
<i>It's like returning to the womb.</i>

181
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,539
<i>It's a disturbing thought.</i>

182
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,543
<i>- We need a bigger womb.
- That's it,</i>

183
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,287
<i>I'm going up over the top--</i>

184
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,306
<i>Well,</i>

185
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,747
<i>that was exciting.</i>

186
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,094
<i>Carter...</i>

187
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:50,821
<i>Thanks.</i>

188
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:52,902
<i>No problem.</i>

189
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,363
You say that we're not
responsible enough to handle access

190
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,965
to the akashic field.
What makes you any different?

191
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:09,210
It's not me. It's the group I work with.

192
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,545
Who are?

193
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:14,423
A consortium of people who have
the world's best interests in mind.

194
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,701
We will give Kevin all the care
and protection he needs.

195
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,190
Like hell you will.

196
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:22,524
Like I said, there's no way out of here.

197
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,174
You and I both know that's not true.

198
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:27,144
There is one way out,
and your security code can access it.

199
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:28,766
- No.
- No?

200
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,808
One way or the other,
we are taking your son!

201
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:45,953
<i>Communication room's
down past the morgue.</i>

202
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,667
<i>I hate the morgue.</i>

203
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,786
<i>What's wrong, Carter?
Afraid they wake up?</i>

204
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,522
<i>Yeah, I think they're gonna wake up.</i>

205
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,119
<i>Dr. Stark?</i>

206
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:54,679
<i>Is that you, Fargo?</i>

207
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,660
Yes, Sir, I hacked into--

208
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,088
We hacked into--

209
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,863
the mainframe using SARAH

210
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,737
<i>Good thinking, Fargo.</i>

211
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,178
Dad, going a bit far to cancel my party,
don't you think?

212
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:05,355
<i>Ah, you know me.</i>

213
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,351
<i>Three feet, Lucas.
Get your hands off her.</i>

214
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:09,761
How did he know?

215
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,105
<i>I know everything.</i>

216
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:13,534
<i>- Jo.</i>
- Hey, what's happening?

217
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:17,486
<i>We're not sure, but Beverly's locked
down there and she might be involved.</i>

218
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,363
<i>Hey, Jo.</i>

219
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,408
Hey, Tag.

220
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,436
Tag?

221
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:28,503
We can monitor your vitals now,
and help you navigate the building.

222
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,632
<i>Can you patch us into the panic room?</i>

223
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>No, it has an encrypted protocol</i>

224
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,890
<i>that only the DOD has outside access to.</i>

225
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,931
<i>And they haven't been
able to reach them either.</i>

226
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,716
<i>- What is that?
- The sensor that monitors the suits.</i>

227
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:42,520
<i>I'm picking up
the wireless readings here.</i>

228
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,805
One of you is losing pressure.

229
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,654
<i>Better check your suits.</i>

230
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:54,304
<i>It's me.</i>

231
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,609
<i>You've been exposed, mate.</i>

232
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,115
Dr. Stark?

233
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,505
Say something.

234
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,202
<i>I'm headed to the right place.</i>

235
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,889
<i>You got a hypodermic laser?</i>

236
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,974
<i>This should stem the infection.</i>

237
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,225
<i>And if it doesn't?</i>

238
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:23,167
<i>I'll be a lot thinner.</i>

239
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:27,564
<i>Sorry.</i>

240
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,225
<i>Let's keep going while I still can.</i>

241
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,809
- You don't want to do this.
- You don't want anything bad

242
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,111
to happen to your son. Now you know
how this ends if you don't cooperate.

243
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,434
So please.

244
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,143
I'll be right back, honey.

245
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:12,156
- What is this place?
- It's a last resort escape unit

246
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,185
for the head of GD
in case of a security breach.

247
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,552
The SRT.

248
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:18,283
Subatomic Reconstructive Transport.

249
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,968
Teleportation?

250
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:25,196
But this is a banned technology.

251
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,863
All active research was outlawed
by the Stockholm treaty.

252
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,077
After the prototype was created.

253
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,995
We never did human trials.

254
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,156
Yet, here it is at your disposal.

255
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,951
It's interesting how you can skirt
the rules when it benefits you.

256
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,511
Well, it's not benefiting me
at the moment, is it?

257
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:41,420
Does the technology really work?

258
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:44,091
The last primate trials were successful.

259
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,525
It's DNA specific.

260
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:48,104
Essentially, it reconstructs you
at a destination point,

261
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:51,347
leaving your former body behind,
like a snake shedding its skin.

262
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,862
Where is the destination?

263
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,989
A fully stocked bunker
1 km outside of town.

264
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,714
But that's its maximum range.

265
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,772
The greater the distance,
the greater the risk of complications.

266
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,608
And there were many more complications
after you left the project.

267
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:04,063
You want to do this? Be my guest.

268
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,822
God knows how you'll come out
on the other end. But there is no way

269
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:08,944
that I'm letting you
put my son through that thing.

270
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,879
Then say good-bye to your son now.

271
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,242
It's his only chance.

272
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,985
<i>All right, we're in. What do we do now?</i>

273
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,961
<i>You should see a computer
console as you enter the room.</i>

274
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,239
Bring up the panic room intercom link.

275
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:27,580
That should put you in direct contact.

276
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:31,136
<i>Allison, can you hear me?</i>

277
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,890
<i>Allison, are you there?</i>

278
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,665
Hang on, I'm trying to circumvent
the security wall.

279
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:42,545
- Try now.
<i>- Allison!</i>

280
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:45,807
<i>Something's jamming the signal.</i>

281
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,653
<i>It's not working.</i>

282
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,633
<i>Something's working.</i>

283
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,608
<i>What? What "uh-oh?"</i>

284
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,789
I think you made it mad.

285
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,970
The security mainframe is
a learning system,

286
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,167
and because of you
it's gone into defense mode.

287
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,668
<i>What kind of defense mode?</i>

288
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,411
<i>That kind.</i>

289
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,780
<i>Move!</i>

290
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,103
<i>That's a motion-activated
photon defense array.</i>

291
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:23,668
They're screwed.

292
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,098
<i>We can hear you.</i>

293
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,588
Sorry.

294
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,022
It looks like you can access
the weapon's power supply

295
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,705
- through the panel on the east wall.
- And the west wall.

296
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:35,247
There are two panels. One mainframe
and a backup power supply.

297
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:38,498
But you're on your own with this one.
We can't get through the firewall.

298
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:39,744
<i>Damn it.</i>

299
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,277
<i>Two panels, three of us.
How hard can that be?</i>

300
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:46,017
<i>It's a nasty bugger. It'll cut us down
long before we reach the panels.</i>

301
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,659
<i>Unless someone draws its fire.</i>

302
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,440
<i>Why do I always have to be the someone?</i>

303
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:01,224
<i>Any day, Carter.</i>

304
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:03,686
<i>Yeah, you want to change places?
You just be my guest.</i>

305
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,521
I can't watch this.

306
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,790
<i>Just remember.</i>

307
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,475
<i>Serpentine.</i>

308
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:11,414
<i>Three... Two...</i>

309
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:13,571
<i>Don't die... One.</i>

310
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,654
<i>I'm here!</i>

311
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:20,895
<i>I'm halfway!</i>

312
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,665
<i>I said serpentine!</i>

313
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:26,756
<i>Shut up, Taggart!</i>

314
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,678
<i>Running out of places to hide.</i>

315
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,155
<i>I've got mine. Taggart?</i>

316
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,373
<i>Trying!</i>

317
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,964
<i>Hang on, I'm trying!</i>

318
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,477
Dad!

319
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,318
<i>I hate this building.</i>

320
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:55,167
<i>- You all right?
- Yeah.</i>

321
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,327
<i>- What now?
- Listen.</i>

322
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,872
<i>- What is that?
- Guys...</i>

323
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,711
We're picking up heat signatures
down the hall from you.

324
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,439
<i>Where exactly?</i>

325
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:11,200
<i>In--</i>

326
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,020
in the morgue.

327
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,426
<i>I swear to God, if this thing turns
into a zombie attack, I am quitting.</i>

328
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,114
<i>You ready?</i>

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,368
<i>You want every single second.</i>

330
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,705
<i>Is that a yes?</i>

331
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,962
See, I told you I heard gunfire!

332
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,374
<i>Man, what the hell are y'all doing here?</i>

333
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:02,262
We were trying to isolate ourselves
from exposure to the outbreak.

334
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,687
Thanks for opening the door.

335
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,189
<i>You've isolated yourself in the room
where the flesh-eating bacteria began.</i>

336
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,984
- Flesh-eating?
<i>- Flesh-eating.</i>

337
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,724
<i>Is anyone suffering any ill effects?</i>

338
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,796
No. Flesh seems to be right
where it's supposed to be.

339
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:28,938
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

340
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,966
<i>They should all look like this by now.
Henry said this was the first victim.</i>

341
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,457
<i>- No way a bacteria did this.
- I'd say acid.</i>

342
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,372
So does this mean we're good?

343
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:44,352
<i>No.</i>

344
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,422
<i>This means Henry lied.</i>

345
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,225
<i>About a lot of things.</i>

346
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,938
There isn't a biohazard!

347
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,318
This is a hoax.

348
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,722
Why would Henry lie
about a deadly outbreak?

349
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:12,853
- To get everyone out of the building.
- While he and Beverly were coming in.

350
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:16,053
Must've tricked the computers to think
there was a bio-threat. You still there?

351
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah, we are now,

352
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,757
but the building's security
keeps shutting us out.

353
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:22,425
What do you see now?

354
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,549
The sensors still detect a biohazard,
and it's spreading through Global.

355
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,403
That's a problem.

356
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,179
Why? It's not real.

357
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,839
Gen. Mansfield doesn't know that.

358
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:37,019
And if the system tells him
there's a threat, he has to trust it.

359
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:39,302
He'll be forced to follow
all biohazard protocols,

360
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:41,095
and he will order a thermal cleaning.

361
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:44,723
Fargo, try to get through to him. We've
gotta get these people out of here.

362
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:46,368
Well, I can take them, Sheriff.

363
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:47,631
By yourself.

364
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,819
Well, I think I can handle a building.

365
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,128
Taggart, this building
is in defense mode.

366
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,084
It's not gonna let you
just walk out of here.

367
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:56,042
I welcome the challenge.

368
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:59,921
All right, troops.

369
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,158
Let's move out!

370
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,785
- We are so dead.
- I heard that.

371
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,498
I'd like to speak
to Kevin alone for a minute.

372
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,621
I'd like you to go straight to hell.

373
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,066
Trade you favors.

374
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,568
We're almost ready.

375
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,488
What happened to you?

376
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,176
- Why are you doing this?
- I lost the one person I truly loved.

377
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,830
Trust me, that's not something
you want to feel.

378
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,567
There's still one thing
I'm trying to understand.

379
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,778
Just one thing?

380
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,864
Well, you brought Beverly
here in secret because--

381
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,534
Because you're a horrible human being.

382
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,337
But why did Allison go along with it?

383
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,564
Did you ever think maybe
she was trying to protect me?

384
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,328
No, that's not it.

385
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:05,845
Unless...

386
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:08,180
she was trying to protect Kevin though.

387
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,967
She said he was changing.

388
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,425
It scared her.

389
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,579
That's why you and she were
working on the dream scanner.

390
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:18,874
Look, Carter...

391
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:25,409
Kevin was in section five
when the artifact exploded.

392
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,618
We hoped he didn't get exposed, but...

393
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,788
- he did.
- But he didn't...

394
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,638
Burst into flames or--

395
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,474
He's not wired like anybody else.

396
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,082
In fact, somehow

397
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:39,906
he connected to it.

398
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,122
He can control the energy.

399
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:45,942
And I'm afraid it's gonna destroy him.

400
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:49,172
So I've been doing everything I can
to disconnect him from it.

401
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:52,191
Disconnect. All you've ever wanted
to do was connect with it.

402
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,826
Yeah, you're right,
but not at the risk of Kevin.

403
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,558
There's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

404
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:00,534
Or Allie.

405
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:08,600
Then,

406
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:11,509
protect them.

407
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:13,556
I will.

408
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:18,815
<i>Biohazard detected, section three.</i>

409
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:22,010
Oh, God! Please tell me you have
a plan to get us out of here.

410
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,361
Relax, mate. I always have a plan.

411
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,007
So, Fargo, still with us?

412
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,591
Yeah, for the moment,
but the connection's intermittent.

413
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:31,737
Fargo is your brilliant plan?

414
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,074
<i>Hey, you're lucky to have me, Larry.</i>

415
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,339
I'm gonna take my chances flying solo.

416
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,245
Adios, muchachos!

417
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:43,126
<i>Good, I'd rather let the computer
defenses take care of you anyway.</i>

418
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,633
- What?
- what?

419
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:46,501
- What?
- <i>What?</i>

420
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:47,517
<i>Kidding.</i>

421
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:50,031
<i>We've contacted Mansfield
to call off the thermal cleaning</i>

422
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:52,031
<i>and shut down
the defenses in section three.</i>

423
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,370
<i>That's your best way out.</i>

424
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,303
I- I didn't say that.

425
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,657
- Well then, who did?
- Damn!

426
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,889
This thing's good.

427
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,969
The defense system captured
your voice to mislead them.

428
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,388
They can't hear us anymore.

429
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,604
Don't listen to me!

430
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,308
Fargo, you still there?

431
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,531
<i>Sure am. You're doing just great.</i>

432
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,360
<i>It's not far now, Tag.</i>

433
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,340
Only Jo calls me that.

434
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:18,497
That Zane seems
like a nice enough fella.

435
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:22,101
He and Jo make a handsome
couple, don't you think?

436
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,453
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

437
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,903
They're repulsive!

438
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,254
- The real Fargo would know that.
<i>- You'll never find your way out.</i>

439
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:33,005
<i>- Resistance is futile.</i>
- Oh, my God!

440
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,931
We're all gonna die.

441
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,699
Relax, mate.

442
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:39,806
He's fallen for one
of the classic blunders.

443
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:42,596
What's that?

444
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,959
Never go in against

445
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:45,653
an Australian

446
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,439
when death is on the line.

447
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:53,462
What are you doing?

448
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:57,656
I've tracked polar bear across
the arctic tundra in a blizzard.

449
00:23:58,423 --> 00:24:00,409
It's all about the intuition, mate.

450
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,526
This way!

451
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,517
- Didn't expect something like this.
- You just don't know Henry.

452
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:10,045
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would he shut down Global?

453
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,262
Why would he lock himself in a room
with Beverly when there's no way out?

454
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,463
Because there is a way out.

455
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:18,717
When I first brought Henry to Eureka,

456
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,595
I was working on a subatomic
reconstructive transport chamber.

457
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,604
- Do I really have to ask?
- Teleportation.

458
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:26,868
Basically, it rebuilds
a body to a new location

459
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:28,900
using essential DNA markers.

460
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,652
And one of the byproducts of the process

461
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:36,213
is the ability to filter out
contaminants or health hazards.

462
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,061
What, so if I go in when I'm sick
I come out healthy?

463
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:40,214
Exactly.

464
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:41,899
Oh, no.

465
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:47,960
Essentially, it could separate
Kevin from the akashic field. But...

466
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:51,292
Kevin's DNA has been
fundamentally altered.

467
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:53,495
Henry needs both profiles,

468
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,506
but he doesn't have access
to Kevin's original DNA profile.

469
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:59,008
So what happens if Kevin
goes through now?

470
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:06,575
- Is it me or is it getting hot in here?
- It's the building.

471
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,562
Microwave antipersonnel defense.

472
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:11,435
We gotta get out here
before our insides boil.

473
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,574
Oh, my God.

474
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,383
Fargo, open the door!

475
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,558
How do we shut it off?

476
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:26,244
I designed it. I didn't install it.

477
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,666
- You've gotta shut it down.
- We're trying.

478
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:33,432
It's anticipating every attack.

479
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,124
Then change tactics.

480
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,630
You've got a better idea, I'm all ears.

481
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,249
We have to provide a DNA profile
for the SRT to build on.

482
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:42,535
Okay.

483
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,009
Just mine?

484
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:49,725
No, I'll be doing this for each of us.

485
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,291
There we go.

486
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:54,757
So that's me.

487
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:56,831
- That's you.
- Yeah, you can hardly see

488
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:58,943
the cloven hooves and horns.

489
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,642
You know, I'm really not
the devil, Allison.

490
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:04,769
If anything, I'm trying to protect Kevin
from people who might be.

491
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,919
- What people?
- The DOD, the CIA.

492
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,860
Come on, once they find out
what he can do, and they will,

493
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,842
he will be a lab rat
for the rest of his life.

494
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:14,770
Is that what you really want?

495
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,627
Do you want to do this or shall I?

496
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,803
<i>Attention. Intruder alert.</i>

497
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,393
<i>Attention.</i>

498
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:29,974
<i>Attention. Intruder alert.</i>

499
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,490
<i>Attention.</i>

500
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,458
<i>Attention. Intruder alert.</i>

501
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,063
Kevin, honey.

502
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,672
Remember the other night
when you read my mind?

503
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,522
- Yes.
- Can you do it to others?

504
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:50,202
Can you feel if there are
others coming to help us?

505
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:53,401
Yes. They're coming.

506
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,753
The computer's been lying to us.

507
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,337
What if we lie to it?

508
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:03,517
What do you mean?

509
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:05,442
Well, its goal is
to eliminate the threat.

510
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:07,119
So let's do it first.

511
00:27:07,382 --> 00:27:10,305
- You want us to kill them?
- Just make them appear dead.

512
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,063
Those are their vital signs, right?
The security system is picking them up?

513
00:27:14,183 --> 00:27:15,941
- Yeah, so?
- Can you change them?

514
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,913
Maybe we can.

515
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,501
You mean, if you make it think they're
already dead, it'll stop cooking them?

516
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:24,997
Let's hope.

517
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,865
I've got Dr. Stark's vitals ready.

518
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:31,243
- And I've got the Sheriff's.
- So do it.

519
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,370
Numbers dropping.

520
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,736
Approaching critical.

521
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:38,442
That's it!

522
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:40,844
As far as the computer
can tell, they're dead.

523
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:48,767
- It's not working.
- Give it a minute.

524
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:51,834
- They don't have a minute!
- Come on, come on, come on.

525
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,312
- Yes!
- Yes!

526
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,016
Oh, thank you Jo.

527
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,170
This doesn't mean
we're friends now, does it?

528
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,945
- Hell, no.
- Cool.

529
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:08,756
- You okay?
- Yeah.

530
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,788
Never buy another TV dinner, but-- yeah.

531
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:16,967
Come on.

532
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,364
Access to the panic room
is right down here.

533
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:28,604
Nice invention.

534
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:31,764
It's time.

535
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,569
Henry, how can you ask me
to do this? He's my son.

536
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,849
I'm asking you because he's your son.

537
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:41,187
It's the only way. For him.

538
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:52,141
Don't worry, Kevin.
Everything's gonna be okay.

539
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:53,950
Not for everyone.

540
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,459
I know this is unbelievably hard,

541
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,443
but you're making the right choice.

542
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,089
I know I am.

543
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,678
That was the wrong choice.

544
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,532
Stay away from him, you bitch!

545
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,577
You have no idea
what you're sacrificing.

546
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:38,125
I know what I'm not sacrificing--
my son.

547
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:41,529
Allison, wait!

548
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,276
Henry, you push that button,
and I will kill you.

549
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,724
Let me explain.

550
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,397
Why would I trust
anything you have to say?

551
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:49,862
Mom, wait.

552
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:51,928
Listen to him.

553
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,509
Please.

554
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,863
Could we get any closer?

555
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,845
Room stops 100 feet below
the lowest level of Global.

556
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:09,084
We'll have to climb
the rest of the way down.

557
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,611
Yeah, you should probably
let me go first.

558
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:12,759
Why?

559
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:15,165
Heights make me nauseous.

560
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:18,767
After you.

561
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:36,555
Gotcha.

562
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,917
I'm not working with Beverly.
There is no flesh-eating bacteria.

563
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,990
I reprogrammed GD's security sensors
into thinking there was.

564
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:44,207
- Why?
- I knew you

565
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,253
tried to separate
Kevin from the akashic field.

566
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,454
I realized when I saw
the alchemy formula

567
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:50,315
that the SRT Chamber
was the way to do it.

568
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:51,767
Why didn't you say something?

569
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,446
I tried, but you and Nathan
froze me out.

570
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,579
You didn't trust me.

571
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:11,878
Almost there, Carter.

572
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,007
I never thought I'd be so relieved to
get to the bottom of an elevator shaft.

573
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:17,917
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

574
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,136
I'll feel better when we get inside.

575
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,312
Hey, Carter,
I just want you to know I...

576
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,561
I appreciate everything you've done.

577
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,133
Let's do this.

578
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:39,554
Only two more firewalls and
we're in control of the whole system.

579
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:48,456
For years I've wondered
what goes on inside of his head.

580
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,903
Is it what you hoped for?

581
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:54,229
Better.

582
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:58,384
I know that he's happy,
and that's all I've ever wanted.

583
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,443
Henry, if this works,

584
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,554
will he be like he is now, or...

585
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:08,559
how he used to be?

586
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,062
His autism is likely to return.

587
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:13,522
<i>I'll be fine, Mom.</i>

588
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,399
Don't be disappointed.

589
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,602
Honey, it's okay.

590
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:25,322
All I care about is that you're safe.

591
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:28,807
See you in a minute.

592
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,422
Don't do it, Henry.

593
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:40,152
We have all the knowledge
of the universe at our fingertips.

594
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,779
It could be centuries before
someone else connects to the field.

595
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,562
Think about what this means, Henry.

596
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,141
- What we could learn.
- It's like you said.

597
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,911
We aren't ready.

598
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,312
I can't let you do this.

599
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,773
Or what, you'll do to me
what you did to Kim?

600
00:32:57,421 --> 00:32:59,026
If that's what it takes.

601
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:02,556
Drop it!

602
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,305
Henry, not you!

603
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,288
- This could save him.
- It will kill him.

604
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:12,713
You don't have all the data.

605
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:14,459
What are you talking about? What data?

606
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,022
His kb-201 file.

607
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,444
It has his original DNA.

608
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:21,048
You need both profiles. Which I would've
told you if you'd bother to come to me.

609
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,678
I did, and you refused my help.

610
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,843
This is how you fix it?
Put innocent lives at risk?

611
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,970
And she's how you decide to fix it?

612
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,972
All right, this stops now!

613
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,314
Everybody just...

614
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,227
Take a breath. This is over.

615
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:36,948
No, Carter, it's not.

616
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:40,901
Kevin will die if I don't do this now.
I've been tracking his mutations.

617
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:44,279
The Akashic Field takes over his brain.
The only thing Henry's right about

618
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,615
is that the SRT is the way
to separate him from it.

619
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,456
This is your call.

620
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,515
Allie, pull up the file.

621
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:09,929
You all are about to make
a mistake of biblical proportions.

622
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,064
Wouldn't be the first time.

623
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:25,398
I've recalibrated the destination
coordinates right back to this room.

624
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:26,613
The markers are set.

625
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:29,991
Let's do this.

626
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,378
<i>Three...</i>

627
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,541
- <i>I love you, baby.</i>
- <i>Two...</i>

628
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,792
I love you too, mom.

629
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:42,086
<i>One.</i>

630
00:34:57,572 --> 00:34:59,158
He should be right here.

631
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,647
Where is my son?

632
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,902
Allie, his body may not
have been able to process--

633
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,215
No, baby!

634
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:22,251
<i>Mom?</i>

635
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,129
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

636
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:34,381
Oh, are you okay?

637
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:35,939
Get a blanket.

638
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:38,163
Here.

639
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:50,112
We gotta shut this down or
there's gonna be a thermal cleaning.

640
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:53,198
I can't, something's
overriding my control.

641
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,158
Take that!

642
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:57,438
General, you have to believe me.
The virus is a fake.

643
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,213
And there are people inside
who will die if you do this.

644
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:01,922
<i>You are asking me to trust you</i>

645
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:04,835
<i>over the most sophisticated
computer system in the world.</i>

646
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,129
I'm asking you to trust all of us.

647
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,215
- Only one firewall left.
- <i>Oh, I want to, Deputy.</i>

648
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,328
<i>But there are strict protocols in place.</i>

649
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:14,970
<i>As a soldier,
you should appreciate that.</i>

650
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,667
Great leaders know in combat

651
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:19,161
you sometimes have to break protocols,

652
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:20,418
Sir.

653
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:22,811
You of all people
should appreciate that.

654
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:27,389
It just doesn't make sense.

655
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,235
It's like someone on the outside is--

656
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,781
I'm giving her all she's got, General.

657
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,744
Boo ya! Last wall down!

658
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,340
That's it! Resetting the system now.

659
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,378
Yes!

660
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:52,880
<i>Way to stick to your guns, Deputy.</i>

661
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:55,468
<i>Well done.</i>

662
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,295
Thank you, Sir.

663
00:36:58,401 --> 00:36:59,754
You were amazing.

664
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:01,098
Thank you.

665
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:03,664
Ready to get back to your party again?

666
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:05,186
- I really am.
- Yeah.

667
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:09,117
- Not bad.
- Not bad yourself.

668
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:19,826
You did great.

669
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,277
System's reset. Nice work, Fargo.

670
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,491
<i>SRT transfer sequence initialised.</i>

671
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,172
- Beverly, no!
- What the hell?

672
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,945
Damnit, her DNA's already
programmed in the system.

673
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,488
She reprogrammed the coordinates.
She could be anywhere now.

674
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,777
- She'll be found.
- No,

675
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:56,501
she won't.

676
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,743
And... it doesn't matter now.

677
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:02,346
Holy crap.

678
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:03,877
I did it!

679
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,285
Thank you!

680
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:07,076
Oh, thank you.

681
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:17,350
Dr. Blake.

682
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:21,474
- You all right?
- Yes, Sir.

683
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,559
With everyone's help here.

684
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,600
- Where's Beverly Barlowe?
- She's dead.

685
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:28,829
Not much left.

686
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:32,291
And we'll deal with this internally.

687
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:39,589
I would love to know
who's responsible for all this.

688
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,596
I am.

689
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:57,799
How's Kevin?

690
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,610
Well, he slept till noon,

691
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,822
but he's back to his old self.
Thanks to you.

692
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:05,782
I promised you I'd take care of him.

693
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,951
I'll never be able
to thank you enough, Nathan.

694
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,238
I don't want your thanks, Allie.

695
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:12,956
I want you.

696
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:16,549
I almost lost you both.

697
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:20,213
and I'm tired of pretending
that I'm okay

698
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,505
with us being apart. I'm not.

699
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:25,385
- Nathan--
- You and Kevin are my family.

700
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:32,308
and I won't be happy
until we're together.

701
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,965
Marry me, Allie.

702
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:40,400
Again.

703
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:54,998
Ready?

704
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:57,516
As you can see,
my escort's already here.

705
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,739
Just putting
the last few things in order.

706
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:04,815
Is there anything I can do?

707
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:08,299
No, I mean, they have to do what
they have to do, cause I did what I did.

708
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,555
and I'm willing to pay the price for it.

709
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:12,071
Good.

710
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:16,075
You ended up saving Kevin's life.
They'll take that into consideration.

711
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,672
But that's not for us to decide,
remember?

712
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:20,465
No,

713
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:21,440
it's not.

714
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:24,427
Sir, it's time.

715
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,638
Well, you're not alone.

716
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,470
You've friends.

717
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:32,910
Sir.

718
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,025
Right this way.
