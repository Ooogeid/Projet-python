1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,940
come on,zoe.

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,550
just a minute.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,240
This is obstruction of justice.

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,150
How do you figure?

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,340
You're making me late for work.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,500
So you're justice?

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,620
Yeah,I'm justice.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,880
Sheriff,do you need your coffee?

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,000
What do you think?

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,850
Pouring now.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,340
Hurry up,zoey.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,280
S.A.R.A.,If this is the house of the future,how come there's only one bathroom?

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,310
Is there a shortage of bathrooms in the future?

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,590
where is it?

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,220
Where's what?

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,230
Your hair.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,250
Where's my hair?

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,270
You,um-- what did you do to it?

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,720
Let me guess.You don't like it.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,510
No,I didn't say that.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,770
So you do like it.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,910
I didn't say that either.

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,930
Figures.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,160
Now,come on...

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,080
I mean,did it even occur to you to ask me?

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,410
You always say no.

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,230
No,I don'T.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,210
So if I would've asked you,you would've said yes?

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,830
We would've discussed it.

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,840
And then you would've said no.

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,750
That's not the point.

32
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,070
Okay,I gotta go to school.

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,290
We're not done discussing this.

34
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,030
And don't forget you've a therapy session with beverly today.

35
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,440
About that,look-- no about that.We had a deal.

36
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,650
Well,I want to renegotiate.

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,810
Well,you should've thought of that before you set your head on fire.You're going.

38
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,290
Fine.

39
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,410
And wear a hat.

40
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,490
Judging by those dark circles,I'd say iron deficiency.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,200
Mmm,more like sleep deficiency.

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,690
This dark's killing me.

43
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,000
Well,this will pep you up.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,570
Eggs-odus over easy with spinach and ginseng reduction.

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,620
Eggs-oxus of cnidas?

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,530
The greek astronomer?

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Honestly,I don't know why I bother.

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,160
Oh,my god.

49
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,230
Callister raynes?

50
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,070
Hello,vincent.

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,180
I thought you dropped off the face of the planet.

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,180
Close enough.

53
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,220
so what brings you back?

54
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,340
Guess I was feeling a little homesick.

55
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,850
Have you seen her yet?

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,790
Who?

57
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,740
Please.You know exactly who I'm talking about.

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,290
Jo.

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,370
Not yet.

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,650
You think she's still mad?

61
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,080
Well,she's still jo,so...

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,610
Listen,callister-- for what it's worth,I never believed you were responsible.

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,240
And I don't think jo did either.

64
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,840
But you probably don't want to talk about that right now.

65
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,090
What about stark?Does he know you're here?

66
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,040
Any minute now.

67
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,750
ladies,gentlemen,distinguished colleagues--

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,010
thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to join me here today.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,660
But I assure you--

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,090
dr.Stark,I need to talk to you.

71
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,790
Excuse me for a moment.

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,790
I swear to god,fargo.The world better be on fire.

73
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,090
Actually...

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
pretty close.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm sorry,but something's come up that demands my immediate attention.

76
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,140
We'll have to continue this at a later time.

Proudly Presents

79
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,580
Hey,george jetson,how's it going?

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Looks like some kind of program error fried one of the chips.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,660
You're gonna have to give me a minute to put in a new one.

82
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,110
All right,well,hurry up.

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,920
Traffic cop is so not in my job description.

84
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,880
You must not have read the fine print.

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,440
But on the bright side,the orange really brings out your eyes.

86
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,490
Enjoying yourself?

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,870
You have no idea.

88
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,520
So?

89
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,540
Oh,um-- jo's filling out the security reports as we speak.

90
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,830
That's what you said yesterday.

91
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,920
Because that's what she told me yesterday.

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,920
Hey,stop'n slow!

93
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,490
All set.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,990
Let me know if it gives you any more trouble.

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,380
Thanks,henry.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,820
So,come on,I'll let you buy me a cup of coffee.

97
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,370
It's free.

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,530
Well,in that case.I'll buy.

99
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,740
Okay.

100
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,680
I think this could be our thing.

101
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,560
Don't push it,traffic boy.

102
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,130
We don't have a thing.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,910
It's freezing in here.

104
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,600
Here.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,590
Take that.

106
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,170
That's much better.

107
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,250
Are you enjoying yourself?
I have no idea.

108
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,410
Sorry,guys.The cpu's out on the thermostat.

109
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,870
Just roll with it.

110
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,900
Um,buttered rum,malt cider,hot toddy?

111
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,910
Is that christmas music?

112
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,060
I said just roll with it.

113
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,450
Okay.

114
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,740
So,admit it.

115
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,080
We have a thing.

116
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,720
You got to be kidding me.

117
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,220
Uh,ouch,all right.

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,740
Not you.

119
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,150
Him.

120
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,450
callister raynes in the flesh.

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,220
Just strolls in here this morning like nothing ever happened.

122
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
Who's callister raynes?

123
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,300
He's a computer programmer that nathan brought in for a classified project.

124
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,890
Brilliant kid.Everyone loved him.

125
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,110
I'm sensing a "but.

126
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,380
" But the two of them had a falling out.

127
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,480
A week later,nathan's lab was destroyed by a fire.

128
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,840
Callister was the prime suspect.

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,290
Uh-oh,show time.

130
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,720
Jo,those reports aren't gonna write themselves.

131
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,720
You've no idea.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,460
This is--

133
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,490
hey,jo.

134
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,490
I was just about to stop by and see if you--

135
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,520
that's for coming back.

136
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,060
And that's for leaving.

137
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm back to those reports.

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,900
No rush.

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
They've a history.

140
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,450
I gathered.

141
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,370
What?

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,920
Taking the christmas theme a bit far,don't you think?

143
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,990
This isn't my doing.

144
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,920
Callister raynes,right?

145
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes.

146
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,390
I don't think we've been formally introduced.

147
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm jack carter.

148
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,560
I'm the new sheriff.

149
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,010
How are you doing?

150
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,340
Did you need something,sheriff?

151
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,410
I was just stopping to see if you were okay.

152
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,170
Oh,right.

153
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,550
I'll be fine.

154
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,050
Where you headed?

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm going to beverly'S.

156
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,060
Really?

157
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,780
Because that's back that way.

158
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,710
Right.

159
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,870
Of course.

160
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,870
Here,hop in.I'll give you a lift.

161
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,350
No,I like to walk.

162
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,110
Seriously?

163
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,720
s2 to s1.Repeat.S2 to s1.Over.

164
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,490
Jo,it's just you and me.

165
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,600
You can feel free to be a little less formal.

166
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,080
Over.

167
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,010
There's an electrical problem at osborn's farm on the way into town.Over.

168
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,060
See,was that so hard?

169
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,950
You didn't say "over.

170
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,630
" I know.It's gonna bug her all day long.

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,930
I heard you were back.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,250
Figured you'd find your way here sooner or later.

173
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,900
I was curious how much you kept.

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,610
I probably should've destroyed it all after you left.

175
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,690
But,uh...

176
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,210
I couldn'T.

177
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,880
I didn't realize you were so sentimental.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,310
You can't be here,callister.

179
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,740
We can't risk it.

180
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,390
I know.

181
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,070
Then why did you come back?

182
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,640
Because something is very wrong.

183
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,540
when you're done with the communicate,you're supposed to say "over.

184
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,370
" Uh,forgot.Sorry.

185
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,150
Not gonna hit me,are you?

186
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,100
What happened between callister and me was private.

187
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,270
Yeah,I gathered that from the way you handled it so discreetly in that very public caf?

188
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,870
Yeah.

189
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,000
So,what's the problem here?

190
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,100
Osborn said he had a power surge this morning.

191
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,420
And his electrical fence is not functioning.

192
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,910
Would a fence like this run off a computer?

193
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,080
Almost everything in eureka does.

194
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,970
Why?

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,370
Well,I think I feel a hunch coming on.

196
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,480
Come on!

197
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,710
Jo.

198
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,880
Yeah?

199
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,010
Could've told me it was magnetized.

200
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,070
Oh,I forgot.

201
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,180
Sorry.

202
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,920
Jo!

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,090
I'll go see if I can shut it down.

204
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh,good.

205
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,000
I was worried everyone wouldn't get a chance to see this.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,370
Hey,allison.

207
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,550
Um,what are you doing here?

208
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,330
Uh,I heard there was another glitch.

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,330
Yeah,yeah-- got it under control.

210
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,560
So I'll catch you up on it later.

211
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,160
What are you hiding?

212
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,650
Nothing.

213
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,450
No,no-- allison,don't!

214
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,300
hi.

215
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,600
Hi.

216
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,330
The fence is,um,magnetized.

217
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,120
Yeah,I see that.

218
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,370
You know what?I think I can,um...

219
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,630
what are-- what are you doing?

220
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm just trying to-- stop it.

221
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,040
But I can-- let me just-- oh.

222
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,790
I'm trying to shut it off.

223
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,470
Uh-- jo,jo,the-- is trying to shut off the fence.

224
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,990
Oh,okay.

225
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,120
So,how are you?
Fine.You?

226
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,500
Good.

227
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,150
Good.

228
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,540
So these glitches are becoming a little worrisome.

229
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,660
How so?

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,870
Well,you know.

231
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,770
Three today.

232
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,270
Two's a coincidence.Three's a pattern.

233
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,870
oh,I can--

234
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,390
thanks.

235
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,470
It was my pleasure.

236
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,530
Uh,guys...

237
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,750
I shut the fence down a while ago.

238
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,410
Um,I'm gonna,um-- okay,yeah.

239
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,520
Central processing unit from the computer that regulates the fence.

240
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,070
It's fried.

241
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,150
Thanks,jo.

242
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,500
Allison!

243
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
Wait up.

244
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,180
Uh,you might want to come to henry'S.

245
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,660
I have a feeling you're gonna want to hear this.

246
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,290
How long?

247
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
A few weeks.

248
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,420
Maybe more.

249
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,340
How bad?

250
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,030
I've been losing control.

251
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,940
It's getting worse.

252
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,940
Okay,I want you to stay here.

253
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,490
No.

254
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,910
I didn't come all the way back to be left alone.

255
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,250
It is too dangerous for you to be wandering around town.

256
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,950
Dangerous for who?

257
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,800
Listen to me.

258
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,450
I'm not going through all that again.

259
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,600
Not after everything I sacrificed to help you leave.

260
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,130
You're not the only one who sacrificed.

261
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,210
I'll be back as soon as I can.

262
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,720
There's your problem.

263
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,700
That's what's been messing up everything on the internet.

264
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,660
Is this our glitch?

265
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,700
Glitch?No,that's a virus.

266
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,490
You guys should've switched to macs.

267
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,100
It's a little bit more complicated than that.

268
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,120
You see,eureka has its own operating system.

269
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,000
One that's unlike any in the world.

270
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,440
Viruses don't just happen.

271
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,240
They have to be written by someone who is intimately familiar with the operating system.

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,070
Like,oh...

273
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,430
say a computer programmer who used to live in eureka?

274
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,570
Point taken.Henry,how dangerous is this?

275
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,160
Well,the entire system is run on a wireless internet.

276
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,760
The traffic light,the ac,the electric fence.

277
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,750
if the virus isn't stopped,whoever's behind it may be able to get access to something more dangerous than traffic lights.

278
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,100
All right,how do you want to deal with this?

279
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,960
Why don't you talk to stark?

280
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,160
See if callister contacted him.And what he knows about the virus.

281
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,990
Jo.

282
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,720
Carter,please.I'm almost done,okay?

283
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,120
It's not the security checks.

284
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,360
I need the file on the fire that callister was accused of setting.

285
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,250
He wasn't accused.

286
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,560
He was suspected and we cleared him.

287
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,650
Well,maybe he wasn't involved with what happened then.

288
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,260
But I'm pretty sure he's involved with what's happening now.

289
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,540
Carter,I know this is gonna sound weird,especially coming from me.

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,560
But he's not like that.

291
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,270
And I hope that you're right.

292
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,920
But you know as well as I do that I can't stop an investigation just because you're involved with some guy.

293
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,910
I wouldn't ask you to.

294
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,880
I just thought you might want my opinion.

295
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,600
Jo...

296
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,710
I gotta get back to these reports.

297
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,330
Hey.

298
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh,hello.

299
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,070
Guest or patient?

300
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,910
Excuse me?

301
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,190
Are you a guest or patient?

302
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,990
I have a room here,if that's what you mean.

303
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,300
Yes,but is it padded?

304
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,030
I'm a guest.

305
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,190
Cool.

306
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,040
Patient.

307
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,970
Not like I'm crazy or anything.

308
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,410
Actually,my dad's making me go here.

309
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,210
Apparently,I have "issues" with "authority.

310
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,370
" And "listening," and...

311
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,560
I don't know.Other stuff.

312
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,150
I wasn't really paying attention,so...

313
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,050
you two don't get along?

314
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,030
He thinks I'm a delinquent.

315
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm just a product of my environment.

316
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,920
Believe me,I know that feeling.

317
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,880
I'm callister.

318
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,140
Zoe.

319
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,090
Nice to meet you,zoe.

320
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,320
I like your hair.

321
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,750
Thank you,callister.

322
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,670
Thank you,duncan.

323
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,840
I was able to reschedule the demonstration for 3:00.

324
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,730
Good,because you're gonna be running it.

325
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,600
What?Why?

326
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm taking the rest of the day off.

327
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,130
Well,that's got to be a first.

328
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,830
Allison.

329
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,210
Fargo,give us a minute.

330
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,360
Did you know callister raynes was coming back?

331
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,440
I didn't even know he was here.

332
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,640
Really?

333
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,330
So he hasn't contacted you.

334
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,060
I think that was implied by my first answer.

335
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,620
Now,if you'll excuse me,allison.

336
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,900
Are you all right?

337
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm just feeling a little under the weather.

338
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,290
You haven't taken a sick day since I've known you.

339
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,920
You always told me to take better care of myself.

340
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,770
There's a virus on the internet,nathan.

341
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,230
Really?

342
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,290
Eureka has a virus.

343
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,370
Okay,I'll take care of it.

344
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Right now,I've got to go.

345
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,620
Nathan,what is going on,really?

346
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,010
Nothing is going on,all right?

347
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,520
Really.

348
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,870
I'll take care of the virus.

349
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,780
well,this inventory list doesn't make any sense.

350
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,650
I mean,you can't tell me that in stark's top secret lab all they had was the standard stuff listed here.

351
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,060
It was a fire.

352
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,970
Probably burned.

353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,470
Well,that's exactly my point.

354
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,810
Anything lost in a fire has got to be documented as destroyed.

355
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,280
Unless it's classified.

356
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,720
That's a good point.

357
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,130
Can you run callister's name through your security check?

358
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,950
Fine.

359
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
But you're not gonna find anything.

360
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,500
Nothing came up.

361
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,400
It's worth a shot.

362
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,210
No,I mean nothing came up.

363
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,300
It's like somebody's gone in here and erased all his records.

364
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,980
Hold on.I'm getting a fax.

365
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,020
This guy isn't who he says he is.

366
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,000
He's been lying about everything.

367
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,860
Someone's been lying,all right.

368
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,940
Son of a bitch!

369
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,310
Hello.

370
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,620
I'm sorry I'm late.

371
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,720
Zoe,you look,um,lovely.

372
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,820
Thank you.

373
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,060
Your room is all ready,callister.

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,120
If you need anything else,you just let me know.

375
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,790
The lies stop right here,right now.

376
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,860
I know what you did.

377
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,810
Identity theft.

378
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,610
Credit card fraud.

379
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,040
What the hell were you thinking?

380
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,880
Look,the credit card company will cover it.

381
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,860
The most she's gonna have to pay is like,50 bucks.

382
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,610
That's not the point.

383
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,050
Adjeet,um...

384
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,930
ghandahavi shouldn't have to pay a penny for you.

385
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,900
I'll pay her back.

386
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,420
I thought we were past this.

387
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,890
We-- I am.

388
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,410
Look,that was from before I even came here.

389
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,500
Exactly!

390
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,710
And when you showed up,what did I say?

391
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,240
Look at me!What did you promise me?

392
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,120
No more secrets.

393
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,280
Exactly.

394
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,740
When you showed up,it was all cards on the table.

395
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,020
No secrets.That was our deal.

396
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,560
And yet you sat there and lied to my face.

397
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,180
And for what?

398
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,460
Shopping spree,a trip to bermuda,some online gambling-- what was it?

399
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,650
What was it that-- I bought a bus ticket!

400
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,510
To eureka.

401
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,710
You had to steal it?

402
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,310
Huh?You couldn't come to me for help?

403
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,770
Yeah,right.

404
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,210
Don't do that.

405
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,510
That's not fail.

406
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,910
I haven't always been the world's greatest dad.

407
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,830
But I've always been there for you when you needed help.

408
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,850
Oh,so you're saying that if I said I wanted to come live here,you would just make it happen.

409
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,100
Of course!

410
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,630
Well,I guess we're both liars now.

411
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,390
I can't do this anymore.

412
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm done,zoe.

413
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,280
Dad-- done!

414
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,080
Not a word.

415
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,730
Is he always that angry?

416
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,640
We're working on it.

417
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,450
It's all right.

418
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,070
Callister.

419
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,290
Damn it.

420
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,290
Hit me.

421
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,950
I'm cutting you off.

422
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,570
I think three's your limit.

423
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,680
I don't pay you to think,I pay you to pour.

424
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,870
Actually,you don't pay me at all.

425
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,560
What's going on,zoe?

426
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,790
Oh,I don't know.

427
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,140
My dad hates me.

428
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,570
Why,what did you do?

429
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,640
See,now why do you automatically assume that it's my fault?

430
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,990
Is it?

431
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,690
No.

432
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,840
Okay-- yes.

433
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,930
But not the point.

434
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,480
I screwed up.

435
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,200
Bad.

436
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,540
And now he's sending me back to L.A.

437
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,550
He said that?

438
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,230
Yes.

439
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,440
Okay,no.

440
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,880
But I can read between the lines.

441
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,160
He said he was done with me.

442
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,330
Zoe,he's not going to send you away.

443
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,290
You're right.

444
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,830
And you know why?

445
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,500
Because I'm not going to let him.

446
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,620
Good for you.

447
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,910
Bye,vince.

448
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,880
Carter,where the hell have you been?

449
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
I don't want to talk about it.

450
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,180
Are you okay?

451
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,550
Yeah,um...

452
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,310
could we just work now?

453
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,100
Really want to work.

454
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,920
All right.

455
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,770
Get anything from stark?

456
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,620
Not really.He said he didn't even know callister was here.

457
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,420
What happened when you mentioned the virus?

458
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,400
He gave me this weird look.And then he just ran off.

459
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,730
That's not at all suspicious.

460
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,140
Yeah.

461
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,290
And you'd think he'd be worried about the effects on global.

462
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,280
Well,maybe he's more worried about something else.

463
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,060
Or someone else,okay.

464
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,180
This is the case file from the fire.

465
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,510
I've been over it a dozen times.

466
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,030
And everything in it,everything,points to callister torching stark's lab.

467
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,960
But stark insists that it was faulty wiring.

468
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,320
So you think that he was protecting callister?

469
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,490
I think he still is.

470
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,000
Callister.

471
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,290
Nathan?
Where is he?

472
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,080
Is everything okay?

473
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,790
I know he's here.Where is he?

474
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,720
He's upstairs.I'll go get--

475
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,620
nathan,what's going on?

476
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,460
Callister!

477
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,300
what did you think you were gonna do?

478
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Get out of the house.

479
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,880
oh,my-- nathan,what-- get out of the house now.

480
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,060
Oh,my god.

481
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,010
nathan!

482
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,330
Nathan!

483
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,110
nathan,wait.

484
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,740
Oh,my god.

485
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
Callister,what did you do?

486
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,280
I didn't mean to.

487
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,030
Beverly,are you okay?

488
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,040
I'm fine.

489
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,000
But look at my house.

490
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,040
What happened?

491
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,640
I don't know.Stark came in,screaming for callister.

492
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,940
Next thing I know,the whole place is on fire.

493
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,010
Where are they now?

494
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,420
They left.

495
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,940
I think callister got burned.

496
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,930
Okay.

497
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,530
Henry.

498
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,540
Where's the hydrant and I'll help you hook it up.

499
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,420
Carter,this is eureka.

500
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,600
Beverly,is everybody out?

501
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,720
Yes.

502
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,180
Clear!

503
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,910
Right.

504
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,110
Eureka.

505
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:49,140
As you can see,the nanotech composite has limited-- limitless capabilities for replication.

506
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,340
where are they,fargo?

507
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,020
If you'll excuse me for a moment,everyone.

508
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,770
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?

509
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,510
Where are they?

510
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,160
I honestly don't know.

511
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,440
Let me come at this another way.

512
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,440
Do you know where your sarah michelle gellar doll is?

513
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,920
Because I do.

514
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,430
And if I have to,I will go get it out of your desk.

515
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,860
And show it to those nice people.

516
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,660
Now,where do you think they are?

517
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,910
there's nathan's car.

518
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,060
You okay?

519
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,060
I don't know.Technically,I'm still married to nathan.

520
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,800
But right now,I have no idea who he even is.

521
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,510
Well,whatever's going on,if he's lying,I'm sure he has a reason.

522
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,340
What could that possibly be?

523
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,570
I don't know.

524
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,910
But I think we're about to find out.

525
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,330
oh,my god.

526
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,520
Stark,step aside!

527
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,150
Callister,put your hands in the air.

528
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,270
Carter,wait.
Quiet!

529
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,950
Callister,put your hands where I can see them.

530
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,240
Carter,listen to me.

531
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,620
Nathan-- allison,I can explain.

532
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,690
Carter,don't hurt him don't want to.

533
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,620
Callister,I don't want to shoot you.

534
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,430
Show me your hands.

535
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,110
I can'T.

536
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,410
Yes,you can.

537
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,830
Do as he says.

538
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,320
Okay.

539
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,640
Not where I thought this was going.

540
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,050
I didn't bring him here.

541
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,680
I built him here.

542
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,110
Callister's A.I.

543
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,300
So he's a robot.

544
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,160
An artificially intelligent being.

545
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,390
Then why keep him a secret?

546
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,850
I mean,this has to be one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern age.

547
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,800
So was the atomic bomb.

548
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,560
Doesn't mean the world is ready for it.

549
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,700
Truth is I needed to see if callister could assimilate.

550
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,900
So I introduced him to eureka as my assistant.

551
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,850
And they embraced him.

552
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,510
Callister formed attachments,developed relationships.

553
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,090
And you did too?

554
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,060
I wasn't about to let D.A.R.P.A. Turn him into another military project.

555
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,790
How is this possible?

556
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't know.

557
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,180
I had dozens of prototypes.

558
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,040
None of them worked.

559
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,730
Except for callister.

560
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,690
I still don't know why.

561
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,450
It's a miracle.

562
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,020
So he didn't burn down your lab.

563
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,630
You did.

564
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,400
I needed them to believe that the entire project had been destroyed.

565
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,200
But then sheriff cobb started asking a bunch of questions.

566
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,960
So I had to send him away.

567
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,290
But how is he connected to the virus?

568
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,200
Callister transmits on a wireless network.

569
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,930
I thought if I changed his primary microprocessor,I could fix it.

570
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,200
But his system's totally corrupted.

571
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,930
Nathan,I'm sorry.But you know he can't stay here.

572
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,190
That fire could've killed someone.

573
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,810
I know.

574
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,110
But I can't send him away.

575
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,330
Not again.

576
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,990
I don't think you'll have to.

577
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,970
Callister.

578
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,910
Hey.

579
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,880
Hey,zoe.

580
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,610
Uh,where you headed?

581
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,960
Anywhere but here.

582
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,690
Perfect.

583
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,610
Can I get a ride?

584
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,140
Well,come on.Let's get out of here.

585
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,630
Yeah.

586
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,050
Yeah,okay.

587
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,990
stolen,black,late model beemer 7 series.

588
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,330
License stark 1.

589
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,620
Yeah,I'll hold.

590
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,970
You okay?

591
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,320
It's just my luck,right?

592
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,930
All the good ones are either gay,married,or robots.

593
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,460
get anything?

594
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,980
No,and we looked everywhere.

595
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,720
How about you two?

596
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,190
yeah,I'm here.

597
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,110
How long ago?

598
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,860
Great.

599
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,030
Okay,if you find them,stop them and call me immediately.

600
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,270
Thanks.

601
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,200
Wait.

602
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,990
Them?

603
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,680
They found the car at a gas station off interstate 17.

604
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,040
The attendant said that there was a redheaded girl in the passenger seat.

605
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,720
It's zoe.

606
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,420
Callister.

607
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,290
It's okay.

608
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,330
Let's just go.

609
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,730
They wouldn't just ditch the car unless they had some other way of getting around.

610
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,600
They must be on some form of public transportation.

611
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,860
I've checked every airport,bus terminal,taxi service,and ferry within 50 miles.

612
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,960
There's nothing on callister raynes or zoe carter.

613
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,710
Try another name.

614
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,920
Try adjeet-- adjeet ghandavari.

615
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,860
Two tickets on an international stage line bus leaving out of summerville.

616
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,020
It departs in less than an hour.

617
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,110
Okay,you two stay here.

618
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,550
Stark,you're with me.

619
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,190
call if you hear anything.

620
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,940
Callister.

621
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
Are you okay?

622
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,310
Are you okay?

623
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,740
I didn't want to leave like this.

624
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,310
listen,carter...

625
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,330
I'm truly sorry zoe got wrapped up in this.

626
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,280
We're gonna find them.

627
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:26,300
Whatever you decide to do-- report me,arrest me,I completely understand.

628
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,330
As far as I'm concerned,the case is closed.

629
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,440
Project was lost in the fire.

630
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,670
Must think it's kind of crazy.

631
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,370
First guy running for a machine.

632
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:51,950
Callister just became so much more than that.

633
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,660
I don't expect you to understand.

634
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,870
I'm a father.

635
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,240
Of course I understand.

636
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,210
Hey,um...bus 72 to portland?

637
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,680
It pulled out a few minutes ago.

638
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,440
I told them to hold it.Where's the next stop?

639
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,290
Salem,downtown terminal.

640
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,340
What's this all about?

641
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,470
dad!

642
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,540
Zoe.

643
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,050
You okay?

644
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,180
I think he's sick callister?

645
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,160
callister?

646
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,720
Hey,nathan.

647
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,070
Let's get him back to the car.

648
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,530
Give us a second,will you?

649
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,960
You didn't leave.

650
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,320
I knew he needed help.

651
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Where were you going?

652
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,550
Anywhere but here.

653
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,220
You were right before.

654
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:29,840
If you'd called and asked to come to eureka,I would've said no.

655
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:35,920
And I would've regretted it for the rest of my life.

656
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,670
You said you were done with me.

657
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,240
Zoe,you're my daughter.

658
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,170
And I will never,ever be done with you.

659
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,580
I messed everything up again,didn't I?

660
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,320
No.

661
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,420
It's my fault.

662
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,570
I should've never sent you away in the first place.

663
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,430
I'm scared.

664
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm not ready.

665
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,500
I know.

666
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,030
What's gonna happen to me?

667
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,740
Remember what alan touring said?

668
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,780
He figured god could give a computer a soul if he wanted to.

669
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,360
Do you think that's true?

670
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,490
I know it is.

671
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,120
What are you doing here?

672
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,400
I was just on my way to school.

673
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,170
So...

674
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,040
I spoke to the credit card company.

675
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,700
And pulled some strings with my old boss.

676
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,140
You know you're going to have to pay back every penny,right?

677
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
I know.

678
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,840
I will.

679
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,620
Okay.

680
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,430
Okay.

681
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,960
Zoe...

682
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,540
I was wrong about your hair.

683
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,340
I like it.

684
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,130
Really?

685
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,860
Because I think I'm going back to blonde.

686
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,110
Oh,thank god.
