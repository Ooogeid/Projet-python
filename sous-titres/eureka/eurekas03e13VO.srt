1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:02,293
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:05,129
Sheriff Jack Carter, Tess Fontana.
Tess and I are old friends.

3
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:06,897
She's the new head of Section Five.

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:08,549
It was a radio signal.

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:09,800
Man-made?

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,219
I mean, we don't have
anything out that far.

7
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:15,271
There's something out there,
and it's heading straight for us.

8
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,351
General Mansfield is concerned
that the signal may not be friendly.

9
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:21,348
He's ordered me
to prepare a defense system.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,739
Why does morning
have to start so early?

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,907
Because someone stays up too late.

12
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,993
I didn't.
But I had the weirdest dreams.

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,163
Like, when you're trying to finish
a test and you're running out of time?

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,574
I usually dream about baseball
or Global catastrophe...

15
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:44,806
or cake.

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,146
10:00 and 2:00, keep your hands.

17
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,841
That make you nervous?

18
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:55,530
What about this?
Or this?

19
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,040
- What is your problem?!
- Relax!

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,142
They're upgrading the network.

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,561
The roads.

22
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:04,980
Self-driving.

23
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,024
Do you even read your e-mail?

24
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,737
Sometimes.

25
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,553
SmartAsphalt.

26
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:13,403
Do... I beg your pardon.

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,680
The roads... they're wired
to make the traffic super efficient.

28
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,912
- It's called "SmartAsphalt. "
- Of course it is.

29
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,745
They're connecting the cars
to the roads,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,090
the system can basically
drive for you.

31
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,242
<i>Sheriff's office.</i>

32
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,967
See, we're here, and I didn't
even have to do anything.

33
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,012
Yeah, another victory
for total laziness.

34
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,182
Isn't it awesome?
I can sleep all the way to school.

35
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:44,228
Yeah, that's what the world needs,
is more people asleep at the wheel.

36
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,814
Do you have to suck the fun
out of everything?

37
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:53,446
- Tesla High, please. Take your time.
- <i>Destination entered.</i>

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,553
Automatic driving...
it's a bad idea.

39
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,978
Anything's better
than a teenager driving.

40
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:05,870
But don't worry, it'll take Henry
a while to get all the cars online.

41
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,178
Tell him to skip me.

42
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,389
I prefer to be driving
when I'm driving.

43
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:13,982
Amen. Especially when you're driving
something as sweet as...

44
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:15,477
this.

45
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,345
This is yours?

46
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:22,441
265 horsepower,
track tune suspension,

47
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,286
and all-wheel drive.

48
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,507
Totally high-performance,
but completely under my control.

49
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:30,933
Kind of like Zane.

50
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:34,591
- What about my new car?
- With your driving record,

51
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:35,905
good luck.

52
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,783
I went through requisition hell
to get this.

53
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,243
I cced you on everything.
Don't you read your e-mails?

54
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,475
Yes.
Sometimes.

55
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,685
Looky here.
Hot wheels, Jo.

56
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,628
Thanks.
Six weeks on the wait list.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,927
Small price to pay for awesomeness.

58
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,966
<i>Congratulations on your new vehicle,
Deputy Lupo.</i>

59
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,595
<i>The Subaru Impreza WRX
is an excellent choice.</i>

60
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:03,389
Thank you, Tabitha.
You're looking pretty good yourself.

61
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,647
You guys are okay?

62
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,484
Yeah, it's just experimenting and...

63
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:16,486
Come on, Tabby,
don't do this to me again.

64
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:19,100
- People are watching.
- <i>I'm doing my best, Douglas.</i>

65
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,138
Let's go.

66
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,927
I hate it when couples
bicker in public.

67
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:29,624
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,043
She drives like a rocket.

69
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,088
I didn't hear anything
about a missile test today.

70
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,757
It's probably in your e-mail.

71
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,432
The test drive's gonna have to wait.

72
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,507
You know, where I come from,
it's considered polite to warn people

73
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,940
before you detonate a missile
above their heads.

74
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,461
Dr. Wyman has my permission

75
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:58,028
to conduct any tests
he deems necessary for his project.

76
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,947
But thanks for the etiquette tip.

77
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,173
- You heard the massive explosion.
- All right, please don't start.

78
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,579
Carter,
Dr. Wyman, planetary defense.

79
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,703
Hey, nice hoodie.

80
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:09,832
Jealous?

81
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,333
Dr. Wyman's missile malfunctioned,

82
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,003
so we followed normal safety protocols
and aborted the test.

83
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:17,569
Yeah, by blowing up
an A-311 booster,

84
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:20,237
which, by the way,
he wasn't even approved to use.

85
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,304
- So he stole a missile?
- Borrowed, from another project.

86
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,799
I left a note.

87
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:27,558
He has my authority
to use any and all resources.

88
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,852
- Yeah, but he put the town at risk.
- Dr. Blake told me to get results,

89
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,355
so I'm putting everything
in this thing.

90
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,185
Which is leading to mistakes.

91
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,153
First, the laser misalignment,
then the leaky antimatter energy cell.

92
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,864
Al, you're letting this guy
run wild.

93
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,458
I am doing what needs to be done.

94
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,611
Dr. Wyman, please continue your work
as quickly and safely as possible.

95
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,318
I need your system online.

96
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:57,296
So planetary defense...
do I even need to ask?

97
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,882
The signal that we've been
tracking is getting stronger.

98
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,052
- Meaning closer?
- Yes.

99
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:07,222
Whatever it is, it is going
to be here in 138 hours.

100
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,171
Five and a half days.

101
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,485
Do you need me to do anything?
Put out traffic cones, anything?

102
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,315
Yes, we should all be preparing
for its arrival.

103
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,817
- I am preparing.
- You're preparing for the worst.

104
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,546
You've got a dozen divisions
working on defense weaponry.

105
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,235
We are the only people in the world
with the technology to detect it.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,257
General Mansfield wants it kept that way
until we know what we're dealing with,

107
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,423
so we don't start a global panic.

108
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:31,913
This means being prepared...

109
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,292
for anything.

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,973
This doesn't sound good.

111
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,759
Sheriff's office. Can you hold, please?
Hi, thanks for waiting.

112
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,723
Why would someone wanna steal
your doorbell?

113
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,130
Busy?

114
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,924
No, I'm...
I'm not making fun.

115
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:54,453
Could you describe your doorbell?

116
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,692
What's Ranger Tom
calling six times about?

117
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,395
Somebody steal a tree?

118
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,172
I wrote it down.

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,863
"Something weird."

120
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,048
Okay, thanks.
Listen, he didn't go into detail.

121
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,371
The phone's been ringing off the hook.
Stuff's missing all over town.

122
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:17,297
Got a parking meter, a weather vane,

123
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,341
475 feet of Christmas lights...

124
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:23,674
And your desk chair.

125
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,261
You okay there, Sheriff?

126
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,609
I think I need a new chair.

127
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,051
You should try one
of those yoga balls.

128
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,286
Your back
will totally say thank you.

129
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,050
You wanna tell me
what you think is so weird?

130
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,073
Probably better I just show you.

131
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,864
Maybe the most disturbing thing...

132
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,128
it wasn't here yesterday.

133
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,631
That's my chair.

134
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,811
You don't see this every day.

135
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,493
Projet-SG (1.00)

136
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:39,879
This is amazing.

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,541
I never really got modern art.

138
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:45,047
It's not art.

139
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,425
This looks like the base structure
of a toroidal vacuum chamber.

140
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,096
You know, this could be the outline
for a magnetic mirror field.

141
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:58,343
But I mean, this looks
like a pile of crap.

142
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:02,272
A pile of crap that someone is
turning into a plasma generator.

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,524
A honking big one.

144
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,861
And generally speaking,
what does a plasma generator generate?

145
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,948
And don't say plasma.

146
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,158
Bursts of energy...
short and really intense.

147
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:15,576
The question is,
what's it designed to power?

148
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,996
I'll run some displacement scans.

149
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,290
Okay, let's do
an EV field analysis, too.

150
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,868
- Okay.
- Thanks.

151
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,524
So who do we know
that can build one of these things

152
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,759
out of a lava lamp
and a kitchen sink?

153
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,316
That really is a kitchen sink.

154
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,146
Can it power a weapon?

155
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,830
Sure could.

156
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:46,843
Well?

157
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:49,394
It looks like
a cracked engine block,

158
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,704
but let's see.

159
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,706
I'm a little backed up
with the SmartAsphalt sensor upgrade,

160
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,277
but I think I can have her fixed,
what, by the end of the week?

161
00:08:58,549 --> 00:08:59,566
I don't think so.

162
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:01,963
Fargo, she's okay.

163
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,430
I mean, Tabitha's AI
is in perfect condition.

164
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,712
She just needs a little TLC,
that's all.

165
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,630
Yeah, well, so do I.

166
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,077
<i>Maybe Dr. Deacon
could install massaging seats.</i>

167
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,409
That's not what...

168
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:16,402
Look, Tabby, we've had a good run,

169
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,848
but there's
a new problem every week.

170
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,600
This just isn't working anymore.
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,809
<i>He's just upset.</i>

172
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,791
<i>He'll be back.</i>

173
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:33,994
<i>Won't he?</i>

174
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,043
Afternoon, Deputy.
You like?

175
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:48,295
I waited six weeks.
How did you...

176
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,672
Pulled some strings
with my buddy in requisitions.

177
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:51,798
Awesome, huh?

178
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,509
Well, what happened to Tabitha?
I thought you loved that car.

179
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,743
Well, it was nice while it lasted,

180
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,724
but, you know, it's time to move on.

181
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:05,494
- So you just dumped her.
- I don't believe in long good-byes,

182
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,190
especially when something
this sweet comes along.

183
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:09,858
Men.

184
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,793
Besides, I found her someone new.

185
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,159
They're perfect for each other.

186
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:29,021
I don't think that it's possible
to build a working plasma generator

187
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,265
out of aluminum Christmas trees
and duct tape.

188
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,618
That's what it looks like to me,
and I'm pretty smart.

189
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:36,616
And if she's right, then it means
that someone at GD is building it.

190
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,685
Well, I checked the equipment list
for every lab in particle physics,

191
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,116
astrophysics, and condensed matter.

192
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,303
No project needs
a generator that powerful.

193
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, what about the department
of planetary defense?

194
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:50,366
Dr. Wyman has all the resources
that he needs for his work right here.

195
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,595
Why would he build a plasma generator
in the woods out of junk?

196
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,179
Maybe he likes to recycle.

197
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,617
That kind of device could be
a good power source

198
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,198
for a land-based energy beam.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,120
It could vaporize an incoming craft
if you were preparing for the worst.

200
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,687
I will talk to him, but I am telling you
that it is a waste of time.

201
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,930
And we don't have much of it left.

202
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,674
Looks like Wyman's not the only one
under a lot of pressure.

203
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,560
Tell me about it.

204
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,973
- Where are you going?
- They're still building it, right?

205
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,016
So someone's gonna want it finished.

206
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,226
Sorry.

207
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,202
Tabitha, what are you doing here?

208
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,581
<i>I guess Larry changed his mind.</i>

209
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,753
Oh, he did, did he?

210
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,052
<i>Be careful, Douglas.</i>

211
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:06,516
<i>When you're angry,
you often say things you regret.</i>

212
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,980
- Hey, hose clamp, not funny.
- What are you doing here?

213
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,390
- Conscience get the better of you?
- Conscience had nothing to do with it.

214
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,402
We had a deal. No take-backsies.

215
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,865
Thanks for picking her up for me,
but you sold me a bill of goods.

216
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:25,366
The stereo only plays '80s rock,
the AC smells like feet,

217
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,052
and it only drives in reverse.

218
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,206
What are you talking about?
She works fine for me.

219
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,999
You two should be
very happy together.

220
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,422
- I want my refund in cash.
- No way.

221
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,157
I moved on to greener pastures.

222
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,380
We had a deal.

223
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,365
She's your problem now.

224
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,104
Don't think this is over!

225
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,047
Stakeouts are fun.

226
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,114
They're more fun with pepperoni

227
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,304
than with organic tofu medley.

228
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,100
- You mean, "Thank you for the pizza"?
- That is thank you for the pizza.

229
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,377
You're welcome.

230
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,988
You want anything else?

231
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:38,718
I've got a protein bar, juice box,

232
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:43,613
- Funyuns.
- You always eat this much?

233
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,990
You always this smooth
with the ladies?

234
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:54,363
So when do you think Dr. Planetary
defense is gonna show up?

235
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,201
Actually, I don't.

236
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,184
Well, then why are we here?

237
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,883
I think somebody's building this thing,
but I don't think it's him.

238
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,045
Like Allison said,

239
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,071
he has all of Global's resources
at his disposal, so...

240
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,473
She could be protecting him, too.

241
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,892
She could be, but...

242
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:19,370
I don't know, but...

243
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,945
she's been under a lot
of stress lately, I think.

244
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,965
That's very considerate
of you, Carter.

245
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,826
No wonder she likes you so much.

246
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,086
You hear that?

247
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,919
He's my daughter's boyfriend.

248
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:55,977
He brought company.

249
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,525
This is who's building it...

250
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,442
a bunch of sleepwalking kids?

251
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,949
It's like they're all
in some sort of aphasic trance.

252
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:33,919
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

253
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,380
So the nurse come by?

254
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, yeah, she came by.

255
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,814
I don't think I have any blood left.

256
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:45,819
So they said
that I was building something?

257
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,492
You ready to tell me
what you remember?

258
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:59,207
I remember washing my face,
going to bed, and...

259
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,237
I woke up here.

260
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:10,257
Well, I'll have to help you
fill in some of the blanks.

261
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,097
I brought you here.

262
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,684
You fought me the whole way.

263
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:19,694
You were pretty upset.

264
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:23,857
And then you just fell asleep
in the car.

265
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:28,204
And I was really walking around
the woods with Lucas and everyone?

266
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,498
It was like...

267
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,534
<i>Village of the Damned.</i>

268
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,739
I mean, it could be
a lot of things, Jack.

269
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:44,778
I mean, a virus in the myelin sheath
has been known to affect the forebrain

270
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,577
- and cause group hallucinations.
- I've had a lot of viruses,

271
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,989
but none of them that ever made me
build junk towers in my sleep.

272
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:52,818
I don't know of any infectious agent

273
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,781
that could cause this kind
of coordinated obsession.

274
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,266
Well, could Dr. Suenos be involved?

275
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,428
Dr. Suenos has been doing research
on a zero-gravity mattress,

276
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,622
on a space station
for the last year.

277
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,523
Something's gotta be
affecting these kids.

278
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,862
It could be a thousand things
that affect brain chemistry...

279
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,533
a tuned microwave beam,
gamma radiation,

280
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:13,553
a radio signal.

281
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:16,534
Could any of those things have
anything to do with planetary defense?

282
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:20,413
Possibly. But, you know,
that's Allison's baby, and...

283
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,426
Yeah, so I'm... discovering.

284
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,786
Wait, one more thing...

285
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,619
brain scans on the kids.

286
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,422
I'm seeing
some unexplained activity.

287
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,509
Like dangerous activity?

288
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,970
Activity that I'm concerned about.

289
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,284
How's Zoe?

290
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,410
These kids are in a lot of trouble.

291
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,551
- Tell me it isn't one of your projects.
- Carter, of course it isn't.

292
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:04,860
- I would never put our kids at risk.
- No, not on purpose.

293
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,794
But around here, a lot of things
happen by accident.

294
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,004
Well, I'm about to fix the accident.

295
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,798
You order the wrecking crew?

296
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,113
I want these towers
completely dismantled.

297
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,179
- Hold up.
- Zane, it's okay.

298
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,600
- I told them to take them down.
- Sure.

299
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,235
A little antimatter explosion
never hurt anyone.

300
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,562
Antimatter?
You told me it was a plasma generator.

301
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,811
Yeah, it was, yesterday.

302
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,493
With these enhancements,
it's a new ball game now.

303
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:31,735
Okay, hold the work!

304
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:35,467
I've been running scans
on the new pieces of the machine.

305
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:39,617
I think this could be the trigger device
to an antimatter bomb.

306
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:41,327
- Are you sure?
- Well, no.

307
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,711
Someone built it
out of baling wire and bubble gum.

308
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:48,208
But if I'm right and we start
pulling pieces off this thing,

309
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,343
- we could set it off.
- We better get these teams outta here.

310
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:53,882
I want guards posted around the clock
until we get some answers.

311
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,883
Okay, just give me a few more hours.

312
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,850
Looking good, Fargo.

313
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,706
You'll rue the day.

314
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:22,948
Rue the day!

315
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,848
Enough, you hear me?
Douglas Fargo says enough!

316
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:32,170
Well, you can say it outside
after you mop my floor.

317
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,632
You need to arrest Larry right now.

318
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,177
I refused to take Tabitha back,
and he tried to run me down.

319
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,200
Well, you seem okay to me.

320
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:44,015
What are you talking about?!
I am covered in evidence!

321
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,103
Did you just flick me?

322
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,774
I'm sorry, but I need help.

323
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:53,297
This is your own fault.

324
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:55,610
If you had taken better care
of Tabitha,

325
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,654
instead of dumping her on Larry...

326
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,156
I took great care of her.

327
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,250
Really?

328
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,201
When was the last time
you rotated her tires,

329
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,328
or, I don't know, detailed her dash,

330
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,555
or gave her a good buffing?

331
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,725
I don't know.

332
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,211
I guess I just
kind of lost interest.

333
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,797
And you say she let you down.

334
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,095
What is wrong with you?

335
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,760
I have been running
more tests on the kids.

336
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,346
And what'd you find?

337
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,070
Well, their abnormal brain activity
has been increasing all day.

338
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:28,101
I've never seen anything like it.

339
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,280
Okay, so it builds
as they get tired?

340
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:34,409
Our subconscious is more susceptible
to suggestion while we're asleep.

341
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,777
- All right, let's keeping them awake.
- Too late.

342
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,212
One minute they're sleeping
and then this.

343
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,407
They've been trying to get out
for the last hour.

344
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,103
Easy.

345
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,381
It's time to go to bed.

346
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:18,855
Okay, sweetie?

347
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:23,781
They're worse.

348
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,867
Their brains are flooded
with neurotransmitters.

349
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,202
Adenosine, ATP, serotonin.

350
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,310
They can't go through cycles like this.
The levels will cause permanent damage.

351
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:35,418
Is it the thing in the woods
that's calling them or...?

352
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:36,772
I don't know.

353
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,725
What'd Zane find out?

354
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,507
I've been trying to reach him.

355
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:46,315
- They're in a trance again.
- <i>They're not the only ones.</i>

356
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,425
They keep coming.

357
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:16,292
I think it's starting up.

358
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:21,605
Whatever it is.

359
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,022
Carter, what the hell is happening?

360
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,775
I don't know.

361
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:42,835
But it's spreading.

362
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:50,629
The thing is way more complex,
and it's humming.

363
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,678
The original plasma generator

364
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:56,030
has been networked
to a dozen new components.

365
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,668
Well, it's affecting more people now.
Why those people?

366
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,790
Also, it's only happening at night.
Now, that can't be a coincidence.

367
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,090
Lunar cycles affect
sleeping patterns.

368
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:06,275
Henry, let's re-task
the geo satellites

369
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,177
to measure for abnormal
gravitational pull.

370
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,315
- Any data that you can get.
- Good.

371
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,710
What we need to do
is tear that thing down and now.

372
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:15,518
Wait, so, if you don't understand it,
just destroy it?

373
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,140
Well, it could be turning
the whole town into zombies.

374
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,430
It can't be. The ring wasn't here
before the kids were affected.

375
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:22,984
They built it, right?

376
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,430
Yeah, and since they have,
the effect's gotten worse.

377
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,018
Listen, Carter,
if they're connected to this thing,

378
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:31,367
we need to know what we're dealing with
so we don't make this worse.

379
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,000
The trance effect wanes during the day,
so we have a few hours.

380
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,975
Let's have Fargo and Henry
finish their scans,

381
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:40,001
then we'll decide what to do.

382
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,545
Right.

383
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:03,983
What do you think
of this thing, Trixie?

384
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,739
How you doing, Cassandra?

385
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,575
Shanaynay, looking good!

386
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,525
You need a name,
but I am just not feeling it.

387
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,482
But I am feeling this.
I don't believe it.

388
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,615
Yes, get me Dr. Blake.

389
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,755
Well, then find her.
This is urgent.

390
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:41,575
I'm sorry. Yes, I know.
I should watch my tone.

391
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,375
It's just...
Of course I'll hold.

392
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:55,205
Larry, what is wrong with you?
Didn't Jo talk to you about stalking?

393
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,192
That is it, Haberman.
Game's over!

394
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:06,065
No hard feelings, buddy.

395
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,935
- How's Zane?
- Snoring like a lumberjack.

396
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:38,953
Zoe?

397
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:40,795
She's good.

398
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,709
She's exhausted. They all are.

399
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,838
First the teens, now the adults.
Did you find a link?

400
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,831
I was cross-checking names.
It's all random.

401
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:54,356
Men, women, young, old,
no specific field of research.

402
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:57,175
Well, keep trying.

403
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,330
Why don't you go get a coffee?
I can watch her.

404
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:02,455
No, I'm...

405
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:03,885
I'm good.

406
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:06,835
You can go.
Someone's got to do the "sheriffing".

407
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,358
Trust me, all the drama's in here.

408
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:13,529
Traffic's so smooth, I found myself
hoping for a high-speed chase.

409
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:18,117
Yeah, I guess the road networks take
all the fun out of eluding the police.

410
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:21,515
Seriously, everyone's driving around
on autopilot.

411
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:24,081
I may never write a ticket again.

412
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,115
On autopilot?

413
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:33,591
Jo did a background check
on all of the builders,

414
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,345
and every one of them has had their car
networked with the SmartAsphalt.

415
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,555
- So you think it's driving people.
- Yes, exactly.

416
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,940
If that's true,
why is it only affecting the teens?

417
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,150
Because we upgraded the cars
to the SmartAsphalt

418
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:47,063
in order of accident statistics.

419
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,086
And teens are the most
dangerous drivers.

420
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:51,234
And that explains Zane, too.
He's a terror.

421
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,236
Zane is also
the architect of the system.

422
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,821
Maybe he could help us
if he wakes up.

423
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:00,576
Yeah, but we don't have time.
We have to shut the grid down now.

424
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,329
Well, get ready for the mother
of all traffic jams.

425
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:13,529
Mom, just a few more minutes.

426
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:15,995
I'm not your mom.

427
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:23,933
- Where are we?
- In the trunk of a demonic convertible.

428
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,160
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Take the pain. You deserve it!

429
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,245
I'll show you pain!

430
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:31,909
No pinching!

431
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,193
No pinching!

432
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,205
Time out, time out.

433
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:40,915
If we're both in here,
who's driving?

434
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:43,275
<i>That would be me, Douglas.</i>

435
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,873
You sold me a psychopathic car.
I wasn't stalking you, she was!

436
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:50,955
Tabitha, pull over!

437
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,900
<i>I don't believe your name
is on my pink slip anymore.</i>

438
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:58,004
- Mine is. Tabitha, pull over now.
- <i>Shut up, Larry.</i>

439
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,805
Where are you taking us?

440
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,567
Sweetheart?

441
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:10,280
<i>Not so pleasant having your destiny
in someone else's hands, is it?</i>

442
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,955
You don't have hands!

443
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:19,500
Jack, before we shut down the grid,
you should know that there are risks.

444
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,545
Yeah, I know, traffic jams.
I'll handle it.

445
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,200
No, he means for the people
connected to it.

446
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:27,913
Shutting down could be the answer,
but it could cause adverse effects,

447
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,583
so you may wanna be with Zoe
when we do this.

448
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,212
Thanks.

449
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,905
Is that the one-phay ire-way?

450
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:50,245
Why are you using pig Latin?

451
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,175
I read in the owner's anual-may,

452
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,233
ig-pay atin-lay isn't one of her...

453
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,694
programmed anguages-lay.

454
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,745
Ut-shay up-ay, arry-lay.

455
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,298
Call someone and tell them
we've been idnapped-kay.

456
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:06,452
I'm concerned with telling Dr. Blake
what I found before it's too late.

457
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,454
I'm more concerned with survival!

458
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,212
- <i>What are you doing,?</i>
- Do what you want to us, Tabitha.

459
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,506
I have to talk to Dr. Blake.
It's urgent.

460
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:21,085
He means do what you want to him.

461
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,117
Wait, wait, hold on.

462
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,434
One sec,
I have Carter on the other line.

463
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,295
- She hung up on me.
- <i>No, I hung up on you.</i>

464
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,484
Carter, are you there?

465
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:42,405
Allison, it's not good.
You gotta shut the grid down now!

466
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,523
Henry, take it off-line, now.

467
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,456
All right, here we go.

468
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:04,985
It worked.

469
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:25,865
Hi, Henry. What's happening?

470
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:31,139
Their brain scans indicate
some kind of heightened REM sleep.

471
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:33,950
- Heightened by what?
- I don't know yet.

472
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:35,632
But the teenagers are more severe,

473
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:38,048
possibly because
they were affected first.

474
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:41,173
And all the others are in and out.

475
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,593
- I was pretty stupid.
- It wasn't your fault.

476
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:49,200
It was my idea to turn off
the road network, and...

477
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:51,025
It wasn't just the road.

478
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,459
There's no way that

479
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:01,734
that system is sophisticated enough
to control a human brain.

480
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,904
Well, given that it's been controlling
your brain, how can you be so sure?

481
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:07,239
Okay, let's say
that the system was interacting

482
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,493
with whatever is doing this
to all of you.

483
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:14,707
It's possible
that the SmartAsphalt sensors

484
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,382
crossed frequencies
with something else.

485
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,070
Okay, like what?
And why at night?

486
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,784
Well, possibly a broadcast.

487
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,507
If so, then the signal would be stronger
because the sun's down.

488
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,075
The grid could've amplified
the power.

489
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,678
But we chose an encrypted frequency
for the road network

490
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,307
so we wouldn't have any interference
from a local-source signal.

491
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:38,575
Well, what if the source signal
isn't local?

492
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,625
Jackpot!

493
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,327
Found a Mr. Big bar.

494
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:00,961
Do you want half?

495
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:04,245
I'm not having a candy bar
for my last meal.

496
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,841
Drama queen.

497
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:11,762
- She's not gonna kill you.
- No, she's gonna kill us.

498
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:15,140
- What did I do?
- You said she smelled like feet!

499
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,725
I was...

500
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:18,355
I was joking.

501
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:23,001
Well, I guess she didn't really
find it funny, did she?

502
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:26,595
Wait. You feel that?

503
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,547
I think we're on
the Da Vinci Bridge.

504
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:37,246
- I'm too pretty to die!
- This is all my fault.

505
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,894
It is! It is!
It's all your fault!

506
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:42,785
Jo was right.

507
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,923
Tabitha was a great car.
I mean, sure, she's a little quirky,

508
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,593
but she always played
my favorite radio station,

509
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,225
always warmed my seat
to a comfortable 72 degrees.

510
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,775
I just sold her off
without even saying good-bye.

511
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,855
Seriously, you deserve to die.

512
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:05,775
I'm sorry, Tabby.

513
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,044
You deserved better.
I let you down.

514
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:15,951
Could you forgive me?

515
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,338
Or at least let Larry go.

516
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:22,740
Tabitha, I really need
to reach Allison.

517
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:24,665
Please, this is important.

518
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:33,125
We're doomed!
I'm gonna die a virgin!

519
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,370
So the smartroad was just serving
as an amplifier,

520
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,351
and whatever was telling them
to build it

521
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:44,390
isn't being transmitted
from anywhere around here.

522
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:45,980
Well, maybe it's the signal.

523
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:48,570
Whatever's coming
has been trying to send us a message.

524
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,976
Yeah, right, and only certain people
are receiving it.

525
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,151
Oh, my God.

526
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:54,183
Well, a 30 hertz offset carrier wave

527
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,875
could propagate through
the fermite coils into the road system.

528
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,119
Which could affect
nucleus accumbens in the forebrain.

529
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:02,790
- Small words, small.
- It wanted us to build that device.

530
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,584
And we have no idea
what it's capable of doing.

531
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:09,303
I'm gonna tell Wyman to spin up
Eureka's planetary defense grid.

532
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:11,685
- You're gonna shoot it down?
- I'm just loading the gun.

533
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,052
We have no idea what it's doing to us
and why, and we need to be prepared.

534
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:19,061
You know that could just be a function
of our inability to receive the info.

535
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:23,587
Don't let all this technology fool you.
We're still very primitive creatures.

536
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:29,106
- When did you shut off the road grid?
- A couple hours ago.

537
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:32,398
Well, the signal has been doubling
in strength every 4.4 seconds.

538
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:35,781
It makes it exponentially more powerful
than it was yesterday.

539
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,565
How close is this thing?

540
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,912
Close enough not to need
an amplifier anymore.

541
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,041
And we can't shut it off.

542
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:48,705
It's just gonna get worse.

543
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,005
- Allison Blake.
- <i>Allison, it's Henry.</i>

544
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:04,476
They just came streaming through.

545
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:06,930
And we know where they're going.

546
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,263
I'm sending a security team
to the site.

547
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,075
You okay?

548
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,645
It's gonna be okay.

549
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,239
- I hate you.
- I hate you.

550
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:41,615
I hate you more.

551
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,594
Hate you so much.

552
00:35:45,265 --> 00:35:46,565
I hate you most.

553
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:54,401
I think this is it.

554
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:56,920
Oh, God.

555
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,365
Hold me!

556
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,975
This is the worst death ever.

557
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:13,712
Hello, boys.

558
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:17,216
- He hugged me.
- You wish.

559
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:19,510
- How'd you find us?
- Tabitha called.

560
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,227
<i>Dr. Blake's cell phone
isn't picking up,</i>

561
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,370
<i>and you have important information
to deliver.</i>

562
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,976
<i>Deputy Lupo's new cruiser
can get you there faster.</i>

563
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,275
Thank you, Tabby.

564
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,130
When we get back,
I'll make this up to you.

565
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,255
I promise.

566
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,562
Listen, about that hug...

567
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:46,055
What happened in the trunk
stays in the trunk.

568
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:58,455
Lock down that perimeter!

569
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,206
Isn't this monumental?

570
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:20,280
You always this positive?

571
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,405
Annoying?

572
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,270
We've lost cell reception,

573
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:28,579
but I've set up a hard-line video link
to Henry in telemetry.

574
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,363
Whatever it is, it's accelerating.

575
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:32,510
- How long?
- They'll be here within the hour.

576
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:35,335
Wyman, get the new coordinates
from Dr. Deacon and get back to GD.

577
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,721
- I want everything ready to fire.
- Got it.

578
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,299
You're just gonna shoot it
out of the sky?

579
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,885
Al, can't you feel their anticipation?
Something big is gonna happen.

580
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,755
It's already happening.

581
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:27,195
I have to reach Allison
before it's too late.

582
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:30,945
I still can't get a signal.

583
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:36,855
- Nice acceleration.
- Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

584
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,942
Tabitha never rode
the outside groove like this.

585
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,361
Tabitha did the best she could
with what she had.

586
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:46,605
She can't help it if she wasn't born
with a better chassis.

587
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,241
But I can.

588
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,120
When this is over, I'm gonna give her
the upgrade she deserves.

589
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:54,635
Put Tabby's AI into the Subaru.

590
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:58,328
Guess you won't have to name
your new car after all.

591
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,502
We're getting massive ionization
building up in the atmosphere.

592
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:09,513
That's just a function
of the plasma wave.

593
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,340
It could also ignite the ionosphere
if it keeps building.

594
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,970
Ignite, as in burn the sky?

595
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:16,930
If the ionization goes critical,
then yeah.

596
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,394
We have to destroy that thing
before it gets any closer.

597
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,317
- Allison, you can't. You can't do that.
- What's the status of that thing?

598
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,153
<i>It just crossed the orbit of Mars.</i>

599
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,781
- <i>How long before it's in range?</i>
- A few minutes, tops.

600
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,491
<i>Get ready to fire all batteries.</i>

601
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,285
Talk to her. Please.

602
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:34,075
Dad.

603
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:41,127
- How are you? How do you feel?
- You can't shoot it down.

604
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,650
That's not my call, sweetie.

605
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,302
It's putting a lot of people
in danger.

606
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:51,138
But it's not on purpose.

607
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:52,875
It's like...

608
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,035
It's helping a friend.

609
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,245
It's help...

610
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,720
Allison, she says it's safe.

611
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,485
What's the ionization level?

612
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:08,875
<i>It's holding steady.
9.9 million electronvolts.</i>

613
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,700
See, it's not going critical, Al,
it's not gonna ignite the atmosphere.

614
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,703
Recheck the numbers.
We only have one shot at this thing.

615
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:16,755
Recalculating.

616
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,040
- We just lost the target.
- <i>What do you mean you lost it?</i>

617
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,421
As in, it's gone.

618
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,481
<i>Along with our chances
of destroying it.</i>

619
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:30,635
Based on its last speed and trajectory,
it's headed straight this way.

620
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,530
Sergeant. Prepare the security team
and the demolition unit.

621
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,767
We are not letting
this thing touch down.

622
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,063
<i>We're still not detecting
the target.</i>

623
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,066
They must've found a way to hide.
They could be cloaking.

624
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,234
Set the charges.
We're taking these towers down.

625
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

626
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,601
This thing is pumping energy
like a fusion reactor.

627
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:54,201
- You can't just blow it up.
- We may not have a choice.

628
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,952
Get those charges ready!

629
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:58,515
Dr. Blake!

630
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:01,195
Stop.

631
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,836
I know what it is. It's not a weapon.
It's a boson cloud exciter.

632
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,922
Oh, my God.

633
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,200
Wait, what's a boson cloud exciter?

634
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:14,346
The end point
for a high-velocity space jump.

635
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,265
Like a giant catcher's mitt.

636
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,894
Yeah, for a 670-million-mile-per-hour
fastball.

637
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,810
It would be impossible to slow it down
without a cloud of bosons

638
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:26,775
- to dissipate the energy.
- Well, we can't just let it land.

639
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,399
I'm not sure we can blow it up.

640
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:31,446
The impact would turn Eureka
into a mile-deep crater, Al.

641
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,700
Sergeant.

642
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:38,820
Pull the explosives back,
move to threat level red.

643
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:39,995
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,500
Here's hoping it's friendly.

645
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,668
Move back!

646
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:46,805
All teams, threat level red!

647
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,678
<i>We've reacquired the target.
It's right on top of you.</i>

648
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:15,475
Oh, my God.

649
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:25,865
What is this?

650
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:35,865
How was your...

651
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,470
day?

652
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,888
Henry, what...

653
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:57,095
What is he doing?

654
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,395
Oh, my God.

655
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:06,115
It's one of ours.
