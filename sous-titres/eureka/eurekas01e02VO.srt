00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
PREVIOUSLY ON EUREKA

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,410
I'm guessing you guys
don't get AAA out here.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,090
No. We have Henry.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,820
- I was an engineer.
- As in trains ?

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,820
Space shuttles.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,180
Jack Carter, U.S. Marshal.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,690
Allison Blake, Department of Defense.

come on.Let's go for a ride.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,690
What are you doing !?!

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,880
one minute I'm driving my delinquent daughter back to LA,
and the next I'm in the middle of the freakin' Twilight Zone !

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,530
Wellcome to eureka

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,870
Walter was our top quantum physicist.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,320
Something went wrong
with his experiment.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
My orders are to contain this area
until we figure this out.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,260
I don't understand.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,730
It's a promotion.
Oh, you mean the sheriff ?

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,910
You can do this, Jack.You can make it happen.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,680
So you had no idea Walter was involved in some espionage ?

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,870
There were phone calls late at night.I think he must've been working
with someone else.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,840
Drink this. It'll make you
feel better.

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,770
A lot of us are still in shockabout the
tragic events that have brought us here.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,600
The loss of...walter and susan
perkins forces us to question

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,500
if the work we do is worth the risks.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Eureka was bornfrom the idealistic
vision that by advancing science,

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,000
we can control it for the greater good.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,850
Clearly that's not always the case.

26
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,120
We can never forget walter and susan.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,100
Their legacy is in our hands now.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,160
Their friends,their family.

29
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,260
Their son.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,430
Walter and susan,you will be greatly missed.

31
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,360
- I still don't get it.
- what's that?

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,560
Susan committing suicide.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,880
I mean,I know it sounds callous,
but I don't carehow bad things are.

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,410
Once you have a kid,
you don'tget to just...check out.

35
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,740
Well,my daughter zoe saidpretty much the same thing to me
when I told her I wasbeing transferred to eureka.

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,650
Taking your life and takinga job
are hardly the same thing.

37
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,050
In this town?I'm not so sure.

38
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,390
I don't need you to tell me
I don't have a placeto put my stuff.

39
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,560
I know that.

40
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,780
The question is,where is my stuff
That I don't have anywhere to put?

41
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,020
Lupo.

42
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,530
Yeah,yeah,I know.
Tracking numbers and corporate policy but--

43
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,110
- it's for you.
- Yeah,can you take a message,please?

44
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,340
No.
It sounds urgent.

45
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,490
Hang on.

46
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,610
Hello,jack carter.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,300
Really?
A ghost.Very mature.

48
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,540
Look,it's very convincing.
But I get it.You haze the new guy.

49
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,240
Big laughs. I gotta go.

50
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,740
Uh,hello. Yeah.

51
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,370
Hello? You still there?

52
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,970
Oh,come on.

53
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,270
Great. Thank you,jo.

54
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,410
I think I may have lost my only
chance of getting my stuff back

55
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,090
because I had to takea crank
call about a haunting.

56
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,570
- I didn't set that up.
- Yeah?

57
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,680
I should believe you...why?

58
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,120
Carter...

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,590
this is a townfull of scientists.

60
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,710
Everyone knows there'sno such thing as ghosts.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,360
Where is walter?

62
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,230
You were saying?

66
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,030
I'm not sure this will all get
worked out,ms. Perkins.

67
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,430
I need to see walter now.

68
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,090
Walter was obviously trying
to hurt me,and when I--

69
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,730
what?What are you all staring at?

70
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,130
Sorry if we seem a little...

71
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,430
unnerved,but we justburied you this morning.

72
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,190
You're unnerved?

73
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,920
My parents called mein hysterics
because they got an invitationto my funeral

74
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,140
and a message saying that theyhad
a grandson who needs a home.

75
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
Which was alla big surprise to me,

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,040
seeing as how I'm not dead and
I've never had a child.

77
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,650
Yeah. You win.

78
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,620
We're just trying to figure outwhat's going on.

79
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,250
Then get walter in hereand ask him.

80
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,450
- You didn't tell her?
- I was getting to it.

81
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,190
Tell her what?

82
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,260
Walter's dead.

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,350
Walter'S...dead?

84
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,420
Yeah,he--he--he sort of,um...

85
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,250
blew himself up.

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,070
Oh,my god.

87
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,080
What--you--you'renot joking.

88
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,580
I'm sorry,susan.

89
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,840
hold on.If she's susan perkins,
then who did we...?

90
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,390
You're staring again.

91
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,510
Yeah,um,do you mind if I askyou
how you and walter met?

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,050
I was a grad student at mit.

93
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,120
He was a postdoc.

94
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,180
We got marriedright after graduation.And...

95
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,000
he wantedto start a family,
but...I wasn't ready.

96
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,520
One morning,this guy came to the doorand
wanted to talk to walter about some top-secret job.

97
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,300
He wanted to go.
I wanted to stay.

98
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,280
So we separated.

99
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,940
You do realize we aregonna have to verify that,
so we can,uh,sort this thing out.

100
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,650
How long is that gonna take?

101
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,690
I'm not really sure.It's not like we
havea standard form to undead you.

102
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,730
Tell me you're kidding.

103
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,900
924/B. In triplicate.

104
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,980
We'll still need to confirmyour identity.

105
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,530
- How are you gonna do that?
- We can do a dna test.

106
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,490
Oh,we can do betterthan that.
But we're still gonna needto do some digging.

107
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,010
- Oh,you mean I gotta go back to the--
- yes!

108
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,380
- Well,someone's gotta get me a--
- that's right.

109
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,600
Just do what you have to do.

110
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
I just want to get backto my normal life.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,130
Yeah,I can relate.

112
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,740
- County coroner,huh?
- Board-certified.

113
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,960
Pretty cool,huh?
I call it an "omniversal"remote.

114
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,090
I can run all this equipmentby remote control.

115
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,300
That's super,henry.Can we just...hurry it up?

116
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm,uh,not a big fanof cemeteries.

117
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,680
One too manyromero movies,huh?

118
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,160
Uh,one too many funerals.

119
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,130
That's crazy.

120
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,770
Something's actually interferingwith the frequency.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,170
- Pull the batteries.
- What?

122
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,860
Pull the battery!

123
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,990
Way to keepthings quiet.

124
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,160
I guess I got a few more kinks to work out.

125
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,350
Well,just see ifyou can get susan perkins' body

126
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,600
to global dynamics withoutalerting
the entire town.

127
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm going over there nowto meet allison.

128
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,580
Batteries.

129
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,220
Now,why didn'tI think of that?

130
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,450
Welcome to global dynamics.

131
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,800
Level-one clearance only.*********

132
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,160
- So you metthe new director yet?
- Not yet.

133
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,470
He just arrived.

134
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,800
Global dynamics is underD.A.R.P.A. Jurisdiction

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,070
and they get a little crazyabout
sharing information.

136
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,820
- Hence,our visit.
- What's D.A.R.P.A.?

137
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,290
The defense advanced researchproject agency.

138
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,610
It's the central research armof the D.O.D.

139
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,260
Okay,so why am I here?

140
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,830
Well,you want to usethe new molecular bioscanner
on susan perkins' bodyand this new woman,right?

141
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,120
Maybe.

142
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,930
Yeah,well,all requeststo use laboratory
resources for

143
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,240
police applications must be submittedto
the director of research.

144
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,390
- Who we haven't met yet.
- Exactly.

145
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,330
Nathan?

146
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,740
Allison.
I swear I was just aboutto call you.

147
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,810
What are you doing here?You're not--

148
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,220
- 'fraid so.
- You're movingback to eureka?

149
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,030
Moved,actually.Yesterday.
Same office,same house.

150
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,150
Surprise!

151
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,970
I probably should've calledsooner.

152
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,490
Probably.

153
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,500
Must be the new sheriffI've heard so much about.

154
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,540
- Nathan stark.
- Jack carter.

155
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,600
So you two used towork together?

156
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,980
I mainly worked withher son,kevin.But,um,

157
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,150
all I and ihad our moments.

158
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,600
Anyway.
Uh,I was looking into something

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,580
and wanted to knowif I could use your,uh,
bio,uh,scanner moleculethingy.

160
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,320
Of course. Anything I cando to help.

161
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,220
Excuse me,dr. Stark.

162
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,970
Maggie's taking careof your parking space
and the new furniturewill be delivered tomorrow.

163
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,750
A lot to catch up on.

164
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,840
Sheriff,it's been a pleasure.
Allison...

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,280
It's good to see you.

166
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,070
So you two have a history?

167
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,660
- You could say that.
- What,ex-boyfriend?

168
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,700
- Not exactly.
- What exactly?

169
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,810
He's my husband.

170
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,580
thanks for letting me stay with you.

171
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,230
Just don't tell the sheriff thatI've
got a spare bedroom,okay?

172
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,610
Oh,my god.

173
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,540
What?Did you see something?

174
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,290
If you did,there's this formthat
I gotta get you to sign--

175
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,060
no,it's our house.

176
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,300
Wait,pull over.

177
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
this is your house. I mean,
susan perkins' house.

178
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,180
But how did you know?

179
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,930
Before walter and I split up,

180
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,250
we were...planning to buildour dream home.

181
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,530
This is it.

182
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,410
It's exactly the same.

183
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,170
I even picked that wallpaper.

184
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,500
This is unreal.

185
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,460
It's me,but...

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,010
but it isn'T.

187
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,620
This is their son?

188
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,060
Hey,susan,maybethis isn't such a good idea.

189
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,030
This can't be happening.

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,910
Kevin...

191
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,250
honey,five more minutesthen
it's time for bed,okay?

192
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,880
Five minutes.300 seconds.

193
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,030
7:30 P.M.

194
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,770
How does he do that?

195
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,750
Well,his brain just worksdifferently
than other people.

196
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,690
I miss my mom and dad.

197
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,400
I know,honey.
It's hard to losethe people you love.

198
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,820
But it does get better.

199
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,350
And the important thingto remember
is that they loved youvery much.

200
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,430
My mom dropped me at school.

201
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,990
She said she'd be backto get me.

202
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,230
But...she never came.

203
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,160
I know she would've been thereif she could've.

204
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,700
Okay?

205
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,800
Tomorrow's gonna bea better day.

206
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,590

How...?

210
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,010
I thought I locked the door.

211
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,430
Uh,yeah,no.I-it doesn't work.

212
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,390
Sheriff cobb always hadan open-door policy.

213
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,120
Um,you might wantto be careful with this.
It's a portable generator.

214
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
So?

215
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,410
Uh,a fission-poweredportable generator.

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,730
Okay.Don't sleepon the nuclear-powered device.

That was S.A.R.A.H.

Self-actuated residential automated habitat.

242
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,050
S.A.R.A.H.,For short.

243
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,610
Fargo,is that youtalking like a girl?

244
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,710
No.It's the smart house.

245
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,990
A state-of-the-art model home,

246
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,910
designed to anticipateits owner's
every need and desire.

247
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,350
Of course,it'll takesome time to learn
all of your personalpreferences.

248
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,830
Well,my preferenceright now is to have
a house that isn't radioactive.

249
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,320
Ha!Well,it used to be a nuclear
disaster bunker,but don't worry.

250
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,970
Rad levels are well withinnormal.

251
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,900
Well,that's great.

252
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,350
the telecommunications systemis
linked directly to your office,

253
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,260

programmedinto the mainframe.

254
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,620
Your bathroom.

255
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,490
Oh,fargo,you gottaget yourself a girlfriend.

256
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,140

If this house is so great,
why is it sitting here vacant?

261
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,830
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.Sleep tight.

262
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm a human guinea pig.

263
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,220
Uh,so,S.A.R.A.H.,Is it?

264
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,680
That's correct,sheriff carter.

265
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,770
Aha.Can you see me?

266
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,110

Doctor fargo says you like baseball.

273
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,470
I recorded the indiana game earlier.

274
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,140
Really?

275
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,590

Yeah,well,that's--why are you yelling at me?

287

Oh,that's weird.
There's been a power surge.

304
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,130
It reset the clockand threw off the settings.

327
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,730

328
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,440
- Allison.

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,910
Chromosomes,celldifferentiation,
I mean,all of the markersare identical.

347
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,820
How did you know?

348
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,730
I was reading walter'spersonnel file last night.

349
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,330
Guess what the subjectof
his first dissertation was.

350
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,500
Stem cell replication.

351
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,470
Are you saying that waltercloned his wife?

352
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,700
Not exactly.
Walter wentway beyond cloning.

353
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,270
He re-created susancell by cell
as a full-grown adult.

354
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,390
I mean,she may look 30. Chronologically,
those tissues can't be more thanseven years old,tops.

355
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,730
A year older than her son?That's creepy.

356
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,800
Ah,susan was right.
Walter wanted a family,with her...

357
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,200
or with her.

358
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,270
memo to file.

359
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,590
All section five projectsseem to be in order.

360
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,110
First priority will beredoubling
all security measures

361
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,040
to avoid similar breachesin
sec--urity in the future.

362
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,960
Hello?

363
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,190
Someone there?

364
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,960
that's why you collapsed?
An electrolyte imbalance?

365
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,040
I'm just telling youwhat the doctors told me.

366
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,700
And they have no ideawhat caused it.

367
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,710
Yes,my electrolytesare out of balance.

368
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,860
Oh,nathan.

369
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,930
Don't worry,I'm fine.

370
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,990
Who said I was worried?

371
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,530
Wishful thinking.

372
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah.

373
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,740
Uh,susan perkinsis asking for you.

374
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,380
Henry told herabout the whole "uber-clone" thing.

375
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,660
I have to go deal with this.

376
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,790
I don't thinkI'm going anywhere.

377
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,440
Come on.

378
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
Sheriff.

379
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,100
Talk to you for a sec?

380
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,820
Uh,sure.Yeah,okay.

381
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,480
I'll catch up.

382
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,100
Um,okay.

383
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,200
How you doing,sheriff?

384
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,090
Pretty good. Shouldn'tyou be staying in bed?

385
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,810
Oh,no. I should begetting back to work.

386
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,060
I didn't want to sayanything
with allison still in the room.

387
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,070
Oh,listen,I think you got the wrong impression.

388
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,790
I saw something.

389
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,080
Something I'd liketo keep between us.

390
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,570
Oh. O-okay.

391
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,950
There was an electricalproblem with the computers,

392
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,290
and then I saw...something.

393
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,580
A figure.

394
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,320
Are you saying someonewas in your office?

395
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Not someone.Something.

396
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,240
It wasn'tentirely corporeal.

397
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,230
"Corporeal"?

398
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,400
Physical.
There and not thereat the same time.

399
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,960
Are you saying you saw a ghost?

400
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,820
Sheriff,the director ofresearch of the most advanced
scientific facility inthe world doesn't see ghosts.

401
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,060
No.

402
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,560
- I'll check it out.
- Thanks.

403
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,510
So,you sleeping with her?

404
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,590
Excuse me?

405
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,810
You said I'd gottenthe wrong impression.

406
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,280
I assumed you weretalking about my wife.

407
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,310
- Not that I haveany right to ask--
- you're right,you don'T.

408
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,800
You're not.

409
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,100
But you'd like to.

410
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,230
I'll let you knowif I get anywhere.

411
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,510
With the ghost,I mean.

412
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,060
Yeah.

413
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,110
Tell me,henry.You're a scientist.
Do you believe in ghosts?

414
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,340
Well,I believe in energy.And when somebody dies,
that energy has to go somewhere.

415
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,290
So,theoretically,I suppose it's possible.
Why?

416
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,280
Topic's come upa few times.
Where are wetaking her,anyway?

417
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,030
Cryogenics.

418
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,940
She's going to bethe focus of a lot of interest.

419
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,000
Jeez.

420
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,980
What's the mortality ratearound here?

421
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,560
Twice the national average.

422
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,850
The bigger the science,the bigger the risks.
But,uh,none of theseare local.

423
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,090
I have them shipped infor research.

424
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,850
Hello?

425
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,370
Hello,sheriff carter. It's S.A.R.A.H.

426
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,060
Sorry,who's this?

427
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,810
Your house.

428
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,780
I'm,uh,waist-deepin bodies at the moment,
so--

429
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,370
Sorry to bother you,but your wife
abby called from los angeles.

430
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,860
She wanted to let you know that
your daughter zoe didn't come home last night.

431
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,270
Ah,there's a shocker.

432
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,730
She also said something about you shirking
your responsibilities as a husband and a father.

433
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,770
I recorded the conversation,
if you'd like me to play it back for you.

434
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,770
Uh,about the recordings,no more recordings.

435
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,230
Uh,my private lifeisn't a reality show.

436
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,970
Whatever you say,sheriff.

437
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,080
- S.A.R.A.H.?
- Yes,sheriff?

438
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,660
Is there a camerain my bedroom?

439
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,960
Certainly.I monitor all areas of
the house for dr. Fargo's data collection.

440
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,070
Would you like me to patch him in?

441
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,650
Uh,no,no.
I'll be seeing dr. Fargoin person later,thanks.

442
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,700
Will you be home for dinner?

443
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,590
I guess so.

444
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,070
Wonderful. I'm making pot roast.
Your favorite,right? Don't be late.

445
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,490
Pretty mind-boggling,huh?

446
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,940
Yeah.

447
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,600
Henry,I needto see a geek about a ghost.

448
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,380
Right this way.

449
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,290
There is something very wrong with you people.

450
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,770
Believe me,susan,no one knewwhat walter had done.
I'm as surprised as you are.

451
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,060
Oh,I seriously doubt that.

452
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,830
Well,I thinkthe important thing now is
to decidewhere you go from here.

453
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,630
My ex-husband cloned me,moved her
into our dream house,and had a child with her.

454
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,670
Where I'm going is home,
to put this insanity behind me.

455
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,960
Yes! I am susan perkins.

456
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,430
Back from the grave.
Everyone take a good look.

457
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,730
Uh,youfeel better now?

458
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,120
Yeah.A little.

459
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,910
so,listen.
Your records haveall been cleared.

460
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,230
You can moveanytime you want.
I just wishthat you would--

461
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,190
I know whatyou're going to say.

462
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,640
I appreciate the concern you have
for that boy,really.

463
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,670
But he's not mine,ms. Blake,
and no amount of science

464
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,290
is going to change that.I know,but--

465
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,910
my mind is made up.I need to go home.

466
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,860
Fine. I'll drive youback to your car.

467
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,710
Where's the video? fargo?

468
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,580
I dumped all the videoin the trash.
Please don't hit me.

469
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,080
Where is it?

470
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,310
- Carter.
- What?

471
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,020
What are you,amish?
The computer.

472
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,600
- Can you get it back?
- Sure. Why?

473
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,670
I need youto pull up the tape from yesterday.

474
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,970
no problem.

475
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,660
The surveillance cameras are on 24/7.

476
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,950
Okay,"a,"that stops now.

477
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,730
And,"b," pull upthe footage from my bedroom,
from aroundthe time the power surged.

478
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,860
If this goes on the internet,you're a dead man.

479
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,330
What the hellis that?

480
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,540
There was a power surgeat my house
that screwed up the computers.

481
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,400
Stark,beforehe blacked out,he said that his
computers went haywire too and then he saw a figure.

482
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,550
I'm--I'm betting that's it.

483
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,140
I guess that answersyour question about ghosts.

484
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,430
Okay.Freeze it there.

485
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,510
That's weird. It disappeared.

486
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,950
move it forward slowly.

487
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,120
It's probably moving too fastfor
our eyes to pick it up.

488
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,140
There. Back.

489
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,490
There's our ghost.

490
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,310
- Is that whoI think it is?
- Unreal.

491
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,190
Now we just gottafind him again.

492
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,700
and how are we supposed to do that?

493
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,490
That remoteof yours,that's for
scanningelectronic frequencies,right?

494
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,040
- Yeah.
- Do ghosts have frequencies?

495
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,060
we're going to needa bigger battery.

496
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,770
I thought you weretaking me back to my car.

497
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,340
I told you.I can't do this.

498
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,680
Susan,look,I-I know that this is a lot to handle.

499
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,760
But like it or not,thereis a boy out
there who is biologicallyyour child.

500
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,160
You--you don't haveto get out of the car.
You don't even haveto talk to him.

501
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,200
But do you reallywant to walk away
without evereven seeing him?

502
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,660
there he is.

503
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,370
I have a son,kevin.

504
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,730
His father died rightbefore he was born.

505
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,090
We don't getmany second chances.

506
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,990
Okay.

507
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,510
I've seen him.Can we go now?

508
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,300
Really,ms. Blake,this is--

509
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,380
It's not me.

510
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,190
Oh,my god.

511
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,920
- what is that?
- My son's nightmare.

512
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,080
Get these kids out of here!

513
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,270
Brian!
Get out of here!Get out!

514
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,990
Brian,get out!

515
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,770
No!

516
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,150
You stay the hellaway from him.

517
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,810
Mom!You came back!

518
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,250
just stay behind me,honey.

519
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,340
And you,so help me,you--

520
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,280
walter?

521
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,270
Walter,is that really you?

522
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,790
Stop!
susan,don't touch him!

523
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,390
It's okay,walter.We're here to help.

524
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,230
he,uh,doesn't seem to remember
much before the accident.

525
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,880
We may never knowexactly what happened.

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,140
How convenient for him.

527
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,660
I--I don't understand how this happened.

528
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,370
Walter createda machine that
caused a temporal implosion.

529
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,670
When he tried to fix it,there was a cascading
effect and he got caughtin the blast.

530
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,890
That sounds like walter.

531
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,090
Well,we all assumedthat he was dead.

532
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,380
It turned out he'djust been
shunted off into anothertime stream.

533
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,930
Essentially stuckbetween seconds.

534
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,890
This device should stabilize him.

535
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,120
Why?

536
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,070
I missed you.

537
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,360
I missed you too,mom.

538
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,080
I know you did.

539
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,950
Can we allgo home now?

540
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,910
So,what happens now?

541
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,210
Temporalrehabilitation.

542
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,210
What?

543
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,200
Think physical therapy.
But a whole lotmore expensive.

544
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,850
Uh,I was talkingabout susan.

545
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,690
Do you think she'sgoing to stay?

546
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,790
For brian's sake,I hope so.

547
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,450
Oh,wow. I thoughtmy family was dysfunctional.

548
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,870
allison.

549
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,880
Can you come hea moment?

550
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,620
Um...I guess I'd better go.

551
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,670
Oh,y-yeah.

552
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,870
Yeah,I gotta fill outa report on this,anyway,

553
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,030
and I still don't knowhow to spell "corporeal."

554
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,240
C-o-r-p-o-r-e-a-L.

555
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Get some rest,huh?

556
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,930
And,uh,tellyour husband I'm glad he'sfeeling better.

557
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,460
carter.

558
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,140
Carter,I sure am gladI caught you.
There's somethingyou should probably--

559
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,120
- is it life-threatening?
- Huh?

560
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,560
Does it have anythingto do with,uh,
a hole in time,or clones,

561
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,110
- or it does it have globalconsequences?
- Well,no,but--

562
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,690
okay,ah-ah!
Then whatever it is,it can wait till tomorrow.

563
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,320
You're the boss.

564
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,630
That's right.

565
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,230
I am the boss.

566
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,200
Open the door!

567
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,710
Due to technical difficulties,
I cannot visually confirm identity at this time.

568
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,910
Okay,okay.Listen to my voice.

569
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,090
All right?It's me.

570
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,420
Jack carter!

571
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,270
I'm sorry,voice-recognition
imprint is currently offline.

572
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,640
And in the future,when someone says they'll
be home for dinner and they're running late,

573
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,870
it's polite to call.

574
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
You're joking.You're mad at me?

575
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,430
Sorry,but I'm not programmed for
that emotion at this time.

576
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm gonna kill fargo.

577
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,990
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,860
It won't happen again.

579
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,440
I promise.

580
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,850
S.A.R.A.H.,Uh,

581
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,190
lights,fireplace,music.

582
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,350
If you're hungry,I can reheat dinner.

583
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,300
Oh,ju--no,just...

584
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,490
you know,if I could justhave a moment to myself.

585
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,640
I've been dealing with otherpeople's
problems all day.

586
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,870
And,you know,I'd really likea couple
of minutes of peace.

587
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,460
All you had to do was ask.

588
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh,yeah.

589
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,340
Just a minute.

590
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,800
I swear.
If this is anothersusan perkins...

591
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,720
Listen,I don't mean to be rude...

592
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,280
hi,dad.

593
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,530
You know? Your yardneeds a lot of work.

594
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,130
Turns out it couldn'twait till tomorrow.

595
