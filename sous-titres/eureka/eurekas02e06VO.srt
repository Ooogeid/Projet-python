1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:03,159
It's gotta be hard going
from liaison to head of GD.

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:05,489
Well, I'll admit it was
a bit of a rough start,

3
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,405
but I think I'm getting
the hang of this job.

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,568
I mean, things are actually
calm at Global...

5
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:11,767
Don't... don't even... don't tempt fate.

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,710
- I don't believe in fate, Carter.
- No, just stop. Honestly,

7
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,778
I'll turn around,
run home, and take a shower.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,892
Oh, god, I wish I could take a shower.
You know, my water heater's broken.

9
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,007
All the greatest scientists
in the world in a 3-mile radius,

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,819
and I can't find a decent plumber.

11
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,916
I'll take a look at it for you.

12
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:28,784
You? No, you don't understand.

13
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,962
No, I'm really handy.
I know what you're thinking...

14
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,917
is there anything this guy can't do?

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,630
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking.

16
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:40,181
- You want a drink?
- Uh, sure. Yeah.

17
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:42,121
Is it too early for happy hour?

18
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,138
Well, if you consider Vincent's veggie
blend happy, then, no.

19
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,117
Well, not quite what I had in mind.

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,453
But here's to quiet afternoons.

21
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:54,580
What was that?

22
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,955
Either someone's doing construction,
or... you got a pest problem.

23
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,585
Yeah. Definitely a pest problem.

24
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:04,837
Hello, Sheriff.

25
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,720
you running or swimming?

26
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:09,201
Baby, I didn't expect
you guys home so soon.

27
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:12,734
Oh, Kev's helping me install
a new system for his music therapy.

28
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,086
Well, I offered to fix

29
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,913
Allison's water heater.

30
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:17,695
Really?

31
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,269
Interesting Allison
didn't mention it's a fusion

32
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:21,450
water heater...

33
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,517
and that to work on one
you need a PHD from MIT.

34
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:26,525
Which I happen to have.

35
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,821
Right.

36
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:33,941
I'd better go.

37
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,012
Thanks for the run.

38
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:42,070
Yeah. Thanks for the happy hour.

39
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,557
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,146
- I'll make it up to you next time.
- You're on.

41
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,112
<i>Don't hurt yourself out there.</i>

42
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:52,852
PHD from MIT.

43
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,446
Very bad boy, Sparky.
I told you to stay close.

44
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,738
Now it is time for your leash.

45
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,461
Oh, Sparky, hey! Come back!

46
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,541
<i>Come back here right now. Bad dog.</i>

47
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,700
<i>Stay out of the street. Get back here.</i>

48
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,297
Oh, man.

49
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,837
Jeez!

50
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,794
Can you hear me?
Buddy, here. Give me your hand.

51
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm gonna get you out of here.

52
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,772
Can you give me your name?

53
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,535
You all right? What's your name?

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,639
Sheriff Carter?

55
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,547
Crap.

56
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:23,115

Noche de Suenos (v. 1.0)

62
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,242
Relax, Carter.

63
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:56,132
It's standard procedure
with chemical spills.

64
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,270
The most dangerous neurotoxins

65
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:01,271
were neutralized by
the waste scrubbing process.

66
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,077
Decontamination only
works if it comes into contact

67
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,549
with bare skin.

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,175
The faster you scrub down, the better.

69
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:12,899
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

70
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,195
No.

71
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,338
Ok, switch it on.

72
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,449
SARAH, door.

73
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,935
- What happened to you?
- I tempted fate.

74
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,312
SARAH, can I have a beer waiting for me?

75
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,267
<i>I detect that you're upset, Sheriff.</i>

76
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,856
- <i>But alcohol isn't the answer.</i>
- No, I'm not.

77
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,121
And, yes, it is.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,503
Yeah, he's upset.

79
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:54,584
Morning.

80
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:02,731
Damn.

81
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:07,202
We're out of fresh ground vinspresso.

82
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,989
Be right back.

83
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,432
Morning. How's it going?

84
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,849
Carter, what are you doing?

85
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,141
Oh, not again.

86
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:43,113
Haven't had that one since college.

87
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,799
SARAH, OJ.

88
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:47,364
Hey, morning.

89
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:48,641
You okay?

90
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,140
Yeah, just a weird nightmare
I had last night.

91
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,395
Me too. How you feeling?

92
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,516
I'd rather not talk about it.

93
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:59,502
You know, I'm in enough therapy already.

94
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:01,970
<i>Poached eggs and sausage, Zoe?</i>

95
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:04,259
Actually, I think I've lost my appetite.

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,744
I'm just gonna...

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,784
get something at school. Gotta go.

98
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,067
<i>Sometimes I think she says
these things just to hurt me.</i>

99
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:17,599
No. I say things just to hurt you.

100
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:20,727
She's just a teenager.

101
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,976
Morning. Any word on the driver?

102
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,493
Something funny about
toxic waste exposure?

103
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:32,469
No.

104
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,291
Something is funny about
Sheriff Carter exposure.

105
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:39,377
<i>I had this dream last night,</i>

106
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,837
and you were naked,

107
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:44,382
<i>walking around, doing
your normal Carter thing like</i>

108
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:45,675
nothing was wrong.

109
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,387
What?

110
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:52,432
Yeah. You came in.
You bent over by the fridge...

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,395
just like that, and...

112
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,185
cute birthmark, by the way.

113
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,405
And then went off to get

114
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:00,593
fresh-ground vinspresso.

115
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,115
Yeah. How did you know that?

116
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,536
Just a hunch.

117
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:12,368
<i>What could cause us
to share the same dream?</i>

118
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,800
I need... coffee
before I can contemplate that.

119
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:20,721
Maybe we've developed a deep,
subconscious connection.

120
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,446
Like soldiers in battle.

121
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,696
Or maybe it's that I was marinated
in radioactive waste.

122
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:28,618
That seems more likely, doesn't it?

123
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:29,969
Hey, Vince, we're out of coffee.

124
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,095
Uh, fresh ground vinspresso coming up.

125
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,305
Oh, see, Vincent,
here's a perfect example

126
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,182
of where you could be
much more efficient.

127
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,684
Dr. Childress is expert on productivity
and time management.

128
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,146
She helps me to be more efficient.

129
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,306
How do you become
a doctor of efficiency?

130
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,978
I'm a neurologist at Global.
I just do this for fun.

131
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:48,458
I search to maximize people's cognitive
potential through neural networking.

132
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,418
You should have her help you, Sheriff.

133
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,520
What are you saying?

134
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,254
Nothing.

135
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,778
I'll... I'll get your coffee.

136
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:04,984
Great. Thanks.

137
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,139
Uh, driver's awake,
and Allison wants to see us.

138
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,770
Oh, great. Hey, Vince,
w'ell pick up a little later.

139
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,449
<i>This isn't just another
traffic accident, Carter.</i>

140
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:19,143
Global Dynamics has the most advanced
waste reduction technology in the world.

141
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:20,981
Well, having taken a bath in that waste,

142
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,491
I can tell you there's still plenty.

143
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:25,629
Well, that truck contained
six months' worth of hazardous material.

144
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,922
Without our distillation
and scrubbing process,

145
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:29,899
that much waste could fill Lake Erie.

146
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:33,332
So basically, you boil it down
to just the really dangerous stuff.

147
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,092
The spill was contained. My point is
that whenever there's an accident

148
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,247
involving GD technology and materials,

149
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,541
we have to rule out sabotage.

150
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:46,003
What would any one have to gain
with crashing a hazardous waste truck?

151
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,714
I don't know, Carter.
That would be your job.

152
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,866
Oh, make sure to note my elevated pulse.

153
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,886
And there's a mild tingling
in my left elbow.

154
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:56,721
It could be a pinched nerve.

155
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,234
Noted.

156
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:03,506
Morning. How's the driver doing?

157
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,753
Mr. Wyatt should be fine.

158
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,949
Suffered a mild concussion,
a few cracked ribs.

159
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,501
We're just running some more tests.

160
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:10,300
Nurse, more pillows.

161
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,791
But that boy... may die.

162
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,160
You're my first visitor.

163
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:22,747
- What are you... doing here?
- Recovering.

164
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,582
Checked myself in this morning.

165
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,668
- Recovering from what?
- Whiplash

166
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,620
from when you tackled me.

167
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,171
May wanna contact a lawyer.

168
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:33,285
You never cease to amaze me.

169
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,082
Thanks for stopping by, Jo.

170
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,738
You made my day.

171
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,764
Glad I could help, Fargo.

172
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,203
Mr. Wyatt.

173
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,883
Please, call me Jake.

174
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:47,997
I hear I owe you one
for pulling me outta that crash.

175
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:50,566
Tell you what... you don't sue me,
we'll call it even.

176
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,297
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

177
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,730
I was on my way to the waste repository.

178
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,468
I was heading down Euripides drive.

179
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,165
I... I must have blacked out.
Next thing, I woke up here.

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,712
Are you on any prescription medication,

181
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,245
- sleep aids?
- Oh, no, sir.

182
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,377
The strongest thing that I ingest is...

183
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,097
a cup of coffee in the morning and

184
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,295
a pint of beer at night.

185
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,436
- You're a man after my own heart.
- Not that we don't believe you,

186
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,643
but we will need your permission
to take a look around your home.

187
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:19,871
Oh, of course,
anything I can do to help.

188
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,472
I feel terrible about all this.

189
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,027
This may seem like an odd question.

190
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,061
Do you remember
your dreams from last night?

191
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,023
No. But they do have me
on some pretty heavy pain meds... why?

192
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,614
Just curious.

193
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,736
You know what? Rest up, get better.
If we have more questions,

194
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,800
- we'll come back, okay?
- I'll be here.

195
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,581
Shut up, Fargo.

196
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,248
What are you working on?

197
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,217
Do you know what it is you're making?

198
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,324
It's in my dreams.

199
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:03,596
It's in my dreams, too, Kev.

200
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,143
Can you help me understand what it is?

201
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,124
How's it going?

202
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,200
- Another one, huh?
- It's astonishing.

203
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,087
No matter what medium I give him,

204
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,359
the image is always the same,

205
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,489
down to the very last detail.

206
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,794
I wish I could see
what's going on inside of his head,

207
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,299
why this is happening to him.

208
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,680
I don't know, Allie,

209
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,712
but do not worry.

210
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,646
We'll figure this out.

211
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,362
Very soon.

212
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:53,050
Nice house.

213
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:57,537
Nice artwork.

214
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,674
Looks like Jake has a talent
for more than just

215
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:01,041
driving trucks.

216
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,775
Well, not many of us get to do

217
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:04,094
what we really want to do.

218
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,244
You mean this isn't your dream job?

219
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,273
Well, it's certainly not dull,
but who are we kidding? It's not...

220
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,966
pitching in the big leagues.

221
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,084
You ever want to do anything else?

222
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,808
Nice family.

223
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:22,755
Yeah, Jake and his wife
divorced last year.

224
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,011
Oh. That sucks.

225
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,599
Guess Jake and I have
a few things in common.

226
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,038
Same pay grade. G3.

227
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,254
A dancer.

228
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:39,102
What's that?

229
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,385
I wanted to be a dancer.

230
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:44,197
Really?

231
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,211
Really.

232
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,038
Wow. What happened?

233
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,668
You grow up with
three brothers and no mom,

234
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,672
uh, you learn to survive.

235
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,315
Well...

236
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:02,002
your secret's safe with me.

237
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,882
Josefina ballerina.

238
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,341
I will taser you.

239
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:09,897
Hey, who's the employer on
that check you got over there?

240
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,743
GD why?

241
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,689
I got a Descartes delivery for 30 hours

242
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,483
- last week.
- Jake's been moonlighting.

243
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,461
Which means he was
probably working nights.

244
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,071
Maybe he fell asleep at the wheel.

245
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,705
<i>Stay with me.</i>

246
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,414
All right, stay with me, buddy.

247
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:12,608
<i>Clear!</i>

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,539
<i>Come on, stay with me.</i>

249
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,757
Clear!

250
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,381
Okay, shock him again. charge to 400.

251
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,630
Clear.

252
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,193
Okay, that's it.

253
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:35,868
Time of death,

254
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,023
7:40 AM.

255
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,039
I don't understand.
You said he'd be fine.

256
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,990
With traumatic injuries, it's difficult
to see the extent of the damage.

257
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,852
And we won't know why
he stopped breathing

258
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,369
until I've done an autopsy.

259
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,558
I'll tell you why.

260
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,968
Because he died in the dream.

261
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,256
I saw the crash. you tried to save him.

262
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:10,193
Then I felt him slip away.

263
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:11,390
Fargo, that was a dream,

264
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,542
and given your accident,
it's not surprising.

265
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:15,643
Just to be clear,
Fargo didn't have an accident.

266
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,318
He avoided an accident.

267
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,157
The point is, I dream he dies,

268
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,739
a second later, he's flatling.

269
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:23,783
We frequently incorporate external
stimuli into our dreams... music,

270
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,282
alarm clocks.

271
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:27,901
You probably just heard the EKG, fargo.

272
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,737
Hold on. uh... excuse me.

273
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:32,645
What do you think?

274
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,309
You think that's what happened?

275
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:36,495
Actually...

276
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:38,577
No.

277
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,087
Okay.

278
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:43,666
Any particular reason why?

279
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,290
Because I had the exact same dream.

280
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:49,807
So did I.

281
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:56,607
<i>Honey, keep your voice down.</i>

282
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:58,493
<i>Don't tell me what to do.</i>

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,633
Okay, you wanna run that by me again?

284
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,046
Fargo and the head nurse

285
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,360
and three residents who sleep
in the lounge across the hall

286
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,621
all shared the same dream
about Jake's death.

287
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:09,776
How can that be?

288
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,399
We don't know. But they're not
the only ones to share dreams.

289
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:15,156
- We had disturbance calls all morning.
- Like what?

290
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,472
<i>Get her off me!</i>

291
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,655
- Like that.
- <i>Honey, it was just a dream.</i>

292
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,021
Do you mind?

293
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,068
Fine. But you're gonna get the next one.

294
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,957
<i>How do you like my husband now?</i>

295
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,982
<i>What the heck are you dreaming about?</i>

296
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,200
- Okay, what's going on?
- We don't know.

297
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:32,888
But we think it's tied
to the chemical spill.

298
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,256
Okay. Why?

299
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:37,345
Well... before it happened,
dreams weren't contagious.

300
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,915
- Dreams can't be contagious.
- Well, normally, I'd agree with you.

301
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:44,477
But since it's happened
to Jo and me and Fargo

302
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,518
and a boatload of other people,

303
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,147
I'm gonna have to say they can.

304
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,917
Now, the crash site
was close to a stream.

305
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,766
Maybe the spill contaminated
the water supply.

306
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,583
No, Eureka's water treatment
system would have detected it.

307
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,074
Unless someone didn't want it to.

308
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,387
You're the one who brought up sabotage.

309
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:04,515
All right, I'll have someone look at it
while Henry's doing the autopsy.

310
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,441
But there is no way that

311
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:09,084
a contagious dream killed Jake Wyatt.

312
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,004
It's Eureka.
Stranger things have happened.

313
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,086
There have been legitimate
studies done on shared dreams.

314
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,484
So it is possible.

315
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,858
Well, to an extent.
Subjects focused on the same topic

316
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:21,135
to induce shared dreaming
with some success. But...

317
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,674
we never had the exact same dream.

318
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,768
What you're talking about
is unprecedented.

319
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,773
And what are you working on here?

320
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,739
I'm developing a dream spectrometer.

321
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,145
it... it maps the electrical
impulse patterns of a person's dreams.

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,574
Layman's terms, doc. what's the upshot?

323
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,179
If dreams were television,

324
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:43,827
this would be the written transcript.

325
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:45,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

326
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,832
- What's this one about?
- I have no idea.

327
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,120
A... at this stage,

328
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,708
it's kinda like trying to decipher
a new language. We're working on it.

329
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,882
What about studies
related to dreams and death?

330
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:58,595
What about 'em?

331
00:17:58,742 --> 00:17:59,755
Is there any evidence

332
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,387
that dying in your dream can
cause your death in real life?

333
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:06,099
In bad hollywood horror movies,
maybe. But in reality,

334
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,309
absolutely not.

335
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,236
Are you certain?

336
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:10,979
I'd bet my life on it.

337
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,706
Kevin, honey,

338
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,106
where are you?

339
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:36,609
Kevin, honey, where are you?

340
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,103
I'm right here, mom.

341
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,804
Why didn't you answer me?
you had me worried.

342
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,973
I'm sorry, mom.
I wanted to show you something.

343
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,683
Well, where are we going?

344
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:49,957
It's a secret.

345
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:52,420
Honey, it's late, and I still
need to make dinner.

346
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,481
It'll only take a minute, I promise.

347
00:18:58,423 --> 00:18:59,527
Are you ready?

348
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,946
I don't know, Kevin. What's in there?

349
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:03,823
Everything.

350
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,101
It worked, honey.

351
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,541
It worked.

352
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,807
OK, now, who's next?

353
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,107
He sold our research
and took all the credit!

354
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,508
I dreamed of selling, OK?

355
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,876
- That doesn't count.
- Am I supposed to trust you?

356
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:15,548
Yes, you are. You never trusted...

357
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,087
I didn't slander her.

358
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,633
You called me a jackass. In front

359
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:21,401
- It was a dream!
- of the entire cryogenics team.

360
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,245
And I have 20 witnesses
who will back me up.

361
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,292
I didn't cheat. I swear.

362
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:29,472
You copied my test answers verbatim,
now we're both suspended.

363
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,427
Well, copying dream
answers shouldn't count.

364
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,564
It does when the teacher
dreamed you stealing them.

365
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:36,461
- <i>It's getting out of hand.</i>
- How many more shared dreams?

366
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,559
Hundreds. People are getting
too freaked out to sleep.

367
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:42,004
- Did the autopsy turn up anything?
<i>- The truck driver?</i>

368
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,219
Nothing obvious. I mean, he...

369
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,577
he just stopped breathing.

370
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,718
Let's look at
where the dream sharers live.

371
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,429
Maybe it's location based.

372
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,565
<i>All right.</i>

373
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:53,456
<i>All right, where is the spill?</i>

374
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:56,302
<i>Not even close.</i>

375
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,942
<i>Maybe it got into the water supply?</i>

376
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:02,163
No, I did that test myself.
There was no presence of CNS stimulants,

377
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:05,317
psychotropics or anything
that would explain this.

378
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:10,949
What are we missing?

379
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,062
Just checking some readings.

380
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:36,673
We have to stop.

381
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,592
OK. Why?

382
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,480
Other people are sharing dreams.

383
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:45,103
Allison, we'll be lucky
if this works on Kevin,

384
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,466
much less anyone else.

385
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,511
Did it?

386
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,116
- Did it work?
- That's not the point.

387
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,581
Of course it's the point.

388
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,250
We're trying to figure out
Kevin's connection to the artifact.

389
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,873
You said you would give anything

390
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,833
to know what's going on inside his head.

391
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:04,604
I've spent months
trying to give that to you.

392
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:07,747
Did it work?

393
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,454
Yes.

394
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:15,763
There has to be some connection

395
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:17,223
among these people.

396
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:21,602
Or a disconnection.

397
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,141
What?

398
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:26,906
No dreams were shared in here.

399
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,792
Where is that?

400
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:34,010
Now, here's your double-double
no-foam Sumatran latte.

401
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,012
Now, that should
keep you awake for a while.

402
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,331
Vincent.

403
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:39,285
Sheriff.

404
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,299
Have you had any...

405
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:43,750
odd dream experiences
in the last couple of days?

406
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,877
Sadly, no. I seem to be
missing out on all the fun.

407
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,862
Believe me, it's not so much fun.

408
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:51,672
Where do you sleep?

409
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,074
Upstairs in the loft.

410
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:55,928
I like to be close in case I get
the midnight urge to baste something.

411
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,389
Could we book your cafe for the night?

412
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,183
Sure. You having a party?

413
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:03,186
More of a sleepover.

414
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,617
We were here in your lab.

415
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,356
And he was just

416
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:09,358
this normal kid, happy and excited.

417
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,229
And he wanted to show me
something in the back.

418
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:13,996
What was it?

419
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,339
I don't know. It was like a vault.

420
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:19,427
I woke up before we had
a chance to go inside. But...

421
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,628
when I asked him, he said...

422
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:23,080
it was everything.

423
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,738
I think he might be right.

424
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,771
I don't understand.

425
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:30,921
For centuries,
we've been searching for a

426
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:33,546
unifying theory of everything.

427
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,819
A zero-point energy field
containing all...

428
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:38,887
knowledge and experience

429
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:40,383
from the beginning of time.

430
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,793
You're talking about the akashic field.

431
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:44,831
Yes. And I think...

432
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,953
the artifact is the antenna

433
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:49,398
for that field.

434
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,833
Are you saying that Kevin...

435
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,656
of all the people exposed
to the artifact explosion,

436
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:58,407
his was the only system
that didn't overload.

437
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,282
And his brain is wired
like no one else's.

438
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:03,924
Somehow, I think he's...

439
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:06,940
created a connection to the field...

440
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,406
that the rest of us can't.

441
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:12,129
What am I supposed to do now?

442
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:16,258
Let Kevin show you
what's inside the vault.

443
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,223
<i>Head to toe, people. Head to toe.</i>

444
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,834
And, yes, we still have space
behind the counter.

445
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,249
Man, she's good.

446
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,187
<i>So, Jack, I'm still not clear</i>

447
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,481
what your little experiment
is meant to accomplish.

448
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,556
We know that Cafe Diem
is a dream-free zone.

449
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,919
Everybody gathered here
has been sharing dreams.

450
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,300
So we're gonna test
whether it's the place or the people.

451
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:41,035
OK, so either everyone
will finally get a good night's sleep

452
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,826
or we could share the most
horrifying dream experience ever.

453
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,411
Yes.

454
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,900
All right, Sheriff. We've maximixed
the potential of our space.

455
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:51,582
Good.

456
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:53,086
Glad you're on that.

457
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,981
All right, people.

458
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,840
Lights out.

459
00:24:57,678 --> 00:24:58,716
What? No story?

460
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,285
Don't make me come over there.

461
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,685
You really wanna add
police brutality to the list?

462
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,524
Just go to sleep, Fargo.

463
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:25,217
I love watching him sleep.

464
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:28,745
He seems like just...

465
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:31,346
any other normal kid.

466
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:35,880
Would you really want him
to be like any other normal kid?

467
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:40,606
Sometimes.

468
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:43,261
There's nothing wrong with that.

469
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,221
Then why do I feel so guilty about it?

470
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,307
You want what's best for your son.

471
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:51,603
We both do.

472
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,280
Do we really?

473
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:59,093
I don't know, I...

474
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:01,842
I think you're still
fixated on the artifact

475
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,414
and your theory of everything.

476
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:04,805
And I think...

477
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,030
that I just want the feeling
that I had last night.

478
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,566
In Kevin's dream, we were so connected,

479
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:15,774
so normal.

480
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,227
He's always been so...

481
00:26:18,472 --> 00:26:20,072
different and brilliant.

482
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,471
And for the most part,
I love that about him. But...

483
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:25,844
different is hard. Brilliant is hard.

484
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:27,466
Hell, normal is hard.

485
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,371
And with everything else that...

486
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,313
So what do you want to do now, Allie?

487
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:39,233
I want to protect my son.

488
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,191
- Me too.
- But not at the risk of everyone else.

489
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,065
We have to stop.

490
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:48,584
Now, we have to tell Carter.

491
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,554
Allison, listen to me.

492
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,354
Whatever is happening in this town,

493
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:55,899
that signal

494
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,085
is not the cause.

495
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,598
Then turn it off,
and tomorrow we'll know.

496
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:13,692
No.

497
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,283
- I've made up my mind.
- So have I.

498
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:41,457
Hi, guys.

499
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:42,852
- Kinda busy.
- Yeah...

500
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,042
I need to talk to Allison.

501
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,400
About what?

502
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:48,159
About this.

503
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:51,776
Way to cut to the chase, Sheriff.

504
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,160
Direct, focused, efficient. Kudos.

505
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,355
Oh, dear.

506
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:57,779
That approach lacked confidence.

507
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,205
It was too tentative.
No woman likes that.

508
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,205
- True.
- Shocker.

509
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,542
Try it again, this time with confidence.

510
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:07,187
Hold her face with one hand.
Pull her in closely with the other.

511
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,152
The goal is efficiency of movement
to achieve maximum results.

512
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:13,584
I think... we may have different goals.

513
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:18,468
I'll make it easy for you.

514
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:34,930
Oh, my god.

515
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,081
Madre de dios!

516
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,595
- Could have been anyone's dream.
- Right.

517
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:41,181
Well, actually, he's got a point.

518
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,682
Oh, and I suppose that that whole

519
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,851
kissing mess wasn't
Carter's dream either.

520
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,061
Hey, it wasn't a mess.

521
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:48,684
- Actually...
- Nobody's asking you.

522
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:49,811
Or you.

523
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:53,876
All right.

524
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,103
So we've ruled out the waste,

525
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,742
the water, and the location.
It's gotta be us.

526
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,328
We're gonna have to start testing people
as soon as possible

527
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,228
All right, everybody.

528
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:05,059
We're moving to Global.

529
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,961
Dad, this woman won't wake up.

530
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:13,671
Sheriff, this one's out too.

531
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:15,882
I've got one over here.

532
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,218
Unconscious...
we must get them to the infirmary.

533
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:20,346
Collect your stuff
in an orderly fashion.

534
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:23,139
We're gonna move out
to Global as quick as we can. Go!

535
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:27,101
Thanks, I got it.

536
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,646
- Put the pressure on...
- That couldn't have hurt any more.

537
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:31,347
Tell me you found something.

538
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,275
I went back and reviewed the autopsy
and discovered that Jake Wyatt had

539
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:36,690
abnormally levels
of acetylcholine in his spinal fluid.

540
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,483
- Which is...
- A neural transmitter.

541
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,073
A chemical that allows your neurons to

542
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:42,784
communicate and your muscles
to flex and is essential to dreaming.

543
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,099
So the dream did kill him.

544
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,860
No. But elevated levels have
a devastating effect on neural function

545
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:50,144
and ultimately lead
to the loss of muscle control.

546
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,751
In this case, his diaphragm.

547
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:53,836
He suffocated in his sleep.

548
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,719
- I think I know where it's going.
- That's right. All the latest

549
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,120
victims have high levels...
including you.

550
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:03,002
And those levels are rising.

551
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:09,059
Let's work a little faster.
Joe, I'm gonna go talk to Paul Suenos.

552
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:13,682
Even if you could share dreams, it
wouldn't cause you to slip into a coma.

553
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,578
Six more people are unconscious,

554
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,752
and a lot of others
are headed in that direction,

555
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:18,903
including me.

556
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,782
Okay. What can I do?

557
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:27,322
First, we've to separate
the dreamers from the dreamees.

558
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,038
If I hook people up
to my spectrometer, we might see...

559
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,157
a difference in brain activity
during rem sleep.

560
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:34,643
The dreamers would likely experience
more than the watchers.

561
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:36,363
Good. Good...

562
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:37,838
We talk about hundreds of people.

563
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:41,383
Considering I only have two protypes,
that could take weeks.

564
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:46,968
You have two of these things?

565
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,892
- Where's the other one?
- It's right in here.

566
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:54,283
It's gone.

567
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,900
Told her to get a nanny cam.

568
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,735
Thanks.

569
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:08,268
- I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, me too.

570
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,244
Look, I know what's
causing the shared dreams,

571
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,735
and you have to...

572
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,074
stay calm.

573
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:19,260
It's the music thing

574
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:21,006
that Stark put in Kevin's room.

575
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:22,827
I know.

576
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,386
- You know?
- I should have told you sooner.

577
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,969
Yeah, you should have told me.

578
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,533
You protect Stark instead of the town?

579
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:32,309
No, I told him to turn it
off last night.

580
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:33,977
He was just trying to help me.

581
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,087
- Help you what?
- To protect Kevin.

582
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,942
To understand what's going on
in his head. And it worked.

583
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:40,378
Well, that's great.

584
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,736
You put yourself first, and a man died.

585
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:45,387
- Not from what we put in that room.
- You lied. You lied to me!

586
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,820
I know, and I'm sorry!

587
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,825
Something is happening to Kevin.

588
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,128
He is changing.

589
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,604
And it terrifies me.

590
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,250
You tell me you wouldn't
do the same if it was Zoe.

591
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,299
I think it's time to get Stark
to explain what the hell he did.

592
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:06,550
Don't you?

593
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:11,031
The receiver I adapted
from Suenos's device

594
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:12,412
visually interprets

595
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:14,516
electrical impulses
created during rem sleep.

596
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,600
So why is it messing with
our acetamophen levels?

597
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,645
- Acetylcholine.
- Don't push me.

598
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,098
There's no reason
it would affect one person,

599
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:22,400
much less half the town.

600
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,110
How many people show elevated levels?

601
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,357
50 total.

602
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,137
50 even?

603
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:28,257
Yeah. So?

604
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:30,571
Jo, you were taking
the dream statements?

605
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:34,370
Yeah. I had around 50 different dreams
that were shared by everyone else.

606
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,179
Well, they're the sources of the dreams.

607
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,751
- That's why their levels are so high.
- What do we know about these 50 people?

608
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,586
But my name isn't on there.

609
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,763
That's a good thing.

610
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:46,174
I know, because it means I wasn't
the one who had the man in black dream.

611
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,302
Well, it sure as hell wasn't me.

612
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,988
Oh, god.

613
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,518
Focus. Jake, you me,
we're all on the list, right?

614
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,855
So we're searching his house.
What did we find we had in common?

615
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:03,733
None of us realized our full potential?

616
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,643
Yes. But we're also the same pay grade.

617
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:12,163
G3. Can you run this list
and tell me who else is G3?

618
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,620
All of you.

619
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,955
So 50 people, same pay grade.
All with crank levels of

620
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,003
Acetylcholine.

621
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:20,791
Thanks. That's gotta mean something.

622
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,293
G3 refers to work schedule,
not pay level.

623
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,221
All the jobs have set hours, so overtime

624
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,011
doesn't compromise safety or security.

625
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,616
Like truck drivers.

626
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,342
Yes. Or reactor technicians,

627
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,720
weapon test specialists...
network engineers.

628
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,140
The... network.

629
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,990
What about it?

630
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:40,519
Childress was saying
she was working on some

631
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,766
sort of neural network?

632
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,107
Yeah. She's beta testing a system
of distributed computing with humans.

633
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,153
Okay. But given that Stark's

634
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,756
dream receiver isn't powerful enough
to caused shared dreaming,

635
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:54,167
could the neural network
be used as an amplifier?

636
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:55,739
It's possible.

637
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:57,298
We should shut it down.

638
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,955
- Do it fast.
- You're not coming?

639
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,165
I would...

640
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,024
but I can't move my legs.

641
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:15,794
We'll take care of her. don't worry.

642
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,003
You should go with the others.

643
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,778
I'd rather stay with you,
if you don't mind.

644
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:27,042
No. No, I don't mind.

645
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:31,737
<i>We all sleep a third of our lives away.</i>

646
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,519
I figured why not find a way
to use our brains during our down time?

647
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:37,075
Yeah, sure, why not?

648
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,537
I created a wireless network
of test subjects

649
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,227
with regular sleep schedules.

650
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:43,749
Yeah. G3 employees.

651
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,892
Yeah.

652
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:47,460
See, everyone's brainwaves
have a distinct signature.

653
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,083
Theirs are programmed in the network,
so when they're asleep,

654
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:52,220
I can tap into their minds
from this computer,

655
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,009
use the combined power to problem solve.

656
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:58,471
Wait a second.
You're taking people's brain power?

657
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:02,023
No, Sheriff.
Just tapping into unused potential.

658
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,991
And it's in everyone's contract
that they may be randomly selected

659
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,215
for double blind case studies
from time to time.

660
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,287
I told you to read your contract
carefully before you signed it.

661
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:14,313
And I'm guessing you've randomly
tapped into, say, 50 of them?

662
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,948
Exactly. They're essentially
wireless transmitters.

663
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,917
And everything we dreamed has
been networked to everyone else.

664
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:21,912
- It doesn't work that way.
- Not by itself.

665
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,952
But in combination with
Dr. Stark's dream device, maybe.

666
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:28,042
But why the sudden
buildup of acetylcholine?

667
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,285
Probably lack of sleep.

668
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,469
The people were selected based
on the regularity of sleep patterns.

669
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,545
But Jake's been secretly
doing double shifts,

670
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:37,051
and no one in town's been
sleeping normally this week.

671
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,754
We'll shut down the network immediately.

672
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:43,501
That won't solve the buildup
of acetylcholine in the test subjects.

673
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:46,894
Their bodies are overproducing
the compound like a hyperactive gland.

674
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:51,190
Clean the system of the compound, it may
reset the body's rate of production.

675
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,634
Okay, good. Let's do that.

676
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:53,898
The excess neurotransmitters

677
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,695
are acting like toxins in your body,

678
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,697
and I have no idea
how we scrub that out.

679
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,909
So GD has the most advanced
waste reduction system in the world,

680
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:04,453
but we can't clean this out of us?

681
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:08,875
Maybe we can.

682
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:13,671
You gotta be kidding me.

683
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,816
It's an oxygenation filtration system.

684
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,508
It should remove the excess
acetylcholine from your system.

685
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,916
In theory.

686
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:21,447
In theory.

687
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:25,016
Once you're inside, we'll flood
the chamber with an oxygen-rich plasma.

688
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,263
It's gonna take a moment to adjust.

689
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,374
You have to breathe
the fluid into your lungs, but

690
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,104
the chemical reaction will do the rest.

691
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:33,357
And if it doesn't?

692
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:36,229
You'll drown.

693
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:39,291
Well, this just gets better and better.

694
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:21,822
Just breathe in, Carter,

695
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,717
slow and easy.

696
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,622
You've got to take
the fluid into your lungs.

697
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,875
- We have to get him out of there.
- Wait.

698
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:38,717
Nathan, he's going to drown!

699
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:44,761
Come on, Carter.

700
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,717
His acetylcholine levels are dropping.

701
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:59,272
Oxygen's on the rise.

702
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:00,610
He's gonna be okay.

703
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,689
He's gonna be fine.

704
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:04,998
And we have a cure.

705
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,659
Which means we can keep moving
forward with our research.

706
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,043
Let's get everyone up here and get them
in treatment as soon as possible.

707
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:32,557
Morning, Henry.

708
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:34,607
Hey, Jack, how you feeling?

709
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:36,771
I got a total body enema.

710
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:40,733
Thank you for that... very vivid image.

711
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,642
Actually, I'm just glad to have
my dreams back to myself.

712
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:45,350
Think a lot of people feel the same way.

713
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,373
Those were some disturbing images, huh?

714
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:49,190
Yes, that one of your...

715
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,937
birthmark is particularly haunting.

716
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,109
You know, there was... one

717
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,447
that was so familiar,
it was like <i>deja vu</i>.

718
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,628
Uh, you, me, and we're in the garage.

719
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,041
And you said...

720
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,686
"i'll make it easy for you."

721
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:06,319
and...

722
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:08,803
there was a big flash of light.

723
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:13,371
I don't know.

724
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,738
I don't know. Dreams are funny that way.

725
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,045
Sports?

726
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:21,387
Yeah.

727
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:23,471
You know me so well.
