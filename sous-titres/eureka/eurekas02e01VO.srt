1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,585
Previously on Eureka.

2
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:02,651
Relax, Carter.

3
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:03,868
It's a promotion.

4
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:06,779
You know, sometimes it sucks
having a dad who's the town Smokey.

5
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:09,991
Well, sometimes it sucks having
a daughter who's the town delinquent.

6
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:11,202
Dog!

7
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,673
- I'm Jack Carter.
- He's a U.S. Marshal.

8
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:16,327
I was an engineer.

9
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:18,161
- Trains?
- Space shuttles.

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,007
Allison Blake, Department of Defense.

11
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,068
- Where are you taking me?
- Welcome to Eureka.

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,005
A haven where
the world's greatest thinkers

13
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:26,221
could live and work.

14
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:28,558
You must be the new sheriff
I heard about. Nathan Stark.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,347
- You two have a history?
- Not exactly. He's my husband.

16
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:34,162
That Section Five's restricted to
military projects only.

17
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:37,155
We happen to be in the most advanced
scientific facility in the world.

18
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,803
The Artefact is the last remnant

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,235
of whatever universe existed
before our own.

20
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:44,281
- What's happening in there?
- I don't know. Systems are offline!

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,784
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

22
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,192
Henry, what did you do?

23
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:54,723
I couldn't let you go.

24
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,681
None of what we've known for the past
four years was supposed to happen.

25
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:01,104
Henry went back and changed history

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,758
thereby creating a paradox.

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,177
We need to stop Henry from saving Kim.

28
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:06,626
Someone's gotta go back.

29
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,113
I love our life. I love this baby.

30
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:12,966
There's no time, no way,
that we don't end up together.

31
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:15,413
October 3, 2006.

32
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,337
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping you.

33
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,934
I have to save her.
Get the hell out of the way!

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,073
I think this is definitely
becoming a thing.

35
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,506
We don't have a thing.

36
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:28,996
We might.

37
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:40,246
We are at marginal proximity now.

38
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,005
No change in core temperature
or ambient emissions.

39
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,302
Let's proceed.

40
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,966
Extreme proximity now.

41
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:03,438
Still no reaction from the Artifact.

42
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,684
Moment of truth.

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,201
What's happening in there?

44
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:23,338
I don't know! Systems are offline!

45
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,732
Get 'em back online!

46
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,373
I'm trying!

47
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,001
Oh, my God.

48
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,126
I thought I'd find you here.

49
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,563
You're not returning my phone calls.

50
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,386
I didn't feel much like...

51
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:20,521
talking.

52
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,555
You know, you can't keep reliving this.

53
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,853
It's been over a month.

54
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,273
I know.

55
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,814
I can't bring Kim back...

56
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,736
either.

57
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,898
Well, you could. But...

58
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:37,399
not without
unraveling the universe, so...

59
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,080
Sorry.

60
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:40,880
Look.

61
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:45,463
You and I are gonna be living with
the memory of a timeline that's gone.

62
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:48,351
I know it's gonna seem impossible.

63
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,675
And... I know it's not
gonna happen overnight.

64
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,151
But...

65
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,926
I think that you and I should help
each other move on.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,881
I mean, don't you?

67
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,112
Working on it.

68
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:26,314
Then the Phoenix appears.

69
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,430
The firebird,

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,068
rising from the ashes.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,951
A mythical symbol of death

72
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,394
and rebirth.

73
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:38,048
Mythical is right.

74
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,126
Phoenix is about as real as Bigfoot.

75
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:46,810
History and cultures are chock-a-block
with stories of the Phoenix.

76
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:51,444
Its sacrifice to the flames
begins our salvation.

77
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,571
Lest we suffer the flames ourselves.

78
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,535
So show a little respect, lad.

79
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,806
Okay.

80
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,285
Another refill, Vincent.

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,902
That is my famous
five-alarm chili, Wayne.

82
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,515
You may wanna go easy.

83
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,287
Try a lobster button.

84
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,842
I been fighting a cold.

85
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:27,480
Spicy food cleanses the evil spirits.

86
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,025
The hotter the better.

87
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:30,241
All right.

88
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,069
Don't say I didn't warn you.

89
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:38,161
So why don't you just go talk to him?

90
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:40,880
I can't.

91
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,504
You know, everything is all
weird with us now.

92
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:46,169
Maybe it was just a one-time thing.

93
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,645
You know, adrenaline,

94
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,162
heat of the moment.

95
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,175
Making out with Taggart?

96
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,075
More like a moment of insanity.

97
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,373
Not so loud.

98
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,111
Look, I really need some
outside perspective here.

99
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,287
Please?

100
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:02,651
You want perspective?

101
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,783
You hooked up with a guy
whose age difference with you

102
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,758
is the same as me and my dad.

103
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,068
That did it.

104
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,899
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

105
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,962
You need something, Fargo?

106
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,725
What? Uh, no. I mean,

107
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,326
I was, just gonna go get some food.

108
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:44,296
Do you want anything?

109
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,471
I'm good.

110
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:48,697
Okay, then.

111
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,678
I didn't expect to see you here.

112
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,755
I didn't expect to be here. But...

113
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,959
my ears finally stopped ringing.
I thought I could use the distraction.

114
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,153
- Well, it's good that you came.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,999
So how are your burns healing?

116
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,407
Surprisingly well, actually.

117
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,451
My last treatment's tomorrow.

118
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:11,823
I take it there's no news
from the disciplinary committee?

119
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,000
It's the Department of Defense.
Nothing happens quickly.

120
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,686
Well, it was my call
to sample the Artifact.

121
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,517
Kim Anderson died as a result.

122
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,581
As did the Artifact.

123
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:24,671
Someone has to take the fall.

124
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,762
It was an accident.
Let's just wait to see

125
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,574
what the results are before
we jump to worst-case scenarios.

126
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,133
Gonna head back to the lab.

127
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,140
Take one last look at the Artifact,
just in case.

128
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:39,432
I don't think you should necessarily
forget about what happened.

129
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,302
I think it'd be wrong. It'd be horrible.

130
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,240
But I do think that we should
look on the positive side.

131
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,990
- Positive?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,629
Like...

133
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,342
Like... the little things.

134
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,726
For the next four years we're gonna know
which movies suck before they come out.

135
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,681
We're gonna know
where bad guys are gonna do

136
00:07:56,763 --> 00:07:58,432
bad things before they even happen.

137
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:02,013
We're gonna know, the outcome
to every major sporting event.

138
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,229
Huge financial upside.

139
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:06,263
Jack, I don't think you understand.
That life is gone.

140
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:07,944
We are not likely to relive

141
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,381
many of the same events again.

142
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:12,526
Well, I've had this picnic before.

143
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,274
Right? As a matter of fact, tonight

144
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,059
is the night when
I first ask Allison out.

145
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,444
I remember that, because
Vincent was right over there

146
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,234
making the same lobster balls.

147
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,959
- Buttons.
- But...

148
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:24,611
Whatever... it...

149
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,863
And, see the sweaty Asian guy here?

150
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,773
He's gonna trip on that kid's

151
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,767
hover thing and spill his chili
all over that guy's T-shirt.

152
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,446
And I know that, 'cos tomorrow,
when I go to the dry cleaners

153
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,127
to get my clothes for the date,

154
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,901
he's gonna be complaing about
how the stains didn't come out of his

155
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,172
favorite T-shirt.

156
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:46,786
You have to take a step back.

157
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:49,779
Granted, some things may occur
in a similar way.

158
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,016
But they are going
to diverge more and more.

159
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,149
- No...
- You lived through four years

160
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,322
of a timeline that was erased
because you stopped me

161
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,674
from doing the thing
that created it... saving Kim.

162
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,107
And the fact that
we're having this conversation

163
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,936
means things are going to change.

164
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,095
Everybody get ready!

165
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,546
The moment...

166
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,582
has arrived.

167
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,441
There she is.

168
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,915
The firebird.

169
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,351
So far, everything's happened

170
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,963
exactly the way it did last time.

171
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,487
Including the fact
that I still can't see

172
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,761
Taggart's crazy firebird.

173
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,510
Okay, that's new.

174
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,715

- Saison 2 | Episode 1 -
Phoenix Rising (v 1.1)

180
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,509
So no one saw what happened?

181
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,709
No, all our eyewitnesses
were staring at the sun.

182
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,413
There's not much tissue left, but
I can run a DNA sample and get an I.D.

183
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,327
No, I know who it is.

184
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:16,487
It's, fat, sweaty Asian guy.

185
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,701
- What?
- Carter!

186
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,762
I'm being descriptive.
If I knew his name, I'd use it.

187
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,154
His name is Kwan. Wayne Kwan.

188
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,917
What?

189
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,257
Are you sure?

190
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,979
Yeah. He was on his third bowl of chili.

191
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:31,302
Fourth, if you count the one
he spilled on Dr. Brock.

192
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:33,694
- You okay?
- That's Kevin's occupational therapist.

193
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,279
He's been working with him for years.

194
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,862
I don't know how I'm gonna
tell Kevin that he's gone.

195
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,803
What's up?

196
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,386
Hum... So, what...
he get too close to a barbecue?

197
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,534
None nearby.

198
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:44,853
Drop a cigarette?

199
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,729
Wayne was asthmatic.
He never touched them

200
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,439
Vincent... do you have any special
ingredients in that five-alarm chili?

201
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:55,215
- Like what?
- I don't know. Alcohol, rocket fuel.

202
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,760
Whatever else you cook {\up }in that lab
you call a kitchen.

203
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:00,153
I'll have you know I come
by my spice naturally.

204
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:03,748
Without a doubt. But {\ that guy}he ate three bowls
of your chili and burst into flames.

205
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,895
So if it's not too much trouble,
I'd love a sample.

206
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,543
Cool. Help yourself.

207
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,759
- Any of you wanna test it for me?
- It's what I live for.

208
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,000
- There is another possibility.
- What's that?

209
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,962
Oh, you're not buying into Taggart's
crazy firebird fairy tales?

210
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,335
You've got to admit,
the timing was a little disturbing.

211
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,630
There are documented incidents

212
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,157
of combustion when certain
chemicals are exposed to sunlight.

213
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:32,006
But in this case, most of them
would have been in his GI tract.

214
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,746
He also spilled a bowl, so...

215
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,261
So maybe there is something
to this Phoenix thing.

216
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,857
Fine.

217
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,432
Go talk to Taggart.
But don't get your hopes up.

218
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:44,668
Uh... talk to Taggart?

219
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,316
By myself?

220
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,858
Why, do you have a problem with that?

221
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,017
No...

222
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,736
you just never let me
follow up on my own leads.

223
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,523
Jo, you've done this
dozens of times over the years.

224
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,223
What years?

225
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,634
Well, I... you know.

226
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,712
I mean, no time like the present.

227
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:05,977
It's, uh...

228
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,239
I have every confidence in you.

229
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,486
Uh... great.

230
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,659
See? We're not in Kansas anymore.

231
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,034
How's Kevin doing?

232
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:37,989
I asked Beverly to come over
and help him process the news.

233
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,920
Kevin, has your mom told you
what happened to Wayne?

234
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,642
He's gone.

235
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,085
Yeah.

236
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,988
Yeah, I'm afraid he is.

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,817
How do you feel about that?

238
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,964
Will I still see the other man?

239
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,067
What other man?

240
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,244
The man downstairs.

241
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:06,988
- Do you know who he's talking about?
- His sessions were always one-on-one.

242
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,851
Kevin, can you tell me
the name of the man?

243
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:15,723
Kevin?

244
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:17,996
I don't know.

245
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:20,980
Okay.

246
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:30,044
I don't wanna push him.

247
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:33,133
It's an awful lot for him
to process at one time.

248
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:36,631
He may even be making up
this other man as a defense mechanism.

249
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,319
Well, thanks for coming by, Beverly.
We really appreciate it.

250
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:45,932
And... by "we," I mean...

251
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,758
just... all of us.

252
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:49,549
You know, in Eureka.

253
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,787
It takes a village.

254
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,601
Okay. I might be making a lot
of house calls in this village today.

255
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,818
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thank you, Beverly.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,008
Hey, it's Carter.

257
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,276
I just talked to Taggart, and he thinks
he may know what happened with Wayne.

258
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,579
All right, I'll be right there.

259
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,721
I call it the Phoenix Effect.

260
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,761
When the firebird appears, solar flares
emit high-energy exotic meson particles.

261
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,169
Under the right atmospheric conditions,

262
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,917
you can get spontaneous combustion.

263
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,876
Is that human?

264
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:45,827
Of course it is.

265
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,015
Freshly-ground skin grafts
from the bio-chem burn unit.

266
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,157
Now watch.

267
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,258
Uni-directional meson particle emitter.

268
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:05,347
Turn up the juice, and...

269
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,920
The Phoenix... rises.

270
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,205
I hate you.

271
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,967
You're welcome.

272
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,539
Well, mystery solved.

273
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:40,623
Except why did it only
happen to Wayne Kwan?

274
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,952
Interesting point.

275
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,616
I'm gonna go shower.

276
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,725
I'm covered in human.

277
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,542
Dad, it's been 20 minutes.

278
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:58,362
- I need you to take me to the concert.
- I'll be out in a minute.

279
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,041
Allison Blake is calling, Sheriff.

280
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,312
Oh, great, put her through!

281
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,170
Oh, yeah, please, take your time!

282
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,533
Hey, Allison, can you hear me?

283
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,194
Um, uh, yeah.
I can do more than hear you.

284
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,514
Oh, sorry, yeah.

285
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:12,812
- Hey.
- Hey?

286
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:14,983
Can you put that away, please?

287
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,245
Oh!

288
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:19,715
Right, um... S.A.R.A.H.,
no video phone in the bathroom!

289
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,517
Any idea what happened
to Wayne Kwan yet?

290
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:23,815
Henry's testing the chili,

291
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:26,210
and Taggart thinks the fire
was caused by an eclipse.

292
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,805
- Uh, that's impossible.
- Yeah.

293
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,557
He has impressive visuals, though. Um,

294
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:35,519
anything more on the man downstairs
that Kevin was talking about?

295
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:38,418
No, I checked Global.
Wayne wasn't working with anyone else.

296
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,648
I don't know, maybe...

297
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:42,323
maybe Kevin did make it up.

298
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,265
Huh. Do you have access
to the GD phone records?

299
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:48,318
- Yeah. Why?
- I figure if we can find out

300
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,521
who he was talking to,
it might tell us something.

301
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,356
All right, hold on while I pull it up.

302
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,462
All right. Take your time.

303
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:57,609
Okay, you know what?
Now you're just mocking me.

304
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,077
Drive yourself.

305
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,898
- Really?
- Yeah, but...

306
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:10,639
if you're not home by 11:00,

307
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:12,941
- you will be sleeping in a jail cell.
- Carter...

308
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,477
I'm not gonna make her
sleep in a jail cell.

309
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,596
She's only 15.

310
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:19,580
Right.

311
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,818
Which obviously means

312
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,666
- you don't have a license.
- Yeah, well,

313
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,908
- I won't tell if you don't.
- I was testing you.

314
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,384
- And I'm disappointed. You failed.
- Carter,

315
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:30,191
there are a bunch of calls
to a chemist. Rob Matthew.

316
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,733
But he works in Section Five.

317
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,598
Why would he be talking
to Kevin's therapist?

318
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,663
Nice place.

319
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,279
Yeah, Section Five guys say

320
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,718
they don't get the best houses.
But they do.

321
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:51,960
Well, I live in an underground bunker
that has more opinions than my ex-wife.

322
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:54,675
Hey, I'm thrilled just to have a window.

323
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,903
Do you smell smoke?

324
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,783
Is everything okay?

325
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,349
Oh, no.

326
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,413
Guess that would explain
why he didn't answer his phone.

327
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,056
If Taggart's right about the Phoenix,
everyone could be in danger.

328
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,381
It's not the stupid Phoenix.

329
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:10,752
After everything we've seen,
how can you say for sure?

330
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,923
Well, because Taggart said
the combustion was caused

331
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,256
by meson particles
coming from a solar flare.

332
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:18,336
I'm no astrophysicist, but I don't think
there are a lot of solar flares

333
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,292
- inside a house.
- He's right.

334
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,693
Really?

335
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,681
Could you not act so surprised?

336
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,696
Think of it as getting a sunburn.

337
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,591
The sun's rays burn you
from the outside in.

338
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,547
This guy's burned from the inside out.

339
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:33,324
Now, this is where
the initial combustion happened.

340
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:36,088
Radiating from here. The frontal lobes.

341
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:37,862
So their own minds did this to them?

342
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:41,108
Yeah, it's like a power surge
in the body's electrical system.

343
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,383
Think of the brain as the microprocessor
and the body as the motherboard.

344
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,618
So... then food
would be the energy source.

345
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,013
Great... have you tested
Vince's chili yet?

346
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,267
Digesting the beans in the chili would

347
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,752
release methane, which is
extremely flammable.

348
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:58,713
Except then, the burning would
have started in the GI tract, and not

349
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,005
in the brain.

350
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:04,125
So we're back to they just burst
into flames for no apparent reason.

351
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,674
Everything has a reason. We just...

352
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:08,582
haven't figured it out yet.

353
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,696
Maybe that's the thing
we should be looking for.

354
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,501
What's the thing?

355
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:17,568
Well, all this time we've been assuming
that it was an accident.

356
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,696
What if someone had
a reason to want them dead?

357
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,546
That should do it, Dr. Stark.

358
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,152
You can't even see the scars.

359
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:32,262
Yeah...

360
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:33,896
all better.

361
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,439
Time for your monthly Botox injection?

362
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:38,095
Hello, Sheriff.

363
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,532
Really? No comeback?

364
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:42,941
Just not in the mood.

365
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:44,854
All right.

366
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,930
There was another fire last night.

367
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:50,377
This time, we lost a researcher
named Rob Matthew.

368
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,960
- What the hell's going on?
- I'm trying to figure it out.

369
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,743
Two guys burn to death within
eight hours. I'm guessing it's related.

370
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,155
Were they working together?

371
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,699
I doubt they even knew each other.

372
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,549
Wayne was an occupational
therapist in Section One.

373
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,773
Dr. Matthew studied
biotechnology in Section Five.

374
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:07,585
We found a number
of interoffice phone calls between them.

375
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,487
They must be talking about something.

376
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,599
Can't imagine what it would be.

377
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,156
I'm gonna need a list of names.
Anyone they have contact with. Friends,

378
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:18,060
family, coworkers, enemies, all of it.

379
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:19,527
You think someone did this to them?

380
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:22,162
When something seems
too coincidental, it usually is.

381
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:26,702
Dr. Stark is one of the finest
scientists Eureka has ever known.

382
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:30,298
And I think that his past contributions
should be considered in your review.

383
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:33,730
Yet the fact remains that Dr. Stark's
decision to sample the Artifact

384
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,575
cost millions of dollars in damage,

385
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,323
and the life of another of
Eureka's finest scientists.

386
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:40,427
Eureka is a place where
we push the boundaries

387
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,573
of human understanding every day.
And it is...

388
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,347
hypocritical to punish
Dr. Stark for doing his job.

389
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:48,614
Are you speaking as a
D.O.D. liaison or his wife?

390
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,145
Ex-wife.

391
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:53,411
And I believe that my track record shows
that our personal history has never

392
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,686
interfered with my
professional judgment.

393
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,213
Given the magnitude of this incident,
I'm afraid the committee has no choice

394
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:02,425
but to appoint a new head of
Global Dynamics, effective immediately.

395
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,719
Why would anyone want to kill them

396
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,496
in such a public way?

397
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:11,650
I don't know.

398
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:14,727
I guess that's where this thing
called investigating comes in.

399
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,498
I need to know who they work with and
what kind of research they were doing.

400
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,214
- What's wrong?
- Trouble logging in. System error.

401
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,515
Sure you have access?

402
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,851
There's nothing in this facility
I don't have access to.

403
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,818
- Hey, Allie.
- Cart...

404
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,568
I'm trying something
a little less formal.

405
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,083
- I'd prefer you didn't.
- So would I.

406
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,926
I can't get in the database.
Any idea what's wrong?

407
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:44,032
The committee has reached a decision.

408
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:47,572
And you're the messenger?

409
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:48,911
I'm sorry, Nathan.

410
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,798
Have they found my replacement yet?

411
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,510
Actually, they have.

412
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,161
Anyone I know?

413
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,364
Yes.

414
00:23:58,113 --> 00:23:59,357
Me.

415
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:10,974
- This isn't right.
- I'll say.

416
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,403
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- I didn't mean that.

417
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,841
I defended you, Nathan.

418
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:17,299
Looks like you defended me
right into a promotion for you.

419
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,048
The only reason you're
not being redacted

420
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,562
and escorted to the city limits
is because of me.

421
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:22,883
So I should be thanking you?

422
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:25,158
- Guys, bigger issues...
- Damn right you should be.

423
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,678
You were obsessed with the Artifact,

424
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,458
and it cost Kim's life.
I mean, what did you expect?

425
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,215
I don't know.

426
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:32,758
Not this.

427
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,135
- Good luck, Allison.
- Nathan, uh...

428
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,684
Fine. What do we do?

429
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,780
Well, we cross-check anyone
Wayne Kwan or Rob Matthew

430
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,090
had in common, to see
if they were targeted.

431
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:47,984
You okay?

432
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,966
Yeah, let's just...

433
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,160
let's just find those names. Sure.

434
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,002
I don't know if this helps,

435
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,487
but I believe things work out
the way they're supposed to.

436
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:04,137
You just have to have a little faith.

437
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,638
Yeah, well...

438
00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:09,537
I don't have a lot of faith these days.

439
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:15,897
G- go back. I know that guy.

440
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,118
That's the guy Wayne
spilled his chili on yesterday.

441
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:22,385
Ryan Brock, biotech, Section Five.
He worked with Dr. Matthew.

442
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,676
What'd they work on?

443
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,735
The origins of the Artifact.

444
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:29,620
That thing's been nothing but trouble.

445
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,028
Tell me about it.

446
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,510
I've seen him somewhere else too.

447
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,241
Hi, this is Allison Blake. Can you send
Dr. Brock up to see me, please?

448
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,428
Really? When?

449
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:42,704
Okay, thank you.

450
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,783
He left for the day. With a fever.

451
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,882
- Good afternoon, Dr. Stark.
- Good afternoon.

452
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,098
Is there a problem?

453
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,426
Sorry, sir. For some reason
your access is coming up denied.

454
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,934
Well, I'm pretty sure it's me.
Why don't you just perform an override?

455
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,667
Regulations require special
authorization for that, sir.

456
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:18,540
And who would you get
that special authorization from?

457
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:21,397
You.

458
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,584
Gotta love the irony.

459
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,960
Hey, Jo, it's Carter. You copy?

460
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,677
Lupo. What's up? Over.

461
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,040
Keep your eye out for a Dr. Ryan Brock.

462
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,814
- He's gonna be driving...
- a black Subaru Forester.

463
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:36,928
What'd Brock do?

464
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:37,990
More was done to him.

465
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:40,901
Just like Wayne and Matthew.
We might have another fire brewing.

466
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:42,679
We're gonna go to his house right now.

467
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:43,881
Got it. Over.

468
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,802
Wait, the...

469
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:51,394
Scratch that. We're gonna
stop at the dry cleaner.

470
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,103
Wait, wait... how do you know that?

471
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:55,144
Well, I bumped into Brock
at the dry cleaner

472
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:57,016
the day we had our first...

473
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,039
First what?

474
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,659
Nothing.

475
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,286
I just know.

476
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,367
- It's Brock.
- Damn.

477
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,048
What's he doing over there?

478
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,484
Hey! Glad we could catch up with you.
You okay?

479
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,821
He's burning up.
I'll call the paramedics.

480
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:31,926
Actually, I'm not feeling so hot.

481
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,518
- Maybe get a fire extinguisher.
- Yeah.

482
00:27:35,092 --> 00:27:36,787
Fire extinguisher?
What's happening to me?

483
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:40,040
We don't know, it's the same thing that
happened to Wayne Kwan and Rob Matthew.

484
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:42,288
- Rob too?
- Yeah.

485
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,001
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, who would wanna do this to you?

486
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,819
- I don't know.
- Take a seat.

487
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:50,565
Everyone, clear now!

488
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:58,225
Over here, this way. Over here.

489
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,870
- Carter, we try to save him.
- I screwed up.

490
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,267
If I'd been...

491
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:16,150
a little sooner, I...

492
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:20,209
I'm having trouble keeping the...

493
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,601
times straight. Everything's changed.

494
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,130
What are you talking about?
What's changed?

495
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,331
No, just...

496
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:28,162
something Henry was saying.

497
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:35,643
What about him?

498
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,038
That's where I've seen Brock before.

499
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:39,370
Oh, man.

500
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,318
Hey, Henry. Whatcha workin' on?

501
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:53,463
Jack, hey.

502
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:55,150
Just tinke.

503
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,999
What's up?

504
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,163
That's what I'm trying
to find out. And I...

505
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,551
sincerely hope I'm wrong.

506
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:03,783
About what?

507
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:07,309
Could you run the hologram?
Just... there's something I need to see.

508
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:08,675
I thought you wanted me to

509
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,302
leave it off. Move on and all that.

510
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:13,091
I did, but I just realized
what our victims have in common.

511
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,908
So... turn it on.

512
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,699
Please.

513
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:36,906
Stop it there.

514
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:51,012
It's them.

515
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:52,529
It's Brock and Matthew.

516
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,427
Hey, look at that.

517
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,735
You're telling me you didn't know?

518
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,469
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that everybody in this room

519
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,558
could be held responsible
for Kim's death.

520
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,173
I ruled out the accident.

521
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,889
I ruled out the eclipse.

522
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:11,812
I ruled out the chili,
or should I say, you did.

523
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,528
You think I'm capable of murder?

524
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:16,513
You risked the universe for her once.
What, is it really that different?

525
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,891
Taking a risk and taking a life
are two different things!

526
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:20,679
- I am incapable of the latter.
- Really?

527
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:23,119
- Even for Kim?
- Especially for Kim!

528
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,348
What are you working on over there?

529
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,284
- Not what you think.
- Knowing the lengths you went

530
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:32,664
to last time to bring her back,
what do you think I think?

531
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:34,436
Even if I did blame those men,

532
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,350
what motivation could I possibly have

533
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:39,376
to kill Kevin's therapist?
He wasn't even there!

534
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:45,965
You're right.

535
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:53,219
Unless he was. We can see
everybody in the room.

536
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,537
Just...

537
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,757
can you fast forward this for a second?

538
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,807
- Please. You don't have to watch it.
- Yes, I do.

539
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,040
Okay, stop it there.

540
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,307
Can I see the other side of the room?

541
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,573
Okay.

542
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:27,442
This might be a stupid question,
but what exactly killed her?

543
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,904
A concentrated burst
of particulate radiation.

544
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:32,739
Like... like a...

545
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,242
A shotgun blast.

546
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,376
Shotgun.

547
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:39,565
What's on the other side?

548
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:42,552
Another lab. You'll have to look
at a building schematic... why?

549
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:45,723
My first year as a marshal,
I tracked this guy down to a hotel.

550
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,046
I kick in the front door. He comes out
of the bathroom firing, just...

551
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,399
barely missing me.

552
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,453
But the woman in the next room
wasn't so lucky.

553
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:55,243
Stray bullet.

554
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,047
Yeah.

555
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,774
We have to find out if
someone was on the other side.

556
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:03,056
Does this mean you believe me now?

557
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:07,143
It doesn't matter what I believe.

558
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,007
But the lab behind the blast wall
wasn't damaged in the accident.

559
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:16,046
Well, not that we know of.
Keep scrolling.

560
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:18,820
The radiation from the Artifact
is unlike anything we saw before.

561
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:21,007
We don't have equipment
sophisticated to measure it.

562
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:24,137
Which means that some of it could have
passed through the wall undetected.

563
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,886
There, just, now... who...

564
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,226
who works in that lab?

565
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,916
Dr. Matthew.

566
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:32,748
Who was exchanging frequent phone calls

567
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,483
with Kevin's therapist.

568
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,408
Can you tell if anyone was
in there at the time of the accident?

569
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:40,586
Yeah, uh, each lab in Section Five

570
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:43,743
has a biometric security scanner.
I can pull up the entry log.

571
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,504
I can't believe it. It's Wayne.

572
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,759
Look at the time code.
He should have been in therapy.

573
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,160
What was he doing in there?

574
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,224
He was visiting the man downstairs.

575
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:54,110
My God, Kevin could have been with him.

576
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,518
Wait, where is he now?

577
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:57,404
In session with Beverly, Section One.

578
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,958
There was someone else in the chamber.
Nathan is the last man standing.

579
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:04,027
- Well, he won't be for long.
- I'll have security help you find him.

580
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,977
Get him to cryogenics
while there's still time.

581
00:34:01,117 --> 00:34:02,415
Everything looks fine.

582
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,354
We'll keep him under observation
just to be on the safe side.

583
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:06,515
Thank you.

584
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,307
They found Dr. Stark.

585
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,043
Can you watch him, please?

586
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:15,743
We have to cool him down.

587
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:17,069
I was so close.

588
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:18,668
So close to understanding.

589
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,062
Nathan, stay with me.

590
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:22,016
Just try to stay calm.

591
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:29,510
He's overloading, like the others.

592
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,517
- It looks like a massive seizure.
- It is.

593
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,168
- From what?
- Exposure to the Art...

594
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,808
That's classified.

595
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:40,950
His temperature's up to 104.

596
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,068
Okay, the seizure's frying
his electrical system.

597
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,022
We... can we shut it down?

598
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,950
You shut down his system, he dies.

599
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,901
Not the whole thing. Just the bit
of it that's misfiring. You know,

600
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:51,500
- tripping a breaker.
- Maybe we can.

601
00:34:51,596 --> 00:34:53,113
- How?
- Fight fire with misfire.

602
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:56,202
Jack's right. We don't have to shut down
the circuit, but to disrupt it.

603
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,280
- Great. How do we do it?
- Electroshock therapy.

604
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,387
No!

605
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:00,781
Small silver box.

606
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,350
- Got it.
- They used electroshock therapy

607
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:05,728
very effectively
to disrupt seizure disorder.

608
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,386
Yes, in dealing with epilepsy.

609
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:10,338
But we have no idea how that will affect
what's going on in his head!

610
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,852
And we don't have time
to fight about it!

611
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:17,622
He's right.

612
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:19,426
Are you sure?

613
00:35:21,107 --> 00:35:22,555
Please don't burst into flames.

614
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,477
I'll do my best.

615
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,595
All right, hang in there.

616
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,194
Sheriff. Didn't know you cared.

617
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,800
Oh, I don't.

618
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,557
Systems are online.

619
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,998
You ready?

620
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,663
I'm sorry about Kim.

621
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:46,603
I know.

622
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,354
How are you feeling?

623
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:12,267
Oh, like someone microwaved my brain.

624
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:13,893
But besides that...

625
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:16,955
Well, your fever topped 106...
we were all...

626
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:18,376
really worried.

627
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,040
Me burst into flames?

628
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,779
I'm not giving the D.O.D.
the satisfaction.

629
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:25,693
I really am sorry, Nathan.

630
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,151
Don't be.

631
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:32,038
They made the right choice.

632
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:34,263
You mean that?

633
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,575
Absolutely.

634
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:39,350
After everything that's happened,
don't think I could do the job anymore.

635
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:42,902
You might be just what this place needs.

636
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:51,676
This place still needs you too.

637
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,218
Well...

638
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:02,195
I should probably let you get some rest.

639
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,675
Nathan, can I ask you something?

640
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:13,165
Sure.

641
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:17,758
What was Kevin's therapist doing
in a lab in Section Five?

642
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:20,337
I wish I knew.

643
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:32,027
I hear, um...

644
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,649
Nathan's on the mend.

645
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,543
Oh, sure, rub it in.

646
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:42,112
Allie has that book.
Had... had that book.

647
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,787
In the other timeline.

648
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,093
- You okay?
- No, you're right.

649
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,153
Every time I try to make things
happen with Allie

650
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:51,795
the way they did before,
the more they change.

651
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:53,065
Tonight

652
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:55,917
was supposed to be our first date.

653
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,676
Stark was supposed to take
the job in San Francisco.

654
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:04,727
And instead, she's holding his hand,
convincing him to stay.

655
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:10,366
And, uh...

656
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,995
sorry I suspected you.

657
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:17,795
You were just...

658
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,260
following your instincts.

659
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:20,719
Yeah.

660
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,713
Which were all wrong.

661
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,086
I mean...

662
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:28,556
I thought it would
be easier this time around.

663
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,396
I thought, it'd be fun, you know.
Like I could do things better.

664
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,659
instead, a man died.

665
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,866
And I accused you of murder.

666
00:38:44,536 --> 00:38:47,853
And the woman I love is slipping away.

667
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:53,007
I don't know if I can do this.

668
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:00,112
Maybe you don't have to.

669
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,709
- What... what is that?
- It's a modified version

670
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:05,138
of the memory neutralizer
that I designed years ago.

671
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,406
The original was like a shotgun,
erasing short-term memory.

672
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:12,397
This one erases long-term memory,
but is much more precise.

673
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:14,053
It can pinpoint the neuropathways

674
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:17,613
associated with specific
experiences and time periods.

675
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:20,322
You wanna erase your memory
from the other timeline?

676
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:23,205
I want to erase our memories.

677
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:29,197
You're my closest friend.

678
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:32,728
And intellectually, I know that you had

679
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:35,482
to prevent me from saving Kim,
but emotionally,

680
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,700
I blame you for her death.

681
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,598
I can't look at you without thinking
that you're the one who did this,

682
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,297
that you're the one
who took her away from me.

683
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:47,198
- I wish there had been another choice.
- I know.

684
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:51,554
But the pain that I feel
every day that she's not here,

685
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:56,324
the... the pain that you feel knowing
that you're not gonna be with Allison,

686
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:59,572
that you're not gonna be meeting
the child that you were having together.

687
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:02,523
This takes all that away.

688
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,455
Can we keep some of the memories?
'Cause there was this one time

689
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,815
- with Allison...
- Jack.

690
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:13,860
I'm afraid it has to be all or nothing.

691
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:17,933
- You're really gonna do this?
- We have to.

692
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:21,049
- And who will go first?
- I'll make it easy for you.

693
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:26,451
I hear Nathan's on the mend.

694
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:28,102
Oh, sure.

695
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:29,311
Rub it in.

696
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:36,173
My head is killing me.

697
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,649
You okay?

698
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:39,542
Yeah.

699
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:41,826
What...

700
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:44,995
Can I borrow this?

701
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:46,813
Sure.

702
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,223
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you later.

703
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,828
And I will never forget.

704
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:23,162
Good morning, Allison.

705
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,029
You look nice.

706
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:27,521
Going for a job interview?

707
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,926
Actually, I am.

708
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:30,347
I...

709
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:34,335
I wanna work at Global Dynamics.

710
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,675
Congressman Faraday.

711
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,074
According to Nathan Stark,

712
00:41:58,444 --> 00:42:01,079
the Artifact appears to be dead.

713
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:03,785
That isn't possible.

714
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:05,411
I said "appears."

715
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:08,484
Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.

716
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,919
It had to go somewhere.

717
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,062
Kevin, honey, dinner's ready.

718
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,694
Come on, baby.
