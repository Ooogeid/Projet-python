8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,160
What did you do?

9
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,250
Why did you shoot henry?

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,020
I don'T...remember.

11
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,040
I don'tremember anything.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,030

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,800
I went back to check someof my own personal files

14
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,220
and they've been classified.

15
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,570
I mean,they're my files!

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,270
It's not my faultthat there are things

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,260
about yourself that
you'rejust not cleared to know.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,700
Yeah,I'd hateto stumble across something

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,480
that if I told meI'd have to kill me,right?

20
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,230
What's next,are they gonnaclassify the contents

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,200
of my fridge?

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,660
My underwear drawer?

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,050
You think agentsof a foreign government

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,270
would be afteryour underwear?

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,530
Maybe.

26
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,870

I was up all nightreading shakespeare.

43
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,750
You're really intothe school play?

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,030
Yeah,you know?

45
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,250

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,300
find myself emotionally.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,290
I feel like I'm reallystarting to fit in.

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,880
How many classes do youget to skip for rehearsal?

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,050
Last period every day.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,970
Including geometry.Love drama.

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,540
That's what I thought.

52
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,360
Do you remember my school playswhen I was a kid?

53
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,650
Remember third grade,parade of nutrition?

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,550
You remember my cucumber outfit?

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
Do you?

56
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,510
Yes.

57
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,230
Zoe,you were the cutestcucumber in the garden.

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,850
I was a tomato,actually.

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,270
You weren't at parade of nutrition.

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,360
I knew you were a vegetable.

61
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,730
In fact,you weren'tat anything I ever did.

62
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,500
Come on,it's not likeyou
did anything in those plays.

63
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,760
You just sort of sat therelooking...

64
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,460
I sat there looking...?

65
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,980
Come on.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,450
Zoe...

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,190
work was crazy back then.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,260
But it's different here.

69
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,360
There's a visitor at the door.

70
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,680
It is different.

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,870
It is!

72
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,140
Alert,there's a visitor at the door.

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,280
nobody there,S.A.R.A.H..

74
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,010
all right,don't tune me out with the newspaper.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,310
I invented tuning outwith the newspaper.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,730
Forget I said anything.

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,250
- Alert,there's a visitor.
- Hey!

78
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,600
S.A.R.A.H.,There's nobody at the door.

79
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,460
Hello,sheriff.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm putnam.I go to zoe's school.

81
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,680
Theatrical director.

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,420
What are you,like 11?

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,000
- He's a senior.
- 12,actually.

84
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,990
Put it in gear,lamp chop.

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,580
I wanna run through act ibefore first period.

86
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,690
Space is time,time is relative.

87
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,140
And all of it's money.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,860
I gotta grab my costume from vincent

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,640
after school.

90
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,740
And then I have rehearsaluntil 6:00.

91
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,520
You asked vincentto make your costume?

92
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,780
Sir,you should know.

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,220
Your daughter'san incredible talent.

94
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,930
Her audition,she wasblack body radiation in 1901.

95
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,080
Change the paradigm.

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,050
Let's roll.

97
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,020
and a tomatois a fruit.

98
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,840
Table food has always been

99
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,190
community property.

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,600
You remember thailand?

101
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,660
It is goodto have you back.

102
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,250
Stealing my breakfast.

103
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,650
Well,don't get used to it.

104
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,420
We finish this projectfor stark,

105
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,690
we're off to geneva.

106
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,430
no.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,930
I know,I know,I know.

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,650
But jason doesn't likestaying anyplace

109
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,950
for too long.

110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,500
And he does his best workon the road.

111
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,410
Well,you can't arguewith results.

112
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,680
Hey,listen.

113
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,960
Jason would never ask,but...

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
we could use your helpon this one.

115
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,420
- What?
- The wonder twinsdo not need my help.

116
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,730
We do.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,780
We're stuck,and stark's already
scheduled a D.O.D. Field test.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,100
Come on,it'll be fun.

119
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,610
Like those all-nighterswe used to pull at jpl.

120
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,820
Come on.

121
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,670
All right.All right.

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,330
Ta da!Fetching.

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,870
I thought zoewas picking this up.

124
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,060
Yeah,I'm saving itfor the trip.

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,680
Be carefulwith the tentacles.

126
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,750
I thought they weredoing shakespeare.

127
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,020
Putnam's re-imagining it.

128
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,890
He'S...he's a visionary.

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,030
And I thought he wasjust annoying.

130
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,470
Hands off the wife.

131
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,260
I was just recruiting himto help us out

132
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,990
on the body armor.

133
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,550
just like old times.Speaking of which...

134
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,750
- yeah.See you there?
- Yes.

135
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,300
Henry,I gotta flybefore stark has an aneurysm.

136
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,950
Because we're being way overpaid

137
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,090
to pinch hiton this project.

138
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,130
But listen...

139
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,980
if you canhelp us crack it,

140
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,680
there's a very expensivebottle
of scotch in it for you.

141
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,710
A very expensive

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,660
bottle of scotch.

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,030
Done.

144
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,410
Excuse me,I don't meanto be a hard-ass,

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,740
but blockinga police vehicle...

146
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,340
not a very good idea.

147
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,820
My apologies,sheriff.

148
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,300
- I'll get right on it.
- All right.

149
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,260
Nice costume.

150
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,940
Healthy egoon your buddy.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,900
Oh,yeah.

152
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,140
Jason has more patentsthan
the fortune 500 combined.

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,570
Universities throw grants at him

154
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,590
just to rub up against their blackboards.

155
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,270
What about his wife?

156
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,280
Amazing.Amazing scientist.

157
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,830
No,I meantwhat about his wife and you?

158
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,490
Saw you talking.

159
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,780
We're friends.

160
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,220
When weren't you friends?

161
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,220
Come on,man,it's obvious.

162
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,580
A long time ago.

163
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,390
We worked togetherfor years,and...

164
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,090
I was best manat their wedding.

165
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,020
And the restis ancient history.

166
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,040
I'll catch you later.

167
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,700
Kinetic absorption complete.

168
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,060
Protective energyconversion field

169
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,200
is holding.

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Napalm.

171
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,670
There's a breakdownwhen the protective field

172
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,830
tries to cross convert

173
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,510
thermaland kinetic energy.

174
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,660
That's exactly right.

175
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,200
The army was promisedindestructible

176
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,430
force-field body armorbased on

177
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,570
your preliminary designs.

178
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,370
Field demonstration's tomorrow.

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,370
Even without the fix,this still

180
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,780
could savethousands of lives.

181
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,970
Not just soldiers.Police,fireman...

182
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,770
the goal was to allow12 men to be able

183
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,230
to clear out an entireinsurgent stronghold.

184
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,680
Army's all stocked upon insurgent strongholds

185
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,650
right now.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
You get paidto produce results.

187
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,660
I get paid regardless.

188
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,090
Field test is tomorrow.

189
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,470
I know youwon't let me down.

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,650
I'm going for a driveto clear my head.

191
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,360
- We can adjustthe feedback loop.
- Just...

192
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,890
I haven't failedin 15 years.

193
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,930
I'm not gonna start now.

194
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,180
So...

195
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,080
who's gonnamake the coffee?

196
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,510
All right.

197
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,110
Insert tab epsiloninto slot gamma.

198
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,210
Okay.

199
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,740
Who writes instructionsin greek letters,anyway?

200
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,380
Greeks?

201
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,150
I thought they weredoing shakespeare.

202
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,450
midsummer night's dream.

203
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,110
Putnam changed it.

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,610
Putnam.Kid's a visionary.

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,050
Yeah,well,I thinkhe has a crush on zoe.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,420
It's cute.It's all very normal.

207
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,620
Normal is good.

208
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,530
Oh,normal's very good.The more,the better.

209
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,080
My mom used tomake my costumes.

210
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,650
You used to do theater?

211
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,230
Believe or not,carter,

212
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,530
I didn't havechildhood dreams

213
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,790
of becoming a commando.

214
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,950
So you went from being toldto break a leg

215
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,560
to actually breaking them.

216
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,930
Enjoying yourself?

217
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah,but I gottaget this to zoe

218
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,180
before rehearsal.

219
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,140
Trying to scoresome points.

220
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,100
Tell her tobreak a leg for me.

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,970
- Thanks.
- Yes.

222
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,140
approaching car 60 miles per hour.

223
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,390
What do we have here?

224
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,330
Sheriff,dr. Anderson is
undera great deal of stress.

225
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
We're in a dynamictherapy session.

226
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,450
I'll bet you are.

227
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,280
This isn'twhat you think,sheriff.

228
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,530
My concern about thisis that you're doing 60

229
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,410
in a 30-mile-an-hour zone.

230
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,100
Then why don't youjust write me a ticket?

231
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
That's exactly whatI'm going to do.

232
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,390
Just--I gottaget my ticket book.

233
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,490
What areyou waiting for?

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,710
Hey!Get...

235
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,920
get back in the car.

236
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm sorry,sheriff.

237
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,720
We can't be seen together.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,890
Well,you can geton your way

239
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,600
just as soon as I...

240
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,190
Got it. All right.

241
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,400
Now,back in your car.

242
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,040
Back in yours.

243
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,250
We gonna have a problem?

244
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,330
Looks that way.

245
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,840
Jo,this is carter.

246
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,090
We're gonna need some backupon old post road.

247
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,060
Somebody's ina lot of trouble.

248
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,440
Where's the perp?

249
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,540
You called me.

250
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,130
Why did you call me?

251
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,040
I...can't remember.

252
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,450
What do you got?

253
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,730
You forgot the hamiltonian...

254
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,990
no,I didn't.Just keep going.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I got it.

256
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,350
All right,so theelectrodynamics work.

257
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,760
Force-field works.

258
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,440
We just can't finishthe algorithm

259
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,010
for the softwareto run the conversion.

260
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,880
You know what?

261
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,440
It's timefor more coffee.

262
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,110
Dive in.

263
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,500
There's no point.

264
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
Jason willsolve it again,you'll see.

265
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,270
Oh,come on.We can crack this.

266
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,300
I've seen ita million times,henry.

267
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,570
It's his gift.

268
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,810
He'll just take it all in

269
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,110
and just seize the answer.

270
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,450
It's amazing.

271
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,570
You don't sound amazed.

272
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,800
Well,sometimesplaying second fiddle

273
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,900
can be a little tiring.

274
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,840
You are not secondto anything.

275
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,500
You and ican solve this.

276
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,930
Together.

277
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,900
Okay.

278
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,620
I didn't gofor that long a drive.

279
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,630
- We pulled upall the research.
- I double checked--

280
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,910
yeah.Wait,hold on.

281
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,030
You got the force vectors.
Or henry got the force vectors.

282
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,640
That funkyrussian math you use

283
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,290
is like a fingerprint.

284
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,790
All right.

285
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,970
R-d-T.That is it!

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,580
It works.

287
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,830
You son of A...

288
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,300
you saved us again.

289
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,510
You and henrylaid it all out.

290
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,350
You solvedthe force-field problem.

291
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,600
I couldn't havedone it without you.

292
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,040
Look,my dad took my costume

293
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,930
for reasonsI can't imagine.

294
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,970
And I don't knowwhere he is.

295
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,510
Zoe,no.

296
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,520
You don't have your costume,

297
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,700
you can't rehearse.

298
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,280
I must see my vision.

299
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,490
Puck!Where is my puck?

300
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,810
I'm gonna kill my father.Speak!

301
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,920
if we shadowshave offended...

302
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,220
think but this,and all...

303
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,660
is mended.

304
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,220
Putnam,I can'tdo study hall.

305
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,190
Think but thisand all is mended.

306
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,290
that you have...but...

307
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,680
that you havebut slumbered here.

308
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,730
- Slumbered here,okay?
- Okay.

309
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,780
Sorry,zoe,can't breakthe rules for you.

310
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,390
People will talk about us.

311
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,340
Dad.Now the jet pack!

312
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,340
Note to self.

313
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,190
Adjust the fuel mixin the jet pack.

314
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,160
Note to self:Find new puck.

315
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,580
What foolsthese mortals be.

316
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,080
It's calleda senior moment.

317
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,630
Soon you'll be driving,

318
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,490
just that oneright blinker going non-stop.

319
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,480
No,I mean...

320
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,490
I took my ticket bookout of the car

321
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,310
for a reason.

322
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:48,890
I need henry.

323
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,280
Is this on the way toor from zoe's school?

324
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,900
no.She's gonna kill me.

325
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,700
She's right to kill me.Hey,jack!

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,070
- Have you got anybody
- who's lost time?Any reports of lost time?

327
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,260
So,ten minutes?

328
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,340
Maybe more.

329
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,050
I was at global dynamics,
so it could be section five.

330
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,530
No,no,I was outby the farm.

331
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,240
I must have called jo.

332
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,220
We digitize all the audio,
including the radio calls.

333
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,010
Time code saysyou called me two minutes

334
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,560
before I got there.

335
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,820
jo,it's carter.

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm gonna need some backup on old post road.

337
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,310
Somebody's in a lot of trouble.

338
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,590
I don't remember saying that.

339
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,670
But I must havepulled someone over.

340
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,020
The ticket's gone.

341
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,220
Carbon's missing too.

342
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,530
Well,I can put thatunder a uv scope

343
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,270
and it'll highl--

344
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,490
or you could just draw over it.Same thing.

345
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,770
Okay,the first fourof the plate are...

346
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,640
n-I-d-5.

347
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,770
Are you serious?

348
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,490
nid-563.

349
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,850
I passed that caron the way out to see you.

350
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,250
And jason was therewhen I lost time.

351
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,890
Table on the left.

352
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,260
You good?

353
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,150
I'm good.

354
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,900
You need to come with me.

355
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,150
Carter!

356
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,190
What did you do?

357
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,120
Why did you shoot henry?

358
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,270
I didn'T.

359
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,450
I don'T...remember.

360
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,290
I don'tremember anything.

361
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,710
No.

362
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,630
No,whatever happened,

363
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,560
it wasn't jack's fault.

364
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,180
There's no way I couldintentionally hurt henry.

365
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,740
Protocol for dischargeof a weapon,

366
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,670
injuring a civilian...

367
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,960
and what does your protocolsay about the fact

368
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,080
that nobody,absolutely nobody

369
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,770
remembers what happened?

370
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,930
I've got nothing.

371
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,140
And all the caf?witnessesare fuzzy.

372
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,670
The last thing I rememberI was in my office.

373
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,770
Allison,we have tofigure this thing out.

374
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm sorry,carter.

375
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,410
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.

376
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,500
Sheriff,down in front. Please.

377
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,760
What?

378
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,130
Up and down.Up and down.

379
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,930
I willbring them up and down.

380
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,590
I am fearedin field and town.

381
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,320
Goblin,lead themup and down.

382
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,860
Here comes one now.

383
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,160
I know I've beenforgetting

384
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,500
a lot of stuff today.

385
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,890
But I knowthis is my living room.

386
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,270
rehearsal in progress.

387
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,880
Sorry,I was justchecking her blocking.

388
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,010
Oh,crap,I haveyour costume in my car.

389
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,510
Yeah,luckily for you,I don't need it.

390
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,270
Because I have a new partwith a new costume.

391
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,540
I was trying to help.

392
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,010
I know.Just don't ever do it again.

393
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,360
Oh,what--that's not fair.

394
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,210
promise.

395
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,980
Putnam,put this on tape.

396
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,260
Oh,come on.

397
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,880
Okay.

398
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,920
I promise.

399
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,360
Clever little setup.

400
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,780
that's a holographic generator I invented.

401
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,940
Theater is aboutcreating illusion.

402
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,730
The device helps merealize the vision.

403
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,310
Zoe,take it fromwhere puck arrives.

404
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,990
With oberon?

405
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Right.

406
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,730
And puck uses his magic to make titania

407
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,560
and bonham wake from their spell.

408
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,530
Okay.

409
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
Now when thou wakest with thine own fool's eyes...

410
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,850
peep...

411
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,520
did you wishto add something?

412
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,080
No.

413
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,400
Putnam,you're a genius.

414
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,680
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.

415
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,620
True.

416
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,030
Putnam,can I offer a few small notes?

417
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,720
Everybody's a critic.

418
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,470
Spring cleaning?

419
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,380
Somebody'sdone something to us.

420
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,680
We just don't know what.

421
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,410
He can make us,not see.

422
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,930
Or,move through time,or,

423
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,460
you know,just blank out.

424
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,570
Okay...

425
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,950
we all forgot?

426
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,160
All of us?

427
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,380
I mean,henry gets shot,and no one saw anything?

428
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,740
Come on,jo.

429
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,960
We're being...pucked with.

430
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,770
Your argumentis so strong,

431
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,910
it's almost petty of meto ask,how?

432
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,580
He's got a thing.

433
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,260
A thing.

434
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,310
Yeah,a gizmo.A device.

435
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,270
Has to be a device.

436
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,710
Do you have a piece ofdevice-oriented evidence?

437
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,540
No.

438
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,130
But look.

439
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,590
What's my ticket book doing there?

440
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,770
It's gathering dust.

441
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,210
That's right,I alwayshave it in my car.

442
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,400
- In the trunk,on the floor.
- And yet,here it is.

443
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
I don't remember doing that.

444
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
Okay,this is weird.

445
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,490
Okay.A big one for you.

446
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,150
Hey,you okay?

447
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,120
Yeah.Just,

448
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,930
just thinking.

449
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,140
Well,less thinkingand more eating.

450
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,430
I mean,vincent gave usway too much.

451
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,800
Well,you know how muchI love tandoori.

452
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,640
Hey,how are youreally feeling?

453
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,730
Better.Now.

454
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,420
What?

455
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,360
This is weirder.

456
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,440
jason anderson?

457
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,620
I bet jason wasat caf?diem.

458
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,250
That's why we were there.

459
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,560
- We can't prove that.
- No--vincent

460
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,160
check the receipts.

461
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,470
See if vincent made a mealfor jason today.

462
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,370
Okay,and whereare you gonna go?

463
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,960
I gotta go see a guyabout a thing.

464
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,020
Device. Gizmo.Just...

465
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,350
but there's somethingelse we have to do first.

466
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,210
I heard they suspendedthe sheriff.

467
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,690
It's not his faultwhat happened.

468
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,590
- What did happen?
- I'm not really sure.

469
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,240
I have this blank spotthat I just cannot fill in.

470
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,700
I know the feeling.

471
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,610
What happened beforewith us?

472
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,490
I've been tryingto remember.

473
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,510
Did you say somethingor did I?

474
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,470
Look,if we weremeant to be together,

475
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,740
you wouldn't havewound up with jason.

476
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,510
Whatever it was,

477
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,410
an argument,a sulkthat went on too long,

478
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,960
I'm just...

479
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,910
I'm just grateful thatwe were able to

480
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,920
salvage a friendship.

481
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,090
Did we ever even kiss?

482
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,190
Couldn't have beenthat great a kiss

483
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,020
if we have to ask.

484
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,290
I thought you were suspended.

485
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
You worried to see me?

486
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,420
You shot my friend,so yes.

487
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,020
I figured it all out.I know what you're up to.

488
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,780
In regards to...

489
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,060
I know you have a device

490
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,500
that can create a wormhole.

491
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,710
Or,bend time.Or make you invisible.

492
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,960
A worm-holing,time-bending,invisible-ing device

493
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,610
that shields youfrom the mind.

494
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,480
Yes,he said invisible-ing.

495
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,550
Watch out!

496
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,330
- Carter,you're already under suspicion!
- That'S..no!

497
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,240
Stop it!

498
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,060
There,that's the devicethat invades your mind.

499
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,920
It also starts my car.

500
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,520
Okay,just let go of him.

501
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,420
Get out of here while you can.

502
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,830
Go!

503
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,740
What does he have to doto get fired?

504
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,660
Shoot anotherinnocent person?

505
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,380
- Good question.Allison?
- Okay,you guys do your job,I'll do mine.

506
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,980
Carter!

507
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,220
It's a little unorthodox,
but I've dealt with worse.

508
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,650
How are you so strong?

509
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,490
I'm small,but I'm scrappy.

510
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,630
I don't need therapy.

511
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,810
Maybe not.

512
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
But if it keeps you awayfrom jason anderson

513
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,480
until after jason's D.O.D. Test this afternoon,

514
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,700
I consider it time well spent.

515
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,530
50 minutes.Not a second less.

516
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,090
Okay.Come on,jo.

517
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,230
Oh,that's not my call,carter.

518
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:39,910
I'll be at...

519
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,900
caf?diemif you need anything.

520
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,350
well,I've hadresistant patients,

521
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,710
but you've seta new benchmark.

522
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,940
I don't have timefor this.

523
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,240
I understandhenry's doing well.

524
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,140
Well,aside fromthe bullet hole

525
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,450
He's doing great.

526
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,440
How do you feelabout what happened?

527
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,800
I don't know what happened.

528
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,460
I mean,I wastrying to find out.

529
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,400
But I can't do thatfrom in here.

530
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,420
Sheriff...

531
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,660
Beverly,no offense.

532
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,170
I really,reallydon't wanna do this.

533
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,020
- I get that.
- Okay.

534
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,220
But sincewe're both here,

535
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,830
we might as welltalk about something.

536
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,090
I mean,who knows?

537
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,870
I might even be helpfulif you let me.

538
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,960
Okay.

539
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,000
All right.

540
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,740
do you know any waythat someone could make

541
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,780
people forget things?

542
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,070
Hypnotherapy couldpotentially be used

543
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,580
to trigger memory loss.

544
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,530
No--no,nobody couldhypnotize me that fast.

545
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,310
And it wasn't just me.

546
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,360
It was everybodyat caf?diem.

547
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,740
You'd be surprisedwhat the true masters can do.

548
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,060
Do you knowjason anderson?

549
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,450
I've met him in passing.

550
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,660
He and henry go way back.

551
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,650
I don't trust him.

552
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,710
Do you trust henry?

553
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,830
Of course.

554
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,220
The shouldn't youtrust henry's opinion

555
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,720
of dr. Anderson?

556
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,710
I don't even know his opinionof dr. Anderson.

557
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,880
I should ask him.

558
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,660
That's not exactlywhere I was driving.

559
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,040
Well,but we allget different things

560
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,220
from therapy,right?

561
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,440
I mean,I need to see henry.

562
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,050
That would help mein my processing.

563
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,630
That's what you'drecommend,right?

564
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,530
- Under normal circumstances,yes,but
- great.So I can go.

565
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,900
Absolutely.

566
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,230
In 46 minutes.

567
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,830
don't wander off too far.

568
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,410
The test is in a couple hours.

569
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,970
Not to mentionthat crazy sheriff

570
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,130
is still out there.

571
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,430
He does seemfixated on you.

572
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,500
Yeah,well,he is tryingto deflect his guilt

573
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,610
over shooting henry.

574
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,640
Do you think he intentionallyshot henry?

575
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,510
Doesn't everyone?

576
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,470
I mean,kim,come on.

577
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,660
They found this nut jobstanding over our friend

578
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,890
with a smoking gun.

579
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,650
How else do youexplain that?

580
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,720
I don't know.

581
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,600
There seem to bean awful lot of things

582
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,450
around here latelythat require an explanation.

583
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,730
Solve it again.

584
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:29,910
What?

585
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,450
Looking at it,I know I can do it.

586
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,530
I can solve it.

587
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,170
But I wanna watch youdo it again.

588
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,890
What did you do?

589
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,080
Come in here,bring in some coffee,

590
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,490
see that henry and ialready solved the problem?

591
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,430
Erase the board,erase us,

592
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,200
and stroll back in herelike it was the first time?

593
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,250
Looking for this?

594
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,220
Something is going on.

595
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,020
There's just too manyweird coincidences

596
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,010
for this to bejust about you losing it.

597
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,020
Like,what,last nightI had a theory about

598
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,700
your buddy jason.

599
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,780
Jason?

600
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,760
Yeah,like,um,that he had a device

601
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,550
of some kind.

602
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,850
Oh,well,that at leastnarrows it down.

603
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,900
Oh,don't you start.

604
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,230
You know,a devicethat could,like

605
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,510
erase short bursts of time.

606
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,860
Or how we perceive them.

607
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,950
Almost like it can make usforget all about him.

608
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,760
What?

609
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,180
Not just about him.

610
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,740
He could make us forget aboutwhatever he wants.

611
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,940
Oh,and that's not crazy?

612
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,950
I know what's going on.

613
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,720
JasoN...

614
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,390
jason anderson has a machinethat can wipe out

615
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,740
short term memory.

616
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,890
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I built it.

617
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,110
20 years ago.

618
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,480
I had a theorythat a properly modulated

619
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,590
em burst could change the electrical properties

620
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,040
of your brain cells.

621
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,100
Unbind short-term memorybefore they can

622
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,830
imprint as long-term memory.

623
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,000
So you have one too.

624
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,810
No,while I was developing itwith jason,

625
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,620
I could never geta single test to work.

626
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,250
Not one that you remember,anyway.

627
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,850
Now I know what the sonof a bitch has been up to.

628
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,680
Jo,this is carter.

629
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,380
Look,I'm gonna needthat backup we talked about.

630
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,340
Meet me in theglobal dynamics lobby.

631
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,960
You're not storminginto a test session

632
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,060
with one ofthe joint chiefs.

633
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,160
Jason anderson has A...a device.

634
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,060
A device.

635
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,340
Oh,great,you too?

636
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,290
He can eraseshort term memory.

637
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,240
Why would he do that?

638
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,330
Pull kim's personnel files.And jason'S.

639
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,720
All the recordsback to college.

640
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,180
That'll show us why.

641
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,460
Make sure those arearmor-piercing rounds.

642
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,730
I want the works.

643
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,970
You sure about this?

644
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,010
I've tested the force-fieldsix times.

645
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,550
The pentagon sees this,they're gonna jam us

646
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,110
into production right away.

647
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,780
Good for us,good for global dynamics.

648
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,010
And whose insane ideawas this?

649
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,110
I don't remember.

650
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,590
We were talking...

651
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,230
I think it was minE.

652
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
Must be.

653
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,930
Kim is far too sensibleto try something like this.

654
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,120
Good luck.

655
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,510
Here.

656
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,700
Here.

657
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,690
Here.

658
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,630
Oh,and look.

659
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,580
Here.

660
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,710
All of jason's breakthroughswere fields

661
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,270
kim pioneered.

662
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,080
This is jason andersonwe're talking about here.

663
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,420
This is your friend,henry.

664
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,470
I thought he was.

665
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,930
But kim's the real genius.

666
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,830
He's been stealing her workfor decades.

667
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,600
What about all the otherresearch projects

668
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,160
he's helped on?

669
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,010
Oh,wait for the teamto make the breakthrough

670
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,150
and then wipe them out.

671
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,120
Cover your tracks and thenride
in and save the day.

672
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,800
Is

673
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,370
20 minutes at a time.

674
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,990
How many timesdo you think?

675
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,200
Kim...

676
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,530
add it up,henry.

677
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,260
He took a lot morethan 20 minutes of my memory.

678
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,780
He took my life.

679
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,990
I know.

680
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,260
We'll make this right,kim.

681
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,970
I already have.

682
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,350
Carter,what areyou doing here?

683
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,450
You're under suspension.

684
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,860
we had A...

685
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,380
it was...

686
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,500
it was important.

687
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,520
Might wannaput these on,sir.

688
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,070
Clear the areafor a live ammo test.

689
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,820
Okay,I would loveto stay here

690
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,080
and play with you twoall day.

691
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,540
But I have work to do.

692
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,180
Jo.

693
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,300
You have no ideawhy I'm here,do you?

694
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,980
What--

695
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,380
hidden camera.

696
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,010
Saw the whole thing.

697
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,300
Initiate test on my mark.

698
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,170
Three,two...

699
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:48,860
one.

700
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,920
Don't!

701
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,260
Kim,wait.

702
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,020
Don'T.Please.

703
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,720
I am leaving.

704
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,120
I can run and you won'teven know

705
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,420
why you should chase me.

706
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,180
You haven't run away

707
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,910
from anythingin your life.

708
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,670
How do you know?

709
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,780
I don'T.

710
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,660
I don't know anythinganymore.

711
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,720
Maybe I cheated on him.

712
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,960
How many times did icatch jason cheating on me

713
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,450
and he made it all better?No.

714
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,140
Maybe I left him.

715
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,660
How many times did itell jason,"I'm leaving,"

716
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,230
and I walk out that doorand,
boom,none of it happened?

717
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,740
Whatever he took from you...

718
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,820
from everybody,is unforgivable.

719
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,270
But you cannotkill him for it.

720
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,150
Henry,what did he takefrom you?

721
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,400
Why can't we remember...

722
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,810
if we ever even kissed?

723
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,110
Remember our biggest fight?

724
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,970
Remember whenyou told jason

725
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,410
it was okayto ask me out?

726
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,440
Do you?

727
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,010
More than 20 years ago.I...

728
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,950
we had to move on.

729
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,050
I had to...

730
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:13,180
henry,if he stole...us.

731
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,280
Stark,what's going on?

732
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,760
Someone's about tolose their job,general.

733
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,540
Nathan,there's somethingyou should know.

734
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,900
Sheriff,you're standing in the way of science!

735
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,410
Jason,camera never lies.

736
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,060
My daughter taught me that.

737
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,470
I had jo rig me up with this digital video.

738
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,810
We've just finished watchingthe surveillance feed.

739
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,060
We know aboutyour memory wiper.

740
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,240
Which is a devicethat henry built

741
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,540
and you stole.

742
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,490
A memory wiper.

743
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Stark,are youlistening to this?

744
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,970
Can you have this maniachauled off?

745
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,060
I outsmarted you.

746
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,600
Now I knowyou're hallucinating.

747
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,400
Activate the damn test.

748
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,420
I get that.

749
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,520
Okay,fair enough.

750
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,770
I mean,you're 100% certain
that you're smarter than me.

751
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,110
But are you smarterthan kim?

752
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,340
I mean,she's the one who programmed your

753
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,570
very fancy little vest.

754
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,060
I double checkedthe algorithms.

755
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,770
Sure.

756
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,550
And if jason andersonis the genius

757
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,710
everybody says he is,

758
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,210
then there's no wayyou're in any danger.

759
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,910
But if kim'sthe real genius,

760
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,220
then you have no way of knowing

761
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,440
if she sabotaged that vest.

762
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,250
But if you'resmarter than her,

763
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,200
then there's no wayshe could have

764
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,420
figured it out.

765
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,940
If she had a problem,
she would have said something.

766
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,250
Maybe she did and youjust don't remember it.

767
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,510
There's no wayshe could play you,right?

768
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,820
I mean,you're jason anderson.

769
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,230
You're the genius,not her.

770
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,150
So let's firethis puppy up.

771
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,120
No!No!

772
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,840
I think it's timefor you to go,jason.

773
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,470
Stark,come on.

774
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,320
Cash that check quick.

775
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,340
It's the last oneyou're gonna see.

776
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,510
General.

777
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,440
How could you do this?

778
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,000
I just wanted what you had.

779
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,330
You and henry.

780
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,030
I did what I had to do,but I gave you a good life.

781
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,310
No.You took it.

782
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,230
What can I say,henry?

783
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm sorry.

784
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,540
- If...
- I hadn't have comewhen I did...

785
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,010
he would have been fine.

786
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,670
Even though you stole my life,

787
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,180
I couldn't take yours.

788
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,970
The vest works.

789
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,310
I just turned downthe power

790
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,210
so you'd getbanged up a bit.

791
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,100
Is that right?

792
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,900
Even I saw that one coming.

793
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,480
Henry.

794
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,980
Hey,I thought maybeyou changed your mind.

795
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,670
No,I hadsome thinking to do.

796
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,480
Sure.

797
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,990
You know,a lot's happened.

798
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,530
If you don't want to do this,I understand.

799
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,790
Stark offered mea position at G.D.

800
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,310
So I'd stay here.

801
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,350
- Are you...
- considering it?

802
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,470
- Yeah.
- That's good.

803
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,220
Well,for the town.

804
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,650
I mean,no questionyou'd be an asset.

805
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,270
I remember that.

806
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,820
Where are mycybernetic fairies?

807
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,610
Fairies,assemble.Excuse me.

808
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,890
Two seconds,two seconds.

809
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,390
Hey,these are for you.
- Dad,I'm psyching up.

810

814
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,970
Thanks,dad.

815
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,950

818
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,680
And these visionsdid appear.

819
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,730
And as I am an honest puck,

820
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,170

821
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,680
