1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:01,942
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,390
It's your anniversary.
One year in Eureka.

3
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:07,030
- Thanks, Callie.
- I can't remember the last time that

4
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,531
I had a good date.

5
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:11,117
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- Who's the lucky lady?

6
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:14,621
Henry, you said something the other day

7
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:16,331
when you weren't yourself.

8
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:17,891
Something about Kim.

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,709
And what Beverly did to her.

10
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,336
I wasn't myself.

11
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:22,587
<i>Kevin?</i>

12
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,691
He controls the field now, Allie.

13
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:26,727
<i>He's evolving.</i>

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,704
Henry, you said you had a proof
that someone sabotaged

15
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,680
- the experiment that killed Kim?
- No, I said that I'd found

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,308
<i>something that proved
you weren't responsible.</i>

17
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,803
It's hot today, huh?

18
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,464
You're looking pretty hot
in that uniform.

19
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,336
Very hot.

20
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:48,999
Excuse me?

21
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:50,626
Well, I'm just saying,

22
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,594
if you want to get comfortable,
you could...

23
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,951
take something off.

24
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:55,912
It's fine.

25
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,082
We're alone.

26
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:00,267
All...

27
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:02,249
alone.

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,637
Come on, Jo.

29
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,168
I'm sorry. "All alone."

30
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,812
No, forget it.
Forget it. This is ridiculous.

31
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:15,975
Sexual harassment is anything
but ridiculous, Sheriff.

32
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,432
Gender dynamics are something
every organization has to contend with.

33
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,196
Now, I appreciate your kind attention.

34
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,109
Let's thank our role players, shall we?

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,356
Especially Sheriff Carter for offering
such a despicable example.

36
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,763
No problem. Thank you.

37
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,422
If you excuse us,
we have to head back to work.

38
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:35,960
Thank you, Dr. Young,
for a very informative presentation.

39
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,499
Well, if I can spare at least one person
the humiliation of sexual harassment,

40
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,119
then I've done my job.

41
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,809
I think I'm with Sheriff Grabass.
Seems to be a ridiculous waste of time.

42
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,559
Nathan, as long as Global
is funding your research,

43
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,196
you have to follow the same
rules as everyone else.

44
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,349
And that attitude is precisely why

45
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,489
this traing is so necessary, Dr. Stark.

46
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,097
You people think a high IQ
means you can just forget

47
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,703
3.7 billion years of evolution,
but you're wrong.

48
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:00,954
We are apes.

49
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:04,128
Male apes are driven to reproduce
with as many partners as possible,

50
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:07,926
and female apes will use any means
to possess the male as her protector.

51
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:10,569
These are unequivocal,
biological truths.

52
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,820
I believe the people of Eureka are
a little more evolved than that,

53
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:17,375
which is why we've never had
a sexual harassment case

54
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:18,994
in the history of the town.

55
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,204
Well, we've been very fortunate.

56
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,240
You've been lulled into complacency.

57
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,959
There are huge pressures under
the surface, and one day, they'll erupt.

58
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,254
And woe be unto you when that happens.

59
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:33,635
Woe be unto me?

60
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,304
Well, we have to admire her commitment.

61
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,918
Speaking of which, I'm gonna
get back to our little project. It's...

62
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,894
it's going quite well.

63
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,104
- I'll check in with you later.
- All right.

64
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,711
- Hey, got a minute?
- Sure.

65
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,680
You look hot in that uniform.

66
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,550
Thanks. I am hot, actually.
What's up with the A/C?

67
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,573
- It's not working.
- Yeah.

68
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,412
Actually, you know what?
I could use you.

69
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,268
I don't know. I'm not a piece of meat.

70
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:07,111
I've got feelings, emotions, needs.

71
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,686
Yeah. Our biology systems
engineer Dr. Stone

72
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:13,240
has not been answering my pages,
and I'm getting worried about him.

73
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:16,589
He designed Eureka's air conditioning
system, and he does all the repairs.

74
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:19,268
What does a biologist
have to do with the A/C?

75
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,394
Well, the rest of the world
has "room conditioning."

76
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,892
Eureka has "air conditioning".

77
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:27,232
The cooling unit is part of
an integrated, underground system.

78
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,605
You know, water, gas,

79
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,498
waste... It's all recycled.

80
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:33,610
It's a biological model based on
the human digestive system.

81
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,870
So it's a billion degrees
out there because...

82
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,127
- the town has blockage?
- Kind of.

83
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,730
Dr. Stone has been overhauling
older parts of the system,

84
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,415
but he's behind on upgrading
the new schematics.

85
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:46,622
Henry's down in the tunnels,
trying to figure it out.

86
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,124
Henry will fix it.

87
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,587
It's not that easy.
The systems work in equilibrium.

88
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:53,479
With the cooling systems down,
we have water leakage,

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,966
- methane buildup in the sewers.
- All right. I'll find Dr. Stone.

90
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:02,635
There's something else
I need to talk to you about.

91
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:05,373
I need...

92
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:08,060
files from the explosion
that killed Kim Anderson.

93
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,437
Why?

94
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,112
To find out what happened.

95
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:14,525
I don't think that Henry's been
completely honest with me.

96
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,485
We know what happened.
It was an accident.

97
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,402
It looked like an accident, yeah,

98
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:20,644
but it's been implied that...

99
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,826
Beverly's involved.

100
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,262
I just want to be sure.
I know you do too.

101
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,021
Well, the... the files are classified,

102
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,395
- but I'll get you what I can.
- Thanks.

103
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,089
And, Carter, if you find anything,
will you let me know, please?

104
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,550
Of course, yeah.

105
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,518
Thanks.

106
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:52,062
Stone? Don't believe I know him.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,275
Yeah... he keeps the place cool
and keeps the toilets running.

108
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,926
Works in the tunnels.

109
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,648
Oh, him.

110
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,072
The mole.

111
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,348
- Strange fellow.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,077
When was the last time you saw him?

113
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,621
Tuesday. The A/C was a bit hinkey.

114
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,331
He put in some priority cooling ducts

115
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,364
for Fred and Wilma to keep them comfy.

116
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,042
Beautiful dogs.

117
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,079
Just... Aren't ya? Huh?

118
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,174
Hi, buddy. Yes, you are.

119
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:21,509
They're not dogs.

120
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,792
Canis lupus albus.

121
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,513
Hybrid Siberian tundra wolves.

122
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,751
Yeah, nice...

123
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,336
Tundra wolves.

124
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,022
- What was the shot for?
- A hormone cocktail.

125
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:38,734
Trying to encourage
a little lupine <i>l'amour</i>.

126
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,570
I gave fred every combination of

127
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,308
cloned linoleic pheromone in the book.

128
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,263
Nary a nuzzle.

129
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:49,435
Well, if all else fails,
there is Barry White.

130
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,432
Would you like some sugar, Sheriff?

131
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,264
No, no. I'm good, thanks.

132
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,084
Has your husband disappeared before?

133
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:57,605
Into his work.

134
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:01,815
Some men play golf,
some collect egg cups.

135
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,134
My man loves his tunnels.

136
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,574
Egg cups?

137
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,139
And you think
that he's down there somewhere?

138
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:10,682
I'm sure of it.

139
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,059
He probably just lost track of the time.

140
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,149
He can be down there
for days on end sometimes,

141
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,064
and I don't hear a peep out of him.

142
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,892
Has to be tough on a marriage.

143
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:27,157
Bob says marriage is like a

144
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,117
palladium-lined
geothermal heating system.

145
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,436
Beautiful

146
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:32,996
and complicated.

147
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,503
You just never know when the pressure
is gonna rip the whole thing apart.

148
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,298
Bob sounds very romantic.

149
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:48,013
Callie called.

150
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:50,390
Thanks.

151
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,845
Hey, you got... I left...

152
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,852
- From Zane.
- Yeah.

153
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,856
You gonna call her?

154
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,152
Yeah.

155
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,401
You call Zane?

156
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,512
No, not yet.

157
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,768
It's hard to dive back in.

158
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,896
Tell me about it.

159
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:15,645
I feel like such a guy.

160
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:17,968
Me too.

161
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:25,703
I was just down this way,
so I thought I'd bring you this.

162
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,466
Thanks.

163
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,561
I'm gonna go... freshen up.

164
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,960
You two kids excuse me.

165
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,217
So...

166
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:44,859
good day?

167
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,896
Average, strange.

168
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,784
<i>So...</i>

169
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,036
What are you up to this weekend?

170
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,969
Climb into my freezer,
try to get away from the heat.

171
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,896
Well, I was thinking,

172
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,821
my uncle has this great cabin
on the Payette River.

173
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,060
Cool breezes,

174
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,844
warm fire.

175
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:13,887
What do you think?

176
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,519
Cabin, breeze, and fire.

177
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,239
- It sounds like--
- She's gonna blow!

178
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,075

184
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:06,435
- Season 2 | Episode 11 -
Maneater (v. 1.0)

185
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:09,394
Methane backed up in the waste matrix.

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,637
Must have found an ignition source.

187
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:15,144
Well, I think Jo was
laser-plucking her eyebrows.

188
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,502
- That'll do it.
- Yeah. What's the smell?

189
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,492
Which one...
The sulfur dust or the phosphorus

190
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,581
that's coming off of the sewage biofilm?

191
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,900
This is no place for anybody
with a respiratory disease.

192
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,657
Welcome to the bowels of Eureka.

193
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,873
You guys should give out hats.

194
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,886
Hey, do I need to give out
a toilet alert?

195
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,493
No, not yet.

196
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,680
I've got a couple of teams
from hydrogeology

197
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,448
cutting vent holes in the surface.

198
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:42,203
That'll relieve the gas
and buy us some time.

199
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:45,269
Okay. How long do you think
it'll take to fix?

200
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,142
Not a clue. I mean,
we're missing tons of data.

201
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,097
Good, look. It's done.

202
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,986
All right, so these are
the water treatment pools.

203
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,466
This is the main vibrator to create

204
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:59,534
an inertial wave so the water flows up
instead of down, and...

205
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,336
That is where we are.

206
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,681
Keep your eyes open.
Stone's wife said that he was

207
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,526
probably still down here somewhere.

208
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,459
I'll do the best I can.
Just tell Jo to lay off the laser

209
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,543
in the lavatory for a while, because...

210
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,221
it's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

211
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,481
All right.

212
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,426
Left then right, then left.

213
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,044
Hey, Zane.

214
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,554
- I haven't done anything.
- No, well, the day's young.

215
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:31,315
Vince, could I get
a burger, please, rare.

216
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,121
I have a great special today.

217
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:36,007
Serbian cevacice.

218
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,110
Lamb patty, garlic, paprika.

219
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,161
A little hunk of Balkan heaven.

220
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,275
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
You should try it.

221
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:46,500
That sounds great. All right.
I'll have the burger, please, rare.

222
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,096
With some ketchup.

223
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,467
I freaked you out, didn't I?

224
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,034
A little. Yeah.

225
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,516
But, I mean, you got to admit,
having Jo explode a toilet

226
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,320
<i>was a pretty good diversion.</i>

227
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:08,509
<i>Look...<i>

228
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,777
this whole dating thing...

229
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:13,906
<i>- Uncharted waters.</i>
- Yeah.

230
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,776
Judy, your order's almost ready.

231
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,102
<i>Listen, I think the important thing
is that we just</i>

232
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:20,627
keep talking.

233
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,783
An open exchange of information.

234
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:25,364
- That sounds great.
- Sheriff, hello.

235
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:27,037
This is a pleasure.

236
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,039
<i>So when you coming</i>

237
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,666
back out to the house?

238
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:32,251
Callie, I gotta go.

239
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,746
Could we

240
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,462
exchange some information later?

241
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:38,674
Sure.

242
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,500
All right... I'll call you. Bye.

243
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:44,054
Sorry. This have something
to do with your husband?

244
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:45,437
Oh, poo.

245
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,243
We talked about Bob all morning.

246
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,227
I wanna talk about you.

247
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,270
I wanna know what is

248
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,897
going on in here.

249
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:57,072
Here you go.
And I just want to say thank you.

250
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,608
It's adventurous customers like you
who make what I do worthwhile.

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,394
That's me. Adventurous.

252
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,534
Up for anything.

253
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,555
I'll see you soon...

254
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,940
The heat's getting to people.

255
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,357
Vince, you know her husband, right?
Dr. Stone?

256
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,376
The mole? Yeah.

257
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:23,689
A weird guy, but a loyal customer.

258
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:26,304
I hate this heat.

259
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,351
I'm loving it.

260
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,882
Can I buy you some ice cream, beautiful?

261
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,439
I don't think so.

262
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,736
Haven't seen you for a while.

263
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:43,738
What are you talking about?

264
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,477
You and me.

265
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:50,363
Our partnership.

266
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,603
What?

267
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,585
Get everybody out of there now!

268
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:59,895
Hey, Henry, I'm at lunch.

269
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,589
I know where you are!

270
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:04,687
There's an inertia wave propagating
into the vent line of the pizza oven!

271
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,011
Get everybody out of there now!

272
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,756
- What's up?
- We gotta clear this place out.

273
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,980
Everybody, grab your things and
head to the door as quickly as possible,

274
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,326
that would be great.

275
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,305
Go.

276
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:18,901
Everybody. Yeah, that's... And you.

277
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,238
Come on.

278
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,255
Yeah...

279
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:27,823
That's great. Quick as you can.

280
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:29,385
That would be fantastic.

281
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,113
- Vince, you too. Go.
- What's going on?

282
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,216
Henry said that there's
an inertia thing coming.

283
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,337
- An inertia wave?
- Yeah.

284
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:39,029
Is that bad?

285
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,016
Yeah, it's bad.

286
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,481
Hey, Jo, you still with me?

287
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,113
Hey, you okay?

288
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,731
You...

289
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,868
I'm good.

290
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:25,711
Are you hurt?

291
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,922
- Carter, listen...
- Forget it.

292
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,673
It was an "in the moment" thing.

293
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,255
Good, okay...

294
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,268
Are we still in the moment?

295
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:41,980
Because I'd really like to do it again.

296
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,359
We're gonna lie you down.

297
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,442
Yeah, let's lie down.

298
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,563
Okay. Zane, could you take her to

299
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,074
the sheriff's office
and just put her on the cot?

300
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,439
- Sure.
- Yeah.

301
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,177
You're gonna be good.

302
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,004
<i>It's hour 4, and the female</i>

303
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,394
<i>is definitely showing
more interest in the male.</i>

304
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:13,387
We've had a bit of nuzzling,
some tail whipping.

305
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:18,283
Seems like love is finally in the air.

306
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,185
I'm gonna head back to work.

307
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:31,262
I've got a point particle scan
that'll crap out if I don't tweak it.

308
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,706
So...

309
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:38,088
you've felt this way
about Carter for a long time?

310
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,913
Yeah.

311
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,568
No...

312
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,069
I don't know.

313
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,669
It sure sounded like it.

314
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,632
- I guess so.
- Okay, then.

315
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:51,917
Hope that works out.

316
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,129
Do me a favor and
don't invite me to the wedding.

317
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,971
I'm really confused.

318
00:15:58,222 --> 00:15:59,317
I'm not.

319
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,128
Could have been the reed valve,

320
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:11,289
or the magnetic diaphragm
might have failed. Or...

321
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:14,757
Okay. We're gonna need a few
nano-sutures. I'll be right back.

322
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,617
Honestly, I am not sure
what happened down there.

323
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,195
Well, you're hurt. You can't go
poking around down there.

324
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,992
That wave nearly blew Cafe Diem apart.

325
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,037
We have to find someone
who can solve it now.

326
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,835
Still don't know what happened to Stone.

327
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:31,297
When the valve kicked, I saw a lunch box
so he could still be down there.

328
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,758
Okay, hold on.

329
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,967
- Hey, Carter.
- <i>First off,</i>

330
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,772
I was totally insane before.

331
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,508
For the record, I do not now,

332
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,214
nor have I ever wanted to jump you.

333
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,470
- You believe me, right?
- Well, I don't know.

334
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:46,020
I mean, maybe you just
got tired of staring

335
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,336
<i>at Lake Carter,
and you had to take a dip.</i>

336
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,916
Okay, you're making me nauseous.

337
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,443
<i>Probably from your head.
Might want to get that checked out.</i>

338
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,211
Later. We've got bigger
problems to deal with first.

339
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,513
<i>Like what?</i>

340
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,532
Like old faithful in our backyard.

341
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,674
Eureka lost bladder control.
Shooting out of main street.

342
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,131
It's probably the pressure
from the ion purification pools.

343
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,177
You see, you plug up
one hole and then, bam!

344
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,792
- Another one bursts someplace else.
- Can we stop it?

345
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:11,670
I don't know, maybe, but,
the sewage system's gonna get backed up.

346
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,859
Awesome.

347
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,081
GD has nine departments working on this.

348
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:18,224
Geomorphology is tracking
the pressure pockets in the bedrock.

349
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,804
Cartography is trying
to extrapolate maps from

350
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,720
Stone's incomplete data.

351
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:24,565
It is nuts!

352
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,187
Where did you see his lunchbox?

353
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:29,829
I have to get back upstairs.

354
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,364
We have super-pressurized water
venting on the main street.

355
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,776
Just tell me what he said.

356
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:37,970
He wants to look into what happened.
He's not gonna let this go.

357
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,490
Carter is following a road
that goes right through Henry

358
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,273
and leads right to Kevin.

359
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,996
Maybe we have to trust Carter,
bring him into the loop now.

360
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,365
It isn't about trusting Carter, Allie.
This is about the DOD.

361
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:52,336
Look, I know you work for them,

362
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,838
but you don't know them
the way that I do.

363
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,100
If they get a hold of Kevin,
he will never have a normal life.

364
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:01,711
They will quarantine him and study him
until they have the answers they want,

365
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,520
and I'm not letting that happen to him.

366
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,818
But we have to get
that thing out of him.

367
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:07,404
We will.

368
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,144
But I need access.

369
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,438
Kim's lab, the data,

370
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,524
everything we know about the artifact
and I had when I was the head of GD.

371
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,776
The DOD will never
give you that clearance.

372
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,016
Who's asking?

373
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:22,917
Left, left, right.

374
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:25,063
You gotta be kidding.

375
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:45,597
At least you're still here.

376
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,225
Where are you?

377
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,196
<i>Yeah?</i>

378
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:58,401
Hey, you sound annoyed.

379
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,337
I what?!

380
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,182
<i>Whatcha doin'?</i>

381
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,073
Long, weird story.

382
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,433
Okay.

383
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,620
Hey, what do you say we rewind?

384
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:12,586
<i>Just go back to the "great first date"
honeymoon period.</i>

385
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:18,171
Holy crap.

386
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:22,300
Callie, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

387
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:31,326
What were you doing down here?

388
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,007
- Bones?
- Yeah,

389
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:46,907
and they're human.

390
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,660
We don't know how old,
but Taggart's taking a look.

391
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,621
So your theory is,
Dr Stone is Hannibal Lecter?

392
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:54,915
- Yeah.
- Dr. Blake, sorry to interrupt,

393
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:58,028
but I need you to sign off
on the seminar attendance sheets.

394
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,423
Carter, the man we're talking about

395
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,709
is a Nobel laureate in biochemistry.

396
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:05,815
Yeah, and maybe a psychopath, so...

397
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,845
like you, but violent.

398
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,098
- Give me time.
- You gotta admit, it's a little weird.

399
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:14,389
- Oh, sorry. Do you need something?
- No, I'm good.

400
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,813
I just love the way
your lips move when you talk.

401
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,451
Excuse me?

402
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,213
Dr. Blake, that is a wildly
inappropriate comment.

403
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,445
- Yeah.
- Not to mention bizarre.

404
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:25,991
Go ahead, say something else.

405
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:27,357
- What?
- Or don't.

406
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,568
- Yeah.
- Talk is cheap.

407
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,673
I've been wanting to do that all day.

408
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:36,769
Well, do it again,
and I will beat you down.

409
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,460
All right. Easy, easy, easy. A little...

410
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,961
A little help?

411
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:43,494
A little... Okay. Okay... No, no, no.

412
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:44,506
Just...

413
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,924
So ladies, how are we feeling?

414
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:50,035
- Humiliated.
- My head is much clearer now.

415
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,316
When he was in here, I couldn't think.
I just wanted him.

416
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,733
It was horrible.

417
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,407
I can only imagine.

418
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,256
You done yet?

419
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:03,641
No, I'm not kidding, Carter.
It was frightening.

420
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,152
I was out of control.

421
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,393
Yeah, it's been happening all day.

422
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,990
Jo kissed me,
but I didn't put it together.

423
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:13,660
Deputy Lupo kissed you, and you didn't
think there was anything wrong?

424
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:16,371
Well, I've been working out.
I'm looking pretty good.

425
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,292
Dr. Young, this is
supposedly your field.

426
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,573
- Do you have any thoughts?
- Yeah, sure,

427
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:25,674
my thoughts are, my reputation's
destroyed, 'cause I frenched the sheriff

428
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,674
- in front of my boss.
- Anne, it's okay. Just

429
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:30,552
- get yourself under control.
- Of course.

430
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,991
The biochemistry of human sexual
attraction isn't well understood.

431
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,057
It could be a glandular disorder,

432
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,561
<i>an enzyme overgrowth,
a fungal infection even.</i>

433
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:43,090
<i>You know what, we need to draw blood.
And you need to stay in the infirmary.</i>

434
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,047
<i>Well, I can't sit still.</i>

435
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:48,464
<i>I mean, I got toilets exploding
and geysers shooting out of the street.</i>

436
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:51,156
<i>I think Eureka's got bigger problems
at the moment than me.</i>

437
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,111
<i>I can't have you
running around out there.</i>

438
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:56,286
<i>You're too irresistible.
I thought I was gonna tear you apart.</i>

439
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:59,016
Good point.

440
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:03,639
All right, but until we figure this out,
let's just keep it quiet.

441
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,332
<i>Keep your distance, ma'am.</i>

442
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,955
<i>Step away from the sheriff.</i>

443
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,164
<i>You keep your hands
where I can see them.</i>

444
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:10,858
<i>Hot lunch coming through.</i>

445
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,405
<i>Hey, do not pierce the bubble.</i>

446
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,150
<i>You, back that way.</i>

447
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>Hey, back in the elevator.
15 feet, Missy.</i>

448
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,264
- <i>All right, come on, it's clear.</i>
- Very subtle, Fargo.

449
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,423
Thank you.

450
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,650
So Stone uncovered 9,000-year-old bones?

451
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,820
There were early human settlements
all through this area.

452
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:33,950
And these were particularly
violent buggers.

453
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,700
Well, that looks like a head wound.

454
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,830
Good eye.

455
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:41,861
Fractures and weapon marks
all over these bones.

456
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,058
I'd say they had a bit of a dust-up.

457
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,212
- And then killed each other.
- Oh, your dogs are wrestling.

458
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,841
That's not wrestling, Fargo.

459
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:53,259
Isn't it beautiful?

460
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,688
They've been at it all day.

461
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:57,051
Gonna have to re-jigger
the formula bit though.

462
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,473
Fred's gonna be naked.

463
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:01,284
Made him a wee bit too irresistible.

464
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,675
- Wait, you did what?
- Can I get some of that?

465
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:05,976
Sorry, Romeo.

466
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,409
Canines and humans do have
a similar hormone chemistry,

467
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,193
- but it wouldn't work.
- Are you sure?

468
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,696
I asked first.
Besides, you got all you can handle.

469
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:16,907
Exactly, Taggart, I think somehow
your pheromones got transferred to me.

470
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,785
I've been accosted
ever since I touched Fred.

471
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,746
Fascinating. If I touched Fred...

472
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,705
Wait, wait,
I touched Fred lots of times.

473
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,324
I haven't noticed any extra...

474
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,962
Charisma.

475
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:32,173
Well, how would you know?
You work down here alone.

476
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:34,283
How many women have even been down here?

477
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,135
We gotta test your mojo.

478
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:44,268
<i>Not sure I'm entirely
comfortable with this.</i>

479
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,788
<i>That makes two of us.</i>

480
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,090
<i>Okay, release the hounds.</i>

481
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,821
<i>Go ahead, ladies. Don't be shy.</i>

482
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:57,643
<i>Feel free to touch.</i>

483
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,050
G'day.

484
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,412
<i>You in the gray skirt.</i>

485
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,803
<i>How do you feel?</i>

486
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,557
Intensely uncomfortable.

487
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:10,085
Wasn't this covered in the seminar?

488
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:15,185
<i>Twenty different women,
they had absolutely no interest in him.</i>

489
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:17,121
What's this stuff you found in my blood?

490
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,351
<i>It's androstadiene.</i>

491
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:21,030
<i>It's one of the hormones involved
with sexual attraction.</i>

492
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,666
<i>According to the blood tests,
your eccrine gland is producing</i>

493
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,410
<i>more than 379 parts per milliliter.</i>

494
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,145
Okay. Is that a lot?

495
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,189
<i>That's 15,000 times more
than the usual amount.</i>

496
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,275
I take that as a "yes."

497
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,803
A woman exposed to such
high levels of androstadiene

498
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:37,853
could experience delusions,

499
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:39,619
erotomania, violence.

500
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,616
It could overload the female brain.

501
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:43,451
<i>And how much is Taggart making?</i>

502
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,121
- Oh, he's normal.
- But, and this is weird,

503
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,043
the male wolf's levels are sky high.

504
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:50,781
Something over-stimulated
his eccrine gland as well.

505
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:55,367
So why is this potion
affecting us differently?

506
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,968
<i>Well, because it's not
the pheromone serum, Sheriff.</i>

507
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:01,865
<i>Taggart's cocktail affects a different
peptide chain. It can't be causing this.</i>

508
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:03,971
Great. Okay...

509
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:08,374
And I still haven't found the guy who
can stop the town from exploding, great.

510
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,477
Please keep me posted if you find out

511
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:12,438
I have anything else
in common with the wolf.

512
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:13,558
And...

513
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,082
get a bullhorn.

514
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:17,026
<i>Carter, Dr. Young is gonna need</i>

515
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,445
<i>to take some more samples
from you before you leave.</i>

516
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,784
Okay, take as much blood as you want,
but let's do this as fast as we can.

517
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:25,559
<i>Actually, I need a sample
of something else.</i>

518
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,706
Need a magazine?

519
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:39,582
Just a few more minutes, everybody.
Please, please, be patient.

520
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,477
I just need to talk
to Carter for a second.

521
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,742
Sorry, no can do.

522
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,098
He's off-limits to the ladies
until further notice.

523
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,061
He's been getting
way too much action lately.

524
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:50,229
Okay, well, just tell him
that I came by.

525
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,288
Yeah, okay, I'll put you on the list.

526
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:54,868
Everybody, just stand back
a little while longer.

527
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,486
French ham with tarragon mustard.

528
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,537
Now can I please have
my female customers back?

529
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,737
Yeah, just trying
to figure out a timeline here.

530
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:03,941
Do you remember the last time Dr. Stone
came in here to pick up his lunch?

531
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:05,491
Yeah, he comes in every day.

532
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,243
Until today, that is.

533
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:09,806
Too bad too.
Cevacice burgers are his favorite.

534
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:13,165
Unlike some other culinary
philistines I won't name.

535
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:15,003
Wait... today?

536
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,045
Did Mrs. Stone pick up cevacice burgers?

537
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,223
Two orders.

538
00:26:22,605 --> 00:26:23,605
Thanks.

539
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:30,105
Wait.

540
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,123
All right, we're clean.

541
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:37,418
Fantastic.

542
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,202
- I'd feel better if I was packing heat.
- I'm not giving you a gun, Fargo.

543
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:45,826
What if some woman attacks?
They're like ninjas.

544
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,487
It's a low charge perimeter fencing.

545
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,280
I can shut it down. I just need 3.7 MW
of power, a couple of platinum rods...

546
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,875
Or, yeah, okay. You just do that.

547
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,839
Champagne, chocolates...

548
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,641
- Someone's been getting busy.
- Honey, did you find it?

549
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,603
Dr. Stone.

550
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Sheriff.

551
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:19,497
I'm... I'm...

552
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:21,910
I'm guessing you didn't find
the massage oil.

553
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,290
The system is going haywire.

554
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:28,105
But the cooling system was fine!

555
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:29,714
You didn't notice how hot it was?

556
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,781
Sure, but Judy just said
she was keeping it warm

557
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,425
because it was sultry,
like, cat on a hot tin roof.

558
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,083
I may regret this, but,

559
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,170
you wanna tell me
what happened with you and Judy?

560
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:44,342
We were eating dinner, and Judy
looked at me over the tuna casserole.

561
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,712
I hadn't seen that look in 15 years.

562
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:51,333
We were like newlyweds again,
you've... no idea what it was like.

563
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,057
Actually, yeah, I think he does.

564
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:57,896
You and Judy?

565
00:27:58,616 --> 00:27:59,616
No!

566
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,565
I mean, yes. But...

567
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:04,618
No. I...

568
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,061
I can't even walk down the street.

569
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:08,906
It has something to do with...

570
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,637
a gland producing too much of something.

571
00:28:11,915 --> 00:28:13,159
Okay, so...

572
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:17,838
what happened with Judy and me,
it... It wasn't real then?

573
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:20,213
It had a little help.

574
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,712
I just thought
it was the old spark coming back.

575
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,800
You didn't think it was a little extreme

576
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,217
when your wife imprisoned you
in your bedroom?

577
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,345
I... I guess I just wanted to believe
that she loved me that much.

578
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,765
I'm sorry things got so out of control.

579
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,398
There's a substation monitor
on main across from Watson and Crick.

580
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:41,729
- Let me get a system update.
- All right, let me give you a lift.

581
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,909
And how are my little lovebirds doing?

582
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,663
- Oh, yipes.
- What "yipes"?

583
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,359
The stirling cryocooler is down to
162 kelvin. You know what that means.

584
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:14,891
It's gonna get hot.

585
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,494
It's already over 100.
No, I mean, it's gonna get hot.

586
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,767
If I don't reroute some coolant pronto,
this is gonna feel like a snow day.

587
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,185
Get out of sight now.

588
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:29,193
Some place safe.

589
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:30,506
What's going on?

590
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,238
<i>Whatever's happening,</i>

591
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:33,750
it's getting violent.

592
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:35,752
Sheriff...

593
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,292
Wilma...

594
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:40,137
ate Fred.

595
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:42,392
Sheriff.

596
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:47,438
Thanks.

597
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,559
Come on, we're leaving.

598
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:54,051
Shotgun!

599
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,749
<i>Back away from the vehicle.</i>

600
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:00,744
They're not backing away
from the vehicle.

601
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,015
Happy place.

602
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,310
Happy place.

603
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,646
You're a great bodyguard, Fargo.

604
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:17,263
I rerouted the liquid nitro.

605
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:20,116
But I don't think the pipes
can hold the pressure much longer.

606
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,758
There's a lot of
particulate matter in the air.

607
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,234
Don't you want a mask?

608
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:26,628
Oh, no, thanks.

609
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:28,268
Love this smell.

610
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,106
Just gotta know how to talk to 'em.

611
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,268
Sorry about Fred.

612
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,293
He died for love.

613
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,644
There are worse ways to go.

614
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:54,874
Yeah.

615
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:56,696
Yeah, there are.

616
00:30:57,403 --> 00:30:58,698
Look...

617
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:00,700
Dr. Stone and I are affected as well.

618
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,621
The only thing that we have
in common are... your... wolves.

619
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,230
I know it's tenuous,

620
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:08,581
but I didn't have anywhere else to go.

621
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,088
Where's Wilma?

622
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:22,845
I had the vet tech take her for a walk.

623
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:26,601
Not healthy for her to sit around

624
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:29,688
after such a big meal.

625
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:32,353
Sorry.

626
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,819
Taggart, what is this stuff?

627
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,739
Animal cage, lots of dust and dirt.

628
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,609
I think I've seen this somewhere before.

629
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,245
- Where?
- <i>Down in one of the tunnels.</i>

630
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,892
<i>There were mineral deposits
and stuff all through the rocks.</i>

631
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:50,374
<i>The dust was everywhere.</i>

632
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,627
I don't see how a mineral
could have this effect.

633
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,790
- Well...
- 'Cause it's not a mineral.

634
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,893
It's a pre-mitotic haploid.

635
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:01,422
Better known as your basic spore.

636
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,554
Hardy little biological

637
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:04,708
<i>bugger too.</i>

638
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:07,414
Just napping until
the right host came along.

639
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:11,337
That would be Dr. Stone and then me.
We were both down in that chamber.

640
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,373
I gave it a quick how-do-you-do.

641
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:15,423
Mostly hydrocarbons.

642
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:17,542
Some trace aminos.

643
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:19,153
And you ready?

644
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,446
Thymosin.

645
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,956
That's a peptide.

646
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,159
<i>Could that mess with my eccrine gland?</i>

647
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,994
In large concentrations, definitely.

648
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,581
Carter, you and Stone were down there.
How did the wolves get exposed?

649
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,926
<i>Well, because they're Siberian wolves.</i>

650
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,947
<i>Yeah, tundra. Siberian tundra wolves.</i>

651
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:39,006
<i>Stone patched an emergency vent to
keep them cool</i> <i>if the system shuts down.</i>

652
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,799
They must have found a way to that vent.

653
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:43,469
Probably down there
for thousands of years just waiting.

654
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:46,764
<i>Yeah, but could they still really be
viable after all that time?</i>

655
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:49,675
<i>Anthrax spores can survive
in the soil for centuries.</i>

656
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:51,560
When they're uncovered,
they're as deadly.

657
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,155
Looks like this one's deadly too.

658
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:56,315
It might explain what happened
to our prehistoric friends.

659
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,875
<i>Taggart could you bring
those samples to my lab?</i>

660
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,666
- <i>Good job, Carter.</i>
- Thanks.

661
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:03,405
- <i>I'll work to counteract the effects.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

662
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:07,390
You feel that?

663
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:10,662
- Oh, my god.
- What?

664
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:14,499
He fixed the air conditioning.

665
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,876
<i>Spores are gonna spread.</i>

666
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,259
Getting all this?

667
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,345
<i>Spore concentration looks pretty bad.</i>

668
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:30,098
Yeah, just drive to the next waypoint
and take the next reading, all right?

669
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,310
All right.

670
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,394
- <i>How bad is it?</i>
- Well,

671
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,641
according to Fargo's measurements,
it's all over town.

672
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:38,732
<i>Great. How's Dr. Young
coming on her antidote?</i>

673
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,194
<i>She'll have enough serum for you
and Dr. Stone by the end of the day.</i>

674
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,371
<i>Well, that's great, but we need some</i>

675
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:45,864
<i>for every male in town.</i>

676
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,350
<i>Well, it's gonna take some time
to grow the cultures.</i>

677
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,618
<i>A couple days.</i>

678
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:50,741
<i>Days?!</i>

679
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,913
<i>We'll have ripped
each other apart by then.</i>

680
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,388
<i>I think that we're gonna
have to consider evacuation.</i>

681
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:58,395
<i>All female residents can be transported
to Ellsworth Air Force Base</i>

682
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,754
<i>until we can produce
a viable counteragent.</i>

683
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,182
<i>Wait...</i>

684
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:04,966
<i>How do you feel about Henry?</i>

685
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,427
- What?
- He's my friend?

686
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:10,221
<i>You were in the tunnels before.
How come she's not all over you?</i>

687
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:13,141
<i>My mask, my dust filter.</i>

688
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:16,038
- <i>No, you weren't wearing a mask.</i>
- <i>No, I was. You couldn't see it.</i>

689
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:20,612
- <i>An electrostatic filter.</i>
- <i>What does it do?</i>

690
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:24,903
<i>I have asthma. This is a casein-based
suspension that coats foreigns particle.</i>

691
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,114
<i>Okay... No, what does it do?</i>

692
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,138
It binds with the spores,
it makes it impossible

693
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:32,201
for them to be absorbed into the body.

694
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,995
<i>How much of this stuff can we make?</i>

695
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,507
<i>The production isn't the problem.
It's the distribution.</i>

696
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,770
<i>We can't get a spray bottle
into every man's hand.</i>

697
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,063
<i>Not before they breathe in
enough spores to be affected like you.</i>

698
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:43,881
<i>What if we spray it everywhere?</i>

699
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:45,757
<i>Use crop dusters, helicopters...</i>

700
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,377
- <i>Will that clean the spores?</i>
- <i>Yes, if they breathe it in,</i>

701
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,357
<i>but we can't use helicopters because
in order to get it into every lung,</i>

702
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:53,516
<i>we have to get it into every building.</i>

703
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:55,493
Well, you know what?

704
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:57,810
<i>This town needs an enema.</i>

705
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:00,400
<i>I'm on it.</i>

706
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,766
So we're gonna pump asthma medicine
through Eureka's cooling system?

707
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:08,545
Yeah, and it'll neutralize the spores.

708
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,098
This one? This goes everywhere?

709
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,915
You pump it, it'll wash out the system.

710
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:18,998
But look, I don't like this.
I just got her all healthy again.

711
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,876
It's the only way to make sure
the electrostatic filter's distributed.

712
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:25,046
- It feels like a violation, you know?
- Don't worry, we'll be gentle.

713
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,367
Make sure the seal is good.
We have enough for one time.

714
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,383
Let me know when you're ready.

715
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,053
Okay. Let it go.

716
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,473
<i>I'm at the perimeter.</i>

717
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,036
If the spore count goes down here,
Eureka is safe.

718
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:39,894
Six parts per million.

719
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:41,779
<i>Still steady.</i>

720
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:43,480
Stone, how's it going down there?

721
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,483
- We have critical pressure.
- Jack, it's leaking.

722
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:50,192
The valve software
isn't calculating the volume.

723
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:53,324
Not looking good. Numbers are climbing.
6.1 parts per million.

724
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:58,996
Stone, grab the other wrench.
We'll see if we can stop this thing.

725
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:07,781
Wow, this is fun.

726
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:10,048
Pressure's rising. Hang in there, guys.

727
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,967
You're containing the leak.

728
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,635
Okay, it's working.

729
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:15,895
Come on.

730
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,604
There it goes. Pressure's moving
through the cooling system.

731
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,206
Come on.

732
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,470
<i>Still steady. No change.</i>

733
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:46,686
Come on.

734
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,944
<i>Steady.</i>

735
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,297
<i>Wait, wait, 5.8.</i>

736
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,883
<i>5.3. Still dropping.</i>

737
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:54,489
<i>It's getting there.</i>

738
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,552
<i>3.4. 3.3 parts per million.</i>

739
00:36:58,271 --> 00:36:59,764
It's working. You did it.

740
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,935
Carter, we almost had a town full of men
just as attractive as you are.

741
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,937
You sure this is gonna reach everyone?

742
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,106
Well, the flow
distribution grid is solid.

743
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:10,712
Anyone who's breathing should be safe.

744
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,828
- Who wouldn't be breathing?
- <i>2.1 parts per million.</i>

745
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,585
- Fargo, take it off.
- <i>What?</i>

746
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,117
You know what. Take it off.

747
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,236
You know, some of us
still believe in love.

748
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,771
- Hey.
- Hello, Henry.

749
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,832
The air conditioning's fixed,
but my thumb pad is broken.

750
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:43,976
This place is falling apart.
Can you let me in?

751
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,351
I'm sorry, Henry, I can't.

752
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,525
Of course you can,
just use your override.

753
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:48,850
It isn't broken.

754
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:52,239
I'm shutting down all research
into the artifact and the accident.

755
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,068
You'll be getting a new lab space.

756
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:55,528
What are you talking about?

757
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,988
Just what I said.

758
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,494
I think that it's time for you
to start moving on to other projects.

759
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:01,701
What?

760
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,856
Why are you doing this to me?

761
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:06,205
I have to.

762
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,288
I'm sorry, Henry.

763
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,278
You're dripping all over my floor.

764
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,574
"Hello" usually comes first.

765
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,514
Wipe your feet.

766
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,455
Where's your boyfriend?

767
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,645
What? Sounded like true love.

768
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,893
No, it sounded like temporary insanity.

769
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:34,943
Okay, so how you feeling now?

770
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,819
All your neurons firing again?

771
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:39,139
Well, I'm fine.

772
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,574
Did you need something?

773
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:42,927
Yeah.

774
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,328
I just wanted you to know
I didn't like that.

775
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:50,141
Seeing you kiss Carter,

776
00:38:51,056 --> 00:38:52,724
I didn't like it at all.

777
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:53,836
No?

778
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,547
I think I've been
pretty clear about that.

779
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,626
The question is what would you like?

780
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,289
Stop playing games.

781
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:04,751
Meaning what?

782
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,179
This.

783
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:24,036
That, I liked.

784
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:54,229
What the hell's going on?

785
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:59,067
There are things going on
which you just don't understand.

786
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,819
Then explain it to me.

787
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,825
I can't.

788
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:04,356
I'm sorry.

789
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,562
- But it's the way it has to be.
- No.

790
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,953
No, it doesn't.

791
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:35,931
Can I get a double
non-fat cappuccino, please?

792
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:37,653
Foaming up as we speak.

793
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:40,045
Thanks, Vince, that was fantastic.

794
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:41,311
You're very welcome.

795
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,702
Sorry about hanging up before.

796
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:52,305
It's okay.

797
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,455
No need to explain. Fargo filled me in.

798
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:56,199
Yeah.

799
00:40:57,074 --> 00:41:00,253
Prehistoric love spores,
the oldest dodge in the book.

800
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,825
You know, you could have called me back.

801
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:06,134
I really put myself
out there with that invite.

802
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:09,137
Yeah, but you were
under the influence, right?

803
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:12,014
- What are you talking about?
- The invitation to your uncle's cabin.

804
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,511
Don't worry about it.
Just never happened.

805
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:18,104
Probably would have been a bad idea.

806
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:21,399
Yeah, I was serious about this weekend.

807
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:26,612
Just for your information,
you went to see Henry in the tunnel

808
00:41:26,871 --> 00:41:29,057
after I asked you, yeah.

809
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:35,141
I am a moron.

810
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:48,931
So...

811
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,052
So...

812
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:53,045
<i>Tell me about this uncle's cabin.</i>
