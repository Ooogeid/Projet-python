1
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:08,113
You said that if I had 20 hours
behind the wheel, you'd let me.

2
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:10,899
"Drive," as in my car.
Not as in "get your own".

3
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:14,142
Well, it's not like I'm gonna
pick up guys and head for Vegas.

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:17,744
Okay, now you can never
get a car of your own.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,919
Hit me again, Vincent.

6
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,276
What's up, Jo? Big date?

7
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:25,407
High school science fair.

8
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,620
Most dangerous day of the year.

9
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,319
What you got? Um,

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,619
baking soda volcanoes and
some lame fly experiments?

11
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:36,387
Teens with unlimited access
to terrifying technology.

12
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,376
It's Armageddon with acne.

13
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,215
Really? What's your experiment?

14
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:42,760
Flies.

15
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,243
At least you're going with a classic.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,372
It's a dumb genetics thing. I want
to show how different behavior traits

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,836
- pass from one generation to the next.
- Right,

18
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:56,479
like the keen Carter investigative mind.

19
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:59,311
- Honey, that's not so dumb. Thanks.
- Doesn't matter.

20
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,531
I'm gonna be humiliated
by the competition.

21
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:02,975
Hey, don't say that.

22
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:06,162
You just do your best.
Forget about the competition.

23
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,990
She's just a little insecure
about her IQ test.

24
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:11,992
Her...

25
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,358
What IQ test?

26
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,058
Do you two even talk?

27
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,829
Everyone at school had to take it.

28
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:21,309
Wh... Why am I always the last to know?

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,775
Because it's not big deal, and
what could you have done about it?

30
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:27,348
Well, I coulda told you that
I took one when I was a kid.

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,900
- Really?
- Yes.

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,188
And I did very well. I got 111.

33
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:34,437
I didn't even try and I got over 100%.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,441
Yeah, he surprises me sometimes too.

35
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,623
Your regular wheat grass?

36
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:46,420
Please, and one to go for Dr. Stark.

37
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:49,490
Two cups of workout fuel coming up.

38
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,850
Hey... Vincent, I'll try one of those.

39
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,906
Sounds very wheaty.

40
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:59,010
Do you need a ride to school?
Yeah, like, five minutes ago. Okay.

41
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,995
Good luck. And don't worry about it,
project's gonna be great.

42
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:03,448
Thanks, Dad.

43
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,571
Science fair, big day.

44
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,459
Oh, not you too.

45
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:11,225
Why do you think I've been working out?

46
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,570
Oh, I hear ya. I love exercise.

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,892
Just, pump time.

48
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:18,544
Find my center. Clear the chi.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
Oh, you to to the gym?

50
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:22,152
Sure.

51
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,858
All the time.

52
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,912
Good stuff.

53
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,064
I imagine carter more of a
jumping jacks, medicine ball kinda guy.

54
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,207
He says he works out here all the time.

55
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,788
Well, I've never seen him.

56
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,644
And I wouldn't have forgotten that.

57
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,437
Hey guys, they're...
They're... loaners.

58
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,036
I left my gym bag at home.

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,913
This is the zone, right?

60
00:02:57,464 --> 00:02:58,951
Yeah, Carter, you remember,

61
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:00,825
under the gym floor there's a generator

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,706
that produces a localized EM field?

63
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,665
Right, yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:08,204
- And the bars...
- Are paired with the floor.

65
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,600
The field either attracts or repels them
to mimic different weights.

66
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,935
So what you gonna try first?

67
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,231
How about 111?

68
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:17,824
Yeah, huh? Yeah.

69
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,800
You heard about that.

70
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:21,916
You never cease to amaze me, Carter.

71
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:25,858
So the, uh, the science fair,
that's sort of a geeks gone wild, huh?

72
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,876
You know how Texans feel about
their high school football?

73
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,763
- Yeah.
- Child's play.

74
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:33,706
A lot of GD's greatest stars
were discovered at the fair.

75
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,119
Career can be made overnight.

76
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:40,318
Yeah, but, I mean, they're only kids.
How much trouble can they get into?

77
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,351
I mean...

78
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,775
Jo made it seem like
the sky was falling.

79
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,450
That hasn't happened since 2004.

80
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:51,662
And that was more
of an igniting of the ionosphere.

81
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:53,635
Seriously?

82
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:57,194
Hey, when you're pioneering
new territory, things happen.

83
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,704
Truth is, we have strict guidelines, but

84
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:03,901
there's rarely been a year when
someone or some thing hasn't gone...

85
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,153

- Season 2 | Episode 5 -
Duck, Duck Goose (v. 1.0)

91
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,478
All right, so, what's the damage, Henry?

92
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,673
Well, there's a hole
in the engine block.

93
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,648
Looks like it went right through.

94
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,438
Any idea what could cause it?

95
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,876
Oh, I don't know. Given the trajectory,

96
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,102
a meteorite?

97
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,407
- A meteorite?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,448
A meteorite hit my car?

99
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,197
No, not buying it.

100
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,806
Looks like there's
another hole down there.

101
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,534
Looks like a piece of metal maybe.

102
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:25,897
It's way down there though.

103
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,894
Well, no way to get to it
without excavating.

104
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,340
Oh, there might be.

105
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:36,381
Since when do you go to the gym?

106
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,895
Oh, shut up.

107
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:47,999
Got it.

108
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,973
You know, two feet to
the left of my car, I'd let it go.

109
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,934
Two feet to the right,
I'd give it to you. But right

110
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,013
through my car, I...

111
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,453
I gotta check it out. Maybe Jo is right.
Maybe it has something to do

112
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,460
- with the science fair.
- Well, take it to the NEAT lab at GD.

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,956
Oh, they're all neat to me.

114
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,922
No, near earth asteroid tracking.
In the meantime,

115
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,371
I'll drop your car off at my garage,
but let me know what the lab says.

116
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,277
All right.

117
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,389
you're taking my car.
How am I supposed to...

118
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,465
Done deal, called GD, and...

119
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,474
Fargo is working on something.

120
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,291
Sheriff, may I take it for you?

121
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,159
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

122
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,033
You gotta be kidding me.

123
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:55,271
<i>Hello, Sheriff Carter.</i>

124
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,157
SARAH? Is that you?

125
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,359
- <i>Surprise.</i>
- How am I supposed to steer?

126
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,884
- <i>I am self-navigating.</i>
- SARAH, what are you doing?

127
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,256
<i>I just wanted to get out
of the house for a while.</i>

128
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,732
<i>Dr. Fargo downloaded me to the car.</i>

129
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:09,442
<i>Shall we get going?</i>

130
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,504
You know what,
I'm good. I think I'll walk.

131
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,664
<i>Come on, Sheriff.
We never go anywhere together.</i>

132
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,446
<i>It'll be an adventure.</i>

133
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:22,113
All right. Fine, but watch the road.

134
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,115
And just try to keep it under
the speed limit, if you wouldn't mind.

135
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,789
<i>Buckle up.</i>

136
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:31,276
Deputy, I am very sorry about whatever
happened to sheriff Carter's jeep,

137
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,091
but I don't think any of our
students had anything to do with it.

138
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:37,221
We have very strict ground rules
concerning our experiments.

139
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,651
No cloning, AI, infectious diseases,

140
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:43,613
no space-time continuum manipulation,
and no GD technology.

141
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,266
Hey, they're kids. Kids cheat,

142
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,255
especially smart ones,
which in this case is all of them.

143
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,078
I would like to think that
our students follow the honor system.

144
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,688
Even the heathers?

145
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:03,648
I thought you were gonna suspend those 3
after the stunt they pulled last year.

146
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:07,873
Well, we considered it, but their
contributions proved far too valuable.

147
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,837
Music, downloaded
directly into the brain.

148
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:15,179
That technology won an Enterprise award
and a Macarthur genius grant.

149
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:17,790
That technology gave me
a headache for two weeks.

150
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,858
I promise to keep an eye out.

151
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,312
I heard about
your genetics experiment, Zoe.

152
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,277
Mendel? Really?

153
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,678
That guy died, like,
what, a century ago?

154
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,749
Is that the best you can do?

155
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,135
Last century's fruit fly experiment.

156
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:39,160
They're tsetse flies.

157
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:42,253
Wow, very 111.

158
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:45,130
Guess the genetic apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

159
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,628
- <i>This is fantastic.</i>
- Watch it!

160
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,575
<i>I think I'm getting the hang of this.</i>

161
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:58,406
You do know you need a driver's license,
right? Like, I could arrest you.

162
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,176
<i>We should go somewhere.
I've always wanted to see the ocean.</i>

163
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:04,488
We are going somewhere. We're going
to Global. And maintain the speed limit.

164
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,771
<i>Don't be a back seat driver.
You need to relax.</i>

165
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,131
<i>Have a massage.</i>

166
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,978
Oh, that's just freaking me out.

167
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,704
<i></i>

168
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:16,112
<i>effleurage...</i>

169
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:17,499
- Geese.
- <i>Geese.</i>

170
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,722
Geese!

171
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,676
Holy crap.

172
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,068
Turn back, turn back,
you're going the wrong way.

173
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,211
One of my flocks.

174
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,864
Been using them
to study migration patterns.

175
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:44,139
They should be gone by now,

176
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,989
winging south along the pacific flyways.

177
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,404
I don't know what I did wrong.

178
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,295
I'm sorry to hear that.

179
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,345
They need to spread their wings.
Leave home.

180
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,539
It's not normal for them
to stay with their mama.

181
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,749
- You mean papa.
- Mama.

182
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,226
- Papa.
- Mama.

183
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,770
In the animal kingdom,

184
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,490
the male of the species is generally
useless at child rearing.

185
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:14,994
No talent for it whatsoever.

186
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:19,009
That's probably true.

187
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,750
Tiny meteorites, crazy house.

188
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,403
- <i>Massage?</i>
- No.

189
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:42,877
<i>Henry thinks it's just a meteorite.</i>

190
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,315
That's what I'm here to find out.

191
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,291
So how's SARAH?

192
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:48,661
Oh, fantastic.

193
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,548
Remind me to kill Fargo.

194
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:54,558
Fargo's at the GD Arctic station,
staff development seminar.

195
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,437
I sent the car.

196
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:00,355
I just thought you might be sore
after your workout.

197
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,098
I'm fine. Thanks.

198
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,265
Very funny, Carter.

199
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,376
Not funny. Can't move.

200
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,084
Easy, Sheriff. Just relax and breathe.

201
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,815
- It'll pass in a minute.
- Okay.

202
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,850
- What happened?
- Cephalic pattern security barrier...

203
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,692
A sensor intensive gateway

204
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,051
that registers identiy based on DNA.

205
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,342
- Not helping.
- If someone enters

206
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:25,828
without proper clearance,

207
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,368
it initiates a light-based
immobilization field.

208
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,516
I thought you worked
these bugs out months ago.

209
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,965
I did, but the sheriff
must not be in the system yet.

210
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:36,383
Did you get the registration notice
I sent to your office?

211
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,783
Jo opens all the mail. She...

212
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,506
She's so mean.

213
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,489
This will last for the day.

214
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,512
But I'll need a DNA sample
for permanent clearance.

215
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:47,976
Don't forget.

216
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,332
Oh, I'll do my best.

217
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,586
I have a briefing to go to.
Will you be okay?

218
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,132
Yeah, never better.

219
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,526
Hello.

220
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,340
Dr. Finn, I'm sheriff Carter.
I'm the one who called you.

221
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,978
A moment please.

222
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:30,366
Well, good thing Eureka's a no-fly zone.

223
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:31,900
It's not a ray gun.

224
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:33,954
It's a catadioptric imager.

225
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,254
A...

226
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:37,950
telescope with a camera.

227
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:43,152
Powerful enough to pierce
GD's electromagnetic umbrella.

228
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:47,312
And today, it happens to be six
milli-arcseconds off in right ascension,

229
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,560
so you can guess the kinda day
that I am having.

230
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,550
The worst.

231
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,649
Maybe I should talk to someone else
in your Neato lab.

232
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,104
Sorry, it's just me.

233
00:12:57,285 --> 00:13:00,391
The director is at a conference
in Hawaii. But hey,

234
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,515
I get to stay and watch the equipment.

235
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,178
And I get to look at your little rock.

236
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:06,924
Highlight of my week.

237
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,064
Like I said, I'm not sure what it is.

238
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,208
Well, it's doubtful
that it came from space.

239
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:15,214
The lab tracks all known objects large
enough to enter earth's atmosphere.

240
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,270
So you guard the Earth
from total destruction.

241
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:20,564
That's a pretty cool gig.

242
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:24,240
No, I keep the telescope working
while others go to Hawaii.

243
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,223
So is it a meteorite?

244
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,213
Not unless it was made in China.

245
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,004
A meteorite is a rock. That is man-made.

246
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,933
Probably a fragment off
a chinese weather satellite.

247
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,644
Wait... A fragment?

248
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,933
Yeah, space is full of junk.

249
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,995
bits of satellites, tools lost
during shuttle missions.

250
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,164
How many we talking?

251
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,676
Over the last 40 years,

252
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:48,926
maybe a couple hundred thousand in all.

253
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,722
- Couple hundred thousand?
- There's no need to stockpile

254
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,314
the batteries and the bottled water.

255
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,581
An impact like this happens
once in a lifetime. So just...

256
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:05,448
Or twice.

257
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,278
Looks like we found the rest
of our chinese satellite.

258
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,684
I don't think so.

259
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,662
Almost done mapping it now.

260
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:18,179
What is that?

261
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,336
It's a portable computer
axial tomographer.

262
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,423
We take a 3-D image and then we pipe it
into a set point topology program.

263
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:25,798
What is that?

264
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,524
That...

265
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,809
Would be a toilet.

266
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:36,664
Specifically, a zero-gravity urinal
developed by NASA called

267
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,002
an opti-can.

268
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,816
It was discarded by ISS. Years ago.

269
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,923
What are the odds of two pieces of space
junk hitting Eureka on the same day?

270
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,456
Well, random events
do tend to cluster together,

271
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,982
but I'll admit,
that's a bit of a coincidence.

272
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,829
A bit of a coincidence?

273
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,817
The computers create orbit determination
images every 24 hours.

274
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:57,674
The next one will be at 6:00 tonight.

275
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,667
Let's see if we can
step up the time table.

276
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:02,492
A lot of things could hit us
between now and 6:00.

277
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,977
This is from yesterday.

278
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,371
The green circles are objects whose
trajectories have been projected and

279
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,664
pose no risk to earth.

280
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,840
They're definitely in STABO.

281
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:15,107
- Stable orbit.
- I was gonna get it.

282
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,811
Can we see what you got from today?

283
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,577
Yeah,

284
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,557
the director doesn't let me
evaluate raw data

285
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,633
before it's been compiled
unless it's an emergency.

286
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:28,733
Finn, a metal toilet
plowed into a field.

287
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:30,538
Right.

288
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,586
Well, this image won't be complete
for eight hours,

289
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,221
but it'll give you a general idea of...

290
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,116
Okay, that's not good.

291
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:41,014
The debris field is coalescing
into geosynchronous orbit.

292
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,551
And their course has been
unnaturally altered.

293
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,208
They're all coming to Eureka.

294
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,144
So, if we don't figure out
what's causing this, what happened

295
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,665
- to my jeep this morning...
- Is the just the beginning.

296
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,204
- Shouldn't we call Norad or something?
- Are you kidding? Norad calls us.

297
00:15:57,435 --> 00:16:00,493
I've re-tasked our satellites to scan
for anything that could be affecting

298
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,670
objects in orbit.

299
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,986
Henry and Finn work on
a real time inertial track

300
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,138
to pinpoint where the debris could hit.

301
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,715
Okay, I'll sound the alarm,
I'll cancel the science fair.

302
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,212
The science fair is happening
in the safest place in town.

303
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:14,229
It was built as a shelter.
It has a cubic boron nitride roof,

304
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,498
dynamic vector shielding.

305
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:18,922
Unless it holds 3,000 people, we're
still gonna need to evacuate the town.

306
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,122
To where? A debris cloud like this
could fall across 500 square miles.

307
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,360
Until we have a hard track, we don't
know where this stuff could hit.

308
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,287
Taggart,

309
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,364
those things better be housebroken.

310
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,810
You bring a creature into the world,

311
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,821
you try to prepare her for any challenge
she might encounter.

312
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,202
Where did I go wrong?

313
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,509
We do the best we can. Right?

314
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:53,830
I can't help feeling I've failed them.

315
00:16:58,754 --> 00:16:59,769
You...

316
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:03,150
Time to see what's going on inside you,

317
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,365
my little winged angel.

318
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,815
Taggart, what the hell?

319
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:15,472
I don't know whether to be
disturbed or relieved.

320
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,745
They're mechanical.

321
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,766
But still close to my heart.

322
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,708
Did I make a hash of their software?

323
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,430
Internal compass.

324
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,849
Maybe it's the wing design.

325
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,780
Can I ask you why

326
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:39,149
you built a flock of robo-birds?

327
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:41,645
I just modified a military design to

328
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,630
track migration patterns.

329
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,781
The military's building killer geese?

330
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,806
Camouflaged drones.

331
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,228
Heavily armed.

332
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,396
Look up, see a goose.

333
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,367
You don't pay any attention.

334
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:03,742
Then...

335
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:05,358
Bangaroo.

336
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:08,246
Death from above.

337
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,146
Oldest rule of warfare...

338
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:14,130
Control the high ground.

339
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,148
Well,

340
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,621
back to the lab with this one.

341
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,493
<i>Wait, you think we're under attack?</i>

342
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:36,794
Isn't it possible that someone is
making this space junk fall on Eureka?

343
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:39,016
Oldest rule of warfare
to control the high ground.

344
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,224
They have attempted at
weaponizing space debris,

345
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,784
but Russia stopped after the cold war.
So that just leaves...

346
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:46,474
- Aliens.
- No, Jack. Us.

347
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,764
Or Aliens.

348
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,168
The star wars defense system.

349
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:55,583
They weren't working on rail guns, x-ray
lasers to shoot down nuclear missiles.

350
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,375
They wanted to use what was
up there already as AMMO.

351
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:02,647
So we tested a system of magnetic
panels in the desert in 1986.

352
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:05,195
And then we abandoned it
after our very first attempt.

353
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,309
I'm hoping they didn't suck down
a bunch of planes and helicopters.

354
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,601
No, but nearly all the recorded data
in Nevada was erased.

355
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:16,085
Tapes in video stores,
floppy disks in casinos,

356
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,290
half the database of area 51.

357
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,020
Area 51 is real?

358
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:24,884
No.

359
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:27,581
Anyway, the research was shuttered by

360
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:28,816
1989.

361
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,595
It was too bad. GD Was heavily involved.

362
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:34,445
Even some of our science fair
winners were in the mix.

363
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,614
Stop it. Go back.

364
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,607
The... The one before.

365
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,946
Okay.

366
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,233
That's Finn.

367
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:49,333
Aaron Finn won the Eureka science fair

368
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,218
in 1986 and received

369
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,564
an internship at Global for...

370
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,945
Let me guess, his work on giant
space junk sucking magnets.

371
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,137
Optical aiming devices

372
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:04,477
for giant space junk sucking magnets.

373
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,788
- Thanks, Henry.
- You're welcome.

374
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,489
- Dr. Finn.
- What?

375
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,723
Congratulations on the science fair win.

376
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:18,380
Well, that was 20 years ago, but okay.

377
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,599
Is it a coincidence that the project
that launched your career

378
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,160
could actually explain
what's been happening?

379
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,012
Launch my career?

380
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:33,207
That science fair nearly ended it
before it even began.

381
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,638
Do you know what it is like
to have your best idea

382
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:39,293
co-opted by the government at age 16?

383
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,103
No. Not really.

384
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,842
It was all downhill from there.

385
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,433
20 years later, where am I?

386
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,036
I'm not in Hawaii.

387
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,006
I am here.

388
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,793
I'm a... I'm a

389
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,963
I'm a cameraman to the stars.

390
00:20:57,795 --> 00:20:58,798
Sir,

391
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:01,480
are you using your research
to get back at the town?

392
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,343
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to help the town.

393
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,357
Look, I re-programmed the imager
to take a real time assessment

394
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,826
of the debris field every 20 minutes.

395
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,549
Look, I may be pissed off,

396
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,425
but I could no more cause this
than I could prevent it.

397
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:21,746
Look, Sheriff,

398
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,301
they're flying.

399
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,089
- Congratulations.
- My geese.

400
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:29,921
They're going.

401
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,095
They're really going.

402
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:34,972
- Taggart?
- Oh, they're turning.

403
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,441
They seem to be coming this way.

404
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,405
Quite rapidly, actually.

405
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:42,786
Move! Move through here.

406
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,540
Quick. Hurry.

407
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:53,395
Sorry about all this, Taggart.

408
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,163
- Try not to take it too personally.
- It's difficult.

409
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:58,468
They lost their way.
And I gotta wear it.

410
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,642
Do you think the same thing
that screws up your birds

411
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,356
could be attracting the space junk?

412
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,985
They're made from pure polymer
matrix composites. No metal.

413
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,933
But you said you put some kind
of compass inside the birds, right?

414
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:12,443
I got ya.

415
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:15,352
In your biological avian,

416
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:19,358
neurons contain an iron oxide crystal
that aligns with magnetic north.

417
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,731
It sends directional info to the brain.

418
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:24,773
I just designed an artificial version
for my geese.

419
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:27,351
Okay, so a big magnet
could knock them off course.

420
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:31,458
- Very possible.
- For the last time, it's a camera.

421
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:37,157
I... I remember you. 1986.
I was one of the judges.

422
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,774
Good times.

423
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:41,502
That was quite a crop
of baby geniuses, wasn't it?

424
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,720
Finn, let's check out the latest crop.
Let's go.

425
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:56,029
<i>Judging for the science fair
will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

426
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:59,178
<i>Students, please prepare your
projects for presentation.</i>

427
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,467
My experiment. What happened?

428
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,339
It was Megan and
her little Coven, wasn't it?

429
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,356
They took your flies.

430
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,571
Ever since I got a 94
on my physics midterm,

431
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:12,937
those girls have made
my life a living hell.

432
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,098
A 94, that's great.

433
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:17,374
Yeah, well, norms aren't
supposed to be smart.

434
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,001
Norms?

435
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,681
Kids without genius parents.
And I think you've met my dad.

436
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:25,618
Hey, where I come from
we respect our parents.

437
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,510
Especially if they carry a gun.

438
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,210
The point is my flies have flown.
I'm screwed.

439
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:32,971
You still have your data.

440
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:36,715
Doesn't matter.
I'm just living up to my 111 legacy.

441
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,565
What am I supposed to do?

442
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,189
Sua sponte.

443
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:46,267
75th ranger regimental motto.

444
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,641
It means to act without warning.

445
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,053
You know, they expect you to give up.

446
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:54,828
So... Surprise them.

447
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:57,524
Don't get mad, get even.

448
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,510
<i>We're three minutes from
the Tesla school, Sheriff.</i>

449
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:06,900
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

450
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:09,423
Can't afford a whole car?

451
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,374
Oh, don't get me started.

452
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:14,006
You okay?

453
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:15,817
Yeah.

454
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:18,860
It's just...

455
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,406
it took years of therapy to...

456
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,562
get over winning that science fair,

457
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:25,767
and I haven't been back since.

458
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:27,354
Get over it?

459
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,827
Get over what?
You won. You said it was...

460
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:32,796
the high point of your career.

461
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:34,583
It was.

462
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,307
The high point.

463
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,439
And now I get to go back
and see how far I've fallen?

464
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,564
Can't wait for that.

465
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:49,919
We integrated the existing
processor circuitry fiberware

466
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,504
with a bio-mechanic interface protocol,

467
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,685
leading to possible
cybernetic applications.

468
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,586
Your thoughts, Dr. Stark?

469
00:24:57,358 --> 00:24:59,351
I was actually thinking
of a Bear Bryant quote.

470
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,537
"Potential is what you ain't got yet."

471
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:06,869
Claude, do you even
want to be a scientist?

472
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,176
Why don't you quit wasting
everyone's time. Step up your game.

473
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,681
See what I mean? Brutal.

474
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:17,199
Yeah, I thought Stark just
talked like that to me.

475
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:19,179
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

476
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,165
So what's behind the tent?

477
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:23,833
Dr. Stark, Principal Wallace,
we present...

478
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:27,308
Solar powered ultra high resolution
gamma pulse tomography.

479
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,287
It's the next phase in medical imaging.

480
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:31,955
First, there were x-rays,
then MRIs, and now,

481
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:33,754
the SGT.

482
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:39,581
The SGT will lead us
into a cancer-free future

483
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:42,134
with an entirely green power source.

484
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,494
Hey, who threw that?

485
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:53,430
This isn't supposed to happen.

486
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:58,002
Make it stop.

487
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:03,834
Bingo.

488
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,846
I knew those three were trouble.

489
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,825
Looks like we found our magnetic field.

490
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,584
Stay back!
How can I shut this thing down?

491
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,137
I don't know how.

492
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,095
What is happening here?

493
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,668
"Reno 111" just totally messed up
the future of medicine.

494
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,622
We're gonna have to take this in
for testing. And you, you, and you,

495
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:33,484
I'm gonna have to ask
you some questions.

496
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:34,786
Wait, just...

497
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,781
- It wasn't their fault.
- No one's getting blamed yet, honey.

498
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,987
No, look, whatever happened,
they didn't do it.

499
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:44,982
It was me.

500
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,091
Look what you've done.

501
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:51,988
Easy. What did you do?

502
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,163
I... I sua sponted them.

503
00:26:56,513 --> 00:26:57,660
She got even.

504
00:26:57,827 --> 00:27:00,249
They sabotaged her experiment, so

505
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,320
she messed with theirs.

506
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:04,378
Really?

507
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:07,198
Yeah, I know, dumb, right? Big surprise.

508
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,064
Do you have any idea what you've done?

509
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:11,386
I over cranked the system
during your lunch.

510
00:27:11,524 --> 00:27:14,363
It's not like your wiring was
that hard to re-circuit.

511
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,366
You better not have touched
the power system.

512
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:17,570
Enough.

513
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:20,707
We're not done. If she messed with
this thing at lunch, there's no way

514
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:22,856
it could have pulled the space junk
on my jeep.

515
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,242
Thanks for breaking it then.

516
00:27:26,637 --> 00:27:28,499
So does that mean I'm not grounded?

517
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:31,929
You're more than grounded.
We just have bigger problems right now.

518
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,072
Finn's boss took a reading from
GD Radioscope in Haleakala.

519
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,287
He gives us 3 hours before the debris
field enters the atmosphere above us.

520
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,449
Most of the small particles
will burn upon entry.

521
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,267
- And the big ones?
- Will make it through,

522
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:47,218
- we've no idea where they'll hit.
- Whoever's here stays here.

523
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,641
The rest are being moved
to underground bunkers.

524
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:53,029
But I don't even want to think about
what's gonna happen to the town.

525
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:56,267
I don't know why it went
all magneto in there.

526
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:59,071
Why don't you ask the dumb blonde
who messed with it.

527
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,190
Watch who you're calling dumb.

528
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:02,868
I've seen this before.

529
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,678
Ten minutes ago at the science fair?

530
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,568
No, on the roof of Global, only bigger.

531
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:09,582
What are you talking about?

532
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:12,173
I admire your audacity, but the rules

533
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,659
prohibit the use of any
technology from Global.

534
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:16,946
I didn't steal it, I invented it.

535
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,068
Jane Harrington developed an identical

536
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:21,827
solar beam array to power
our new security system.

537
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,878
Do you really expect us to believe
that this is just coincidence?

538
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,514
Jane Harrington?

539
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,892
I take it you know her.

540
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:31,435
Yeah.

541
00:28:33,553 --> 00:28:34,730
She's my mom.

542
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,044
<i>Evacuation in progress.</i>

543
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,952
<i>Please continue down to the bunkers.</i>

544
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,049
Hey, Jane. Whatcha doin'?

545
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:59,961
Some sort of bird problem damaged
my system's power source on the roof.

546
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:02,061
We're having to scan everyone manually.

547
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:05,175
Are you good or should we get
your daughter to help you fix it?

548
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:13,518
You stole her design to help
power your security system.

549
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,505
I invented that power system.

550
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:18,873
Why would I have to steal it
from a 15-year-old?

551
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,525
Oh, maybe because you've been behind
schedule, now suddenly, you're on-line.

552
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,868
I checked the dates on your plans
against Megan's project.

553
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,104
We know what happened.

554
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:32,357
Does Megan know?

555
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:34,503
Jane, how could you do that?

556
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:35,977
You're a parent.

557
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,438
You know the pressure
to do what's best for your child.

558
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:42,855
Megan loves it in Eureka.
If I didn't get the system working,

559
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,527
my funding would be cut, I'd be out.

560
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,779
I panicked.

561
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,267
I'm so embarrassed.

562
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,478
I'm sorry,

563
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,967
but I'll have to suspend your clearance
pending review by the ethics panel.

564
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,063
I just didn't want to let her down.

565
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,015
Guys.

566
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:07,542
I've got something you need to see.

567
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,004
<i>Yeah, it's coming. All of it.</i>

568
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:17,292
I thought we had more time.

569
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,815
This doesn't make any sense.

570
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:21,555
I don't care how big
you make my experiment,

571
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:23,962
the power supply doesn't have
anything to do with magnets.

572
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:25,562
Maybe it's interacting with something.

573
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:28,681
Good "oh," bad "oh"?

574
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:30,060
The EM barrier over Global.

575
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:32,890
It's an electro-magnetic
security umbrella.

576
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:36,279
You shot my energy beam
through a magnetostatic array?

577
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:37,582
Mom,

578
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:38,799
duh.

579
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,854
The beam turned the shield
into a giant magnet

580
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,363
strong enough to
pull metal down from space.

581
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,405
Turn off the beam.

582
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,229
Section four, please.

583
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,670
The beam's been off
since the bird issue.

584
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,533
The debris has already
entered the atmosphere.

585
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:02,379
I'm afraid it's too late.

586
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:15,182
Everybody, stay calm!

587
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,406
The safest place in town is right here.

588
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:21,613
Well, we've got everyone
in the auditorium,

589
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,910
and the deputy has yet to use her taser.

590
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:27,284
Thank god for small favors.
Is Kevin okay? Is he scared?

591
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:28,616
He's good. He's safe.

592
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,428
I told him he could
be an honorary judge.

593
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,173
I should be there with him.

594
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,247
<i>You will be soon enough. Just...</i>

595
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,393
<i>concentrate on trying
to stop this debris.</i>

596
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:41,326
<i>Still fine.</i>

597
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,116
<i>But I guess I got my answer.</i>

598
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,251
Yeah.

599
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,804
The debris is entering
the atmosphere at a very steep angle.

600
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:49,589
Can we un-steep it?

601
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:52,260
Do you understand anything
about particle physics?

602
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:55,147
No, not really.

603
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:57,348
Well, how about gravity?

604
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:02,232
Once my mom's "security device"
pulled the space junk out of orbit,

605
00:32:02,697 --> 00:32:04,091
gravity takes over.

606
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:10,009
Not necessarily.

607
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,875
There's a giant magnet under this floor,

608
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:17,677
if it can repel these bars, it can do
the same with the space junk.

609
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,593
- That's your idea?
- Megan, don't be rude.

610
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,998
You don't get to tell me what to do.
Not anymore.

611
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:25,446
I may let the pressure get to me.
I may made a mistake.

612
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,974
But I'm still your mother,
don't get to talk that way.

613
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,247
Jack, this field is simply not powerful
enough to push the debris away.

614
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,007
I'm not talking about pushing it away.
I'm talking...

615
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,716
more nudging it.

616
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,303
Oh, you mean

617
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:41,252
alter the angle of entry just enough so
the debris will burn in the atmosphere?

618
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,753
Uh, sure. Okay.

619
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:46,404
Dad, that's almost brilliant.

620
00:32:46,524 --> 00:32:47,884
We'd still need more juice.

621
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,480
Zoe supercharged Megan's
power source at the science fair.

622
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,544
So we just hook it up
to the giant magnet.

623
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,409
- And then there's our juice.
- Yeah.

624
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,026
I don't know how to do that.

625
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,994
Sure you do. You just did it.

626
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,416
I was just screwing around!
You can't expect I fix this by myself.

627
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:04,411
Seriously.

628
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:07,035
No, I don't.

629
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:08,867
That's why both of you are here.

630
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:11,739
The bulk of the debris field
is only 15 minutes away.

631
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,425
We've got to hurry.

632
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:18,127
Okay, Zoe, think. You boosted
Megan's power. What did you do?

633
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,836
- I...
- She has no idea what she did.

634
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,475
She's like that one monkey
who just happens to type Shakespeare.

635
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:26,154
Okay, even a trained monkey
would know that the peak

636
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,346
output of a pv array
can be increased dramatically

637
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:31,171
if the modules are interconnected
in parallel, not in

638
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,434
series, as was done here.

639
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,230
That could increase our efficiency 400%.

640
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,663
Good job, sweetie.

641
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,326
Do whatever you want if
you think she knows so much.

642
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:42,257
Enough!

643
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,411
This is not about

644
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,596
who knows more or who's the smartest.

645
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,454
Forget the competition.

646
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,322
Forget the pressure. It is crap.

647
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:55,361
You have created something amazing,
you have a chance to make a difference.

648
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:00,119
Don't let anything
get in the way of that

649
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,236
or believe me, you'll regret it.

650
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:10,810
We'll still need a sat-nav system
to orient the magnetic field accurately.

651
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,948
I could rig something up,
but that'll take time.

652
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,838
You don't have to. I know where one is.

653
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:21,033
Is this gonna work?

654
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:23,577
I hope so, because
the circuitry is gonna be fried.

655
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,906
The energy sap is catastrophic.

656
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,749
<i>I guess this means
we're not going to the beach.</i>

657
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:31,426
No, we won't, but it's
been quite an adventure.

658
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,161
Okay. Here we go.

659
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,775
Okay, SARAH,

660
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,375
what do you see?

661
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,739
Processing trajectory data.

662
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,090
Power's holding steady.
Good work, girls.

663
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,373
Not bad for a norm.

664
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:53,009
That's the most human
thing you've ever said to me.

665
00:34:53,678 --> 00:34:54,703
Don't tell anyone.

666
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,505
Here we go.

667
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:02,290
<i>The Data Stream is too large
for my processor.</i>

668
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,415
<i>I'm running low on available memory.</i>

669
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:08,319
We've got 30 seconds 'til
the debris field enters the atmosphere.

670
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,106
<i>Still calculating trajectory.</i>

671
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:13,581
Come on, SARAH,
you can do it. I know you can.

672
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:16,958
<i>Trajectory found.</i>

673
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,251
What's going on? Is it working?

674
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:35,274
<i>Space debris vertical trajectory
has been adjusted by 32 degrees.</i>

675
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,325
- It's working.
- <i>Surface metal temperature:</i>

676
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,245
<i>8,000 degrees.</i>

677
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,035
Debris field beginning to vaporize.

678
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,580
Yes!

679
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:48,752
- Great. Good job.
- You too.

680
00:35:58,096 --> 00:35:59,353
<i>Quite an adventure.</i>

681
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,281
<i>See... You... At... Home.</i>

682
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:09,859
<i>It is said,</i>

683
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:11,909
"an inventor is a person who makes

684
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:14,560
an ingenious arrangement of wheels,

685
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,610
levers and springs,

686
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:19,111
and believes it civilization."

687
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:21,922
One student's invention

688
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,956
may have indeed saved civilization,

689
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:26,692
or at least Eureka.

690
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:29,027
Tesla school's science fair

691
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,933
has named this year's first prize

692
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,593
and a one-year internship

693
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,029
at Global Dynamics,

694
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,489
You were robbed.

695
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,644
Yeah. An internship?
Please. Totally dodged that bullet.

696
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,092
It is also said

697
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,239
that the path to civilization
is paved not

698
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:56,627
with individuals

699
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:59,140
but with partnerships.

700
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:00,958
Second place goes to...

701
00:37:03,544 --> 00:37:05,399
And her prize is a new car.

702
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,084
A new car?

703
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,170
Hey, Henry.

704
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,136
The debris is burning up
in the atmosphere.

705
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:26,470
Still pretty, though.

706
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:28,400
Got any wishes?

707
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:30,409
One.

708
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,433
Nathan, I know you blame yourself
for what happened to Kim.

709
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,155
Don't. It wasn't your fault.

710
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:44,412
Wish I could be certain of that.

711
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:46,571
I am.

712
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:50,371
Dr. Finn?

713
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,320
There she is, the girl of the hour.

714
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,302
Congratulations.

715
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:57,928
Thanks.

716
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:00,143
They told me
I get to choose what project

717
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:02,171
I want to work on for the internship.

718
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:04,877
It's a big move.

719
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,601
Be sure you pick something

720
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:09,846
you're passionate about.

721
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:10,966
And good people.

722
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,433
People you can trust.

723
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,908
That's why I was...

724
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,264
thinking I might like to work with you,

725
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:19,918
if that's okay.

726
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:22,952
Yeah, it would be an honor.

727
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,039
But if you steal any of my ideas,
I will bury you.

728
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,265
I'm kidding.

729
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,233
Just kidding.

730
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:39,456
Saying good-bye?

731
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:43,242
Time to let them find
their own way in the world.

732
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:48,568
Well, it's gotta be easier without
a giant magnet pulling them off course.

733
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,593
At least it wasn't your fault.

734
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:52,330
Actually, it was.

735
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,518
I was wondering why none
of biological birds around town

736
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,275
had the same navigational problems.

737
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,025
Turns out, when I built my babies,

738
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:03,881
I made their compasses too sensitive.

739
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:06,888
I wanted to be sure
they'd never get lost.

740
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:09,211
At least your heart
was in the right place.

741
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:11,357
Should have trusted them more.

742
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,391
They're gonna get lost for sure.

743
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:17,098
Lose their bearings for a bit.

744
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,529
But that's how they'll learn.

745
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:22,438
Yeah.

746
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:27,328
It's a little bit depressing, though.

747
00:39:36,646 --> 00:39:38,491
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

748
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,766
You're not going to let me
keep the car, are you?

749
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:53,130
Yeah, you can keep it.

750
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,862
I just wanted to make
sure you were ready.

751
00:39:57,488 --> 00:39:58,501
I am,

752
00:39:58,788 --> 00:40:00,207
- really.
- I know you are.

753
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,121
I'm not sure if I am.

754
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:05,370
Did you see Taggart's geese?

755
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:09,605
Apparently dads aren't
very well-equipped for this

756
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,450
child-rearing thing.

757
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,115
Oh, I don't know.

758
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:15,796
You do all right.

759
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:22,575
I looked up 111, and...

760
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:25,323
average.

761
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:28,603
Exactly average.

762
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:30,992
Guess I'm not as smart
as I thought I was.

763
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:33,657
Hey, we're Carters. We're street smart.

764
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:36,910
Who cares anyway? Honestly,

765
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,219
I wish I'd never
even taken the stupid test.

766
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:40,695
Really?

767
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:44,894
'Cause I got your results
from principal Wallace tonight,

768
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,100
and... I thought
you might want to open them.

769
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,096
But... Just...

770
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,910
I love you, whatever your IQ is.

771
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,008
112.

772
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,335
That's great!
You did your dad one better!
