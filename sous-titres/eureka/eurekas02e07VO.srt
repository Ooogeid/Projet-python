<i>Global Dynamics Cryogenics lab.</i>

00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>Access granted.</i>

3
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:14,899
Guys,

4
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:16,266
how much longer?

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:18,648
There are people trying to sleep.

6
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,085
Only 2 more to go.

7
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,048
These probably date back to the '50s.
Don't make 'em like this anymore.

8
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,906
Which is why we're replacing them.

9
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,509
It's an out-of-date design.

10
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,011
Just like your haircut.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,056
What is that?

12
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,850
I don't know.

13
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,186
I thought this one was empty.

14
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,762
It's supposed to be.

15
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:47,214
No way.

16
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,084
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Hand it over.

17
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,903
Come on, come on, come on.

18
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:58,289
Double shot vin-spresso.

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,373
Do not tell him.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,167
Not if he tortured me.

21
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,054
Nice try.

22
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:06,547
Dad, come on.

23
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,699
No, a dozen.

24
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:10,465
Long. Long-stemmed.

25
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:12,386
Okay, thanks.

26
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,842
- Who are the flowers for?
- None of your business. This...

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,601
Is Vincent's coffee.

28
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,603
Vincent knows not to supply...

29
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:22,925
You.

30
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,566
You have a middleman.

31
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:35,868
You'll never break me.

32
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:48,756
"Sassy pumps for fall."

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,076
I'm so ashamed.

34
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,138
Dealing to minors.

35
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,890
Coffee's not a drug, Dad.

36
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,846
Then, you can quit whenever you want,
no driving lessons until you do.

37
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:01,981
- But...
- Ah.

38
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,270
No buts.

39
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,965
I love you too much to watch you...

40
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:07,837
do this to yourself.

41
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,490
Sure. It's Allison.

42
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,161
Jack Carter.

43
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,662
Oh, hey. It's me.

44
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:21,829
Yeah.

45
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay... Well, we have a bit of

46
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:26,869
<i>an unusual situation up here.</i>

47
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,004
Oh, at Global Dynamics? Imagine.

48
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:32,122
Well, this one's unprecedented,
even for us.

49
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,633
<i>What do you want me to do...</i>

50
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:35,177
Evacuate the town?

51
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,426
Okay, I get it. You're still mad at me.
How long are you gonna punish

52
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:39,552
<i>me for this?</i>

53
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,352
I'm just trying to do my job.
I'll be there shortly.

54
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,066
What was that about?

55
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:51,715
Nothing... Gotta go.

56
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,236
We'll talk consequences later.

57
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,615
- Can't wait.
- Can't wait.

58
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,194
He broke me like a stick.

59
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,389
Which will make revenge
that much sweeter.

60
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,822
He left his cell phone.

61
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,184
What are you gonna do?

62
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:08,505
I don't know...
Getting as much coffee and

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,628
driving lessons as I want.

64
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:16,384
Hi, yes. I'm calling for my boss,
Jack Carter.

65
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,134
I believe he just ordered flowers.

66
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,347
Right, well, I just needed to verify
the spelling of the name?

67
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:23,698
Okay. Yeah, that's...

68
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,002
That's right. Thank you.

69
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:31,460
Who the hell is Angela Fairfield?

70
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,236
<i>Okay, Carter. Can we talk about this?</i>

71
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:39,748
I don't...

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,985
I don't know what to say.

73
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,939
I mean, you withheld information

74
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:49,099
that Stark's device could be
causing the shared dreaming.

75
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,710
I apologized for that.

76
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,004
Allison, I'm just gonna
be mad for a while.

77
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:55,675
Okay?

78
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,114
Okay.

79
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,948
So, what's the emergency?

80
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,410
We're updating the equipment
in cryogenics.

81
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:08,512
Thank god.

82
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:11,729
A number of people have elected
to go into cryostasis over the years,

83
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,441
going back to the 1950s.

84
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:14,707
Cryostasis?

85
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:16,032
Cold stored?

86
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:17,733
To be revived at a later date,

87
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,293
ideally after we found the cure

88
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,160
for whatever disease
they were dying from.

89
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:24,127
Creepy, yes. But I don't think
that falls under my jurisdiction.

90
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,640
Well, we discovered a person
in an unmarked chamber,

91
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,164
a very old chamber.

92
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,888
Okay, so GD put some food
in the freezer without labeling it,

93
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,154
now it's mystery meat.
Seems like an internal problem.

94
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,157
There's a little more
to it than that, Carter.

95
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:37,862
Like, the fact that this one
has a heartbeat.

96
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,072
What's he doing here?

97
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:49,059
Nathan's early research
was in cryogenics.

98
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,218
- Of course it was.
- How's it going?

99
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:52,954
We are monitoring the defrost rate.

100
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,777
Opening the chambers too quickly
could destabilize his tissues.

101
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,021
I can't believe this is happening
in my lifetime...

102
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,395
- Right here, right now.
- Fargo, don't hurt yourself.

103
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:01,572
No, you don't understand.

104
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:03,007
This is history in the making.

105
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,325
The first person ever
to come out of cryostasis alive.

106
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,452
His pulse is dropping.

107
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,078
We gotta get him out of there.

108
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,249
I need all medical personnel
standing by.

109
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,087
- Ready to make history?
- Hit it.

110
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:24,481
- Why is he standing backwards?
- why is he fully clothed?

111
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:28,682
His pulse is slow, but stable.
His vital signs look strong.

112
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,434
Okay, get him out of there.

113
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:33,684
Gently.

114
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,209
Ready?

115
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,338
Lift him up.

116
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,609
We need to get him up to the infirmary.

117
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,112
Hold on.

118
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:46,575
Pierre Fargo.

119
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,970
Grampa?

Family Reunion (v. 1.0)

126
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:36,875
All my life, I thought he ran out

127
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,315
on my grandma,
and he's been right here all along.

128
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,671
Of all the people
to bring out of cryostasis,

129
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,562
I resurrect another Fargo.

130
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,392
Karma's a bitch.

131
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:47,989
Is anyone curious

132
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:50,138
as to how
he got in there?

133
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,306
He's a Fargo.

134
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:52,682
Are you really surprised?

135
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,017
I am standing right here.

136
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,283
He just twitched.

137
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:56,853
I think he
might've heard you.

138
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:57,984
Belle...

139
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,383
I'm Allison Blake.

140
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,400
Do you know
your name?

141
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:03,767
Everyone knows my name.

142
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,902
I'm Pierre Fargo.

143
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,070
The Pierre Fargo.

144
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,573
Do you know the date, Pierre?

145
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:11,580
I prefer Dr. Fargo,
thank you.

146
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,203
And yes,
it's august 30th, 1957.

147
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,716
Did I hit my head or something?

148
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,338
You're at
Global Dynamics.

149
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,478
You've...

150
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,002
been asleep for a while.

151
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,671
Does anyone
know the time? Because

152
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:26,523
my girl Belle and I have
dinner plans, and I can't be late.

153
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,262
I don't know how to say this...

154
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:30,138
You're already late.

155
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,304
Like 50 years late.

156
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,473
- Excuse me?
- Pierre...

157
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,225
You just woke up from cryostasis.

158
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:38,436
Sure I did.

159
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,749
I know this may be
difficult to process...

160
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:44,122
But you've been
in cryostasis since 1957.

161
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,214
The year is 2007.

162
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,717
No way you're convincing me

163
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,374
that I just woke up
50 years in the future.

164
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:53,284
Put your glasses on.

165
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,030
Okay.

166
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,271
That's better.

167
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,420
Do I know you?

168
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,090
I'm Douglas Fargo.

169
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:21,814
I'm your grandson.

170
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:29,444
Imagine waking up and
everything you know is gone.

171
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,581
Nathan's gonna keep him
under observation

172
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,282
until we're sure that he's stabilized.

173
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,334
Cryogenics to babysitting?

174
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,502
- Sheriff Carter?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,770
How you doing?

176
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,330
Um, better than my granddad.

177
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,499
Listen, I know Fargos have

178
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,127
a reputation for being
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

179
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:47,496
but if he says
he doesn't know how he got

180
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,673
into that chamber, I believe him.

181
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,680
Maybe somebody put him in there.

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,469
The same way somebody put you
into the force field bubble?

183
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,129
Okay, fair point.

184
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:57,931
But we're not talking about me.

185
00:08:58,678 --> 00:08:59,669
Fargos may be cursed,

186
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,077
but we're honest.

187
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:03,202
Will you please just look into it?

188
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,022
I'll personally put someone
on that right away.

189
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,693
I'm sorry, is... Is my working

190
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,094
disturbing your reading?

191
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,792
No.

192
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,333
So does Allison know?

193
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,669
About?

194
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,957
The woman you're sending flowers to.

195
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:25,347
It's none of Allison's business,

196
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,710
nor do I think she would care.

197
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,543
Did something happen with you two?

198
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:32,975
- Could we talk about something else?
- Like what?

199
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,217
Like what...

200
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,344
Pumps are gonna be in fashion this fall?

201
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,305
I'm just asking, 'cause
I wanna know what belts to buy.

202
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:42,022
Funny.

203
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:48,231
Pierre was working with Andre Sandrov.

204
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,067
- Who is...?
- Who is

205
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:54,070
- Eureka's Albert Einstein?
- I would have thought

206
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:56,828
Albert Einstein would have been
Eureka's Albert Einstein.

207
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:58,041
Yeah, but

208
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:01,040
point is, Sandrov's revered.
By everyone.

209
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,305
And he gave a statement
that Pierre went awol

210
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,920
in 1957

211
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,506
after giving written notice at work.

212
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:10,884
Which Pierre didn't mention.

213
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,443
The cold war's over,
the Soviet Union is gone,

214
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:17,043
the Red Sox won the World Series.

215
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,090
Don't understand why that was important,
but everybody tell me it is.

216
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:22,045
I just don't really get baseba...

217
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:23,634
Grampa, are you listening?

218
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,134
Hey, look...

219
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,566
I'm having a hard time
processing all of this, okay?

220
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,839
And you seem like a really nice guy.

221
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:35,097
And I admit that there's
a slight resemblance. But, you know...

222
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,175
This is insane. I'm Pierre Fargo.

223
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,941
I'm nobody's grampa.

224
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,224
Okay? I'm not even a father.

225
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,096
I'm pretty sure you were.

226
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,510
Look, we're practically the same age.

227
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,301
Well, yeah, pretty much.

228
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:52,753
Okay, great. So in light of that,
let's just drop "grampa"

229
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,391
and stick with "Dr. Fargo." Okay?

230
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,223
Nice meeting you.

231
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,491
Wait!

232
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:02,096
Wait, wait!

233
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,652
Belle St. John is my grandmother.

234
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,615
- So Belle is still alive?
- Very much so.

235
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:09,818
Well, that's wonderful news.

236
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,148
I have to see her.

237
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,530
- How do you get out of here?
- Not by going that way.

238
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,053
You can't see her. She's in Alaska.

239
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:17,365
Which, is a state now.
It's very big with tourists.

240
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,294
- What's she doing there?
- No, not that way.

241
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,114
She's dogsledding.
She'll be back on the weekend.

242
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,419
- My Belle always had a wild side.
- She also had a son.

243
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,836
My dad, Thomas.

244
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,588
He died in a lab accident
when I was a little kid.

245
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,340
Pushed the wrong button.

246
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:33,967
I'm sorry to hear that.

247
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,800
So I suppose
she must've gotten married, then,

248
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,472
- If she had a son.
- No.

249
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:42,556
She always said she was
holding out for her dream man.

250
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,219
Really?

251
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:47,028
I brought a picture of her.

252
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,969
Might look a little bit different
than she did when she was 20.

253
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,587
She's still beautiful.

254
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:00,375
I've missed so much.

255
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,122
But I'm not missing any more.

256
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,958
<i>1957</i>

257
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,501
brand new Ford Thunderbirds

258
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,461
cost 3,000 bucks.

259
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,131
Speaking of cars,
I'd like to start driving mine.

260
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,716
Not 'till you dry out.

261
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:17,385
- I haven't had caffeine all day.
- I said a week.

262
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,019
A week.

263
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,804
Wanna play hardball?

264
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,976
Who's Angela Fairfield?

265
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,309
You hit redial on my cell phone?

266
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,492
Cop's daughter. You pick things up.

267
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,236
Well, normally I'd be proud, but

268
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,098
Zoe, don't go digging into this.

269
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,273
If you would tell me who she is,
I wouldn't have to.

270
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,867
- Someone from my past.
- Okay. Then why are you...

271
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,995
- Why are you sending flowers today?
- We're not discussing this.

272
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,748
I think I just found out why Pierre

273
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,832
would want to put himself on ice.

274
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,498
Birth certificate for a...

275
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,148
Thomas Stephen Fargo,

276
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,381
son of Belle St. John.

277
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,553
Born eight months after
Pierre Fargo disappeared.

278
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:02,547
Maybe he found out about the pregnancy,

279
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,224
panicked, and took
a cryo-trip to the future.

280
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:08,102
I don't know,
that seems a little extreme.

281
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,021
Oh, it says here
fatherhood can scare men

282
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,397
into disassociation,

283
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,239
which can lower their sex drive.

284
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,723
You...

285
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,070
- burn this.
- Where are you going?

286
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,217
To talk to Pierre.
See if he had some fatherhood issues.

287
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,115
I know I do.

288
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,975
This place is a maze.

289
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,453
Just last week, the frame
for this building was going up,

290
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:28,767
and now look at it.

291
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,014
Say, did we ever get to the moon?

292
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,238
Yeah, in '62.

293
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,791
Way to go, guys!

294
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,493
Top secret, of course.
We didn't go public until '69.

295
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,303
- What's that?
- It's a computer.

296
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,658
So is this.

297
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:49,427
- It's so small!
- Microchips.

298
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:52,216
That PDA...
A personal digital assistant...

299
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,524
can store the entire library of congress

300
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:56,165
and track a satellite in orbit.

301
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,168
Terrific.

302
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,247
- Dear lord.
- The robotics lab.

303
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,912
If you think that's impressive,
you should see the big one.

304
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,954
Holy smokes.

305
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,878
Tissue rejuvenation research.

306
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,338
It's not really my cup of tea,
there's some computer...

307
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,513
Hold on a second.

308
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,943
That's my cellular
reconstruction technique.

309
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,179
They're using my methodology.

310
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,398
No, that process

311
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,479
is based on the research
of Andre Sandrov.

312
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:38,513
Sandrov?

313
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:41,552
No, he...

314
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,315
he was a lab tech.

315
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,211
Sandrov was the forefather

316
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,606
of modern bioengineering and cryogenics.

317
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,121
He's a Global Dynamics treasure.

318
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,866
See?

319
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,336
No, this can't be. I'm the treasure.

320
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,045
No, trust me. Nobody treasures Fargos.

321
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,282
They treasure people
who win Nobel prizes.

322
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:04,323
Like Sandrov.

323
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,840
Sandrov won the Nobel? What for?

324
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,058
The dedifferentiation
of mesenchymal cells.

325
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,544
No! That was my idea.

326
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,562
That idea got him
a statue in the park and

327
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,890
a multimillion dollar foundation
named after him.

328
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,812
I can't believe this.

329
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:24,502
Sandrov stole my research.

330
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,564
He stole my life.

331
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:32,824
Sandrov wasn't a genius.

332
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:35,423
- He was a thief.
- A thief?

333
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:38,169
A thief who's given millions of dollars
back to this town?

334
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:39,719
Yes, millions of my dollars,

335
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,164
based on my ideas.

336
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,539
Now, he shoved me into that chamber.

337
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,704
A cryochamber which I designed,
by the way.

338
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,804
How do you like that for irony?

339
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,838
Just so he could steal my work
and pass it off as his own.

340
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,934
We found Sandrov's police statement.

341
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,777
In that statement, he said
that you left a letter of resignation

342
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,157
before you disappeared.

343
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:58,848
Now why would I resign?

344
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,351
I was on the verge of greatness.

345
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,662
Which he has now taken from me.

346
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:05,430
He is a liar.

347
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,615
Work was great. Belle was...

348
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:08,879
Pregnant.

349
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,459
Belle was pregnant.

350
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:13,863
Careful, slim.

351
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:16,165
I respect that
you're an officer of the law,

352
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,163
but you're insulting the good name
of my girl, I will not stand for it.

353
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,169
Come on.

354
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,938
Nobody's insulting anybody.

355
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,547
Belle St. John gave birth
to Thomas Stephen Fargo

356
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,139
eight months after you left.

357
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,396
Fatherhood is a big

358
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,065
responsibility, and you wouldn't be
the first guy to run from it.

359
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:43,491
Run from it?

360
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,318
I was going to propose to Belle.

361
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:47,579
I...

362
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,741
Here, look.

363
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,156
I was on my way to pick up the ring
before our dinner.

364
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,414
Believe me, fatherhood is the

365
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,137
last thing that I would run from.

366
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:03,120
Not sure how I'm supposed to feel.

367
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:06,009
I just lost a son
that i never knew I had.

368
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,801
You still have me.

369
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,472
Not sure how I'm supposed
to feel about that.

370
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,265
Andre Sandrov

371
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,976
took away my family
and ruined my good name.

372
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,769
And now he has to pay.

373
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,771
And I will set the record straight.

374
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:24,484
You honestly believe that Andre Sandrov
stole Pierre Fargo's research?

375
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,148
Well, I don't know, which is why
I'm gonna ask him.

376
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,494
Of all the ridiculous claims,
and by a Fargo.

377
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,699
- You're saying it's not even possible?
- No.

378
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:32,950
Well, yes.

379
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,661
Scientists are always bickering
over credit for breakthroughs.

380
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,371
Or denying responsibility for them.

381
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,184
- Are you still on that?
- Can we please stay focused on this?

382
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:42,117
Look, Sandrov was a visionary.

383
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,337
His work is well-documented.

384
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:48,913
Read any of his voluminous biographies.
Or get a book on tape.

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,205
Just do the tox screen
on Pierre's blood.

386
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:54,847
- I'm gonna go talk to your visionary.
- Please. I need you to keep in mind

387
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,683
that the Sandrov foundation
is funding our stem cell research.

388
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,575
So you want me to go easy on him

389
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,269
because he gives you money?

390
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:02,568
No.

391
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,357
But he is a very well-respected man with

392
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,201
a lot of friends at the DOD.

393
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,195
So for your own sake, tread lightly.

394
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:12,340
I believe that when someone
is responsible for something,

395
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,748
that they should be held accountable.

396
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,156
If you could wait on the lower terrace,

397
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,738
Dr. Sandrov will join you momentarily.

398
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:31,090
Thank you.

399
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,810
Nice place.

400
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,739
This is what a Nobel prize buys you.

401
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,387
So...

402
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,178
Where did you and Angela Fairfield meet?

403
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,789
Let it go.

404
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:48,559
Can I help you?

405
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,817
I'm Sheriff Jack Carter.

406
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,480
This is my deputy, Jo Lupo.

407
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,206
Is there something wrong?

408
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:58,276
Depends on how you look at it.
Not sure if you've heard,

409
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:01,738
Global Dynamics revived someone
from cryostasis today.

410
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:02,832
Really?

411
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,658
He's apparently been in there
for about 50 years.

412
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:08,425
Well, that is tremendous.

413
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,169
I knew that design
would prove itself out.

414
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,051
I just didn't know
if it would be within my lifetime.

415
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,596
The man they woke up is Pierre Fargo.

416
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,725
He claims that you stole
his research, including the

417
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:22,101
cryochamber. Do you rememsber him?

418
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,792
Yes, of course.

419
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:25,541
He used to work for me.

420
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,717
And how in the world
did he end up in cryostasis?

421
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,651
That's what we're trying to figure out.

422
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,324
Pierre seemed to make it sound
like you worked for him.

423
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,886
Well,  I'm not surprised.
Pierre's reach often exceed his grasp.

424
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,702
He tried to pass off my work as his own.

425
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:43,548
I offered to let him resign
rather than fire him.

426
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,637
Then he disappeared.

427
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,752
Shame, really. He was quite talented.

428
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,569
Some people just seem
destined for failure.

429
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,299
Is there any truth
to Pierre Fargo's claims?

430
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,544
I'd like to think the body
of my work speaks for itself.

431
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:01,849
But I look forward to hearing
how he recovers. Wish him well for me.

432
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,210
Thank you.

433
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:04,731
Now, I'm...

434
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:07,088
hosting a cocktail fundraiser
this evening

435
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,722
that I need to prepare for,

436
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:10,890
so, unless there's anything else...

437
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,933
Not at the moment.
Thank you for your time.

438
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:14,476
Not at all.

439
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:20,255
Charming guy.

440
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:24,176
If this breakthrough is based on
Sandrov's work, he should've been dying

441
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,706
- to see the result.
- And he was.

442
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,958
Until he found out it was Pierre.

443
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:29,632
Yeah.

444
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,099
So what now?

445
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:32,788
I think Sandrov is a smart guy.

446
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:35,497
We take his suggestion,
go check out his body of work.

447
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,903
<i>This town is amazing.</i>

448
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,713
The transformation is just incredible.

449
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,796
All along here were quonset huts.

450
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,048
And a... And a dirt road,
if you can believe it.

451
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,905
I mean, there were only 100 of us.

452
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,822
It was more military base than town.

453
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:58,654
Yeah, they didn't bring in the city
planners and architects until the '60s.

454
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,791
No, no, it's okay.

455
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,962
It's just a car alarm. It's anti-theft.

456
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,896
Well, we used to leave our keys
in the ignition.

457
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,828
I guess times have changed.

458
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:11,854
Well, it's really nice
having you back, grampa.

459
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:14,984
I tell you what.

460
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:16,442
You can call me Pierre.

461
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,599
Oh, sorry. I'm... I'm just excited.

462
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:21,822
I've never really had
a grandfather. Or a father. Or...

463
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,177
Friends.

464
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:27,772
Well, I guess if you don't
use it in public, it's okay.

465
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,299
Deal. So, where are we going?

466
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:32,008
To see an old friend.

467
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:34,472
We have the results
of Pierre's tox screen.

468
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:36,487
So is our boy a deadbeat dad,

469
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:39,227
or... did somebody
throw him in the freezer?

470
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:42,401
Well, there are traces
of chloroform in his system.

471
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,000
Traces?

472
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,288
Fine. There's enough there
to sink him like a rock.

473
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,832
So Pierre told the truth.
Somebody was out to get him.

474
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,668
Well, if you're looking
for more praise from me...

475
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,549
What I'm looking at
is the praise for Andre Sandrov.

476
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,829
- I'm wondering if it's deserved.
<i>- Deserved?</i>

477
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,801
Sandrov was one of the greatest thinkers
of his time.

478
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,208
<i>Of any time.</i>

479
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,680
Yeah, but he was just a mid-level
researcher until his big

480
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:07,224
<i>- breakthrough in cell regeneration.</i>
- So?

481
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:10,615
So that didn't happen until a month
after Pierre disappeared.

482
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,572
Charlie, you old dog.

483
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:28,996
In the flesh.

484
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,830
You haven't aged a day.
Where've you been?

485
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,797
Well, you remember
my little cryostasis project?

486
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,919
Let's say it worked.

487
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,409
And here I am.

488
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,607
I have something for you.

489
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,475
How about that?

490
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,631
That's from 1957!

491
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,568
Looks just like new, doesn't it?

492
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:49,589
So do you still have that diamond
you were growing for Belle's ring?

493
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,758
I'm sorry, Pierre.

494
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,594
I sold it a couple of years
after you left.

495
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:57,179
Or we thought you'd left.

496
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,079
Well, it was a long shot.

497
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,247
I was hoping
I could still give it to her.

498
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,740
I don't know, you might wanna think

499
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,326
about that. I mean,

500
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,357
a lot's happened since you disappeared.

501
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,277
And people really believed
that I would just leave her like that?

502
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,584
Even you?

503
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:15,406
I came by with the diamond,
and... And you'd gone.

504
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,669
So Belle has lived this entire time
believing that I...

505
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:20,828
ran off on her?

506
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,663
She did fine, Pierre.

507
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,670
I mean, she's a strong one.

508
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,676
But seeing her now...

509
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:30,192
Might not go the way you planned.

510
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,966
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

511
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:35,815
Thanks, Charlie.

512
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:37,759
Take care.

513
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,247
Let's go.

514
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,066
Go where?

515
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,252
To clear my name.
We have to find that letter.

516
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:50,093
- We?
- Of course.

517
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,022
Well, it's your name too.

518
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,708
Let's go.

519
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,822
<i>SARAH, I need to look up a name.</i>

520
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,783
<i>Of course. Who?</i>

521
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,290
Dad's new girlfriend, Angela Fairfield.

522
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,496
<i>I don't feel comfortable prying into
the sheriff's personal life.</i>

523
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,058
Oh, no, no. I'm not prying.

524
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,480
I just want to know...

525
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:10,410
who she is, and where she lives,
and what she looks like.

526
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,587
<i>Sorry, out of the question.</i>

527
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,094
Okay. Fair.

528
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,426
But you know, it would be a shame

529
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:21,183
for everyone to find out
about your addiction to Jerry Springer.

530
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,909
<i>I have no idea who that is.</i>

531
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:34,871
You're not fooling anyone.

532
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,656
<i>There's no Angela Fairfield
living in Eureka.</i>

533
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,739
Can you try widening the search?

534
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:41,432
<i>None in Oregon.</i>

535
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,834
Okay, try other places my dad has lived.

536
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:47,474
<i>Over the last 25 years,
there have been four in Laguna Beach.</i>

537
00:24:47,897 --> 00:24:50,322
Show me their pictures.
I... I know his type.

538
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,169
Okay, the one with the big hair.
Who is she?

539
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:56,904
There's a juvenile police record
associated with her name.

540
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,217
<i>- But it's closed.</i>
- A record?

541
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:00,944
A record for who?

542
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,223
<i>Your father.</i>

543
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,734
It could take forever
to find my letter in all these files.

544
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,696
Restricted files.
We shouldn't be in here.

545
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,948
- Then hurry.
- I've changed my mind.

546
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,157
I don't think I can do this.

547
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,590
Well, you have to.

548
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:27,078
What if we get caught?
What's the worst that could happen?

549
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:29,372
I'd lose my job and you'd go to jail.

550
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:31,784
I've seen the way
people treat you around here.

551
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:33,459
Getting fired could be a blessing.

552
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:35,705
True.

553
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,189
Come on.

554
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,377
Let's get at it.

555
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:48,099
- Please, open it.
- I found it.

556
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:50,351
Super. Now let's get that letter
and get out of here.

557
00:25:58,663 --> 00:25:59,960
Okay. Yes.

558
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,398
- There we go.
- Here it is.

559
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,323
August 30th, 1957.

560
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,183
"For personal reasons beyond my control,

561
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,941
"I hereby tender my resignation,

562
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,246
"effective immediately.
Sincerely, Pierre Fargo."

563
00:26:11,682 --> 00:26:12,957
Is that your signature?

564
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,305
Well, yes, but I never wrote this.

565
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:18,045
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:20,256
You set alarms off
all over the building.

567
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,469
Don't punish him. This was my idea.

568
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:27,388
And that would be what, exactly?

569
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:28,667
Sandrov set me up.

570
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:30,724
And I need this resignation letter
to prove it.

571
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,311
Okay. Can I see it?

572
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,607
I know this looks bad.

573
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:42,319
Yeah, well, it's about
to look a lot worse.

574
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,800
It is astonishing his tissue
could have survived

575
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:51,328
all these years

576
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,539
without any signs of degeneration.

577
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:57,668
It's good to see you
back to real science.

578
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:01,925
Feels good.

579
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:04,633
Nothing like exploring the unknown.

580
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,106
Nothing like it.

581
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:09,918
The other day, you said that...

582
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,428
you knew for sure

583
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:13,725
that the accident was not my fault.

584
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:15,382
- How do you know?
- I...

585
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:17,688
found something in Kim's lab. Her...

586
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:19,815
computers were sabotaged.

587
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:21,858
- By whom?
- I don't know.

588
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:23,986
But clearly, you and Kim
were on the verge

589
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,212
of understanding something that...

590
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:28,698
Someone was trying to protect.

591
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,198
Pierre's blood analysis.

592
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:38,933
Have you ever seen anything like that?

593
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,085
Never.

594
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:46,716
The bad news is, we have you
on a class III security breach.

595
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:50,400
The good news is that the mattress
is surprisingly supportive.

596
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,319
If he's staying, I'm staying with him.

597
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,151
- That's fine with me.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

598
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,293
There's one just in there.

599
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,005
Can't he use your bathroom, Sheriff?

600
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,524
The window doesn't even open.

601
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:04,757
All right. But...

602
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:06,778
Just be quick about it.

603
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,044
- Swell.
- Mr. Fairfield.

604
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:10,212
Excuse me for a second.

605
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,075
I need to take this. All right.

606
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:13,487
I'm watching.

607
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,778
I mean, I'm not watching,
but I'm watching.

608
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,274
Sorry about that.

609
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,804
No, no... No need to thank...

610
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:25,804
I know.

611
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,400
Yeah, me too.

612
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,533
<i>So what have you got
on Angela Fairfield?</i>

613
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:33,471
<i>I found some photo documentation.</i>

614
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,492
What are these from?

615
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,183
<i>Angela's high school yearbook.</i>

616
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,531
Wait, wait. Stop there.

617
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,230
No way... That's dad.

618
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:44,398
There's another one of them together.

619
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:48,110
So... She was
his high school sweetheart.

620
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:50,574
Why is he still sending her flowers?

621
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,367
Wait, wait. Hold it there.

622
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,367
Oh, my god.

623
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,087
She died.

624
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:02,741
Sorry about that.

625
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,977
He's been in there since you left.

626
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:11,509
Pierre? This is sheriff Carter.

627
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:13,440
<i>Go away, Sheriff.</i>

628
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,500
<i>There's nothing you can do for me now.</i>

629
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:17,444
What sort of trouble are you having?

630
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,665
<i>Not the kind you'd understand, Sheriff.</i>

631
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:21,575
I could kick the door down.

632
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:24,489
We'll call that plan "B."

633
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:27,656
Look...

634
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,444
I know this has to be a shock.

635
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,725
Things must look pretty bleak.

636
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,156
You're scared.

637
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,853
We've all been there.

638
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:38,452
Not exactly there. But my point is,

639
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,795
you don't have to go through this alone.

640
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:44,062
You have family out here.

641
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,471
Or there's plan "B."

642
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,711
That's happening too fast.

643
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:12,456
The stase is temporary altering
the aging process,

644
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,397
but as soon as he got out...

645
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,684
- It's making up for lost time.
- Exactly.

646
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,532
The problem is that
the accelerated aging

647
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,518
is causing advanced cell degeneration.

648
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,836
There is no indication
that that is slowing down.

649
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:24,748
I just got him back. I'm gonna lose him?

650
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:27,459
Fargo, we are doing everything we can.

651
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:28,835
It's uncharted territory.

652
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,045
Of course it is.

653
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:31,880
- Fargo...
- No, he's not just

654
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,084
some screwup.

655
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,883
He had his whole life stolen from him.

656
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,718
His work, his reputation,

657
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,017
his family.

658
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,555
He doesn't deserve this.

659
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,143
Don't treat him
like just another lab rat.

660
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:49,238
I'm gonna go see my grampa.

661
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,321
- Hey. How you doing?
- Well,

662
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:59,324
I'm just hours away from bedpans
and sponge baths.

663
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:01,493
Can't wait.

664
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,828
Don't say that.
They'll figure something out.

665
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,559
I appreciate you being here, Charlie.

666
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,959
Just wanted to see you
with a few wrinkles.

667
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,670
Couldn't stand that baby face of yours.

668
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:16,216
Hey, listen.

669
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:18,343
If I go without

670
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,567
seeing Belle,

671
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:23,653
would you do me a favor and
tell her that I came back to her?

672
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,642
And I never stopped loving her?

673
00:31:26,236 --> 00:31:28,853
- You'll tell her yourself.
- Would you do that for me, pal?

674
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,398
- I will.
- Thank you.

675
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:35,898
Hey, Charlie.

676
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,169
Pierre. Fargo.

677
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,113
Well, thanks for the books, Sheriff.

678
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:42,075
But I don't think I have
a lot of leisure time left.

679
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,153
Kinda busy trying
to save Fargo's granddad.

680
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,685
- What do you need?
- Yeah...

681
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:49,030
I checked out
a bunch of biographies of Sandrov's

682
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,042
that talk about
his groundbreaking research.

683
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:53,294
Generally what biographies do, yes.

684
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:55,838
But they were written about
breakthroughs that happened after

685
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,386
Pierre disappeared.

686
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,260
- So let's see what he knows.
- Carter, you're wasting time.

687
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,887
I don't have a lot of time left.

688
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,264
All I have is my name. And my legacy.

689
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:09,685
And I'd like a chance to set
the record straight before I go.

690
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:11,161
Exactly.

691
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,856
And since you're the Sandrov expert,
and you have access to all

692
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,609
the classified information,
I think it should be you who asks him

693
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:18,542
the questions only
real talent would know.

694
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,706
Fine.

695
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:24,446
What did you first use
to encourage cell regeneration?

696
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,158
Well, you need raw materials,

697
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,396
so we started with hepatocyte

698
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,289
and osteoblast stimulants.

699
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:33,553
Were you successful?

700
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,586
Not exactly.

701
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,504
Uh, the first...

702
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,935
Successful cell regeneration occurred

703
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,593
on my 482nd try.

704
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,141
I take it from your silence
that's another right answer.

705
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:51,769
When were you first able
to isolate and identify

706
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:54,015
signals responsible for cell growth?

707
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,564
Actually, I wasn't.

708
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,481
It was my hypothesis
that the expression of...

709
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,818
small molecules

710
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,861
known as micro RNAS

711
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,614
act as molecular regulators

712
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,240
and thereby control

713
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,521
the growth of isolates. But...

714
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,828
It was a long shot.

715
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,613
A theory that proved to be true.

716
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:16,460
Five years after Pierre disappeared.

717
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:17,918
So he's right.

718
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:21,965
Pierre, your research

719
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,967
changed our understanding

720
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,302
of the human cell.

721
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,089
It was Pierre's work all along.

722
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,934
Anybody want to crash a party?

723
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:35,020
Me.

724
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,983
I just finished lecturing in Vienna,
so I could return to do the galleys

725
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,555
for my new book in october.

726
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:44,321
And what would the title
of that book be, Andre?

727
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,780
My life as a fraud?

728
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:48,332
Pierre.

729
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,430
Why don't we go into the parlor?

730
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:52,649
No, thank you.

731
00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:54,497
You've kept me hidden long enough.

732
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,358
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- You be careful.

733
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,712
I'm a dying man
with nothing left to lose.

734
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:04,215
- And it's all because of you.
- Dr. Sandrov, you had plenty of

735
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,343
opportunity and everything to gain.

736
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:10,221
You think I put him in the cryochamber?

737
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:12,849
No.

738
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,559
I have gains of my own.

739
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:16,713
This town wouldn't be here without me.

740
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:17,937
Tell 'em, Dr. Stark.

741
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:19,689
I wish I could.

742
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,150
We know that
your breakthroughs were based

743
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,491
upon Pierre's work,
which you passed off as your own.

744
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:26,077
It was unethical.

745
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,607
It was illegal.

746
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,909
But attempted murder
is a different matter altogether.

747
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:33,866
I attempted nothing of the kind.

748
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,582
I came into the lab that night,

749
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,238
and you weren't there.

750
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,288
Your letter of resignation

751
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,546
was on the table, and that was it.

752
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,048
I never wrote that letter.

753
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,233
And I find it hard to believe
you didn't notice

754
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,135
there was someone
in one of the chambers.

755
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:52,972
Nobody noticed. We were all
caught up in our own deadlines.

756
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,105
I was failing to meet mine.

757
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:56,267
So...

758
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,454
when you didn't come back...

759
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:03,424
Your work was there.
And it was brilliant.

760
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,381
I just picked up where you left off.

761
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,197
A sin of omission.

762
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,533
If you didn't put my grampa
in there, who did?

763
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:13,975
I don't know.

764
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:16,871
I am sorry, Pierre.

765
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:21,917
So what do we do now?

766
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,502
Only thing we can do.

767
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,881
A great scientist is dying
of rapid tissue degeneration.

768
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:30,062
You're gonna help me save him.

769
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,412
You really think this'll work?

770
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:40,572
The treatment is based
on your theory, Pierre.

771
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:42,786
I simply augmented and refined it.

772
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:46,400
Unfortunately,
it's not gonna make you any younger.

773
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,444
Grampa...

774
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:53,615
Okay.

775
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,869
Let me have it.

776
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:02,998
Okay.

777
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:06,875
Right.

778
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:08,687
Yeah, okay.

779
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:12,459
Well, those years are gone anyhow.

780
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,179
I just want to make the most
of the time I have left.

781
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:17,871
And we'll all make sure
you get credit where credit is due.

782
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,266
Won't we, Dr. Sandrov?

783
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:20,893
Of course.

784
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:23,606
Still working on figuring out
who put you in that chamber.

785
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,397
Well, it's your worry now, chief.

786
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:27,233
The truth's come out, and...

787
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,714
I just want to put things
right with Belle.

788
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:35,449
I wish I still had this ring
that I was going

789
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,676
to give her.

790
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,786
Could I see that order slip
for a second?

791
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,166
Thanks.

792
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:53,175
The signature on this resignation letter

793
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,970
is traced... from your order slip.

794
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:08,982
Hey, Sheriff.

795
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,731
I heard what happened.

796
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:11,868
You made it.

797
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:14,654
That's twice you've risen
from the dead in one week.

798
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,532
Why'd you put him in, Charlie?

799
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,913
I knew, soon as I saw you in my shop...

800
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,750
My sins had come back to haunt me.

801
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,820
You looked me in the eye

802
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,379
and you called me your friend.

803
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,799
I'm so sorry.

804
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,135
Why, Charlie? Why?

805
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,971
You were gonna propose to Belle.
And I've always loved her.

806
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,890
- You never said a word.
- When I showed up to deliver

807
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,475
the ring, well...

808
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,644
I couldn't let her go.
I thought if you were gone,

809
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:48,813
Belle would think you'd run out on her.

810
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,148
I could be her savior.

811
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:53,609
Well, like you say, the past always
catches up with you.

812
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,753
- We're gonna have to take you in.
- Sure.

813
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,243
Hold on a sec.

814
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,869
Putting Charlie in prison
isn't gonna give me my life back.

815
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:04,412
He was in love with Belle.

816
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:06,956
I understand how that feels.

817
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,834
Turning the other cheek
doesn't really apply here.

818
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:12,378
Well, he has to live alone
with what he's done.

819
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,214
I think that's punishment enough.

820
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,091
And that's not for you to decide.

821
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:19,510
Sheriff's right.

822
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,928
For what it's worth...

823
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:30,185
She never got over you.

824
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:49,537
Hey, Dad.

825
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,055
Hey. Let me guess.

826
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:52,543
You need a lift home.

827
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:55,292
Yeah, but, um, that's...

828
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:57,756
That's actually not why I came.

829
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,759
I wanted to apologize

830
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,722
for nagging you about Angela.

831
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,393
It's all right.

832
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,173
I found your yearbook.

833
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:13,701
And...

834
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:15,724
I know that she died.

835
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,443
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

836
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,729
What happened?

837
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,037
I was 17.

838
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,403
And I made a very,

839
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,207
very big mistake.

840
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,326
She was a...

841
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,450
Great girl.

842
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:38,836
She was...

843
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,383
Uh... fearless.

844
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:45,737
Reckless.

845
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,641
A little like you,

846
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:50,925
actually.

847
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:55,814
It was her 16th birthday.

848
00:39:57,816 --> 00:40:00,527
She wanted me to teach her how to drive.

849
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,313
She was doing great.

850
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,074
And...

851
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,552
We were celebrating.

852
00:40:07,576 --> 00:40:08,576
We...

853
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,130
Drifted

854
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,358
into the next lane.

855
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:18,487
And... swerved to...

856
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:20,914
get around a car.

857
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:23,156
I'm so sorry, Dad.

858
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:24,968
When the police arrived,

859
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,451
I was holding her.

860
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,542
They assumed...

861
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:30,538
I was driving.

862
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,853
And I was charged
with reckless endangerment.

863
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,813
Why didn't you just tell them
what happened?

864
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,940
It was my responsibility.
Doesn't matter.

865
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,251
So... Every year,

866
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:46,147
I send flowers

867
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:48,303
to the cemetery.

868
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,160
And every year,

869
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:54,163
her father calls to

870
00:40:54,283 --> 00:40:55,283
thank me.

871
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,548
I haven't talked about this in a long,

872
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,243
long time.

873
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:07,129
Well...

874
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,804
Thank you for... telling me.

875
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:23,466
I hope I don't disappoint her.

876
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:25,010
Oh, you won't.

877
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:28,933
A lot has happened.

878
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,499
I don't exactly know

879
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:35,535
what I'm going to say.

880
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,208
Well, I think when you...
Think when you'll see her, you'll know.

881
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:54,848
You look so beautiful.

882
00:41:55,297 --> 00:41:57,265
After all these years.

883
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,562
I'm so sorry that
I left you alone, my love.

884
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:02,527
It's okay. You're here now.

885
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,971
I've wanted to do this

886
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,830
for a very long time.

887
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,009
Get over yourself, Fargo.

888
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:22,945
Just because your grandfather
left his mark doesn't mean you will.

889
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:25,282
Maybe not. But it's my name too.
