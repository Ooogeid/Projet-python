1
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,588
Walter ?

2
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:34,224
Walter, sweetie ?

3
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,670
Come to bed.

4
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,759
It's after midnight.

5
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,383
Again.

6
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,038
Walter !

7
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,465
Be right there.

8
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,104
Honey...

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,448
Five more minutes.

10
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,493
You need your sleep.
You know how you get.

11
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,021
Another five minutes.

12
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,638
Well, I'll be asleep. And don't
even think of trying anything

13
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:00,197
when you get up here.
That ship has sailed.

14
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:12,720
That works right.

15
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:24,272
Bingo.

16
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,891
Susan, it works !

17
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:02,073
Oh, no.

18
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,021
I told you we should've made

19
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,872
- a left back there.
- Don't make me use pepper spray.

20
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,411
Are all cops this angry ?

21
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,580
This isn't angry.
I was angry at the truck stop

22
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:28,033
when you told the waitress
that I touched you funny.

23
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,243
We're way past angry.

24
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,011
Would it kill 'em to post
a road sign once in a while ?

25
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:36,072
Will you remind me again
why we're not on a plane right now ?

26
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,883
Oh, that's right. The big,
bad marshal's afraid to fly.

27
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,410
You don't want
to push me right now.

28
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:43,730
Look, I'm just saying that if
we would've made a left back there...

29
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,070
Don't say anything.

30
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:48,443
Fine.

31
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,700
- It's just funny, is all.
- Seriously, I'll pay you.

32
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,730
I mean, you drag me
across three states,

33
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,293
you find me in a city of,
like, half a million people,

34
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:59,272
and then you get us lost
on the way back.

35
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,230
I mean, you gotta
appreciate the irony.

36
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:04,420
Or not.

37
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:06,392
We're not lost.

38
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,320
Just taking the scenic route.

39
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:09,841
Yeah, well, the scenes suck.

40
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,673
Whoa, where'd that guy
come from ?

41
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,220
Hey, high beams, moron !

42
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:29,313
Was that...

43
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:31,513
I mean, did you just see...

44
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:32,901
- What ?
- Us !

45
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,570
- I'm really not in the mood.
- We...

46
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:38,172
We just passed
our car with us inside.

47
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,452
And I thought
I was sleep-deprived.

48
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:42,960
I am totally serious.

49
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,141
So am I, so just take a nap
or something so I can concentrate.

50
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,511
Listen... Dog.

51
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,263
No, you listen, home girl !

52
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:51,590
No, dog !

53
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,902
Oh, you okay ?

54
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,682
You call this
"protective custody"?

55
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,700
Oh, you're okay.

56
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,472
Wait, where are you going ?

57
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:14,821
To check the damage.

58
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,662
And what if you
don't make it back ?

59
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,451
I'll be stuck in here like those guys
on the plane who had to eat each other.

60
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:21,041
- You're right.
- I know !

61
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,240
Here. Here's some ketchup.

62
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,803
Start at your feet.
Work your way up.

63
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,481
Karma's a bitch, huh ?

64
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:48,941
For the last time,
there is no other us.

65
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,460
I know what I saw.

66
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,871
What you think you saw.

67
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:55,052
Look, it was an honest to God
paranormal encounter.

68
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:58,183
You are an honest to God
paranormal encounter.

69
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,191
Does that sense of humor
come with the badge ?

70
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,662
Civilization at last, huh ?

71
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,893
By whose definition ?

72
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,140
Come on.

73
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:18,493
Hey, kid.

74
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:19,933
Hey.

75
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:22,403
Hey, you got
a sheriff here in town ?

76
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,790
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

77
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:26,351
Oh, give me a break.

78
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,780
You're absolutely right.

79
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:30,621
And under normal circumstances,
that's a great policy.

80
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:33,000
But as it happens,

81
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:34,772
I'm one of the good guys.

82
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:38,682
What grade are you in ?

83
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:40,742
11th.

84
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,171
See that guy
picking up rocks ?

85
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,191
Uh, yeah.

86
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,933
Walk two blocks past him.

87
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:50,480
Turn left at the stand
with deciduous trees.

88
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,203
It'll be 60 meters
past the park.

89
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,311
- Great.
- Deciduous ?

90
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,682
It means they shed
their leaves once a year.

91
00:05:58,348 --> 00:05:59,953
Thanks, Einstein.
I knew that.

92
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,693
I'm an Oppenheimer.

93
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,881
The Einsteins live on Fourth.

94
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,373
Well, thanks.

95
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,090
What a freak.

96
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,263
Shut up.

97
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:25,401
Watch it.

98
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,960
- Can I help you ?
- Uh, yeah.

99
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,371
Uh, me and...

100
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,441
Is that coffee ?

101
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:32,951
Excuse me ?

102
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,801
Sorry. We've just been up all night,
and I could really use a fix.

103
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,150
Does this look like Starbucks ?

104
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,742
- Sorry, Deputy...
- Lupo.

105
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:44,771
Right. Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

106
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,763
I'm Jack Carter.
I work for...

107
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:47,651
Gun !

108
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,833
Move and you'll spend
the rest of your days

109
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,532
sucking meals
through a straw.

110
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,402
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

111
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,351
- Right.
- Check my coat pocket !

112
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,570
Imagine that.

113
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,042
Should've said something.

114
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:09,740
Before or after
you stood on my neck ?

115
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,032
Where's Zoe ?

116
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,153
What's a Zoe ?

117
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,653
Did somebody lose this ?

118
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,283
She says her name
is Shania.

119
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:16,920
- Shania ?
- What ?

120
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,191
He's a U.S. Marshal.

121
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:20,723
Really ? We don't get many
of those around here.

122
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,963
Of course, we don't get
many of anybody around here.

123
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:25,390
Bill Cobb,
County Sheriff.

124
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,573
Jack Carter.

125
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:29,480
I see that you've become
acquainted with my deputy.

126
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:33,123
Intimately. Yeah.

127
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,180
Coffee ?

128
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:37,381
Okay.

129
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,891
So what can we do
for you, Marshal ?

130
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,682
Well, I was transporting
this one to L.A.

131
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:45,492
when we had a little bit
of an accident.

132
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:46,633
Is that right ?

133
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:49,211
Are you all right ?

134
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,413
Yeah, we ran into...

135
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:51,530
Ourselves.

136
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:54,352
You ran into yourselves ?

137
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,442
Off the road.

138
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,853
We ran ourselves off the road
trying to avoid a dog.

139
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,041
Oh, yeah.
He's a local hazard.

140
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,270
So how can I help you ?
What can I do for you now ?

141
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:05,703
Actually, I was hoping

142
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:09,181
that you could hang on to the kid here
while I went and dealt with the car.

143
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,172
Well, I don't see why not. Jo ?

144
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,941
You cannot be serious.

145
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,878
You're just gonna
lock me up here ?

146
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:18,957
Yeah.

147
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,131
Have you seen Deliverance ?

148
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,501
I'm guessing you guys
don't get AAA out here.

149
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,972
No. We have Henry.

150
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:28,933
Jo, give Henry a call, have him
bring the tow truck around.

151
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,842
Let's get the Marshal on his way
as quickly as possible.

152
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,030
Right.

153
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:41,860
Spencer !

154
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:43,903
I'm coming !

155
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,751
Spencer, can you grab that ?

156
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,141
"Answer the phone, Spencer."

157
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,630
"Close the windows, Spencer."

158
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,033
There's no answer.

159
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,521
Here goes nothing.

160
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,123
"Refill the liquid nitrogen,
Spencer."

161
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,143
Henry !

162
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:18,821
Now he'll answer.

163
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:22,481
Yeah !

164
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:24,641
Spencer ?

165
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,673
Spencer ?

166
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,311
Hey, whoa, Spencer.

167
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:29,630
You okay ?

168
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,342
You all right ?

169
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:37,022
Hello.

170
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:38,411
<i>Henry, Lupo.</i>

171
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,433
Bring the truck.

172
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:41,731
Yeah, Jo, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm on my way.

173
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,590
And, uh, what was
that explosion ?

174
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,801
What explosion ?
I didn't hear anything.

175
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,503
He says he didn't
hear anything.

176
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:54,602
He never does !

177
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:59,432
We'll get it off the ground next time.
You'll see. Hey hey, Walter !

178
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,801
- Susan !
- Morning, Henry.

179
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:04,541
Give it another go, did we ?

180
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,852
Almost, almost,
almost got it this time.

181
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:08,760
Where y'all off to ?

182
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,353
We're just getting
away for the weekend.

183
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,852
You know, a little quality
time with the family.

184
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,603
We'll be back though.

185
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:17,421
Okay then.

186
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:20,551
Hey hey, Brian !
Come on, give me some.

187
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,223
All right.
You know what, man ?

188
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,792
I don't know
who's growing faster.

189
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,561
You or that pup.

190
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,260
Who wants treats
for the road ?

191
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,501
I do !

192
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:38,561
Take care, Henry.

193
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,033
Yeah, you too.

194
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,581
Nice.

195
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,753
You said treats.
Am I being punished ?

196
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,501
Not yet. Now scoot.

197
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,832
Walter ?

198
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:09,561
Walter.

199
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:11,712
Everything okay ?

200
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:13,840
Oh, yeah.

201
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:14,900
Sure.

202
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:17,772
I... I've just been
working too hard.

203
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:20,292
Always puts Susan
a little on edge.

204
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:21,823
You know,
you're not alone.

205
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,651
Lots of families
go through this.

206
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,651
Maybe you should talk
with Beverly...

207
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,402
No.

208
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,643
Thank you, but...

209
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,640
Everything's under control.

210
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:34,510
We'll see you.

211
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,601
Just wait in the motor home,
honey.

212
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:47,791
Come on, boy.

213
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,023
Nice.

214
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,903
Henry knows
something's wrong.

215
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,972
Well, maybe we should
just reconsider.

216
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,200
Tell them what happened.
I'm sure they'll understand.

217
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,061
No. It's too late for that.

218
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:12,223
But you said yourself we will never
have another opportunity like this.

219
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,410
I know.

220
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,653
But you gotta
trust me, Susan.

221
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,721
This isn't just about us.

222
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,121
Not anymore.

223
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:25,213
Act normal.

224
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,643
I am acting normal !

225
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:27,981
Then go shopping.

226
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,541
Go shopping.

227
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:31,303
Buy some things.

228
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:09,660
Cool !

229
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,282
Okay, kiddo.
Where to first ?

230
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:41,531
Museum of Theoretical Physics
or that new supercollider in...

231
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:46,511
Oh, dear God.
Oh, no, no.

232
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:47,600
Brian ?

233
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,892
Brian !

234
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:51,920
Brian !

235
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:54,820
Brian !

236
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,961
Brian ! Oh, no !

237
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,072
Brian !

238
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,283
Brian !

239
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:08,923
Nice landing.

240
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,123
Thanks.

241
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:11,391
How'd you get out ?

242
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,471
Carefully.

243
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,832
And right about there
should do it.

244
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:18,103
Let's take a look.

245
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:28,482
So you're
a U.S. Marshal ?

246
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:29,572
Yep.

247
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,691
Must be exciting work.

248
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,233
Not at the moment.

249
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:37,333
I just was never completely clear
as to what you fellas do.

250
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,203
It varies.
Protect federal witnesses.

251
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,852
Bring back escaped felons.
Transport prisoners.

252
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:45,971
So that little girl,
she'd be a...

253
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,503
How long you been
in the tow business ?

254
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,632
I don't this for a living.
I do this for fun.

255
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:54,950
I just always liked,
you know, fixing things.

256
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:58,401
I was an engineer
back in the day.

257
00:15:58,617 --> 00:15:59,793
As in trains ?

258
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:02,351
Space shuttles.

259
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:06,063
So I can... I can fix it, it's just
gonna take me a few days.

260
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,280
No, no, no. I gotta be back
in L.A. tomorrow.

261
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:09,392
Bright side.

262
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,921
It'll give you some time
to take in the sights.

263
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:13,150
Perfect.

264
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,421
Are you sure
you counted right ?

265
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:20,260
Okay. I'll be right over.

266
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,001
That was Ned Carver.

267
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:26,711
He claims aliens abducted
some of his cattle again, so...

268
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,742
Tell him to call me when
they move onto anal probes.

269
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:34,833
Wait, um...
That didn't come out right.

270
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:38,632
- Happening little burg you have here.
- Yeah, well, we have our days.

271
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,582
Hey, G.I. Josephina.

272
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,801
What's with all the firepower ?
Hot date ?

273
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:44,942
That's one.

274
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,853
What, like that's supposed
to scare me or something ?

275
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:49,470
That's two.

276
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:53,883
- Lupo.
- She must like you.

277
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,983
I've never seen her
get as high as two before.

278
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,023
What ?

279
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,421
When ?

280
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:03,020
Okay, just keep everybody there.
We're on our way.

281
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:05,272
What ?

282
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,191
There's a situation
at Henry's station.

283
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,423
- How bad ?
- It's Henry's station.

284
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,410
I got your gun.

285
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,563
No guns.

286
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:23,592
Susan.

287
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,883
- But it's a small one.
- No.

288
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,771
We're gonna find him. Okay ?

289
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,893
You two need each other now.
You just stay with each other.

290
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:35,070
All right, what I would like to do
is organize you into three groups.

291
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,172
Everyone see the tree line ?

292
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,383
Yeah, see the tree line ?
It's right over there.

293
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,420
What we're gonna do is we're gonna
sweep towards the tree line.

294
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,633
Okay, thank you.
Let's go, people.

295
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,253
Here comes the cavalry.

296
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:53,432
Great. That's all I need.

297
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,221
Hey, Sheriff, what's going on ?

298
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,882
- There's a boy missing.
- Is he lost or is he kidnapped ?

299
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:02,283
We don't know.
We don't know at this point.

300
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:03,970
Call Highway Patrol.

301
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,822
What you're gonna want are roadblocks
on all the major arties and...

302
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:07,552
Hold that.

303
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:09,020
And put search
and rescue guys to

304
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,450
- comb the forest.
- Your jacket's on the ground.

305
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,610
We've all seen
The Fugitive, Marshal.

306
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,182
How about you let us
take care of this ?

307
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:18,872
I don't want to step on any toes, sir,

308
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,201
but I do have a lot of experience
at this kind of thing.

309
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:23,201
Trust me.
You don't.

310
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,481
Henry ?

311
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:26,240
Yeah, one minute.

312
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,251
Okay.

313
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,303
Looking for something ?

314
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,400
You know you're disturbing
an active crime scene ?

315
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,131
Actually, I'm investigating
an active crime scene.

316
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,963
Jack Carter, U.S. Marshal.

317
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:01,220
Allison Blake,
Department of Defense.

318
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:05,522
Didn't see that coming.

319
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,850
Well, now that we're done
with the introductions, Mr. Carter...

320
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,581
Actually, it's Marshal Carter.

321
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:11,850
But you can call me Jack.

322
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,532
Hey, I don't like
to repeat myself.

323
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,121
Yet something tells me
you're going to.

324
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:21,893
See, I've seen
some strange stuff.

325
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,171
This is why the DOD is out here
in the middle of nowhere.

326
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm not at liberty to say.

327
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,211
Come on, Ms. Blake.
We're on the same team.

328
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:31,742
That's Agent Blake,
Marshal.

329
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:34,661
And we're not even in the same league.
This is way out of your jurisdiction.

330
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:36,292
Actually, I'm a U.S. Marshal.

331
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:39,810
So technically the United States
is my jurisdiction.

332
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,802
Careful though.

333
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,561
Wouldn't want you disturbing
an active crime scene.

334
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:47,590
Look...

335
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:49,802
Brian...

336
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:54,981
The missing boy ?

337
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:55,971
Yeah.

338
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:57,541
Hey.

339
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,983
- It's okay.
- What are you doing ?

340
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,162
Relax. It's not blood.

341
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:05,010
Then what ?

342
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,232
Chocolate.

343
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,132
Hershey's Big Block.

344
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:11,190
With almonds.

345
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,032
How could you possibly
know that ?

346
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:21,021
Believe it or not,
I have done this before.

347
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,811
But there's one small detail
I usually like to ascertain

348
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,783
before launching a full-scale
manhunt for a missing person.

349
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:29,961
And that would be ?

350
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,203
That there is, in fact...

351
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:33,700
a person missing.

352
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,000
- Hi, Brian.
- Brian.

353
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,470
Brian. Brian. Brian !

354
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:50,992
Where you hiding
in the RV the whole time ?

355
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,061
Yes.

356
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:54,821
Everybody missed it.

357
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,683
Not everybody.

358
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,951
I guess he's smarter
than he looks.

359
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,643
You know what ?
I'm gonna let Jo handle him.

360
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:09,503
No, no, I'll handle him.

361
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:12,121
- No, Jo. She's perfect.
- I need you to stay focused

362
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,742
- on finding what caused this.
- No. Jo !

363
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,122
- Sheriff.
- Jo.

364
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,253
Sheriff.

365
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,020
Please.

366
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:25,862
Looks like you really
stepped in it, Marshal.

367
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,583
It wouldn't be the first time.

368
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:28,990
I suppose I should thank you.

369
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,293
How about you tell me
what's going on here instead ?

370
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:32,431
Sorry, Marshal, but...

371
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,513
Yeah, I know.
You're not at liberty to say.

372
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,033
Oh, hey, Marshal ?

373
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,602
One... Oh, I don't know.
Maybe two days.

374
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,110
Three days max.

375
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,403
You may be here a while.

376
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,051
I'm getting that impression.

377
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,272
Come on.
I have a place you can stay.

378
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,262
- Really ?
- I'll drive.

379
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,823
Yeah, no,
you can turn around.

380
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:59,073
Taggart, go home.
We found Brian.

381
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:00,160
<i>- Sheriff ?
- Yeah.</i>

382
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:01,693
<i>That's not all we've got.</i>

383
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,691
<i>Better come take a look.</i>

384
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:19,232
It's supposed to be
my day off.

385
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:22,060
Yeah, well,
I owe you one.

386
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:23,821
- Yes, you do.
- Hey, Taggart.

387
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,722
Watch your step.

388
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,893
So what do we got ?

389
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,971
I was hoping
you could tell me.

390
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,081
Careful. Poison Ivy.

391
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,110
It's over here.

392
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,783
Oh, my God.

393
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:57,972
Looks like the boy's dog
and the back of the RV.

394
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:01,580
And it's just the beginning.

395
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:16,722
Well, this is it.

396
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:20,472
What ?

397
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,360
Nothing.

398
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,581
- You didn't think that I was
taking you to my place. - No.

399
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,312
'Cause I'll tell you right now,
this isn't Madison County,

400
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:35,103
and you're definitely
not Clint Eastwood.

401
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,421
Well, yeah.

402
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:40,460
He's twice my age.

403
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:43,411
- You can get out now.
- Yeah.

404
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,811
You know, Agent Blake...

405
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,850
just because you've
dropped the subject,

406
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,312
doesn't mean that I have.

407
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,631
Marshal, whatever you think
is going on with us,

408
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:55,580
trust me, it's not.

409
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,192
I was talking about the RV.

410
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:01,962
I knew that.

411
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,053
Hello ?

412
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:16,813
Hello !

413
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:22,911
Anybody here ?

414
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:38,093
You must be the... marshal.

415
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,912
That was fast.

416
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:41,993
Small town, big mouths.

417
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,232
- I'm Beverly Barlow.
- Jack Carter.

418
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,400
The helicopter there.
Was that...

419
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:48,441
Sorry.

420
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:51,222
Some of my clients require
a certain level of discretion.

421
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,371
Clients ?

422
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,373
- Guests.
- Guests.

423
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,452
Well, you look, um...

424
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:00,473
exhausted.

425
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:02,310
Let's get you settled in.

426
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:03,430
Thank you.

427
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:07,612
Here we go.
Nice and cozy.

428
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:11,802
Will your wife
be joining you ?

429
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:13,540
My wife ?

430
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:18,773
Not likely.
We're separated.

431
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:20,283
Was it the sex ?

432
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,152
Excuse me ?

433
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,573
Well, it's a common problem
in long-term relationships.

434
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,430
People get bored. They want
to experiment sexually,

435
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:30,471
and they don't know
how to express their needs.

436
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,982
Well, not that
sharing my sex life

437
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,270
with a total stranger
doesn't sound like loads of fun,

438
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:40,100
at the moment, my needs are
a nap and a shower.

439
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:41,483
You're the guest.

440
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:45,113
Pleasant dreams,
Jack Carter.

441
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,410
Is that Nanook ?
Their dog ?

442
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:58,902
Look, what have you got ?

443
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:00,523
Inventory confirms it.

444
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,761
One of the Sentex chips
is definitely missing.

445
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:05,533
From Section Five ?
That's not possible.

446
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,271
- The security cameras...
- Not if they were disabled.

447
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,373
Some kind of electromagnetic
disruption corrupted the entire system.

448
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,190
Whoever did this knew
what they were doing.

449
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:16,513
Okay, well, who has access
to that area ?

450
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:17,603
Besides yourself ?

451
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,790
Yeah, besides myself,
Fargo.

452
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:23,493
Only people with S-5 clearance.
Not that I meant...

453
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,243
Okay, look, I want you
to make a list.

454
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:27,280
I want this handled
quickly and quietly.

455
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:28,711
Shouldn't we tell someone ?

456
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,510
What if it falls into
the wrong hands ?

457
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:32,711
- What if this wasn't an accident ?
- Just handle it.

458
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:34,550
Handle what, Mr. King ?

459
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:37,002
The audit.

460
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:38,563
We should get started
right away

461
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,722
if a project at the facility
was responsible.

462
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,430
Well, how long is
that gonna take ?

463
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:44,342
Uh, a few days.
Maybe a week.

464
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:45,571
That's too long.

465
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,090
Well, you have
a better idea, Sheriff ?

466
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:51,472
Yes, I do. You cease all operations
until we figure this thing out.

467
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:54,103
No, not with the appropriations
committee breathing down my neck.

468
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,971
It's review time.
Careers are on the line.

469
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:57,783
Whose career
are you worried about ?

470
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,500
Careful, Sheriff. You're not the only
one with influence around here.

471
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:02,651
- I don't want this getting out of hand.
- Oh, no, it won't.

472
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:05,672
Not as long as everyone
stays calm, does their job.

473
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,011
If something at the facility
is responsible for this,

474
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:10,930
I need everyone where they belong
working to isolate the problem.

475
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:13,770
- Don't walk away from...
- Yeah. You've got 24 hours.

476
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:29,211
Crap.

477
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:33,293
Where are my clothes ?

478
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:42,782
Ms. Barlow !

479
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:45,931
Ms. Barlow !

480
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:51,951
Ms. Barlow !

481
00:28:00,656 --> 00:28:02,821
Doing a little
undercover work ?

482
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:05,101
Someone took my clothes.

483
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:08,541
They were a little ripe.
I hope you don't mind.

484
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:11,350
Sorry. Thanks.

485
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:15,360
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

486
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,082
Henry called
while you were sleeping.

487
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:23,943
Yeah ?

488
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,932
Yeah, he said it's gonna
take longer than he thought.

489
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,141
Something about
sending out for parts.

490
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:30,110
Yeah.

491
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:32,593
Well.

492
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:35,651
I need to know where I can
get a car in town.

493
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,432
You can take mine.

494
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:40,870
But just be sure
to have it back before dark.

495
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,591
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

496
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:48,892
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

497
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,072
A solar car ?

498
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,040
Before dark.

499
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,561
Got it.

500
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:05,751
Pretty impressive, Jo.

501
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:07,100
It's Deputy Lupo.

502
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:08,851
Where'd you learn
to do that anyway ?

503
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:10,851
U.S. Army,
Special Forces.

504
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,792
Well, that explains
some things.

505
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:14,613
What things ?

506
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,453
Nothing.
None of my business.

507
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:19,820
You got something
to say, say it.

508
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,860
Okay.

509
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:23,613
It's just the whole
tough girl image.

510
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:27,553
I mean, it's fine and everything.
But some guys might find it...

511
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:28,841
intimidating.

512
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,573
Oh, unless of course you're
into chicks. Then that's fine too.

513
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,571
Stop talking.

514
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:48,091
What the hell ?

515
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:49,412
Archimedes.

516
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:51,590
Excuse me ?

517
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,753
Greek mathematician.
Discovered hydrostatics.

518
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:56,751
Eureka. Get it ?

519
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,462
Not really, no.

520
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,130
When's your birthday ?

521
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,751
Uh, May 13, 1969. Why ?

522
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:07,172
5-13-69.

523
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:09,001
You're a Tuesday.

524
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,692
I'm 11-18-97.

525
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,543
That's a Tuesday too.

526
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:14,781
Good to know.

527
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,002
Morning.

528
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,683
You are in big trouble.

529
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,472
Just wait until the judge hears that
you kept a minor locked up all night.

530
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,490
Yeah, here.
File a complaint.

531
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:32,770
Uh, Deputy,
where's the sheriff ?

532
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:34,783
Can't you see I'm busy ?

533
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:38,291
Honestly ?

534
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:43,530
You want to know
where the sheriff is ?

535
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:45,780
He's out on police business.

536
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:50,102
Which is where I should be instead
of babysitting Felon Spice here.

537
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,462
Now, if you'll excuse me.

538
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,763
I'm gonna stop
doing your job.

539
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,200
Start doing mine.

540
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,331
Something I said ?

541
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:03,830
No. I guess you just have
that effect on women.

542
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:06,260
Oh, what is that
supposed to mean ?

543
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:10,252
- Forget it.
- No, really.

544
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,423
I would love to get
some sage advice from a teenager

545
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,450
caught impersonating
a flight attendant.

546
00:32:14,578 --> 00:32:17,142
Oh, please.
How hard is it to do this ?

547
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:26,133
Seriously, you can't
keep doing this.

548
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,622
You can't keep running away
from your mother.

549
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,063
Why not ?

550
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:32,760
You did.

551
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:35,963
Zoe.

552
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:41,563
Your mom and I, we tried.

553
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:43,423
It's just...

554
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,201
some people just...

555
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:47,603
don't work.

556
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:49,941
"Don't work ?"

557
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:52,471
Dad, all you do is work.

558
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:55,722
Zoe, that's-that's...

559
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:09,390
Do you need anything ?

560
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,613
Not from you.

561
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:14,813
Okay.

562
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:31,610
Stellar job.

563
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:34,352
Father of the Year.
Mother...

564
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:40,450
Find a crosswalk !

565
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:24,380
All right.

566
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,972
Let me see what
you people are hiding.

567
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,013
Okay.

568
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,073
This is the creepiest thing
I've ever...

569
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,220
This is no good.

570
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,972
Morning, sunshine.

571
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:54,731
Where am I ?
What's going on ?

572
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,520
Afraid I can't say, mate.

573
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:59,001
Well, where are
you taking me ?

574
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,571
Can't say that either.

575
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:03,421
Look, whoever you are...

576
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:04,750
Call me Taggart.

577
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,280
Taggart.

578
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm not sure
if you realize this,

579
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:12,202
but you've just assaulted
and kidnapped a federal marshal.

580
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,843
Yeah, sorry about that.
Just doing my job.

581
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:18,080
Your job ?
What kind of job ?

582
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,021
"Can't say", right ?

583
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,382
What is wrong with you ?

584
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,950
Lowjack.

585
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:43,750
I got ya this time.

586
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:46,692
Hang on.
You're a dog catcher ?

587
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,793
Biological
containment specialist.

588
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,470
Are you insane ?

589
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:58,792
Sneaky little bastard.

590
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:00,640
You-you just shot that guy !

591
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:03,361
It's a non-addictive
phenothiazine derivative.

592
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,283
Perfectly harmless.

593
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:08,303
It's just a dog,
for crying out loud.

594
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:15,433
Now you listen
to me, friend.

595
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:19,361
I once tracked a polar bear
across the Arctic tundra.

596
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:23,032
Dived with Great Whites
off the Barrier Reef.

597
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,240
Hunted with the prides
of the Serengeti.

598
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,572
But none of it...

599
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:31,722
even begins to compare with what
that animal's put me through.

600
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:40,030
It's not just a dog, Marshal.

601
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,760
That's the Devil himself.

602
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:53,180
Oh, yeah, he's stable.

603
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:17,442
You've gotta be kidding me.

604
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,001
No, he's totally
wrong for you.

605
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:31,850
- You think ?
- Yeah.

606
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,251
"Confident law enforcement
professional seeks same ?"

607
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:40,211
Hello ! I don't know
if you've noticed,

608
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:43,290
but Johnny Laws tend to be
self-centered control freaks.

609
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:47,663
Where's Cobb ? I want to know
what's going on. I want to know now.

610
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,541
- See what I mean ?
- Is there a problem, Marshal ?

611
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,911
I don't know. You tell me.
I mean, one minute I'm driving

612
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:54,431
my delinquent daughter back to LA,
and the next I'm in the middle

613
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:55,730
of the freakin' Twilight Zone !

614
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:58,662
- Why don't you just calm down ?
- Don't tell me to calm down.

615
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:01,823
I've had it with you people,
and I've had it with your crazy town.

616
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:03,940
Now you start talking,

617
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,202
or I'll have 50 marshals
down here by nightfall.

618
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,450
I'm afraid
I can't allow that.

619
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,571
Really ?

620
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,163
And just how do you plan
on stopping me ?

621
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:50,933
Hey, Lowjack. If you're hungry, there's
plenty of leftovers in the fridge.

622
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,491
Pudding. I got some cheese.
I got some sauerkraut.

623
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:55,721
But don't touch my sandwich.

624
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,983
Don't touch it.
That's my sandwich.

625
00:39:58,448 --> 00:39:59,432
Go ahead.

626
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:11,082
Hi, Allison.

627
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,090
<i>We have a problem
with the marshal.</i>

628
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:15,143
<i>We should talk.
I'm on my way.</i>

629
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,080
Something's happening.

630
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:19,032
<i>- What's happening ?
- I don't know.</i>

631
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:20,853
<i>- Sheriff !
- It's not good.</i>

632
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,591
<i>It's really not good.</i>

633
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:33,730
No, no. No, no !

634
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:34,983
No !

635
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:38,491
Son of a bitch !
No ! Stop !

636
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:41,270
No !

637
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:42,913
No !

638
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:08,390
Sheriff ?

639
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:11,403
Sheriff.

640
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:13,782
Oh, my God.

641
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:15,390
Sheriff !

642
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,393
He's got experience.
So what ?

643
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:29,101
The way I see it, we have two options.
We can get rid of him or use him.

644
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:30,981
I know my preference.

645
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,113
- He wrecked my cage.
- He found the kid.

646
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:34,692
We would've
found him eventually.

647
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,463
Smashed it to pieces.

648
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:40,043
- Without Cobb, we are gonna...
- He'll pull though. He has to.

649
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:41,552
I built that cage
with my own two hands.

650
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:43,112
You'll build a new one.

651
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:45,770
Yeah, but not as good.

652
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:49,611
Jo, the guy's obviously good
at what he does.

653
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,143
And right now, we need every
resource at our disposal.

654
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,103
I still think
it's a bad idea.

655
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:56,712
Marshal, come on.
Let's go for a ride.

656
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:06,263
So, um, back there when
you said "get rid of him."

657
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:07,841
Was that like...

658
00:42:08,788 --> 00:42:12,953
you know, "buy him a bus ticket"
get rid of him, or like, you know...

659
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:14,790
First things first.

660
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:17,463
Standard nondisclosure
agreement.

661
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,392
It says that you will be
charged with treason

662
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:21,491
if you tell anyone
what you see here.

663
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:25,690
A lot of people would like to get their
hands on what I'm about to show you.

664
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:26,902
Sign it.

665
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:42,210
Where are you taking me ?
Area 51 ?

666
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:45,602
Please. They wish
they had our security.

667
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,682
Slow down.

668
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:50,643
What are you doing !?!

669
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:27,992
- I think I'm blind.
- Relax. That almost never happens.

670
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:36,083
Oh, man.
What did I just sign ?

671
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,243
It started during World War II

672
00:43:47,488 --> 00:43:49,321
when Einstein realized
that our future

673
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,512
was in the hands of scientists,
not soldiers.

674
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,442
Wait. Einstein. Like THE

675
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:54,391
Einstein ?

676
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:56,711
He convinced President Truman
to create a haven

677
00:43:56,846 --> 00:43:59,382
where the world's greatest thinkers
could live and work.

678
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:00,591
And since then,

679
00:44:00,726 --> 00:44:03,391
most of our major
scientific breakthroughs

680
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:06,000
have happened right here
in Eureka.

681
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:07,641
Hold on.

682
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:15,510
Put that on, please.

683
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:32,590
So where do you fit in in all this ?

684
00:44:32,847 --> 00:44:34,613
I mean, no offense,
but you don't strike me

685
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:36,010
as the science type.

686
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:38,331
I'm the government liaison.
It's my job to make sure

687
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,811
the research being done here is

688
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:40,721
Profitable.

689
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,332
I was gonna say "productive."

690
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:44,501
Building a better tomorrow
doesn't come cheap.

691
00:44:46,738 --> 00:44:48,450
Guess that explains
Fort Knox.

692
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:51,452
That's Section Five. Restricted
to military projects only.

693
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,013
Military ? You mean weapons ?

694
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,342
I couldn't say. You need
NSA clearance to enter.

695
00:44:55,478 --> 00:44:57,370
Well, so much for building
a better tomorrow.

696
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,320
Life is full of compromises, Marshal.

697
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:01,540
The tradeoff is that Eureka
has the best of everything.

698
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:03,351
School, housing,
healthcare.

699
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:05,761
I hope with the emphasis on the latter
after what I've seen.

700
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:07,303
There are always risks.

701
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:09,281
You've had problems before.

702
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,953
- Occasionally.
- Like ?

703
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:12,762
Global warming.

704
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,350
I'd like you to meet
one of out top scientists.

705
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:51,313
Simulation off, Fargo !

706
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,580
This is not level six !

707
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:55,771
Actually, that's level four.

708
00:45:55,908 --> 00:45:57,512
You mastered that last week.

709
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,271
Could recalibrate the system
if it's too advanced for you.

710
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:02,311
No, it's fine.

711
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:07,593
Did you need something ?

712
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,900
Allison Blake's on her way up.

713
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,610
Sheriff Cobb was injured.

714
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:13,530
Really ?

715
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,371
Better put on my sad face.

716
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:17,921
Hey, hey, hey !
Easy, easy.

717
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:20,200
It's not a toy.

718
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:23,002
You could put somebody's eye out.

719
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:25,240
There's also a visitor.
A U.S. Marshal.

720
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,050
In Eureka.

721
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,583
Maybe there's a dangerous fugitive
on the loose.

722
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:33,190
- Wouldn't that be exciting ?
- Don't be ridiculous.

723
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:34,350
I know.

724
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,230
What was I thinking ?

725
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,472
But then again...

726
00:46:40,316 --> 00:46:41,760
Why else would he
be here ?

727
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,583
What's all this for ?

728
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:10,661
Professor King is trying to locate
the point of origin.

729
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:12,692
Origin of what ?

730
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:13,831
Everything.

731
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:15,982
Life.

732
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:17,353
The universe.

733
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,363
It all had to start somewhere.

734
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:22,742
Precisely where is

735
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,702
what I intend to find out.

736
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:27,273
Professor Warren King,
Marshal Jack Carter.

737
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:30,440
Professor King is a Nobel laureate

738
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,631
and noted astrophysicist.

739
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:35,392
Well, I'm captain

740
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:37,160
of my division softball team.

741
00:47:39,997 --> 00:47:41,463
Sounded better in my head.

742
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:43,200
I see what you mean.

743
00:47:43,337 --> 00:47:44,702
Allison, how's the sheriff doing ?

744
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:46,290
He's still in surgery.

745
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:47,910
But the marshal has agreed

746
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:49,471
to help us during his absence.

747
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:50,663
Oh, the marshal.

748
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:51,753
Oh, how generous.

749
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:54,050
Well, you must find all of this
a bit shocking.

750
00:47:54,268 --> 00:47:55,170
I'm from L.A.

751
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,450
Nothing shocks me.

752
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:57,681
I see.

753
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:02,263
Well, almost nothing.

754
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:03,791
Well, perhaps we should just

755
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,151
jump right in ?

756
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:07,583
Right. It's right this way.

757
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,883
We carbon dated the trees in
and around the event perimeter.

758
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,201
They ranged in age
from 12 to 1,200 years old.

759
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:16,840
I take it that's not normal ?

760
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:18,963
What about that
sounds normal ?

761
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,221
Rapid aging like that
can only be caused

762
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,021
by some sort of quantum anomaly.

763
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:24,490
And then there's the temporal
bilocation

764
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:26,123
- of the RV.
- I'm sorry. Come again ?

765
00:48:26,255 --> 00:48:28,171
Temporal bilocation.
Fargo !

766
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:29,252
Somehow

767
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:31,662
the back half of the RV became

768
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:33,282
momentarily isolated

769
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:34,261
from the front.

770
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:36,382
It's caught in a different
time stream. Where

771
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:39,271
it ended up was a direct result
of the Earth rotating

772
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:40,633
beneath it during stasis.

773
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:41,731
How is that possible ?

774
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:43,870
That's a good question.
We're auditing all active projects.

775
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:44,941
But so far,

776
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:46,480
none of them seem related.

777
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:47,533
Including yours ?

778
00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:49,092
- Hold on.
- That's all right, Allison.

779
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:50,500
The marshal's just being thorough.

780
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,940
No, my search involves using

781
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:53,842
advanced pattern recognition software

782
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,980
to trace cosmological events so,

783
00:48:56,285 --> 00:48:57,113
unless

784
00:48:57,245 --> 00:48:59,691
- you're afraid of a little math--
- And what about Section Five ?

785
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:01,681
Surely you have more than
math locked up in there.

786
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:03,800
Details concerning S-5 labs

787
00:49:03,936 --> 00:49:05,360
are all strictly classified.

788
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:07,242
But as far as I know,
nothing in there

789
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,821
could've caused this.

790
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,061
As far as you know ?

791
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:12,673
No offense, but isn't our job
to know ?

792
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:14,241
Pushy.

793
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,023
We should get
back to work.

794
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:21,922
Allison ?

795
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,202
Keep me posted
on the sheriff's progress.

796
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,282
We're all... we're all pulling for him.

797
00:49:32,525 --> 00:49:33,941
Well, that wasn't at all awkward.

798
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:35,452
You want me to help ?
This is me helping.

799
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:38,651
Just lay off of Warren, okay ?
He's not one of your escaped felons.

800
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:40,141
Warren ?

801
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,421
Sounds like someone has
a crush on the teacher.

802
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:48,821
Really gotta start wearing
my seatbelt.

803
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:50,631
Are you questioning
my professionalism ?

804
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:53,500
It was a joke. But I forgot the DOD
doesn't have a sense of humor.

805
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:55,300
Maybe you're just not funny.

806
00:49:57,216 --> 00:49:59,800
Look, I'm still trying to warp my brain
around all this.

807
00:49:59,936 --> 00:50:02,292
I don't know squat about quantum physics.
And to be perfectly honest,

808
00:50:02,426 --> 00:50:04,372
I'm not sure whether
I can help you or not.

809
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:07,461
But if you want me to try, then
I'm gonna have to do my job my way.

810
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:10,581
And for the record,
I'm all kinds of funny.

811
00:50:11,427 --> 00:50:13,092
Can I have my gun ?

812
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,401
Thank you.

813
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:23,141
Son of a...
Stop the car.

814
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:24,421
Stop the car.

815
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:27,503
Don't wait for me.

816
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:39,121
- Whatcha reading ?
- Popular Science.

817
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:40,840
It's all they have...

818
00:50:42,028 --> 00:50:43,861
- Crap !
- What are you doing out of your cell ?

819
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:45,591
I'm getting takeout for me and Jo.

820
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:47,093
It turns out we have a lot
in common.

821
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:47,923
Like what ?

822
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:49,870
Like fighting an oppressive
patriarchal society

823
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,592
to express our feminine power.

824
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,492
Are you hungry ?
Vincent can make anything you want.

825
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,763
- They don't even have menus here.
- Marshal, you name it,

826
00:50:57,897 --> 00:50:58,810
I got it.

827
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,162
Yeah. What the hell ?
Surprise me.

828
00:51:02,298 --> 00:51:03,931
One Chef's Special coming up.

829
00:51:06,155 --> 00:51:06,921
So...

830
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,832
where have you been
all afternoon ?

831
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:11,042
About that.

832
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:16,903
We should talk.

833
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:20,913
Okay, please.
Just give me the bad news.

834
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:22,463
What does that mean ?

835
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, the last time
you wanted "to talk",

836
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:26,500
you told me
you were moving out.

837
00:51:26,638 --> 00:51:28,170
And... no, no.
And the time before that

838
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:29,921
you said that Grandma had died.

839
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,292
Do you see the pattern here ?

840
00:51:31,427 --> 00:51:33,240
No, it's nothing like that.

841
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:37,821
Okay, yeah, it's something like that.
The sheriff got injured

842
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:39,720
and we're gonna be here
for a while.

843
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:40,950
What ?

844
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:41,883
Nothing.

845
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:43,931
Just go investigate something.

846
00:51:44,357 --> 00:51:45,753
They need my help.

847
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:47,740
I can't walk away
from that.

848
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:49,591
Since when ?

849
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:52,101
That's one Fugu-sashi,

850
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,990
one cheeseburger, and a side order

851
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,223
of salt-crusted yams and shaved
white truffles to go.

852
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,353
Tell Jo if she wants to trip me up,

853
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:01,041
she'll have to do
better than that.

854
00:52:01,336 --> 00:52:02,390
Thanks, Vin.

855
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:04,351
Well,

856
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,230
I guess I'll see you
when I see you.

857
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:09,021
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Zoe, look.

858
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:12,322
Why don't you come with me to Beverly's ?
I'll get you a room.

859
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:14,150
Touched.

860
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:15,310
Pass.

861
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:17,103
Zoe !

862
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:20,612
I'll be done as soon as I can.

863
00:52:21,615 --> 00:52:23,650
You used to say
the same thing to Mom.

864
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:27,502
I guess she finally got tired
of waiting.

865
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:30,481
See, Zoe, don't !

866
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:41,471
So, Marshal.

867
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,821
You're investigating this thing,
right ?

868
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:46,533
I heard Ned Carver's cows
got sliced and diced

869
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,281
- just like Walter's motor home.
- Yeah,

870
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:50,070
maybe it be best
not to spread that around.

871
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:52,241
Trust me. Around here it's business
as usual.

872
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:55,170
In fact, we've got a pool going
on what's gonna get hit next.

873
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,352
Pot's up to about a grand
if you're interested.

874
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,611
Yeah, look, I'm gonna have to take
a rain check on what I ordered.

875
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,081
- What do I owe you ?
- On the house.

876
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:06,301
Of course, if you have
the inside scoop

877
00:53:06,437 --> 00:53:08,422
on where things might be headed...

878
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,773
Right now, I'm more concerned
with where things started.

879
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:12,050
Can I borrow this ?

880
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:12,982
Yeah.

881
00:53:28,196 --> 00:53:29,613
Hey, little man, is--

882
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:32,942
- Archimedes, right ?
- Honey, who is it ?

883
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:36,943
13/05/69, mercredi.

884
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:40,322
Okay, sweetie.
Go back inside.

885
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,353
Marshal, what's huh...
what's going on ?

886
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:45,630
That's a nice kid.

887
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:47,480
We chatted in the park
earlier today.

888
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:49,233
You trying to be funny ?

889
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:51,671
No.

890
00:53:52,638 --> 00:53:55,382
My son has autism. He barely speaks
to the people that he knows.

891
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:57,642
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

892
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:01,521
I'm sorry.

893
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:03,551
It's--it's been
a long day.

894
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:05,672
I think I have a lead.

895
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:07,003
But as much as I hate to admit it,

896
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:09,251
I'm gonna have to run it
by your professor friend.

897
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,101
You called me here to look at a map ?

898
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:14,800
What are those ?

899
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:18,032
These are the rough locations
of every reported anomaly.

900
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:20,870
I'm well aware of Vincent's
tacky little pool, Marshal.

901
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,571
What, we're gonna start playing bets now ?
Is that your idea ?

902
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,712
No. Your pattern recognition software

903
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,202
traces cosmic events to their
point of origin, correct ?

904
00:54:30,538 --> 00:54:32,302
What if the events are
a little more local ?

905
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,213
Could that actually work ?

906
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,522
Yeah, in theory it could.

907
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,293
It would take a major
recalculation though.

908
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:44,040
What's the matter, Warren ?
Are you afraid of a little math ?

909
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:45,353
No.

910
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:49,203
- I'm not afraid of a little math.
- But it can't hurt to try though, right ?

911
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:52,141
No. No, it can't hurt.

912
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:53,701
It's a little simple,

913
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,152
but, okay, this'll take a little while.

914
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:59,101
- Can I drop you someplace, Marshal ?
- No, I'll walk.

915
00:54:59,306 --> 00:55:00,671
Could use the fresh air.

916
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:01,750
<i>Right.</i>

917
00:55:05,658 --> 00:55:07,252
See ya, Archimedes.

918
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:10,992
Marshal.

919
00:55:11,596 --> 00:55:12,463
Yeah.

920
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:13,810
Thanks.

921
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:15,382
Yeah.

922
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:22,662
Something wrong ?

923
00:55:24,036 --> 00:55:25,220
No, nothing.

924
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:27,252
Okay.

925
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:33,642
Yeah, just a second. I just
gotta take out the trash.

926
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,270
Oh, no.

927
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:50,481
Look out !
Go, go, go, go !

928
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:52,890
Let's go, let's go !
Come on, let's go !

929
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:55,951
Come on, come on, come on !
Go, go go !

930
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:59,051
Charlie, drop the damn rocks !

931
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:00,602
Let's go !

932
00:56:16,308 --> 00:56:18,441
I just got off an 18-hour flight
from Indonesia.

933
00:56:18,578 --> 00:56:20,202
So before you speak,

934
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,901
consider the impact this call will have
on your career

935
00:56:23,037 --> 00:56:25,431
if it's not of monumental importance.

936
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:26,653
<i>It's Eureka, sir.</i>

937
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:28,900
<i>We're got a priority one
situation.</i>

938
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:33,262
Wake up the Chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.

939
00:56:33,398 --> 00:56:35,142
Gather everybody in the sit room.

940
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:37,262
Tell them the topic of discussion
will be

941
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:39,180
"I told you so."

942
00:56:41,426 --> 00:56:43,150
Oh, man !

943
00:56:43,697 --> 00:56:45,013
The car.

944
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:49,953
Breathe, Walter.

945
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:52,211
Okay.

946
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:53,852
Now what happened ?

947
00:56:58,608 --> 00:57:00,772
I got myself involved in something.

948
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:02,572
What do you mean ?

949
00:57:03,935 --> 00:57:06,013
The annual review is coming up
next month, and I...

950
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:07,811
I told you that I was struggling
to make my deadline.

951
00:57:07,945 --> 00:57:10,793
Yes, I know it was causing
some tension with you and Susan.

952
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:12,773
They said
they could help me.

953
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:15,562
Slow down. Who is "they"?

954
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:17,502
I don't know.

955
00:57:17,656 --> 00:57:19,050
I've never seen "them".

956
00:57:19,758 --> 00:57:21,163
And they did help me.

957
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:25,223
But now everything's
falling apart.

958
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:27,022
Who's that ?

959
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:30,563
Marshal.

960
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:32,751
I saw a light on.

961
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:33,910
Hey.

962
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:35,922
Walter, right ?

963
00:57:36,808 --> 00:57:37,830
How's the family doing ?

964
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:38,792
Fine.

965
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:41,310
And they're probably waiting for me.

966
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:42,430
So...

967
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:46,033
Walter,

968
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:47,971
we will talk tomorrow, okay ?

969
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:49,600
- Sure.
- Okay.

970
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:52,921
Everything okay ?

971
00:57:53,787 --> 00:57:55,533
Emergency session.

972
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:59,280
Normally I try to keep
my evenings free, but

973
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:01,323
as you're discovering,

974
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:03,322
this town is anything
but normal.

975
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:05,863
Like your little bed and breakfast.

976
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,933
We all have our roles
to play.

977
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:11,951
Now, I don't know about you,

978
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:13,942
but I could really
use a drink.

979
00:58:14,097 --> 00:58:15,813
Why don't you make yourself
comfortable ?

980
00:58:16,936 --> 00:58:18,183
So how's his son doing ?

981
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:19,412
He'll be fine.

982
00:58:19,548 --> 00:58:21,092
You know, kids are resilient.

983
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:23,113
It's the adults
I worry about.

984
00:58:23,247 --> 00:58:24,431
Especially around here.

985
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:26,513
If I was stuck in this cracker farm,

986
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:28,332
I'd probably need a shrink too.

987
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,141
Who says you don't ?

988
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:33,890
And I prefer psychotherapist.

989
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:38,290
You know, maintaining relationships is...

990
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:40,453
tough in your line of work.

991
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:42,530
It helps to have someone
to talk to.

992
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:44,111
You do what I do,

993
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:45,892
the job comes first.

994
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,093
I imagine your wife might disagree.

995
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,412
- She knew what she was getting herself into.
- Still, the...

996
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:52,870
time away,

997
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,120
the distance.

998
00:58:54,255 --> 00:58:56,001
It must take its toll on you too.

999
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:58,783
Especially with a child involved.

1000
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,083
Well...

1001
00:59:04,527 --> 00:59:05,503
I tried

1002
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:07,942
a desk job when Zoe was born.

1003
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:10,123
Change to make others happy,

1004
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:12,001
you end up making yourself miserable.

1005
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:13,820
That's exactly what I told Abby.

1006
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:16,612
But she felt you were choosing
your job over them.

1007
00:59:16,748 --> 00:59:18,982
Yeah, and I told her
it's not that simple.

1008
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:21,551
I mean, it's not just a job.

1009
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:24,901
I stop bad people
from doing bad things.

1010
00:59:25,635 --> 00:59:27,662
Well, I'm sure that's
a tremendous comfort

1011
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:29,360
when you go home
at night.

1012
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:31,503
Alone.

1013
00:59:34,145 --> 00:59:35,653
So you don't pull punches.

1014
00:59:36,815 --> 00:59:39,452
I've counseled some prominent people,
Marshal.

1015
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:43,173
Diplomats, dignitaries.
Even a few presidents.

1016
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:44,873
I knew that was him.

1017
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:46,620
They don't pay me

1018
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:48,162
to pull punches.

1019
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:52,002
They want honesty.

1020
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:03,230
Easy, Marshal.
It's us.

1021
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:05,682
Where's Beverly ?

1022
01:00:06,278 --> 01:00:07,340
Is she okay ?

1023
01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:09,560
Aside from a bruised ego.

1024
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:12,703
I never had a man fall asleep
on me before.

1025
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:13,853
Well,

1026
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:15,440
it's time to wake up.

1027
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,770
- What happened ?
- Things have gotten worse.

1028
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:23,151
The diner.
We had our first fatality.

1029
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,362
I was just there.

1030
01:00:25,686 --> 01:00:26,812
With my daughter ?

1031
01:00:26,947 --> 01:00:27,883
She's fine.

1032
01:00:28,547 --> 01:00:29,362
Okay.

1033
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,411
What about King ?

1034
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:34,163
- Any luck ?
- That's the good news.

1035
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,943
He may have found the point of origin.

1036
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:37,253
Where ?

1037
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:39,062
Come with me.
I'll show you.

1038
01:00:43,016 --> 01:00:44,970
So, you and Beverly Barlow ?

1039
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,492
Oh, we were just talking.

1040
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:48,803
Is that why there's
lipstick on your collar ?

1041
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:56,220
- I knew that.
- Yeah, right.

1042
01:00:57,418 --> 01:01:00,160
Oh, thank God. I was just trying
to call you. Please, please, come in.

1043
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:04,243
- What's wrong ?
- It's... it's Walter.

1044
01:01:04,378 --> 01:01:06,011
It's just he hasn't been himself.

1045
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:08,801
He is so stressed out. And then
after nearly losing Brian

1046
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:10,532
and that thing with the motor home...

1047
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,112
Susan, Susan.

1048
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:13,942
Calm down.
Where's Walter ?

1049
01:01:14,078 --> 01:01:16,391
Okay.
He came home late.

1050
01:01:16,526 --> 01:01:18,062
Very late last night.

1051
01:01:18,198 --> 01:01:20,320
And then just locked himself
in the basement.

1052
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:23,193
Something went wrong
with his experiment.

1053
01:01:23,677 --> 01:01:25,531
And I think he's been trying
to fix it.

1054
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:32,473
You should stay up here
with me.

1055
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:35,551
Walter ? Sweetie ?

1056
01:01:35,685 --> 01:01:38,353
You need to come out now.
The police are here.

1057
01:01:39,037 --> 01:01:40,253
Walter !

1058
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:44,313
You gotta be kidding me.

1059
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:46,700
All right, let's see
if Mrs. Perkins has the code.

1060
01:01:47,606 --> 01:01:48,581
Susan !

1061
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,072
Doesn't anyone do anything
halfway around here ?

1062
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,192
Hey, Jo, any luck on that code ?

1063
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:06,282
Nope.
But I found a key.

1064
01:02:07,995 --> 01:02:08,693
Oh.

1065
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:12,621
Dr. Perkins,
it's Deputy Lupo.

1066
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,070
If you can hear me,

1067
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,242
back away from the door.

1068
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:19,302
Maybe this isn't the best...

1069
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:23,270
Way to do that.

1070
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:39,643
Ladies first.

1071
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,593
I think we found our point of origin.

1072
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:45,512
That's not all we found.

1073
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:56,062
Let's not shoot

1074
01:02:56,196 --> 01:02:58,810
the crazy End of the World
Machine just yet, okay ?

1075
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,943
Go. Go, go !
Go !

1076
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,402
Somebody order an invasion ?

1077
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:27,450
All right, listen up.

1078
01:03:27,588 --> 01:03:29,540
I want those seals
checked and rechecked.

1079
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:32,083
This is a Class Three hot zone
till I say otherwise.

1080
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:34,371
Colonel Briggs.
First Rangers, Fort Bragg.

1081
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:36,611
- Hello, Jo. Move on out.
- Yes, Sir.

1082
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,363
- Lieutenant !
- Yes, Sir !

1083
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:41,183
Oh, congratulations,
Ms. Blake.

1084
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,661
Looks like you people finally

1085
01:03:42,795 --> 01:03:44,243
screwed the pooch but good.

1086
01:03:44,377 --> 01:03:45,892
Colonel Briggs, what do you think
you're doing ?

1087
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,580
Something I should've done
the last time

1088
01:03:47,718 --> 01:03:49,760
one of your little science
projects got out of hand.

1089
01:03:49,896 --> 01:03:51,832
Eureka is under
DOD jurisdiction.

1090
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:54,231
Was under DOD jurisdiction.

1091
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:56,093
Now it's a matter of national security.

1092
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:58,532
Which means
you answer to me.

1093
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,590
Okay, let's move that machine
out of here.

1094
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:03,903
Idiot.

1095
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:06,941
So you two
are close then ?

1096
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:10,192
You know, the boyish charm act works better
when you're showered and shaved

1097
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:13,043
Yeah, it's on my "to do" list.
So where are they taking that thing ?

1098
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:14,451
Where else ?

1099
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:25,783
Will somebody please
explain to me

1100
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:26,943
what we're dealing with here ?

1101
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:30,012
From what we can gather,
it's a prototype tachyon accelerator.

1102
01:04:30,398 --> 01:04:31,783
In English, Professor.

1103
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:34,551
I'll speak slowly
for your benefit, Colonel.

1104
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:36,301
A tachyon is a hypothetical particle

1105
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:38,520
that travels faster
than the speed of light.

1106
01:04:38,656 --> 01:04:39,641
Okay.

1107
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:41,221
No, that's not okay.

1108
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:44,140
Nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light or the whole concept

1109
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:46,141
of linear
time becomes meaningless.

1110
01:04:46,276 --> 01:04:47,612
If Walter Perkins created

1111
01:04:47,746 --> 01:04:49,830
some sort of tachyon collision, then

1112
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,472
time, as you know it,

1113
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,262
ceases to exist.
And the laws of physics

1114
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,103
break down at the most
fundamental level.

1115
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:57,380
And if we don't stop this,

1116
01:04:57,515 --> 01:04:58,832
no one will be safe.

1117
01:04:58,968 --> 01:05:00,820
Now this is why I hate this town.

1118
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:03,121
Hang on.
How could Walter Perkins

1119
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:04,840
have even built this
without anyone knowing ?

1120
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:06,563
He had to break some...

1121
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:08,260
major protocols. I mean,

1122
01:05:08,396 --> 01:05:10,482
this is a stolen Sentex prototype.

1123
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,773
Strictly

1124
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,583
next gen

1125
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,732
military hardware

1126
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,380
So the question is...

1127
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:19,870
Could Walter have built this
on his own and

1128
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:22,220
where would he get a hold
of something like this ?

1129
01:05:22,368 --> 01:05:23,681
Section Five ?

1130
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:28,771
Oh, I don't see how that's possible.

1131
01:05:29,535 --> 01:05:32,133
But I guarantee you there'll be
a thorough inquiry.

1132
01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:35,273
- You can count on it.
- All right, I've heard enough.

1133
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:36,573
Now listen up.

1134
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,740
My orders are
to contain this area.

1135
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:41,852
So anyone here stays here
until we figure this out.

1136
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:46,461
This is Briggs. Start taking people
down to the bunkers.

1137
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:48,411
Women and children first.

1138
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:52,791
Zoe.

1139
01:05:58,607 --> 01:06:01,112
Hey, Jo, this apricot bath scrub
is killer.

1140
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:02,461
Where'd you get it ?

1141
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:04,023
Jo ?

1142
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:05,922
Jo, you there ?

1143
01:06:29,715 --> 01:06:32,030
- Get out of my way.
- I have my orders, Sir.

1144
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,291
No one leaves.

1145
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:36,033
- I'm going to get my daughter.
- I wouldn't do that, Marshal.

1146
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:39,063
Tell your grunt he's got two seconds
before I make him eat that rifle.

1147
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:41,273
That grunt is a Force Recon Commando

1148
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:43,993
who can kill you a hundred
different ways with his bare hands.

1149
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,832
The rifle is just his way
of being polite.

1150
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,752
- She's my daughter.
- I don't care.

1151
01:06:47,886 --> 01:06:49,451
- Stand at ease, Burke.
- I hate to interrupt,

1152
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:51,482
but we have bigger issues at hand.

1153
01:06:51,656 --> 01:06:53,543
Time is unraveling.

1154
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,040
The laws of physics are breaking down.

1155
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:57,871
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but

1156
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:00,462
that's the kind of thing that not gonna stop at
the city limits,

1157
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:02,111
- is it ?
- A rift of this magnitude

1158
01:07:02,248 --> 01:07:04,313
will continue to grow exponentially.

1159
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:05,880
Unless...

1160
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:07,392
Henry,

1161
01:07:07,948 --> 01:07:10,333
is it possible Walter was trying
to create another

1162
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:12,693
collision... when his machine blew ?

1163
01:07:12,825 --> 01:07:14,013
Right.
Theoretically,

1164
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,093
the two events would cancel
each other out. I mean

1165
01:07:16,227 --> 01:07:17,822
it's sort of like starting a...

1166
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:20,272
a back fire in a brush blaze.

1167
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:22,791
Right. So if we can get this one up
and running again...

1168
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:25,203
I've got some grade A
hardware in the garage.

1169
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:27,882
Not like Walter what was using,
but it should do the trick.

1170
01:07:28,495 --> 01:07:30,393
Except for one
small problem.

1171
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:34,230
Part of his formula was lost
in the blast. I mean

1172
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:37,011
without it,
the accelerator is useless.

1173
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:40,052
Are you telling me in this town
full of super geeks,

1174
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:42,702
you can't one person who can do
a simple math problem ?

1175
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:45,183
It's not that simple.
Walter...

1176
01:07:45,737 --> 01:07:47,081
was our top

1177
01:07:47,218 --> 01:07:49,061
quantum physicist.

1178
01:07:49,256 --> 01:07:51,083
Now he could've worked on this
for months.

1179
01:07:51,215 --> 01:07:52,280
- What ?
- Years.

1180
01:07:52,418 --> 01:07:53,533
I don't know.

1181
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,350
- I could swear I've seen this before.
- Even if we put

1182
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:58,930
our top people on it.
Excuse me.

1183
01:07:59,068 --> 01:08:01,921
It's not gonna be a walk in the park.
I understand that.

1184
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:03,862
- I need to borrow your car keys.
- Okay.

1185
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:05,951
- What are you thinking ?
- Trust me.

1186
01:08:06,106 --> 01:08:07,683
Do I have any choice ?

1187
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,042
Hey.

1188
01:08:09,357 --> 01:08:11,302
- Watch yourself.
- Okay. Right

1189
01:08:11,435 --> 01:08:12,963
Right. Jo, I need to
get out of here.

1190
01:08:13,097 --> 01:08:15,220
- Do you think you can take him ?
- Please.

1191
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,042
He's Force Recon.

1192
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:27,332
Hey, soldier boy.

1193
01:08:34,085 --> 01:08:35,550
U.S. Marshal.

1194
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:56,110
Dad !

1195
01:08:56,246 --> 01:08:57,980
- Honey. Hey.
- hey.

1196
01:08:58,517 --> 01:08:59,650
- You okay ?
- Yeah.

1197
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:01,150
What the hell's going on ?

1198
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:04,102
There's this machine,

1199
01:09:04,237 --> 01:09:07,100
and a missing formula.
A lot of science stuff I can't explain.

1200
01:09:07,236 --> 01:09:08,501
So what are we gonna do ?

1201
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:10,093
"We" aren't gonna do anything.

1202
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:11,820
You're gonna stay right here
where it's safe.

1203
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:13,452
Like hell.
I'm coming with you.

1204
01:09:13,585 --> 01:09:15,051
Oh, Zoe, I don't have
time to argue.

1205
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:16,851
Which is why I'm gonna win.

1206
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:20,280
Okay.

1207
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,652
You stay by my side. You don't leave
my sight, not for a second.

1208
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:24,593
- You got it ?
- Yeah.

1209
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:27,633
Hey, we need help.

1210
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:29,631
Nice to see you too, Marshal.

1211
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:30,953
Nasty out there, huh ?

1212
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:32,370
I think I can fix it.

1213
01:09:32,786 --> 01:09:34,143
But I can't do it alone.

1214
01:09:34,986 --> 01:09:37,252
- How can I help ?
- Oh, actually,

1215
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,730
you can't.

1216
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,421
But I'm hoping he can.

1217
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,861
All right. This has gone on
long enough.

1218
01:09:58,997 --> 01:10:00,131
He just needs more time.

1219
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:02,262
Yeah, like 15 years
and a college degree.

1220
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,970
He's just a kid for crying out loud.

1221
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:06,461
- Just give him a chance.
- Allison, maybe he's right.

1222
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:08,163
We all know Kevin has special talents,

1223
01:10:08,298 --> 01:10:10,642
but this is just too much.
Especially under these conditions.

1224
01:10:10,776 --> 01:10:11,411
Yeah.

1225
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:13,933
Yeah, it's not working.

1226
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:18,630
Here you go, buddy.

1227
01:10:19,946 --> 01:10:21,182
Give that a try.

1228
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:29,212
What are you doing ?

1229
01:10:29,477 --> 01:10:30,350
Nothing.

1230
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:31,722
It's all him.

1231
01:10:47,097 --> 01:10:49,363
Oh, my... God.

1232
01:10:50,026 --> 01:10:51,210
Let me in here.

1233
01:11:27,285 --> 01:11:28,522
He got it.

1234
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:29,720
He got it.

1235
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:31,963
Well, I'll be damned.

1236
01:11:39,738 --> 01:11:40,832
Henry, let's get to work.

1237
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:53,310
Easy on that.

1238
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,403
Man, this thing is cold.

1239
01:11:57,537 --> 01:11:58,133
Easy.

1240
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,382
Henry, remember Groom Lake ?

1241
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,742
Yeah, but this time we're sober.

1242
01:12:04,816 --> 01:12:05,730
Almost there.

1243
01:12:07,985 --> 01:12:09,003
That should be it.

1244
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:11,051
Lock it in.
Great, okay.

1245
01:12:11,335 --> 01:12:12,800
Okay, people.
It's now or never.

1246
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:14,411
Nonessentials clear out.

1247
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:20,740
People, let's get out of here !
Go, go !

1248
01:12:26,595 --> 01:12:28,043
Dreamworld, kid !

1249
01:12:28,856 --> 01:12:29,682
All right,

1250
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:31,521
on my count.
Here we go.

1251
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:32,553
One...

1252
01:12:33,337 --> 01:12:34,173
two...

1253
01:12:34,908 --> 01:12:35,931
three...

1254
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:37,533
now !

1255
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:40,330
Ring one.

1256
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:46,521
Sir, it's been an honor
working with you.

1257
01:12:47,558 --> 01:12:48,642
You too, Burke.

1258
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:51,293
Now.

1259
01:12:51,588 --> 01:12:52,772
Ring two.

1260
01:12:53,648 --> 01:12:54,780
Oh, man.

1261
01:12:55,608 --> 01:12:56,830
Dad, I'm scared.

1262
01:12:56,966 --> 01:12:57,831
I know.

1263
01:12:59,686 --> 01:13:01,163
Here goes nothing !

1264
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:03,020
On my count.

1265
01:13:03,376 --> 01:13:04,292
One...

1266
01:13:05,058 --> 01:13:05,922
two...

1267
01:13:06,718 --> 01:13:07,463
three...

1268
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:09,230
now !

1269
01:13:14,886 --> 01:13:16,963
Henry, do I need goggles ?

1270
01:13:18,038 --> 01:13:19,013
No.

1271
01:13:36,685 --> 01:13:37,820
Walter.

1272
01:13:43,926 --> 01:13:46,131
Walter, you son of a...

1273
01:14:13,425 --> 01:14:14,923
So, what about the machine ?

1274
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:17,282
We'll take it back to the lab
for analysis.

1275
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:18,623
And then ?

1276
01:14:18,825 --> 01:14:20,931
Then we'll lock it away
in a very safe place.

1277
01:14:21,065 --> 01:14:21,911
I hope so.

1278
01:14:22,306 --> 01:14:23,861
'Cause I don't like
this town.

1279
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:25,710
I think it's a powder keg.

1280
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,692
And I think you people get off on
playing with matches.

1281
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:29,773
Well, tell you what.

1282
01:14:29,907 --> 01:14:32,632
99% of the equipment you use
to keep this country safe

1283
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:34,021
was developed here.

1284
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:36,610
So when you're ready to give that up,
you just let me know.

1285
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:40,271
You were lucky this time,

1286
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:41,810
but I'll be watching.

1287
01:14:46,137 --> 01:14:47,193
You lied to me.

1288
01:14:47,325 --> 01:14:48,781
Allison, Allison, it's not that sim...

1289
01:14:48,915 --> 01:14:51,052
That chip Walter had
was stolen from Section Five

1290
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,153
and you knew it.
You put everyone's lives at risk.

1291
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:54,133
I don't know

1292
01:14:54,266 --> 01:14:55,702
how he got that chip, Allison.

1293
01:14:55,836 --> 01:14:57,830
But I promise you I had
no knowledge of it.

1294
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,510
For your sake, Warren, I hope not.

1295
01:15:06,326 --> 01:15:08,362
- Trouble in paradise ?
- Fargo !

1296
01:15:09,278 --> 01:15:10,793
They're ready for you.

1297
01:15:12,597 --> 01:15:13,532
Stay.

1298
01:15:23,737 --> 01:15:24,481
Sorry, sir.

1299
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:27,243
Come on. We did this an hour ago.
Just do it, do it.

1300
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:31,992
You touched my eye.

1301
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:35,442
Let's go.

1302
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:40,853
You've got serious
power issues, Norman.

1303
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:45,122
What a jerk.

1304
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:49,860
Space shuttles ?

1305
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:52,172
Turn her over.

1306
01:15:52,305 --> 01:15:53,592
No, no, no.
Remote.

1307
01:15:57,146 --> 01:15:58,150
Thanks.

1308
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:08,171
Try to keep her on the ground.

1309
01:16:09,936 --> 01:16:11,513
- No, really.
- Yeah.

1310
01:16:21,905 --> 01:16:23,021
Nice.

1311
01:16:29,165 --> 01:16:30,601
Now, remember what I said.

1312
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:33,423
Games are okay,
just don't play by their rules.

1313
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:35,533
- Ready to go ?
- I am.

1314
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:38,072
You know, she's really
very insightful.

1315
01:16:38,617 --> 01:16:40,863
Yeah, she should write a book.

1316
01:16:41,656 --> 01:16:42,400
Jo,

1317
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:43,482
thanks

1318
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:44,430
for everything.

1319
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:46,561
Tell the sheriff I'm sorry
we missed him.

1320
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:48,261
Tell him yourself.

1321
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:50,862
You're leaving us so soon, Marshal ?

1322
01:16:51,397 --> 01:16:53,290
Good to see you up and about, Sheriff.

1323
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:55,063
Should you be up and about ?

1324
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,752
No. But don't tell
the doctors.

1325
01:16:58,776 --> 01:17:01,310
- I owe you big, Marshal.
- Oh, no. Just doing my job.

1326
01:17:01,976 --> 01:17:03,241
No, you were doing my job.

1327
01:17:03,377 --> 01:17:05,163
And you did it well,
I might add.

1328
01:17:06,346 --> 01:17:07,013
Thanks.

1329
01:17:07,146 --> 01:17:08,322
So, is this Henry ?

1330
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,453
Yeah, Henry.

1331
01:17:09,585 --> 01:17:10,510
- Yeah ?
- Hi.

1332
01:17:10,817 --> 01:17:12,370
- Hi.
- The man does good work.

1333
01:17:18,448 --> 01:17:19,912
Try to keep it on the ground.

1334
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:21,322
Yeah,

1335
01:17:21,485 --> 01:17:22,161
you too.

1336
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:24,821
Adios, Zoe.

1337
01:17:24,956 --> 01:17:25,822
Bye, Sheriff.

1338
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:27,352
See you later.

1339
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:31,371
So what do you think ?

1340
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:33,781
I think I'd like it
better in black.

1341
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:35,252
You know what I mean.

1342
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:39,801
We could do worse.

1343
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:45,213
You know

1344
01:17:45,346 --> 01:17:48,220
Zoe, it was wrong for me
to leave you like that.

1345
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:51,613
I know it was rough.

1346
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:53,602
And that I wasn't
always available,

1347
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,743
- so...
- Are you apologizing ?

1348
01:17:55,878 --> 01:17:57,380
Well... no.

1349
01:17:57,725 --> 01:17:59,043
- Yes, you are !
- No !

1350
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:01,091
You are. You're totally
apologizing to me.

1351
01:18:01,227 --> 01:18:02,120
All right,

1352
01:18:02,328 --> 01:18:03,223
yeah.

1353
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:05,312
Yeah, I am sorry.

1354
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:10,751
Now,

1355
01:18:11,116 --> 01:18:12,932
is there something
you want to say to me ?

1356
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,453
Nope.

1357
01:18:20,525 --> 01:18:22,393
Well, you're definitely my kid.

1358
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:35,723
You do realize that's
what got us in the mess

1359
01:18:35,855 --> 01:18:37,361
- in the first place.
- What's that ?

1360
01:18:37,497 --> 01:18:39,641
You not keeping your eyes
on the road.

1361
01:18:41,098 --> 01:18:42,611
What were you looking at anyway ?

1362
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:43,721
Nothing.

1363
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:46,242
Nothing at all.

1364
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,832
I still can't believe it.

1365
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:57,180
So you had no idea
Walter was involved

1366
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,950
in some kind
of corporate espionage ?

1367
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:00,262
No, none.

1368
01:19:00,727 --> 01:19:01,503
Except...

1369
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:02,533
Except what ?

1370
01:19:03,045 --> 01:19:04,372
Oh, there were phone calls.

1371
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,222
Sometimes late at night.

1372
01:19:06,706 --> 01:19:07,570
From whom ?

1373
01:19:07,727 --> 01:19:09,263
Walter wouldn't say.

1374
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:11,761
But I could tell
that he was frightened.

1375
01:19:12,308 --> 01:19:14,602
I think he must've been working
with someone else.

1376
01:19:17,258 --> 01:19:17,970
Here.

1377
01:19:18,108 --> 01:19:19,820
Drink this. It'll make you
feel better.

1378
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:22,370
Thanks. You're so sweet.

1379
01:19:24,085 --> 01:19:26,303
So, have you told
anyone else about this ?

1380
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:29,701
No. But... but I will.

1381
01:19:30,545 --> 01:19:32,050
Oh, Susan.

1382
01:19:33,156 --> 01:19:35,960
You have no idea how sorry
I am to hear that.

1383
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:39,982
It took us a long time
to find the right candidate.

1384
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:43,523
Even longer for him to gain
access to Section Five.

1385
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:46,560
Walter was doing so well.

1386
01:19:47,425 --> 01:19:48,580
And now,

1387
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,553
now I'll have to
start all over again.

1388
01:19:53,526 --> 01:19:56,322
I was so hoping you and I
might become friends.

1389
01:20:13,116 --> 01:20:14,603
Jo ? It's Beverly.

1390
01:20:14,737 --> 01:20:16,561
I'm over at
the Perkins'house.

1391
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:18,800
Susan's committed suicide.

1392
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:21,202
Yeah.

1393
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,500
Okay.

1394
01:20:41,157 --> 01:20:41,871
Carter.

1395
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:44,713
These are Special Agents
Hicks and Miller,

1396
01:20:44,846 --> 01:20:45,952
<i>Department of Defense.</i>

1397
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:48,370
Look, if this is about that thing

1398
01:20:48,508 --> 01:20:49,990
I signed, I didn't tell anyone.

1399
01:20:50,165 --> 01:20:51,880
Actually, we're here
on behalf of the Major.

1400
01:20:52,016 --> 01:20:54,712
- He was very impressed.
- You mean colonel. Colonel Briggs.

1401
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:57,460
No, Major William Cobb,
Army Intelligence.

1402
01:20:57,615 --> 01:20:59,133
He said you two worked
together recently.

1403
01:20:59,265 --> 01:21:00,392
Oh, you mean the sheriff ?

1404
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:03,150
With his recommendation,
your security classification

1405
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,401
and pay level will increase
effective immediately.

1406
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:09,720
Marshal.

1407
01:21:10,056 --> 01:21:10,722
Sir.

1408
01:21:13,646 --> 01:21:14,822
I don't understand.

1409
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,470
Relax, Carter.

1410
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:17,900
It's a promotion.

1411
01:21:20,127 --> 01:21:21,323
Congratulations.

1412
01:21:22,488 --> 01:21:23,981
Define promotion !

1413
01:22:00,397 --> 01:22:01,433
Okay.

1414
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:05,821
Not the promotion
you were hoping for.

1415
