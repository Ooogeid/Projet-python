1
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:12,950
I need to know.

2
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,254
I need to know.

3
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:51,564
Carter.

4
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:53,367
Whatcha doing ?

5
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,916
I'm the sheriff.
I'm... sheriffing.

6
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,817
You were supposed to meet me
at Global a half an hour ago

7
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:00,971
for your physical.

8
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:02,528
Yeah.
Good news.

9
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,131
I gave myself the physical,
and I'm in perfect health.

10
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:07,550
All right, it's mandatory.
You can't be insured

11
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:08,893
by Global without one.

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,590
Yeah, now's not a good time.
We're really, really,

13
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,032
super busy.

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,271
Okay, this is the third time
you've put this off.

15
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,362
- What's up ?
- Do you really want to know ?

16
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:27,162
No, I just enjoy
our morning banter.

17
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:37,591
Because I don't want to die.

18
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,741
Isn't that the whole point
of taking the physical, Carter ?

19
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:42,400
No, that's tempting fate.

20
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,771
Insure a cop today,
he takes a bullet tomorrow.

21
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,363
What, are you superstitious ?

22
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,911
It's not superstition if it's true.
Which it is.

23
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,873
You know, you're not grasping
the point here.

24
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:53,151
If you don't take the physical,
you don't have a job.

25
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,381
So strip.
We'll just do the physical here.

26
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:59,112
- Excuse me ?
- We all have a past. This was mine.

27
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,463
So... time's a-wastin'.
Drop'em.

28
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:04,302
I'm gonna need to see
some credentials.

29
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,203
If... you are a doctor.

30
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,433
Was a doctor
before Kevin was born.

31
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,352
But I still think I remember
where all the main parts are.

32
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,600
So drop your pants.

33
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,102
Yeah, no.

34
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,282
There'll be no pant-dropping
without a nice dinner

35
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:20,282
and many, many cocktails.

36
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,970
<i>- Deputy Lupo.
- This is Carlson.</i>

37
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,921
- Okay, calm down.
- Who is it ?

38
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,420
Just breathe.

39
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,252
Okay, get a paper bag,
and...

40
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,960
- Breathe into it.
- Who is it ?

41
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,032
Carl Carlson.
911s all the time.

42
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,172
We can ignore it.

43
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,522
Not on my watch.

44
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,962
- Carter.
- Sorry, Allison.

45
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,061
Gotta go.

46
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,593
Protect and serve.

47
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:49,823
Wait for it.

48
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:54,301
Where am I going, exactly ?

49
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,280
- Carl Carlson ?
- You're not Sheriff Cobb.

50
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,242
No. Sheriff Cobb ret... retired.

51
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:14,760
I took his place.

52
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,490
There was a town meeting.

53
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,610
And... everything.

54
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,612
- I gave a speech.
- I don't get out much.

55
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:27,470
I'm gathering.

56
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:29,823
- Jack Carter.
- Do you have any idea

57
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:32,271
how many strains of bacteria are
transmitted by hand-to-hand contact ?

58
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:34,371
No.
But I'm guessing you do.

59
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,710
I'm really sorry.
This isn't gonna work out.

60
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:38,910
I need Sheriff Cobb.

61
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,881
- You're still not Sheriff Cobb.
- Yeah, we established that.

62
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,440
But... since I'm here,

63
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:55,423
what is your emergency, exactly ?

64
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,171
I have to get to work.

65
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,922
You called 911 to bum a ride ?

66
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,180
It's a very big day for me.

67
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,410
Sheriff Cobb always used to give me
a ride on very big days.

68
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,172
- Driving makes me very nervous.
- It's okay, Carl.

69
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm here.

70
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,062
- Client of yours ?
- Six years running.

71
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,793
Why didn't you tell me
that there's a new sheriff ?

72
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:12,780
It came about
rather unexpectedly,

73
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:15,620
and I didn't want to panic you
until we had time to process--

74
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,891
Now I'm panicking because this is
a defining day in my research,

75
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,951
and I have absolutely no way
of getting to work.

76
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,652
I'm sure Sheriff Carter

77
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:24,203
will be happy to drive you.

78
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:24,942
Yeah.

79
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,253
You know, he is
a former U.S. Marshal.

80
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,503
- Yeah.
- Yeah ?

81
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:33,242
Okay.

82
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,642
Only if he puts the lights on.

83
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,963
That was surprisingly easy.

84
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:41,381
He must like you.

85
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:44,321
Beverly, I don't run
a taxi service.

86
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,121
He's on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

87
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,343
- More like a major breakdown.
- He's pioneering

88
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,263
the field of cellular regeneration.

89
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,722
You would be helping him
help everyone else if you do this.

90
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:05,431
What are we waiting for ?
You're making me late.

91
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,892
I used to have a real job.

92
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,331
You're doing a good thing.

93
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:11,363
Carl !

94
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,413
And remember, lights but no siren.

95
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:16,703
Right.

96
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,332
Okay, got you here
in one piece.

97
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:28,472
Next  time, if you wouldn't mind
cleaning out your car

98
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:30,062
There won't be a next time.
Best of luck.

99
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,603
What do you mean ?
You're not coming to my lab ?

100
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,133
Well, no.

101
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:33,550
Today's the day
I go for all the marbles.

102
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,213
- It's gonna be--
- I got a... thing.

103
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,132
And then I have
another thing.

104
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,592
- Because Sheriff Cobb always used to.
- Okay, for the last time, Carl,

105
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:42,502
I'm not Sheriff Cobb. I'm an officer
of the law, and I just can't...

106
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,712
- Carter !
- ... get enough

107
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,100
- of the science in this town.
- Oh, good.

108
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,501
- Yeah, so what is this breakthrough ?
- It's remarkable.

109
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,933
I am so tired of that man.

110
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:56,561
- What is it with you and Carter ?
- Not Carter. Carlson.

111
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,870
The man's been here for six years.
He hasn't produced anything.

112
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,993
He's literally more trouble
than he's worth.

113
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,590
Is  this really necessary ?

114
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,890
I can't risk introducing
new strains of bacteria

115
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,353
into the test area.

116
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,042
Could you step back, please ?

117
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,300
I said... I said step back.

118
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,831
I am attempting to achieve

119
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,742
adhesion affinity gradient

120
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,361
in the proximal blastemal cells
in human tissue.

121
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,963
I'm glad someone's on that.

122
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,453
Yes, you know,
when a lizard loses its tail,

123
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,263
it grows back.
It's called cellular regeneration.

124
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm trying to do
the same thing with people.

125
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,122
Oh, that's cool.

126
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:50,121
Beverly encourages me
to take risks

127
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,213
and not wimp out

128
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:54,243
when I'm on the verge of

129
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,261
something new.

130
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,291
Moment of truth.

131
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:05,453
One drop.

132
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:07,933
One drop...

133
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:10,742
only.

134
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,482
- Uh-oh.
- What do you mean, "Uh-oh ?"

135
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:15,643
If you'd come to my office
for your physical,

136
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,423
you might not have been
hurt physically.

137
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:20,203
Well, Dr. Blake, if you hadn't tried
to give me a physical,

138
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,813
then I wouldn't have had to go through
such extreme measures to avoid it.

139
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,430
You got off lucky, Carter.

140
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,263
Well, not as lucky as him.

141
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,351
However, it could be
the new tungsten alloy rotor

142
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,762
I installed in the centrifuge.

143
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,543
It could be... you know what ?

144
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,673
Dichloride heptoxide
is unstable when heated.

145
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,330
And that's what probably happened.

146
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,302
In fact, I'm sure that's
what happened.

147
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,363
Probably.

148
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:43,861
Allison, I'm gonna need

149
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:46,672
form 395-2C.

150
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,500
- Nathan.
- My call.

151
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,911
He's all yours, Carter.

152
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,332
All mine ?

153
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:57,202
What's... what's... Form 395-2C ?

154
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,413
Revocation of government clearances
and property.

155
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,760
Carl is being fired.

156
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:04,120
And it is your job as sheriff
to oversee the safe

157
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:07,512
and orderly removal of
all ex-employees from Eureka.

158
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,951
What does that entail ?

159
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:14,192
Technicians from Global Dynamics
will pack up anything

160
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,853
that belongs to Dr. Carlson

161
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:17,902
and confiscate
anything that doesn't.

162
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:19,422
They'll review
his personal documents

163
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,673
and redact
any classified information.

164
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,853
Dr. Carlson will then be scanned

165
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:26,853
to make sure he's not concealing
any classified materials.

166
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,140
And a Global Dynamics
human resource counselor

167
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:31,223
will provide Dr. Carlson
with a new résum.

168
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,680
Replacing his tenure at Global

169
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,613
with a plausible
government research project,

170
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,743
complete with applicable
references.

171
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:39,010
Every molecule of my life
has been erased.

172
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:41,160
That's our goal.

173
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,720
Have a good day.

174
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,181
Don't... touch me !

175
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,860
- I'm really sorry about this, Carl.
- Yeah.

176
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,523
Where am I gonna sleep ?

177
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:53,360
- I'm sure Beverly has a place.
- No, she's not returning my calls.

178
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,830
Besides, I cannot sleep
in a public bed.

179
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:58,932
If Sheriff Cobb were here,

180
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,950
he'd  let me stay
with him.

181
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:01,973
But...

182
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,152
he's not here.

183
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,623
All my stuff.

184
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:08,900
Carl, I happen to

185
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,273
live in a hermetically
sealed military bunker.

186
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,001
Perfect !

187
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,202
Thank you !

188
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,323
I'll just call Beverly to let
her know where I'm staying.

189
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:18,083
If I had a phone, because I don't have,
because they took it ! So I don't have

190
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,972
- Can I borrow ?
- Yeah, I...

191
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:21,723
got a...

192
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,280
So you moonlighting
at Staples ?

193
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,992
Form 395-2C.

194
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:39,793
Carl has to complete these before
he's allowed to leave Eureka.

195
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:42,081
Well, so much for your
paperless society.

196
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:44,093
All these'll get filed
at the D.O.D.

197
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,700
They're not quite down
with the "save a tree" mentality

198
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:47,741
as of yet.

199
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,220
Oh, and that's for you.

200
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh, yeah, it'll hurt a lot more
if you try to take it off.

201
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,751
What the hell is it ?

202
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,330
Wireless body sensor.

203
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:56,450
In other words,
portable physical.

204
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,081
It's taking constant measurements
of your vital signs,

205
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,390
organ functions,
and blood chemistry.

206
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,641
- I feel so violated.
- Oh, I'll be monitoring you.

207
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,192
- Allison !
- Blood pressure.

208
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,300
Make sure he signs
every page.

209
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,373
Beverly,
it's Carl again.

210
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,493
Please pick up
if you're there.

211
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:20,182
I know you told me
that with risks

212
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:23,391
come great rewards.
Well, I'm having a little trouble

213
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,222
seeing what those rewards...

214
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,250
are at this moment.

215
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,043
<i>Beverly, listen.
I'm being redacted.</i>

216
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,042
<i>I'm being exiled
out of Eureka.</i>

217
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,570
<i>You need to call me.</i>

218
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,130
<i>Actually, you have to call
Carter's phone,</i>

219
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,821
<i>not me. Cause they
took my phone.</i>

220
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,203
That  was him.

221
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:41,302
<i>This is an unfortunate setback.</i>

222
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:42,961
It's okay.

223
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,501
Carl Carlson may no longer
be a viable candidate

224
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,043
for our objectives.

225
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,963
However, a new target
has been identified.

226
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,000
- You asked to see me, sir ?
- Yes, Fargo.

227
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,612
I need you to lead
the investigation

228
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,773
on the explosion
in Dr. Carlson's lab.

229
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,761
Thank you, sir.
I'm--I'm honored.

230
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,500
Just keep the findings between us
until I tell you otherwise.

231
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,763
On the down-low.
Got it.

232
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,933
- S.A.R.A.H., door.
- Welcome, Sheriff Carter

233
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,001
Hey, what's up ?

234
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:14,101
Organic chemistry's gonna kill me.

235
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,272
What happened to you ?

236
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,242
Uh, organic chemistry
almost killed me.

237
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:20,273
We're gonna have
a houseguest tonight, so

238
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,341
remember to pick up.

239
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,350
Good going, Dad.
Is it Allison or Jo ?

240
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:24,463
What ?

241
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,663
Well, see, I have a bet
going with Vincent.

242
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,531
See, if I win, then

243
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,321
he's going to make me breakfast
in bed for a month.

244
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,193
And if he wins,
I wait tables.

245
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,320
Neither. Stop wagering
on my love life.

246
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,263
- Or lack thereof.
- Right, so who's this

247
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,122
lucky person ?

248
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,610
It's a researcher
who got canned today.

249
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:41,823
He'll be over just as soon as
he finishes off some paperwork.

250
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,591
Which could take a while.

251
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:46,310
Don't.

252
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,133
Carter.

253
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,183
<i>It's Carl.</i>

254
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,090
Oh, hey, Carl.
You done already ?

255
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:54,560
<i>No.</i>

256
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:57,122
Listen, I wanna thank you
for the generous offer,

257
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:59,821
but I don't think I'm gonna be needing
a place to sleep tonight.

258
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,943
Carl, where are you ?

259
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,131
<i>I'm just cleaning.</i>

260
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,252
Cleaning what ?
Your place is empty.

261
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,102
The railing of the...

262
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:08,912
Da Vinci Bridge.

263
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't move.
I'll be right there.

264
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:25,990
Hey, Carl.

265
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:26,760
Hi.

266
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,513
You wanna come back here ?

267
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,032
Why ?

268
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,722
My  whole life's a failure.

269
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,591
Blew up six years
of research.

270
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:35,810
Got fired.

271
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,800
And end up with nothing
but my toothbrush. All before lunch.

272
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:42,121
Okay.

273
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,171
This was a setback.

274
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,400
My work...

275
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:47,730
is my life.

276
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:51,042
And without it,
I'm nothing.

277
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,571
Oh, you're something.

278
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:53,852
You're...

279
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:56,722
a nice guy.

280
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:58,301
I irritate you.

281
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:01,600
I irritate everybody.
It's not surprising. I'm irritating.

282
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:04,392
You're...

283
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,122
colorful.

284
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,691
Don't patronize me,
Sheriff.

285
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:09,822
All right.

286
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:14,042
If you're going,

287
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,320
- hold on.
- What are you doing ? No, no, no !

288
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,192
When I get nervous,
I get very confused.

289
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,093
- If I get confused, I might--
- Fall.

290
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,683
Yes.
I'm glad you understand.

291
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,691
I don't think you wanna do this.

292
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,821
I get it. I mean,
you've had a really

293
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,101
rotten day.

294
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,321
And--and, uh,
everything sucks.

295
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

296
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:45,823
Why don't we just...

297
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,041
climb back over and talk about it ?

298
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,471
You know, go grab a beer.
Make fun of Stark.

299
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:54,601
What do you say ?

300
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:57,561
I've never grabbed a beer
with anybody in my life.

301
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,041
Today's the first drink
of the rest of your life.

302
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,022
If you don't jump.

303
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,612
You think we could be friends ?

304
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,800
I think that's what
the beer is for.

305
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,120
What do I do ?
I don't know what to do.

306
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,971
I can't do it till I get drunk.

307
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,080
Okay, okay.

308
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,912
- I gotta do it really fast.
- Give me your hand.

309
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:18,542
Okay.

310
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:04,720
<i>Carter.</i>

311
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,000
Carter, are you all right ?

312
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:07,801
Not sure.

313
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,981
Still taking stock.

314
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,112
How did you know ?

315
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:15,792
Well, your blood pressure spiked,

316
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,232
your adrenals went
in overdrive,

317
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,203
and your white cell count suggests
you may have broken something.

318
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,683
I fell down.

319
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:25,673
A long way down.

320
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,251
Are you sure you're okay ?

321
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:30,490
Where's Carl ?

322
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:31,912
What do you mean,
"Where's Carl ?"

323
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,503
I thought you were staying
on top of him.

324
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,500
<i>Believe me, I was.
I'll call you later.</i>

325
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,473
Henry ?

326
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,580
- Henry.
- Carl ?

327
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:57,673
Listen.
I heard the news, and...

328
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:01,072
- I have to talk to you.
- What happened to your head ?

329
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,910
- What ?
- Your head !

330
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,300
Yeah, I took a bit of a tumble.

331
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,223
In more ways than one.

332
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:13,393
Let  me clean that up for you
so it doesn't get infected.

333
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,082
No. With those hands ?
I don't think so.

334
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,153
- Do you have a sink ?
- Sure, in the back.

335
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:27,331
There should be some sanitizing lotion
and disinfectant in there, too.

336
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,011
Oh, my God.

337
00:17:58,396 --> 00:17:59,263
Oh, God.

338
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,111
We have preliminary data
on the lab accident.

339
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,572
Looks like there was
a momentary breach of the EMG.

340
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,303
It coincided with the accident
in Dr. Carlson's lab.

341
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:12,040
The pulse wave from the ultrafuge

342
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,273
probably caused an
electromagnetic disturbance.

343
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:16,961
That's not all. We're detecting
exotic atomic particles

344
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,933
inside his lab
that I've never seen before.

345
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:21,840
And the breach appears to have come
from below his lab.

346
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,530
In Section 5.

347
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:34,402
Hey, Carter.
You okay ?

348
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,361
Yeah, yeah.
Think I...

349
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,970
well, I may have
cracked a rib or three.

350
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:40,670
What ?
How ?

351
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,791
Funny you should ask.
It's a good story.

352
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,423
A hypothetical guy

353
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:51,202
falls maybe 50 feet,

354
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,883
lands flat on the ground.
And then another guy weighing

355
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,822
180 falls and lands
on top of him.

356
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,183
Okay, what is the chance
of the hypothetical guy

357
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:00,971
getting up and walking away ?

358
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,030
Whether I use single-case probability

359
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:04,861
or an application
of Bayesian statistics,

360
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,350
the outcome is the same.

361
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,602
Slim to none.

362
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:08,760
Yeah, that's what I thought.

363
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,702
Look, this "hypothetical guy."

364
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:13,410
- Is that you ?
- No.

365
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,362
I landed on the
hypothetical guy, though.

366
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:17,022
Uh, it's Carl Carlson.

367
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,783
What ?
Carl was just here.

368
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,382
I mean, he did look
pretty beat up, but

369
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,760
he certainly didn't look
like a guy who fell 50 feet.

370
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:24,553
Doesn't make any sense.

371
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,443
I gotta find him.

372
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:29,263
- You might want to find a doctor.
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,132
Vincent.

374
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:06,641
A beer.

375
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,511
<i>Okay.</i>

376
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,790
But you don't drink alcohol,

377
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,331
and I don't serve you anymore

378
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,001
since you brought in
the health inspector.

379
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,740
- There was a fly in my soup.
- You sensed a fly in your soup.

380
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,933
I may have overreacted.

381
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,931
Yeah, you overreact a lot, mate.

382
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:22,273
That's why you're out.

383
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,032
What number of animal distress calls
I've made to your house ?

384
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,442
- I'd have canned you years ago.
- Yes, Taggart, you're right.

385
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:29,551
I used to be a man
afraid of everything.

386
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:30,233
But.

387
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,833
All that will change.

388
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:46,603
Starting now.

389
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,523
Beverly.

390
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:53,140
Carl. Oh, my God.
What happened ? Are you okay ?

391
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:54,561
I'm better than okay.

392
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,690
I'm really sorry that
I couldn't take your calls.

393
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:00,063
- Global revoked your therapy privileges.
- Perfectly understandable.

394
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,190
Why would you take my calls ?
I was a loser.

395
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,221
But I'm a new man now,
Beverly.

396
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,371
You told me to take risks,
and you were right.

397
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:12,091
You're touching my skin.

398
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:13,992
Without gloves.

399
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,702
Without disinfectant.

400
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:17,812
Fear kept me
from living, Beverly.

401
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,471
Kept me from trying the things
I wanted to try

402
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,132
and doing the things
I wanted to do.

403
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:25,050
But something extraordinary
happened to me today,

404
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:27,450
and all that's changed.

405
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:29,261
I wanted to say...

406
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,202
thank you.

407
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,110
I've always wanted
to do that.

408
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,272
Who hasn't ?

409
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:43,681
Even I've thought
about it.

410
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,753
And now, Beverly,

411
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:54,782
if you'll excuse me.

412
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,741
Good night, boys.

413
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:09,440
Dr. Stark.

414
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,023
Stark ?

415
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,361
Carlson.

416
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:33,291
I would've thought
you'd have been redacted by now.

417
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:34,942
Oh, I have been.

418
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,632
You took away the only thing
that I ever cared about.

419
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,623
You're gonna regret it.

420
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:44,492
You and I both know I should've done
that a long time ago.

421
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:46,330
Carl !

422
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:49,373
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

423
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:50,873
What happened ?

424
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:53,760
Carl, no !

425
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:00,111
Carlson.

426
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:02,153
No job is worth this.

427
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:07,832
What do you think this
is worth ?

428
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,932
Spontaneous cellular regeneration.

429
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:25,801
The implications are staggering.

430
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,810
Surgeries, amputations,

431
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,291
organ transplants, all could become
a thing of the past.

432
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:32,521
It could change the entire face
of medicine.

433
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,260
Think how much relief
this will give everyone.

434
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:36,221
Well, except for surgeons.

435
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,583
Oh, and hospitals.
And oh, the... the...

436
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,772
guys who make Band-Aids.

437
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,893
An amazing transformation.

438
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,660
A little too amazing.

439
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:49,782
Carlson's not just
a researcher anymore.

440
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,240
He's the research.

441
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,413
He's finally come through.
I'd think you'd be happy.

442
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:56,391
I'll be the first one to jump up and
down if he can replicate the results.

443
00:23:56,856 --> 00:23:58,790
But until then,
he needs to be studied.

444
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:00,232
Dr. Stark.

445
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,611
I have some...
numbers for you to sign off on.

446
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,361
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me.

447
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:09,710
I think we've found the source
of the exotic particles.

448
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:13,151
There was an electromagnetic breach
of the floor above Section 5.

449
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:15,460
- Which room ?
- I can't say.

450
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,921
The room doesn't appear
on any of the published schematics.

451
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,573
It's classified,
and I'm not.

452
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:22,391
So unless you wanna up
my security clearance.

453
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,671
Here, give it to me.

454
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:36,032
Oh, that's not possible.

455
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:39,651
There's 20 layers of concrete
and charged-particle barricades

456
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:41,032
surrounding the...

457
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:42,812
room.

458
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,861
What's in there
that's so dangerous ?

459
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:01,072
When I perfect this formula,

460
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,262
I can make you invincible.

461
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,490
That's a very generous offer, Carl,
but I think I'll have to pass.

462
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:08,570
Really ? Why ?
Think about it.

463
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:10,360
You won't be afraid
of death anymore.

464
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:12,460
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

465
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,551
Besides, fear's what keeps
you sharp, right ?

466
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,552
Buy me a beer sometime.
Tickets to a ballgame, something.

467
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:20,140
I've never been
to a ballgame.

468
00:25:20,948 --> 00:25:23,702
All that spilled food on the ground
fermenting and beer and filth.

469
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,740
That's what used to make my skin crawl
when I used to think about it.

470
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,202
When you put it like that,
it's no wonder.

471
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:32,251
It's interesting. It just doesn't
bother me anymore. In a strange way,

472
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,901
it's almost appealing.

473
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:38,283
Ever since the accident,
I've had this bizarre

474
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:39,733
life craving.

475
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,272
Sounds like you feel pregnant.

476
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,402
Well, in a strange way,

477
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:47,983
actually, I do.

478
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,603
It's like a light's been turned on.

479
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:53,771
It's...

480
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,223
like I've been reborn.

481
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:02,210
Just came for the patch.

482
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:04,023
Your exam's over.

483
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:06,103
- So I passed ?
- Yes.

484
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:09,082
You are officially insured
by Global Dynamics Life and Health.

485
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,932
I still say
it's tempting fate.

486
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,230
Now you can go get your ribs
checked out. You...

487
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,511
You do at least
have them wrapped.

488
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,610
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

489
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,332
Do you have
an Ace bandage ?

490
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:22,871
No.
Fresh out.

491
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:26,140
<i>Yes, you do, Sheriff.
In your gym bag upstairs.</i>

492
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:27,531
<i>Bedroom closet.</i>

493
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:30,513
- That's really disconcerting.
- Yeah, you get used to it.

494
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,530
- Traitor.
- Come on.

495
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:39,350
- Here you go.
- Okay.

496
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:43,953
I'm worried about Carl.

497
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:47,011
I think there... something's
going on with him.

498
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:49,740
I mean, besides
the invincibility thing.

499
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,602
Well, he seems to think
it's a good thing.

500
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,790
Can't believe I'm saying this,

501
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,743
but I think I'm gonna...
miss the old Carl.

502
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:02,261
And now I'm gonna have
to get your head checked, too.

503
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:05,661
He's not right.

504
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:07,583
Henry's running
a full battery of tests,

505
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,902
so hopefully it'll tell us
what happened.

506
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,033
- Yeah.
- Okay, so how's that ?

507
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:14,831
That's better.

508
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:16,861
Good. Well, maybe now
you can get some sleep.

509
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,800
- Yeah. Here, come on. Lay down.
- All right.

510
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:20,763
- Come on.
- Yeah.

511
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:23,471
That's the one thing that Fargo
got right about this place, is

512
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:24,970
the mattress.

513
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:26,991
It's a...

514
00:27:27,475 --> 00:27:30,610
a prototype
for a body-contouring silicone.

515
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,363
Really ?

516
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,941
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

517
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,581
- I need one of these.
- I think everybody needs one of these.

518
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:48,591
All right, I'm gettin'up.

519
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:49,292
Okay.

520
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:54,062
All right, I need
to get out of here.

521
00:27:58,017 --> 00:27:58,963
Okay.

522
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,263
And now some regener to jam.

523
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,641
It's not healing.

524
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,201
I've done everything
exactly the same way.

525
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:52,251
I don't understand.

526
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,261
My cells are regenerating.

527
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:30,933
What am I doing wrong ?

528
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,341
<i>Good morning, Zoe.</i>

529
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:54,511
I win.

530
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,091
Hey.

531
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:06,961
Hey.

532
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:08,360
Hey.

533
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:13,333
- I think I fell asleep.
- I think you might've.

534
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:19,822
I have to pick up Kevin
from his friend's house.

535
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,291
I had a purse.

536
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,450
<i>Your purse is downstairs,
Ms. Blake.</i>

537
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:28,411
All right,
that's really disconcerting.

538
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,932
You know what ?
Put that on.

539
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:32,900
Thanks.

540
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,103
- So...
- See you at Global.

541
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,121
Yeah.

542
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:36,823
Allison ?

543
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,503
Thanks for stopping by.

544
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:41,421
Yeah.

545
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,712
I've reviewed all the test results.
And it's absolutely amazing.

546
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,513
You won't believe what's going on
with Carl's blood work.

547
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,842
- Hey, good morning, guys.
- Morning.

548
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:57,821
Morning.

549
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,831
Weren't you wearing that
yesterday ?

550
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,070
No.

551
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,071
Just similar.

552
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:08,351
Oh, don't look at me.
I wear the same thing every day.

553
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,620
I found traces of radiation
in his white cells,

554
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:13,203
and his exotic particle count
is off the charts.

555
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:15,801
Is there any chance that the explosion
could've caused that radiation

556
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:17,512
to leak from an adjacent lab ?

557
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,441
Not that I'm aware of.

558
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:20,983
Well, whatever Carl
was exposed to,

559
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,983
it's created a spontaneous
genetic mutation

560
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:24,731
that is accelerating rapidly.

561
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:26,111
We just have to figure out

562
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,872
what those mutations
are doing to him.

563
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,203
Whatever it takes, Henry.

564
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:46,973
What am I doing wrong ?

565
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:52,760
Dr. Carlson,

566
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:55,130
here are the biliary epithelial cells
you requested.

567
00:31:55,145 --> 00:31:57,900
I asked for nonparenchymal
progenitor cells !

568
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:15,372
The lab tech said that Dr. Carlson
attacked him telekinetically.

569
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:16,593
I wouldn't discount it.

570
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:17,630
Seriously ?

571
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,820
When I first looked at Carl's
blood work, I thought the explosion

572
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,483
had somehow reprogrammed
his cells

573
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,093
to spontaneously regenerate.

574
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:25,361
- It didn't ?
- No, his cells aren't doing the work.

575
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,813
His brain is. Here.
Take a look at this.

576
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,413
Now, most people use maybe 10%
of their brain

577
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,762
at any one time.

578
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,070
This mutation has allowed Carl
to access

579
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,332
all 100% of his brain.

580
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,743
Okay, well, maybe I'm only accessing

581
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:42,070
5% of mine, but that
would just make him

582
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:44,433
smarter, right ?
Like, not invincible.

583
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:47,421
The mind has powers
that are completely uncharted.

584
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,232
Tibetan monks
have been using meditation

585
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:50,941
to promote healing
for centuries.

586
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:53,203
Maybe one day, man will evolve
to the point that

587
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,050
he no longer needs doctors.
He'll be able to heal himself

588
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,122
with thought.

589
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,653
But not for thousands of years.

590
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,623
Tens of thousands, even.
If ever.

591
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:02,002
Carl is already there.

592
00:33:02,017 --> 00:33:03,382
And he's still evolving.

593
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:05,601
But into what ?

594
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:17,942
Hey, buddy.

595
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,091
I guess you heard
about the incident.

596
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:21,641
Yeah.

597
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:25,080
I don't understand
what's happening.

598
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,732
It appears that you
were exposed to something

599
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,612
during the explosion that's

600
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:31,801
altered your brain functioning.

601
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:34,730
That is why
you're able to heal so...

602
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:35,653
quickly.

603
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:37,653
So...

604
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,273
my research is a failure.

605
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,642
- I didn't do this.
- No.

606
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,360
No, yeah, you did.

607
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,651
Just... with your mind.

608
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:49,430
I guess that's why I can't get
this out of my head.

609
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:52,222
- What is it ?
- I don't know.

610
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:56,871
I have no idea. It's like a song
that you can't think of the name of.

611
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,123
And I'm starting to...

612
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,371
sense things. Feelings and...

613
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:04,761
thoughts.

614
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:06,752
Do you know what this is ?

615
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:09,990
No.

616
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:14,970
Dr. Carlson, I think it's time
we went somewhere to...

617
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,561
run some more specific tests.

618
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:18,492
Why ?

619
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,522
Determine what's happening
to you.

620
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,460
I think you want
to study me.

621
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:27,542
The way you want
to study that.

622
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:34,840
Dr. Carlson.

623
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:42,883
I think he's evolving
a little faster than we thought.

624
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:48,922
Beverly.

625
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:50,901
Carl.

626
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,330
- Scared me.
- Something happened to me.

627
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:00,791
It's happening to me.

628
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,421
It's something that I didn't create,
and I can't control it.

629
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,333
- It's okay.
- I feel connected

630
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:07,911
to everything
at the same time.

631
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:10,032
And I'm...
I'm... seeing images.

632
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,073
And I'm hearing thoughts.

633
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:13,972
Which is remarkable.

634
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,333
But... it's a little scary.

635
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:17,851
Come.

636
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:20,071
I'm here.

637
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:22,802
Whatever you need,

638
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,313
Carl,
I can help you.

639
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,282
You don't want
to help me.

640
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:35,241
You want me
to help you.

641
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:38,810
To get into Section 5.

642
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,503
I want to do
what's best for you,

643
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:43,551
Carl !

644
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,972
I'm so stupid.

645
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,772
I thought that you
cared for me.

646
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:50,530
I do care for you, Carl.

647
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:52,713
You're a liar.

648
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,013
Carl.

649
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,261
<i>I always knew
he'd snap one day.</i>

650
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,362
<i>He's creepy.</i>

651
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:13,763
<i>So much promise.</i>

652
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,980
<i>I thought he was
strange before.</i>

653
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:26,680
Carl.

654
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,503
Carl, slow down.

655
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:29,703
Carl.

656
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:32,100
I'm a friend.
Remember ?

657
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:34,230
I thought I'd created
something incredible.

658
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:35,263
I know.

659
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,533
But it was something
at Global, some...

660
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,532
Strange kind of radiation ?

661
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:41,843
How did you know ?

662
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:44,661
Because I was... thinking of it ?

663
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,163
Loud and clear.

664
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,150
Okay, that's a little disturbing.

665
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,331
So then you know

666
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,191
that the only place
that can help you is Global.

667
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:55,041
I go back there,
they'll never let me leave.

668
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:56,560
Trust me.

669
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:02,431
Carl, you gotta trust me.

670
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:04,682
I'll take it
from here, Carter.

671
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,060
We're doing just fine, thanks.

672
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:07,121
- Carter.
- Nathan.

673
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,802
Okay, the two of you
just take a breath.

674
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:09,930
Dr. Carlson.

675
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:11,653
Let me help you.

676
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:12,923
Before it's too late.

677
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,742
You don't wanna help me.
You want to use me.

678
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:15,871
Why would I want to do that ?

679
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:17,930
Because you think
I'm the key.

680
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,211
The key to what ?

681
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,670
- Nothing.
- To Section 5,

682
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:22,702
to his... precious artifact.

683
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,361
What is he talking about ?

684
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:25,612
I have no idea.

685
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:29,180
The sad thing is you really
don't know what it is, do you ?

686
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,803
You are obsessed with this object

687
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:33,963
you know absolutely
nothing about.

688
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:35,833
Do you ?

689
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:47,001
Carl, you can't leave.

690
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:50,251
Wait !

691
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:54,601
Carter !

692
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:57,500
Carter, damn it.

693
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,193
He's not breathing.

694
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,141
Call for help.

695
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,330
We're losing him.

696
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:03,440
I know what to do.

697
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:06,761
Get him back to Global, now !

698
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:10,223
Please let me call in
a trauma surgeon.

699
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:13,882
It's not working.

700
00:38:14,648 --> 00:38:16,302
I have to get closer to it.

701
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:17,601
The artifact.

702
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:20,623
- You can't.
- It's the only way.

703
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,403
We have to go to Section 5 now.

704
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:25,590
Wait here.

705
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:26,962
What ? No !
I'm coming with you.

706
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,730
- You're not authorized.
- Nathan, this is ridiculous.

707
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:30,531
- The man is dying.
- Ally.

708
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,283
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it alone.

709
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:34,971
Trust me.

710
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,422
That's close enough.

711
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,970
Sit him down.

712
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:29,803
Hey ! Welcome back, Sheriff.

713
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:33,610
Come on, Carter.

714
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:34,862
You're okay ?

715
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:41,623
There we go.
Come on.

716
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:46,301
Get him to the infirmary.

717
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:46,833
Yes.

718
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:03,303
Carlson, wait.

719
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:11,483
Don't do it, Carl.

720
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:13,673
It's gonna be all right.

721
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,163
It'll destroy you.

722
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:21,441
I'm not afraid.

723
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,033
Carl, please.

724
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,222
I have to know.

725
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:30,511
What is it ?

726
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,323
One day you will know.

727
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:34,862
The question is

728
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:37,210
will you be ready ?

729
00:40:43,646 --> 00:40:44,402
I am.

730
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,301
You sure you want to do this ?

731
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:21,620
Absolutely.

732
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:22,943
We've waited long enough.

733
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,563
Because now I'm having
second thoughts.

734
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,503
- This was your idea.
- Exactly. And...

735
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:29,382
And I don't want you to blame me
for talking you into it.

736
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,322
If there's one thing I've learned
from Carl, it's to take some risks.

737
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:35,110
Now, come on.

738
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:37,563
Let's do it.

739
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:39,933
Okay.

740
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:40,743
Okay.

741
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:47,103
Just sign and date here.

742
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:49,300
You will be 100% insured.

743
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:52,783
Well, without Carl around,
maybe I won't be needing it.

744
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:56,951
Where'd he get
reassigned, anyway ?

745
00:41:58,047 --> 00:42:00,172
I don't know.
Nathan had it classified.

746
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:01,750
Figures.

747
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:03,721
I'm gonna miss him.

748
00:42:03,736 --> 00:42:04,941
All right, here goes nothing.

749
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:09,003
What made you change
your mind ?

750
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:12,031
Well, can't let fear
run your life, right ?

751
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,543
No, we can't.
