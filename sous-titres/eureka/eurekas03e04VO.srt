1
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:08,678
- Water.
- <i>Yes, Sheriff.</i>

2
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,425
- Warm water.
- <i>Sorry, Sheriff.</i>

3
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,103
Forget it.

4
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:23,576
<i>I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.</i>

5
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:27,489
- <i>Is something bothering you today?</i>
- Nope. Perfectly fine.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,480
<i>High adrenaline can cause physical
and psychological reactions.</i>

7
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:34,415
<i>Bandage?</i>

8
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,334
- That'll look good at the wedding.
- <i>Good thing you're not the groom.</i>

9
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:44,477
What kind of type "a" bride
works the morning of her wedding?

10
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,575
- Nice cut.
- Thanks.

11
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,865
<i>There is a condiment dispenser
in the refrigerator.</i>

12
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,011
That's all right.
I like the bottle.

13
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,111
I don't know.
She called, said she needed my help.

14
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,433
So you jumped, like always.

15
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,185
No, I didn't.

16
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:00,160
Dad, you're walking the woman
you possibly love

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,023
down the aisle to marry another guy.

18
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,056
Okay, first, not true.

19
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,765
And second, since when do you
and I talk about this stuff?

20
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,532
Since I'm 17 and you're in denial.

21
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:12,447
I'm fine.

22
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,869
Are you really this hopelessly
un-self-aware?

23
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,632
- That's my last clean shirt.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:22,919
<i>There's an unexpected visitor
at the door.</i>

25
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,799
- It's auntie Lex!
- Three days early.

26
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,655
- <i>Shall I let her in?</i>
- Yes!

27
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,184
Hello?

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,202
You look like a supermodel...
Every father's nightmare.

29
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,692
I love your hair and...
your cats.

30
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,154
A Tibetan monk told me that Tabby
is a reincarnation of grandma Lil.

31
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:51,757
Jackie.

32
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,575
You look just like dad...

33
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:57,704
Always ready, always prepared,

34
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,330
always uptight.

35
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:02,250
I thought you weren't coming
till tuesday.

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,075
My Seattle chakra conference
ended early,

37
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,699
and Saturday travel...
Always best for Geminis.

38
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,200
Right.
Well, glad to see you.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,174
If you could put the cats
in the guest room.

40
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,699
And I'll see you
at the wedding, sweetie.

41
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,514
Nice to see you, too, Monkey.

42
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,389
- Monkey?
- Don't call me that.

43
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,016
Weddings, I love weddings.

44
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:21,487
Okay, be careful with grandma.
She's in heat.

45
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,156
Shouldn't you be
at a beauty parlor or something?

46
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,638
What, is it 1960, and no one told me?
Relax.

47
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:29,360
We've both done this before.
I mean, separately, but...

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,156
Yeah, but getting married isn't like
riding a bike or returning dry cleaning.

49
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:37,487
I mean, getting married
should be momentous.

50
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,184
Well, redaction is momentous, too,

51
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,329
but I owe it to these people
to see them through it.

52
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,623
Big day.
Nervous?

53
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm not a first-time bride.

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,632
Sorry I had to call you in, but
quarterly balance sheets are due monday.

55
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,214
- This couldn't wait.
- Another set of layoffs?

56
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,822
There's over a dozen people here.

57
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,520
Good thing
you called in the cavalry.

58
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:57,958
- Blood stain?
- Oh, no, breakfast.

59
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,766
It's Saturday.
It's my last clean shirt.

60
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:05,011
- This is gonna take hours.
- Time's a-wasting.

61
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:07,899
Wouldn't want to miss
your beautiful wedding.

62
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,522
You didn't invite her, did you?

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,763
No.

64
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:17,263
Look, this whole redaction thing sucks.

65
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,599
I'd like to see the Fixer
cleaning up excrement.

66
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,252
Ye... Look, Lincoln...

67
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:26,393
For what it's worth, we all know
that you're the best...

68
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,693
excrement guy around.

69
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:33,358
Just remember, today at 6:00 pm,
your badge is disabled.

70
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,200
- Sorry.
- I've been in Eureka for eight years.

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,622
Kind of hard to go back to the PETCO
in Pacoima, you know?

72
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:41,533
Yeah, well, it's been a hard day
for a lot of good people.

73
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,380
Carter.
Bar fight?

74
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:47,512
Shouldn't you be at the beauty parlor?
It is your big day.

75
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,732
- Supervising an important delivery.
- Time-sensitive.

76
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:52,234
- Guys!
- Do you need something, Carter?

77
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:56,656
Yeah, I need to find... maintenance.
Last guy on my list is...

78
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:59,245
- Weinbrenner.
- Basement.

79
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,201
Just do whatever you have to do,
but, please,

80
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,802
don't be late to the wedding
and don't forget the necklace.

81
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,956
Oh, I can't believe
she's marrying him again.

82
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,668
I can't believe she asked him
to walk her down the aisle.

83
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,491
Weinbrenner?

84
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,301
Leo Weinbrenner?

85
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:24,616
Anyone here?

86
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,244
All right, you just
bought yourself an extra day.

87
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:50,375
- You're late.
- Yeah,

88
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,754
I had to redact 12 people
and then find a tie.

89
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,053
- The necklace?
- What necklace?

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,033
One of a kind, just like Allie.

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,146
Don't screw it up.

92
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,920
You know, the French give
their children wine with dinner.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,611
Yeah, dad's never been to France.

94
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,827
- If I told you what your father...
- He would kill you.

95
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,365
That's what aunts are for.

96
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,742
<i>A votre santé.</i>

97
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:27,579
Nice, Lex.

98
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,304
You're late.
I met your sister.

99
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,959
Yeah, arrest her
for corrupting a minor.

100
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:47,474
Momentous, huh?

101
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,113
Yeah.

102
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,396
Are you okay?
You look pale.

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,939
That's the white tent.

104
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,296
There's something
that I wanted to say.

105
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:04,141
Something you should know.

106
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,463
I'll always be here for you...

107
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:09,747
No matter what.

108
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:13,292
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

109
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:04,424
Love is timeless,
transcending everything we know,

110
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:07,638
everything we understand
and giving us strength

111
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,556
and comfort forever.

112
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:12,757
What is past is now present.

113
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,854
And what is present
will become your future.

114
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:17,998
That is what love is...

115
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,292
Never ending.

116
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:23,355
Now, before you share your vows...

117
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,114
If there is anyone here

118
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:30,201
who knows why these two
should not be joined together,

119
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:33,914
speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

120
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,537
What the hell?

121
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:50,931
- Warm!
- <i>Yes, Sheriff.</i>

122
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,820
<i>I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.</i>

123
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,696
I'm fine.
Just a...

124
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,792
Weird dream.

125
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:18,166
<i>High adrenaline can cause physical
and psychological reactions.</i>

126
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:20,121
Perfectly fi...

127
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,116
<i>Bandage?</i>

128
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,844
- Sarah?
- <i>Yes, Sheriff?</i>

129
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:30,604
- Is the wedding today?
- <i>Yes, at 6:00 pm.</i>

130
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,159
<i>Good thing you're not the groom.</i>

131
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,863
- <i>Is something bothering you?</i>
- Yeah.

132
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,462
It feels like I was already there.

133
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:45,859
Season 3 Episode 04
I do over (v 1.00)

134
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,054
Teams Projet-SG & 6th-Race.

http://u-sub.net

136
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,371
Nice cut.

137
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,207
Why are you dressed for work?

138
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,589
Allison called,
said she needed my help.

139
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,399
What kind of type "a" bride
works the morning of her wedding?

140
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,712
Sarah made eggs.

141
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:06,990
Yeah, thanks.

142
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:11,055
- Dad, is something wrong?
- Yeah, I'm a little... thrown.

143
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:14,292
Well, no wonder. I mean, you're walking
the woman you possibly love

144
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,368
down the aisle to marry another guy.

145
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:18,602
Yeah, since when do you and I
talk about that stuff?

146
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:21,771
Since I'm 17.
You're in denial.

147
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,946
- That's my last clean shirt.
- Sorry.

148
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,616
<i>There's an unexpected visitor
at the door.</i>

149
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:29,988
Lex.

150
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,080
- How did you know?!
- <i>Shall I let her in?</i>

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,081
Yes.

152
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,789
Hello?

153
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,607
Zoe.

154
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:46,617
You look like a supermodel...
Every father's nightmare.

155
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,149
You look amazing.

156
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,019
I love your hair and...
your cats.

157
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:52,643
Jackie.

158
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:55,430
You look just like dad.

159
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:59,410
And your Tabby
looks like grandma Lil.

160
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,394
- I thought you were coming on Tuesday.
- My chakra conference ended early.

161
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,985
And Geminis travel best on Saturday.

162
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,400
Okay... If you could put the cats
in the guest room.

163
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,465
Something to figure out.
See you at the wedding.

164
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,532
Wedding.
I love weddings.

165
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:17,801
I can't explain it.
I feel like I've done all this before.

166
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,083
We've both done this before,
separately.

167
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,400
No, not the wedding.
I mean, not just the wedding.

168
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,126
It's the Ketchup, my sister,
this conversation.

169
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:26,710
Big day.
Nervous?

170
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:30,049
- She's not a first-time bride.
- I'm sorry to call you in,

171
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,339
but these quarterly
balance sheets are due Monday.

172
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:34,481
- They can't wait.
- Another set of layoffs?

173
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,846
There's... There's over
a dozen people on this.

174
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,335
Good thing
you called in the cavalry.

175
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,767
- Blood stain?
- Breakfast.

176
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,398
Time's a-wasting.

177
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,247
Wouldn't want you to miss
your beautiful wedding.

178
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,604
See, I knew she was gonna say that.

179
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,466
You have to believe me.
I've done this before.

180
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:54,339
Carter, no more advice.
This is gonna take hours.

181
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,783
If we don't start now,
I'm gonna be late to my own wedding.

182
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,207
Guys.

183
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,645
Carter.

184
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,625
- Bar fight?
- No. I got a problem.

185
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:09,214
All right, Carter, look,
do what you have to do.

186
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,563
Just, please,
don't be late for the wedding.

187
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,963
- Don't forget the necklace.
- This isn't about the necklace.

188
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,839
- Something's wrong with today.
- You walking Allie down the aisle?

189
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,638
This isn't about the wedding or
whether or not I think it's a mistake.

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,544
- Now it's a mistake.
- Yeah...

191
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,893
we're supervising
an important delivery here, so...

192
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,063
Yeah, you know, so why don't
I just do it myself?

193
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:29,840
Carter, we're getting married.

194
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,519
- She said "Yes".
- No, I know. I felt it.

195
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:35,405
I mean, I was there the first time...
Second ti... The first second time.

196
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,965
- What is wrong with you?
- This isn't about the wedding.

197
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,535
This is about time repeating.

198
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,838
I mean, can it happen? A time loop...
The same day over and over?

199
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,165
No. Time flows in one direction.

200
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:49,648
If time were to fold back upon itself,
it would affect causality.

201
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:52,088
It would delete us
from the time-space continuum.

202
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:58,609
It's Allie's big day.

203
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,848
- Don't screw it up.
- All right.

204
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,476
The last time I had Moo Goo Gal Pan,
I was in a hut in Canton.

205
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:07,854
So I thought we were gonna get
to meet the future Mr. Lexi.

206
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,339
Oh, he had visa troubles.

207
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:13,089
Duncan is her gorgeous Dr. Who.

208
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,153
Oh, my God!
I love that show!

209
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:18,364
Oh, no, World Health Organization.
He's an immunologist.

210
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,616
I knew that.

211
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,418
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

212
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:27,123
You see me sleepwalking last night
or talking, anything odd?

213
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:31,021
- Nice to see you, too, Monkey.
- Don't... don't call me that.

214
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:34,171
He's just nervous about the wedding.

215
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:36,401
No, I'm not.
And don't call me that.

216
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,210
Can I get two banana milkshakes?

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,469
- Bananas calm Monkey down.
- Coming right up.

218
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:45,341
There have been documented cases
of repetitive cognizance brought on

219
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:49,300
by extreme psychophobia
of a certain upcoming event.

220
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,856
- So tell me, what's my psychophobia?
- Okay.

221
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,179
This Allison...

222
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,526
You like her.
Right?

223
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,071
Can't stand the thought
of her with another guy forever.

224
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
I mean...

225
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,639
Okay, let's say...

226
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,748
- I'm conflicted.
- Have you told her?

227
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:13,166
Okay, there's your problem,
Sheriff I'm-not-a-sharer.

228
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:16,460
So I'm stuck in this day
until I tell her how I feel?

229
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,425
You can't just tell her.
You have to kiss her.

230
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,113
It's the only way to know,
on a truly cellular level,

231
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,305
if your energies
are meant to combine.

232
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:28,211
There's a science to this love stuff,
but why start taking my advice now?

233
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:32,261
Honestly, because you are
the only one who believes me.

234
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:34,269
That's what family's for.

235
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,525
Carter, you can't go in there.

236
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:51,540
Carter, you're early.

237
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,793
- Yeah, and you're...
- Not ready.

238
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,397
Are you okay?
You look pale.

239
00:13:58,517 --> 00:13:59,517
I'm not...

240
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:03,177
a sharer.

241
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:07,831
Hey...

242
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,394
What is it?

243
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,196
So you thought
that coming here and doing that

244
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,557
right before the wedding,
that that's a good idea.

245
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:26,377
No.

246
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,577
My sister did.

247
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:32,335
Look, I'm not gonna deny that...
that, you know, maybe...

248
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,500
Look, it just...
It didn't work out that way.

249
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,704
I love Nathan.

250
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,046
We have a history.

251
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:42,656
- And you and I could've had a future.
- You'll always be my friend...

252
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:44,907
My true friend.

253
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,325
I'll always be here for you.

254
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,392
You know that, right?

255
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:52,510
I mean, no matter what.

256
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,687
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

257
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:59,441
And now, before you share your vows,

258
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,567
if there is anyone here

259
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,946
who knows why these two
should not be joined together,

260
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,382
speak now,

261
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,993
or forever hold your peace.

262
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,203
<i>I sense a high level
of adrenaline in your system.</i>

263
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,948
<i>Is something bothering you today?</i>

264
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,521
I think today is yesterday...

265
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,131
Again.

266
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:38,487
- Saturday again.
- Again?

267
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:42,109
Allison called. What kind of bride
works the morning of her wedding?

268
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,123
Sarah made eggs.
I know you like the bottle.

269
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,112
Not today.

270
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,865
- You didn't shave.
- Safety precaution.

271
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,483
You are freaked out
about the wedding.

272
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:52,609
You're right.
And I'm totally self-aware.

273
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:54,705
You and I should talk more
now that you're 17.

274
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,798
But I gotta check out
a theory I came up with.

275
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,201
- In the bathroom?
- You'd be surprised what happens there.

276
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:02,921
Aunt Lex is coming today with two cats
that should go to the guest room.

277
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,634
And get to know the Tabby, you might
be related. I'll see you at the wedding.

278
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:09,428
Got to go stop time.
And drinking age is 21.

279
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,391
Supervising an important delivery?

280
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,313
- Time-sensitive, Fargo?
- Yeah, I guess you could say that.

281
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,711
Could you say it's a device
that could've created

282
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,921
a time loop I've been living in
for the last 3 days?

283
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,391
Fargo, tell him what it is.

284
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,448
It's our new sub-femtosecond
atomic clock that'll make GD

285
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,867
the constant for time
in all the known universe.

286
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,046
- Those Swiss guys are really fuming.
- And today's the day you plug it in.

287
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,874
It runs on unstable
plutonium neutrons, not AC.

288
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,958
Isn't that unstable?

289
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,497
Of course, 'cause if they were stable,
they would split during...

290
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,413
- Why am I explaining this?
- Don't ask why.

291
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,093
Don't take that thing out of
its container until after your wedding.

292
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,152
Okay, we'll trust your gut
and miss our only sync window

293
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:53,388
between now and 2036.

294
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,599
- Not!
- We're ready to move.

295
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,051
Don't do this.

296
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:00,294
We're all stuck in some weird time thing
where things keep repeating.

297
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:02,439
Yeah, and only you remember it.

298
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:05,609
Carter, this is
a very important project.

299
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,151
Don't screw it up.

300
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,121
Allison's director of operations.

301
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,169
Why don't you ask her
to cancel synchronization?

302
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,389
Well, because you'd still
have to approve.

303
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,542
And I won't.

304
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:18,370
This clock gives GD
universal ownership of time.

305
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,608
I know. I know.
And the Swiss are fuming.

306
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:24,232
But if you plug this thing in, we'll be
doomed to repeat this day forever.

307
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,796
The happiest day of my life?

308
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,339
Sorry I had to call you in,
but quarterly balance sheets...

309
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,980
Quarterly balance...
Forget it.

310
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,201
If we don't stop it from turning on,
you'll have the rest of eternity

311
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,679
to redact those 20 people.

312
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:37,733
- You said a few nonessentials.
- Time's a-wasting.

313
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:40,143
Don't want you to miss
your beautiful wedding.

314
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,233
- You should've invited her.
- Carter, what is wrong with you?

315
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:48,550
Nothing.
Nothing you'll remember.

316
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,736
We just need to stop
that new clock.

317
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,169
You're making me nervous.
I just want to get through this.

318
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,796
Well, you won't.
We're gonna do this again and again,

319
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,910
unless right before 6:00,
I unplug that clock.

320
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,863
And then this horrible day
will be over.

321
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,830
I know you think
that I'm making a mistake.

322
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,151
And I am touched

323
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:07,483
- that you care so much about me.
- Of course I...

324
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:09,798
Look, I just need you
to be there for me today.

325
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,259
Well, I'll always be there for you.

326
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:18,473
And...
If I am late tonight,

327
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:22,614
just know that I was fixing
something that's broken.

328
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,230
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

329
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,380
So, 6:00 pm?
That's when this thing goes off?

330
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,133
That's when the official switchover
from greenwich happens.

331
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:56,011
But now it is time to get married.

332
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,018
In some cultures,
teenagers are guided

333
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:13,134
through mind-altering experiences
by trustworthy elders

334
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,523
to expand their consciousness.

335
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,908
Well, in this culture,
the drinking age is 21.

336
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,203
The French give their children
wine with dinner.

337
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,289
Yeah, dad's never been to France.

338
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:27,046
If we're late to the wedding,
I wonder who'll kill us first,

339
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,885
Dr. Stark or Dr. Blake.

340
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:33,262
Well, nothing matters now, but...

341
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:36,384
Unplugging this unstable
plutonium thing.

342
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:39,304
I thought you said we were here to take
emergency readouts for Thorne.

343
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,530
I lied.

344
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,308
- Turn it off.
- No.

345
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,104
- Now.
- What is wrong with you?

346
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,284
Easy way or hard way, Fargo.
We don't have much time.

347
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,276
Apparently we don't have
much sanity either.

348
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:54,736
I'm not crazy.

349
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,863
Says the guy
with crazy eyes and a gun.

350
00:19:57,023 --> 00:20:00,049
This will all make sense
once we stop the time loop.

351
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,329
Which one is it, Fargo?

352
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,708
So much for my career.

353
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,008
There really was a plug?

354
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,472
For the vacuum seal.

355
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,345
Now that it's broken, so is the clock.

356
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,077
And all the plutonium?

357
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:23,576
Yeah, it's safe.

358
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,018
Let's get married.

359
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,437
The past is your present.

360
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:31,856
And your present will...

361
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:36,277
The present will become your future.

362
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,160
Sorry.

363
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,381
That is what love is...

364
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:01,928
Never ending.

365
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:04,472
Now, before you share
your vows...

366
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:23,987
<i>I sense an abnormal level
of adrenaline in your system.</i>

367
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:27,202
That's because things
keep bleeding through.

368
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,336
- Guys.
- Carter. Bar fight?

369
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,129
Actually,

370
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,507
the flow of time is changing.

371
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,823
This cut isn't from shaving.
I carried it through a time loop

372
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,655
that keeps affecting,

373
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,182
something you said
I don't remember,

374
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,186
and maybe deleting us
from the universe.

375
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,939
- So just listen, and don't call me...
- Crazy?

376
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:57,889
- That's not listening.
- I heard you, but do you really think

377
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,862
there's a possibility that there's
a break in the space/time continuum,

378
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:04,656
and I don't know about it, but...
you do?

379
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,618
Does your ego
even fit in this building?

380
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,890
How many times
do I have to go through this...

381
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:16,387
Before I realize
that you can't change someone's mind?

382
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:20,464
New tactic.
GD has a volcano guy,

383
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,717
a drone guy, even a poop guy.

384
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:25,393
Who is the time guy?

385
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:26,971
Weinbrenner.

386
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:30,016
Carter, you do what you have to do,
but, please,

387
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:33,144
don't be late for the wedding,
and don't forget the necklace.

388
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,074
Wait.

389
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:39,241
Leo Weinbrenner?

390
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,242
The maintenance guy?

391
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:43,446
That would be time maintenance.

392
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,471
All right.
Okay... I gotta go.

393
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:52,619
Carter, I just left you a message.
Thorne called me in.

394
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,831
Yeah, I know.

395
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,066
She's gonna ask you
to redact some more people.

396
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,547
- Figured you could use the help.
- Oh, not more layoffs.

397
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,343
What happened to your face?

398
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,674
It's a long story
I don't think you'll believe.

399
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,058
Can we have a private moment?
Can I talk to you?

400
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,469
I wanna talk to you...

401
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,638
about something you told me once,

402
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,853
- and I think it's... Important.
- <i>Leo Weinbrenner.</i>

403
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,774
Leo. One second.

404
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,031
- Sorry.
- No. Go ahead.

405
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,195
Thanks.

406
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,908
You're in charge of time, right?
The guy in the basement?

407
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,552
- Was, until today.
- Right...

408
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:34,956
I've been repeating
the same day over and over.

409
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,422
I mean, is it possible?
Can time just loop around like that?

410
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,753
You're asking the wrong guy.
I just oil the gears.

411
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,758
Is there any reason why
Thorne would wanna get rid of you today,

412
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,801
so that you wouldn't help us,

413
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:50,290
so that you couldn't discover it?

414
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,931
I wouldn't put anything past her.

415
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:56,074
She's up to something with that clock.
Don't know what, but it can't be good.

416
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,103
Nothing that woman does is good.

417
00:23:58,454 --> 00:23:59,605
Anyhow, I'll...

418
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:03,062
sign those redaction papers
whenever you bring them by.

419
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,074
I'll need all the calibrated equipment
in a truck by 5:00 at the latest.

420
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:11,073
There's a time factor here,
and I don't wanna miss my window.

421
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,850
Sheriff, eavesdropping
is a very nasty habit.

422
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,682
No, I'm just checking in,

423
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:18,832
seeing if there's
anything I can do for you today.

424
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:21,251
- As a matter of fact...
- Oh, redactions! Oh, boy!

425
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:23,692
I love a good culling of the herd.
Leo Weinbrenner...

426
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,730
Any particular reason
you're getting rid of him?

427
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,300
Dr. Stark is installing
a new clock that performs

428
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,260
the same functions as Weinbrenner does,
without requiring health care.

429
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:34,751
Sub-femtosecond?
I bet the Swiss are fuming.

430
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,322
I was wondering if you wanted to be
my date to the wedding.

431
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,924
- I can pick you up around 5:00.
- No, thanks.

432
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:42,583
I think you heard
 I've got something important pending.

433
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,925
- Well, you'll be missed.
- No, I won't.

434
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:46,458
Speaking of work...

435
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,422
Sorry I had to call you in.

436
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,656
Quarterly balance sheets are due...

437
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:53,450
On Monday.
And this can't wait.

438
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,954
Sheriff, make sure she doesn't
miss her beautiful wedding.

439
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,117
- What's that about?
- You should've invited her.

440
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,683
I mean, he's your gorgeous Dr. WHO.

441
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,647
Oh, my God. I love that show.

442
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,822
World Health Organization.
He's an immunologist.

443
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,724
Oh, no, I knew that.

444
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:19,393
Duncan's work
is everything to him.

445
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:22,354
I can't ask him to give it all up
and move here just for me.

446
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:23,897
It's not just for you.

447
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,550
I didn't tell him, Zoe.

448
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,133
I want someone to be with me for...

449
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:31,529
the right reasons,
not the responsible ones.

450
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,532
Speaking of responsible ones...

451
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,177
Hey, Dad, look who's here!

452
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,799
Three days early.

453
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,956
Cats in the guest room.
You look terrific.

454
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:43,542
Has anyone seen Henry?
He's not answering his phone.

455
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,753
- Aunt Lexi wants to stay for a while.
- Great.

456
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,506
I got a big problem now.
And I really need to contact Henry.

457
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,676
Zoe, it's OK.
He doesn't have time for me.

458
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:55,064
Oh, come on, Lex.

459
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,472
You go away for six years,
and I'm the bad guy?

460
00:25:57,632 --> 00:25:59,349
- I was working.
- I am working.

461
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,522
Look, once things return to normal,

462
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:07,868
we can sit down.
We can have a nice long conversation.

463
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:09,359
So you can give me that speech

464
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,821
about how I need stability and I need
to settle down and get a real life.

465
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:14,499
I don't know. Maybe.

466
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,908
I guess my mistake
was thinking I could do that here.

467
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:21,624
Way to go, Dad.

468
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:23,749
Honey, she's been doing this
her whole life.

469
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:26,376
She lives by whims and then
makes everyone else's life crazy.

470
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:28,336
Aunt Lexi's pregnant.

471
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:32,257
She came to us for help
because that's what family's for.

472
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:39,898
I'll fix it.

473
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,487
Something big down there, huh?

474
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:50,174
Seems...

475
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,151
- complicated.
- It's very complicated, Sheriff.

476
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:57,157
Would it have anything to do
with why you fired Weinbrenner today?

477
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,134
Is it a coincidence
you fire him the same day

478
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:02,234
that you have something secretive
to do out here with all this...

479
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,247
well-calibrated equipment?

480
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:05,986
Say what's on your mind, Sheriff.

481
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:09,044
Everyone in town is at this sweet,
little wedding

482
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:10,728
except you.

483
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,256
And you're out here
manipulating time,

484
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,991
making us repeat
the same day over and over,

485
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:18,094
and you don't know
how dangerous that is.

486
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:20,473
- You're wrong, Sheriff.
- Maybe.

487
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:23,250
Mind if I see that?

488
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:24,893
Not at all.

489
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:30,141
What do I press to send
myself back to the shower?

490
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:45,337
<i>I'm sensing broken bones, lacerations,
and contusions.</i>

491
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:48,149
<i>Shall I call 911?</i>

492
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,392
I don't know.

493
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:55,215
Only if they can fix a hole
in the universe.

494
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:57,684
Sit down.

495
00:27:58,246 --> 00:27:59,511
So you say you...

496
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,364
You came through with this?

497
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,890
Yeah, it's what Thorne used
to create the time loop.

498
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,361
No, this device
is not a time-control device.

499
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:09,187
This device is a geological
depth finder...

500
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:10,605
An MRI for rocks.

501
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:13,149
As a matter of fact,
why don't we see what she was up to?

502
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,843
She was manipulating time,

503
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:17,570
probably using that clock
that Stark just hooked up.

504
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,117
No, these are spatial measurements,
compartments deep in rock and man-made.

505
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:25,161
Okay, then, Weinbrenner...
She fired him so he wouldn't stop her.

506
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:28,415
- You know him?
- We worked at Nasa.

507
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,619
He was a temporal physicist
who was working on the EPR paradox.

508
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:35,422
Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen.
Anyway, he had this theory

509
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:38,133
about bending light to alter time,
which he almost got to work.

510
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:40,511
He lied to me.

511
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,552
He made me think it was Thorne
who was behind it.

512
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,694
It wasn't Thorne.
It was him.

513
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:48,939
Jack, bending time is impossible.

514
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,647
He knew he was redacted
before Thorne even told Allison.

515
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:02,283
I guess redaction
starts pretty early around here.

516
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:04,736
See, Leo, that's the problem.

517
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:08,495
It is too early,
and Thorne hasn't laid anyone off yet.

518
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,216
So...

519
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:13,418
How could you know that?

520
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:16,724
I knew you were on to me
the last time through.

521
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,799
Why didn't you say something?

522
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,140
I was afraid you'd shut me down.

523
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,429
Then I'd never have a chance to fix it.

524
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,431
Tell me what you did.

525
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:28,995
Ultra indigo...

526
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,644
It's the closest light frequency
to pure black.

527
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,588
Strictly theoretical,

528
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,148
until now.

529
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,615
Oh, my God.

530
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:47,829
What is this?

531
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:49,918
Perfectly harmless...

532
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:52,354
Exactly what Einstein theorized.

533
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:56,127
Am I getting radiation poisoning
right now?

534
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,380
No.

535
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,051
See, any particle
that reflects ultra indigo

536
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:05,259
won't move along
with the normal spectrum.

537
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:08,014
So this indigo stuff
created the time loop?

538
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:08,901
Nope.

539
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,080
That's...

540
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,550
what this particle decelerator is for.

541
00:30:13,982 --> 00:30:14,682
Okay.

542
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:15,711
I'm lost.

543
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,624
I made one photon of light

544
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:20,922
travel slower than the speed
of normal light.

545
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:25,031
Its reflection caused a chain reaction
that made all light travel slower

546
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,052
back to an exact point in time

547
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,618
that I chose.

548
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,204
So you made time flow backwards?

549
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,958
Yeah, only something bathed
in ultra indigo wouldn't be affected.

550
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:38,262
So...

551
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,505
That... The morning
when I came into your lab...

552
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:42,381
I was sending the photon back.

553
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,551
I stood in the ultra indigo field
so that

554
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,596
I would stay the same while the universe
traveled backward around me.

555
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:50,890
But the light must've hit you, too,

556
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,767
and trapped you in this day with me.

557
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,811
I'm so sorry.

558
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:56,872
Sor...

559
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:58,767
Look, just...

560
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:00,805
make it go forwards again.

561
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:02,152
Reset the...

562
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,700
photon thingy.

563
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:07,723
What do you think I've been working on
in here every day?

564
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:11,545
- And it just keeps getting worse.
- You don't know how to reverse it?

565
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,595
Isn't that like jumping out of a plane,
trying to invent a parachute

566
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:18,084
- before you hit the ground?
- Look, I had to. I was being redacted.

567
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,962
Thorne made it very clear
I had to vacate the premises by 6:00 pm.

568
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:23,500
She didn't care how close I was.

569
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:25,174
So, Leo,

570
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,685
is this time loop

571
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,261
permanent?

572
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:31,215
Just until I figure out how
to get things back to normal.

573
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:33,766
But I gave myself
all the time in the world...

574
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,434
ten hours at a time.

575
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,813
Or until the time wave
that split the sky and broke my ribs

576
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:41,011
deletes everything in the universe.

577
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:42,900
I didn't expect that to happen.

578
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,942
I'm working as fast as I can.

579
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,276
Okay.

580
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,913
And you can do that with...

581
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,225
all this?

582
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,284
Almost.

583
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,412
I've got everything down

584
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:55,859
except for the timer.

585
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,978
I haven't had time to invent it yet.

586
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:59,146
Ironic, huh?

587
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:00,813
How are you gonna...

588
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:02,712
I'm gonna use my baby, the GD clock.

589
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,298
I go in and manually connect
both devices

590
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,433
at the precise moment of synchronicity
with the time-space continuum.

591
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,703
All goes well,

592
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:13,597
I come out normal,
and time will be on its linear way.

593
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:17,547
Look, Sheriff,

594
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:19,578
if this doesn't work...

595
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,976
I'm not gonna be able to help you
the next time through.

596
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:24,984
It'll be Dr. Stark that you need.

597
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,152
Well, he'll never believe me.

598
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,563
Well, he will...

599
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,300
if I teach you this.

600
00:32:36,863 --> 00:32:38,001
Oh, dude.

601
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:51,746
The clock's calibrated to link up with
the accelerator 30 seconds from now.

602
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:54,167
<i>Sequence commencing in 30 seconds.</i>

603
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,379
We've maybe got one more time
through the loop,

604
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,642
two tops before things
start being deleted for good.

605
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:01,842
If I don't...

606
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:04,978
<i>Sequence commencing in 20 seconds.</i>

607
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,483
Just know
that I never meant any harm.

608
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:12,604
- You'll get it right.
- <i>Sequence commencing in 10 seconds.</i>

609
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:15,451
<i>Nine... Eight... Seven...</i>

610
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,996
<i>Six... Five... Four...</i>

611
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:21,206
<i>Three... Two...</i>

612
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,111
<i>One... Zero...</i>

613
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:32,331
Leo.

614
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,152
No! No!

615
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,759
One more chance.

616
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,366
Weinbrenner died trying
to reaccelerate time.

617
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:57,783
Carter, you're crazy.
Fargo, tell him why he's crazy.

618
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,399
Hold on. All right...

619
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:05,000
<i>"t" times the square
of one minus "v" squared</i>

620
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:08,342
over "c" squared
where "v" is greater than "z"

621
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:10,547
Wait a minute.
Where "v" is greater than "c."

622
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:15,608
Yeah, greater.

623
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:18,525
Yeah, yeah, that's the formula
for breaking the light-speed barrier.

624
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:21,516
- Where'd you learn it?
- Hey, we have a problem.

625
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:24,978
Leo Weinbrenner's charred body
was found in the time maintenance room.

626
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,890
- Henry's coming in to do an autopsy.
- Good.

627
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,976
Good, he'll know about the time loop.

628
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:32,903
Carter?

629
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:34,478
You got a second?

630
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:35,832
One sec.

631
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:38,929
What, you want me
to sing another verse?

632
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:40,951
No.

633
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:42,668
I believe you.

634
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,772
If what I'm looking at is correct,

635
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:47,942
none of us may make it
through the next time wave.

636
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:50,994
It's Allie's big day.

637
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,682
Keep this between us?

638
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:56,786
Sure.

639
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:08,397
So shouldn't you be at a...
a beauty parlor or something?

640
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:10,857
What, is it 1960, and no one told me?

641
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:15,552
There's something I wanted to...

642
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:16,722
Say to you.

643
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,200
I know...
that you love Nathan

644
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:23,861
and that you guys have...
this history.

645
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,419
And you're gonna have
a great future.

646
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,710
I think this time we just might.

647
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:32,395
But...

648
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,607
Make sure you get him
to the wedding on time.

649
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:35,590
Count on it.

650
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,092
All right.

651
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:42,430
Weinbrenner jury-rigged
the old GD clock to the accelerator.

652
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,234
Yeah, he did it manually
because he didn't have the time

653
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,768
to create a new timer.

654
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,940
I was here... Well, there.
But I was here.

655
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,985
Well, it must not have been
accurate enough.

656
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,447
No. But yours is.

657
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:03,076
The new clock, the one
that the Swiss are fuming about.

658
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:07,055
Carter, sometimes
you're smarter than you look.

659
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:10,719
Fargo, we have an important delivery
to supervise.

660
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,329
Hey, Zo.

661
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,438
She is?

662
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:24,591
Cats, yeah, just put them
in the guest room.

663
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:27,161
And if you guys
could go to Café Diem.

664
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:31,308
Yeah, I'm gonna be
a little busy later, but...

665
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:34,613
I don't want to miss
spending time with you.

666
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,210
Okay.

667
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,611
But, I mean,
he's your gorgeous Dr. WHO.

668
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,367
Oh, my God. I love that show.

669
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,489
No, World Health Organization.

670
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:48,496
Hi, guys.

671
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:49,414
Dad,

672
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,612
- What happened to your face?
- No, I'm... I'm all right.

673
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,503
Duncan is an immunologist.

674
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:59,277
He and Lex have spent the last six years
traveling around doing...

675
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:00,708
good things.

676
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:02,154
No, I knew that.

677
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,208
Here I thought
you never read my letters.

678
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:05,028
Nah.

679
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:07,265
What happened?
Did you crash your big wheel again?

680
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,459
Nice.

681
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,518
I missed you, Monkey.

682
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:12,979
I missed you, too, Stretch.

683
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,398
You haven't called me that
since I was 12 years old.

684
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:18,568
- You used to hate it.
- Because I was this tall in 7th grade.

685
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:19,919
Well, fair enough.

686
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:23,031
You know,
I'm... I'm glad you came early.

687
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,867
It's good to be able
to see you before...

688
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:27,242
Before what?

689
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,454
- Before the wedding.
- I love weddings.

690
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,652
They're final yet festive,
like funerals with champagne.

691
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:37,312
I got something to take care of.
Just thought I'd come by and say...

692
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:40,924
that I love you guys.

693
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,136
Since when have you become
this self-aware?

694
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,639
I can learn.
It just takes me a few tries.

695
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:48,956
And,

696
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,769
- you guys helped.
- Well, that's what family's for.

697
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:55,124
Yeah.

698
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:57,286
It is.

699
00:37:57,865 --> 00:37:58,959
Oh, just...

700
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:01,529
ditch grandma Lil for me.

701
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:07,245
If none of this is true, we accelerate
a photon beyond the speed of light,

702
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:10,068
and it ends up creating a time hole
and destroying the universe?

703
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,993
We have two choices, Fargo.

704
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:13,832
Either we trust Carter, or we don't.

705
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,604
Guys, we close?

706
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:18,169
Yeah, this new clock should
sync up with the accelerator,

707
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:19,669
theoretically.

708
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:23,493
I did what I could to shore up the seal,
but it's not meant for this kind of use.

709
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,592
All right.

710
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:26,594
It's almost 6:00.

711
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,012
All right, Fargo.

712
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,322
Start her up.

713
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,807
If the seal holds,

714
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,434
we accelerate the photon,
and time gets back to normal.

715
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,745
What happened?

716
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:55,415
We lost the seal.
We can't sync the clock. What do we do?

717
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:56,874
We do it manually.

718
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,211
From the inside?
Like what Weinbrenner tried?

719
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,754
We got less than 60 seconds.

720
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,526
I'll do it.
Tell me what I need to know.

721
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,884
I can't teach you a song
for this one, Carter.

722
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,994
It's a little too complicated.

723
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,724
But not for me.

724
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:12,873
I know how.

725
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:14,884
I'll do it.

726
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,021
I always knew you had it in you, Fargo.

727
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,326
I didn't.

728
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:24,845
But I helped build this thing,
and we only got one shot.

729
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,381
Go sync me up, okay?

730
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:36,016
Are you sure?

731
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,125
What about Allie?
What if you can't...

732
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:40,535
Of course I can.

733
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,795
My ego's bigger
than the building, remember?

734
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:44,161
30 seconds.

735
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,266
You got the necklace, right?

736
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:48,885
Yeah, I do.

737
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,782
Well, make sure she gets it

738
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,604
and that she knows I did this for her.

739
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:00,963
And take care of her, Carter.

740
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:02,709
She'll need you.

741
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:05,860
Dr. Stark.

742
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:08,416
Keep pushing buttons, Fargo.

743
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,881
<i>Sequence commencing in 20 seconds.</i>

744
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:23,234
<i>Sequence commencing in 10 seconds.</i>

745
00:40:23,683 --> 00:40:25,421
I'll see you around, Jack.

746
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:27,256
<i>Seven... Six...</i>

747
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:30,968
<i>Five... Four... Three...</i>

748
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,668
<i>Two... One... Zero...</i>

749
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,046
He did it! You did it!
We're moving forward!

750
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,225
Yeah...

751
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:14,968
We are.

752
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:16,336
He's gone.

753
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:20,267
He's really gone.

754
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:33,663
I can't have any because of baby Carter,
but don't let that stop you.

755
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,233
You know, the French give
their children wine with dinner.

756
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:44,123
Dad?

757
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:54,804
You're late.

758
00:41:54,924 --> 00:41:56,274
Oh, what happened?

759
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:03,016
Hey.

760
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,630
You ready?

761
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:09,179
Momentous, huh?

762
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:10,845
Yeah.

763
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,364
I'll always be here for you.

764
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:18,070
You know that, right?

765
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,887
No matter what.

766
00:42:20,732 --> 00:42:22,482
Are you okay? You look...

767
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:23,658
pale.

768
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:28,646
Carter.

769
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,595
Where's Nathan?
