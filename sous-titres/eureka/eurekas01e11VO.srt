1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,840
previously on eureka:

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,830
all this secrecy isn't healthy.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,860
I suggest instead you start talking to each other.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,650
I thought I would give you a few issues to discuss.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,930
Allison blake.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,560
Oh,crap.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,750
-You're a dead woman. 
-I'm all yours,princess.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,210
Like your problem with carter is strictly professional.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,500
I hate the way he looks at you.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,820
Oh--I don't look at her.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,450
-Oh,please!Like a shark eyeing chum. -Really?

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,760
Am I supposed to ignore that mayberry's hitting on my wife?

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,690
Soon to be ex.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,020
You do realize I'm standing right here.

15
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,040
Don't the two of you ever get tired of bickering?

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,830
-No. 
-Not really.

17
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,550
All anyone around here does is feed on me.

18
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,580
It's time for me to leave eureka.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,400
Yeah.I hope so

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
Don't say anything.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,410
In fact,

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,950
you have the right to remain silent.

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,100
Anything you say can--

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,700
carter! What are you doing?

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,450
My job,and you're welcome.

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,840
Can and will be used against you in a court of law.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,350
And he was doing his job.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,460
Working on a classified project.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,530
Excuse me.Which was what, to atomize your facility?

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,340
-A little help,allison? 
-I'm sorry,carter.

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,070
Technically,he hasn't broken any laws.

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,490
Un-cuff him,sheriff.

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,850
Fine.

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,270
You know what? Here. Do it yourself,

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,760
and the next time one of your brainiacs tries to blow up your building,

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,740
don't think I'm gonna stop him.

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,080
In fact,I might help.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,590
S.A.R.A.H., Uh,beer.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,590
-Nice hair. 
-Thanks.

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,580
I've been working on it all night.

41
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,660
Shouldn't you be at school?

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,180
Shouldn't you be at work?

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,820
Nope. Got a sick day.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,930
Your vital signs seem normal,sheriff.

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,550
I don't detect that you're sick.

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,030
But i am sick.

47
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm sick of saving a man that I can't stand.

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,260
I'm sick of nobody saying "thank you,"

49
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,580
and I'm sick of this ridiculous town and everyone in it.

50
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,220
Well,aren't you in a mood.

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
S.A.R.A.H.,Fill it.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,690
Breakfast of champions.

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,630
Go to school already. You're ruining my sick day.

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,860
Okay,what is this about? This isn't just about you being pissed at stark.

55
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,200
Mmm--I don't even want to hear that name.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,870
So,that's a new house rule.

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,050
And,um,fyi, last night's catastrophe

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,800
gave me some clarity.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,150
About...?

60
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,510
I think henry's got the right idea.

61
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,530
You know? Gettin' while the gettin's good.

62
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,080
Dad. Are you serious?

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,510
You know what's gonna happen to this town when he leaves?

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,650
He's the glue,and I'm the one who's gonna have to pick up all the pieces.

65
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,680
So...I don't know.

66
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,460
I think he should stay.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,920
Is that what this is really about?

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,060
Henry leaving?

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,940
Go on.

70
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,950
You're going to be late for school.

71
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,470
Is it okay to leave you alone?

72
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,060
-Uh,no. 
-Yep.

73
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,140
I'm gonna be fine.

74
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,610
And I'm sick. Until further notice.

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,750
Ah,S.A.R.A.H.,

76
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,510
I need you to do a property search for baja.

77
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,300
Are you planning a vacation?

78
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,110
Yep. Maybe a permanent one.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,860
Any plans today? Perhaps a shower?

80
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,430
Uh,I do that every day, and today is...

81
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,400
Another sick day?

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,490
Bingo!

83
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,820
So,uh,let's go bottom left--enlarge.

84
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh,that's a nice house. That suits me.

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,160
The new me.

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,390
Projected models of rising sea-levels

87
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,880
and coastal erosion suggest this property

88
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,310
to be a bad investment.

89
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,760
All right,how about the upper right?

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,540
A lawless border town with the highest

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,820
per-capita crime rate in mexico.

92
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,660
Criminals are rarely apprehended or prosecuted.

93
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,740
Ah,sounds familiar.

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,730
Okay,uh,let's try canc

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,720
You're mine.

96
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,390
Oh,crud.

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,400
In your face.

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Three rounds to none.

99
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,180
We never discussed grenades.

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,530
War is hell,

101
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,940
my defeated foe.

102
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,420
911. Gotta fly.

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,750
Uh,jo.

104
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,060
You,uh...

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,550
you dropped a clip.

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,630
Not cool.

107
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,140
My pager went off.

108
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,680
Mine too.

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,100
War is hell.

110
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,480
Thank you.

111
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,400
Since you won't shower, shall I mist you with vanilla?

112
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,610
No.

113
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,220
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.

114
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,570
Meaty-meat with extra meat?

115
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,610
And triple cheese.

116
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,980
Nice. Bring that bad boy over here.

117
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,170
Thank you.

118
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,860
Uh,money's right over there.

119
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,760
I fail to see the wisdom of consuming

120
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,580
pizza after cereal and beer.

121
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,190
Would you stop nagging me,woman?

122
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,240
Dude,is that your wife?

123
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,250
It might as well be, yeah.

124
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,870
What's this?

125
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,520
It's a hockey stick.

126
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,450
No--it's,uh--the dodgers. World series.

127
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm more of a sudoku kind of guy.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,320
Hey,can I use your can?

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,690
Uh,sure,yeah. Just over there.

130
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,190
Cool.

131
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,050
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.

132
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,220
Okay,I'm here.

133
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,760
Yeah,you are.

134
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,200
-You paged me. 
-No,I didn'T.

135
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,960
You said it was urgent. Possibly classified.

136
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,820
Sheriff,I got here as quickly as I could.

137
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,700
Okay...why?

138
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,710
You're depressed.

139
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,490
I'm not depressed.

140
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,240
"come quick. Very depressed. Carter."

141
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,130
S.A.R.A.H.,I know I asked you to install a doorbell,

142
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,920
but just disconnect it.

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,250
Do you know your phone isn't working?

144
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,720
-what's up? 
-hello,sheriff.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,460
Let me guess, I--I paged all of you?

146
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,200
-Well,we know. 
-Yeah,no,you don't,'cause I didn'T.

147
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,250
Well,if you didn't, who did?

148
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,710
-Beats me. 
-Love to.

149
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,760
Hey,buddy.

150
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,070
You got a plunger?

151
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,930
Oh...just get out. All of you.

152
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,640
I just wanna spend the day on the couch,

153
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,750
and it's obviously a prank,so...

154
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,220
S.A.R.A.H.,Door.

155
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm sorry,jack.

156
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm afraid I can't do that.

157
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,030
Why not?

158
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,860
Because eureka is facing imminent disaster.

159
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,620
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font>

160
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,950
<font color="#ffff00">sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font>

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,110
S.A.R.A.H.,What imminent disaster?

162
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,260
Is it a hurricane? An earthquake?

163
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,540
Disharmony.

164
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,120
The threads of human congruity are unraveling.

165
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,170
It has already led to

166
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,950
dr. Deacon's decision to leave eureka.

167
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,760
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,890
S.A.R.A.H.,Henry leaving eureka

169
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,000
doesn't mean we're facing imminent disaster.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,940
I mean,no offense, henry.

171
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,210
No offense taken.

172
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,540
My projected models suggest that each person

173
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,360
in this room plays a vital role

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,590
in securing eureka's future or negating it.

175
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,080
Wait.

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,800
You paged us?

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,670
You left me no choice.

178
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,870
There is a high probability

179
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,370
that dr. Deacon's decision to relocate

180
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,500
will precipitate a series of catastrophic events,

181
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,690
beginning with the fact that sheriff carter

182
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,410
has begun to question his commitment to eureka as well.

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,130
No,he hasn'T.

184
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,650
It was a fantasy!

185
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,970
It's a really good fantasy.

186
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,650
Yeah.

187
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,370
According to my projections,

188
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,210
if interpersonal conflicts cause both men to leave,

189
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,910
the outcome is disaster,

190
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,940
and each of you will share responsibility for that.

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
his cell phone's not working.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,260
And you're speeding.

193
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,580
you saw carter's page. It's an emergency.

194
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,210
And I don't want to be the emergency,

195
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,960
so keep it under 60.

196
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,440
You sound like me mam.

197
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,370
"Keep it under 60, keep it under 60."No,I don'T.

198
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,920
You do!

199
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,250
I can't get out,so I assume no one else can either.

200
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,040
-Games still work. -No.

201
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,590
S.A.R.A.H.,I think maybe you're reading too much into this.

202
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,970
We are not in conflict.

203
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,590
Really?

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,340
Henry,no community's always in perfect harmony.

205
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,440
Issues come up living in a small town,

206
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
working closely together.

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,490
-Too small. 
-Too closely.

208
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,650
What are you implying?

209
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,910
What are you inferring?

210
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,390
Maybe she's implying

211
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,600
what S.A.R.A.H.'S inferring,

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,630
that this might be an opportunity to clear the air.

213
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,670
I think more air's been cleared recently than anyone ever wanted.

214
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,120
Don't you?

215
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,460
I think we all said and did things we regret

216
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,950
under the influence of that pollen.

217
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,950
Yes,but no one else broadcast everyone else's secrets

218
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,480
to the entire town.

219
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,550
You're right,and I've already apologized for that.

220
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,640
I know that,I just--

221
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,440
I need some water.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,220
yeah.

223
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,360
No conflict here.

224
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,720
All right, this has been fun.

225
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,380
Fargo,where's the back door?

226
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,200
-There's a back door? 
-Not that I've found.

227
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,140
No,no,no. A hacking back door.

228
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,050
A hidden code programmed in the computer allowing access to its brain.

229
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,030
Fargo,please,tell me you laid in a back door.

230
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,870
I'd really,really like to.

231
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,360
Sometimes your lack of foresight is astonishing.

232
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,980
But the intention is... admirable.

233
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,790
There's got to be another way out of here.

234
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,070
It's a waste of time.

235
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,560
Tell him,fargo.

236
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,940
I'm not telling him that. I'm in enough trouble.

237
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,090
Well,then tell him to make my bed

238
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,890
while he's up there-- he might as well do somethingproductive.

239
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,330
-Hey,what's this? -Nothing.

240
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,370
Gotta go. Carter needs us.

241
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,560
You designed a paintball battle plan?

242
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,390
Give me that!

243
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,040
You are in clear violation

244
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,330
of the paintball rules of engagement.

245
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,390
Me?

246
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,050
You've got a regimen of splatterbots ready

247
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,930
to assault my rear flank.

248
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,690
You'll know when I assault your rear flank.

249
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,170
Did you tuck my sheets in real tight?

250
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,660
Henry,please, just change your mind,

251
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,500
so we can all get the hell out of here.

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,540
Yeah. And I can sit on my couch.

253
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,330
I haven't changed my mind.

254
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,890
Maybe you could just pretend?

255
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,480
Uh,I'm pretty sure that S.A.R.A.H. Can hear you guys.

256
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,770
Why are you leaving,henry?

257
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,550
Because our work has become about results instead of discovery.

258
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,310
You don't get funding for discovery

259
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,570
unless someone is producing results.

260
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,770
That's an ugly, shortsighted system.

261
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,960
I mean,fargo turns a relic of war

262
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,400
into something beautiful

263
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,850
and life-affirming and then gets chastised

264
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,800
because it's actually trying to help us avert disaster.

265
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,380
He got chastised because it's holding us hostage.

266
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,340
Fine. You know what?

267
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,540
I didn't sign up for any of this.

268
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,460
No.

269
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,000
Me neither.

270
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,430
oh,hey,S.A.R.A.H., It's jo.

271
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,820
You want to let her in?

272
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,090
Jo. Jo!

273
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,330
-Jo,we're trapped. 
-Fargo.

274
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,590
S.A.R.A.H.'S gone hal on us, get us out of here!

275
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,570
She can't hear you.

276
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,570
But I can.

277
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,220
Sheriff carter does not wish to be disturbed.

278
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,020
He's feeling ill.

279
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,250
I know,but,uh, he paged us.

280
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,450
It must have been sent in error.

281
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,050
S.A.R.A.H., Let her in.

282
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,960
I believe one of you may try to exploit

283
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,540
the opportunity to leave.

284
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,060
No,we won't,right?

285
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,830
-No,we won'T. -no,no,no.

286
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,480
-jo,we're trapped! 
-fargo.

287
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,670
S.A.R.A.H.'S gone hal on us. Get us out of here.

288
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,590
When I'm stressed,my subtext comes out as text.

289
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,880
Fargo, do you want to duct-tape shut your mouth?

290
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,350
No.

291
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,080
S.A.R.A.H.?

292
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,440
Uh,hey.

293
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,990
carter.

294
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,560
You all right?

295
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,170
You 9-1-1'd me.

296
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,080
um,yeah,false alarm.

297
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,600
Just feeling,

298
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,110
uh,really sick.

299
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,640
Then why all the company?

300
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,780
What company?

301
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,360
It's just me and uh, S.A.R.A.H.

302
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,140
You havin' some kind of party?

303
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,210
No,no,no no. No party.

304
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,240
Just,um, trying to get some rest.

305
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,880
So,thanks for checking in on me,

306
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,440
josefina.

307
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,600
okay. See you tomorrow,

308
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,590
jack.

309
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,590
Good one.

310
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,000
That's your name, josefina?

311
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,650
And a very pretty name it is too.

312
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,720
Don't call me josefina.

313
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,690
Nobody calls me josefina.

314
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,230
Why did he call me josefina?

315
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,290
I know,I know.

316
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,800
Something's wrong.

317
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,800
this house has a force field?

318
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,540
well,technically, there's no such thing.

319
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,340
It's a mono-filament electrified mesh

320
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,160
which forms a near-invisible barrier.

321
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,880
how is that not a force field?

322
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,540
why is she not responding to the sheriff?

323
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,740
-S.A.R.A.H. 
-She's unhappy.

324
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,340
No,I am unhappy.

325
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,380
You all ruined my sick day.

326
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,420
And S.A.R.A.H. Feels your pain.

327
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,540
The overriding concept behind the smart house

328
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,190
is the bond with its owner.

329
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,780
Oh,yeah?

330
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,420
Bad house!

331
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,540
Bad!

332
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,900
Sheriff,I don't see how shaming your house could possibly help.

333
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,370
Oh,no,no. Not my house.

334
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,340
Stark's house. He built it.

335
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,490
Not my house, fargo's house. He built it.

336
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,590
I didn't build it, I re-programmed it

337
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,860
and jazzed it up a little.

338
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,690
So,this is fargo's fault?

339
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,130
Yes,henry.

340
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,850
I put my faith in him. Like I put my faith in you,

341
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,730
and I'm a little disappointed with the outcome.

342
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,180
Faith goes both ways,nathan.

343
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,500
As does disappointment.

344
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,440
stop it! Can we forget whose house it is

345
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,260
and figure out how to get out of it?

346
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,640
taggart,we're like a mile away

347
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,900
from where we need to be.

348
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,780
It's the nearest access point.

349
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,490
Trust me.

350
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,670
Jo,please.

351
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,520
You're not going

352
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,980
need a hand?

353
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,860
All good.

354
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,900
Step back.

355
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,550
Careful,first step's a bitch--

356
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,510
looks like the men are trying to save us.

357
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,340
We may be here for awhile.

358
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,760
I just want to get the hell out of here.

359
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,710
Look allison, I really am sorry.

360
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,700
I just--it just takes time,you know.

361
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,230
What part exactly?

362
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,250
What do you mean?

363
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,240
I mean are you upset

364
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,300
because because I told

365
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,600
or because it's possible I was right?

366
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,920
Well,can't we just cut the power?

367
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,690
Not without cutting off the air supply

368
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,310
and locking the door for good.

369
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,170
Now we need dynamite.

370
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,410
I wish lupo were here.

371
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,220
That's it.

372
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,720
We'll just blow her up.

373
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,030
She's not here.

374
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,410
a labyrinth

375
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,070
of interconnecting tunnels

376
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,530
housing eureka's sewage system,

377
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,430
gas,electrical,plumbing,

378
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,390
fiber optics.

379
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,120
That's a lot of pipe.

380
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,580
She is a beauty.

381
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,410
More deceptive than the kelp forests of tasmania.

382
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,970
More malodorous

383
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,430
than the sulfur springs

384
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,650
of wai-o-tapu.

385
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,520
You spend a lot of time down here?

386
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,100
More than I bargained for.

387
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,180
Chased down cunning predators that escaped

388
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,380
from global dynamics.

389
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,310
Musculus berylius.

390
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,790
English?

391
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,670
Smart mice.

392
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Iqs through the roof.

393
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,830
Little varmints use vector formulas to keep me off their tracks.

394
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,130
How'd you catch them?

395
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,360
Smart cheese.

396
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,150
Though the female of the species

397
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,130
proved to be much more clever than the male.

398
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,060
Just like humans.

399
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,030
All right,you.

400
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,390
Follow my lead.

401
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,570
I believe I'm the ranking officer here.

402
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,760
You follow my lead.

403
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,770
Fair thinking.

404
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,600
Which way?

405
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,180
I know which way I would go.

406
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,160
Which way would you go?

407
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,280
Exactly the way I would've gone.

408
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,400
Okay. Hey,are you sure about this?

409
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
If we can create a power surge on one grid,

410
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,510
we may throw S.A.R.A.H. Off-line.

411
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,820
Or electrocute ourselves.

412
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,370
Everyone,watch your distance.

413
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,850
-Okay,come on. 
-what are you doing

414
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,320
And on three...

415
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,920
two...

416
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,440
...one!

417
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,630
-Yes! -The door!

418
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,770
-yes  -nice!

419
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,470
In a town full of super geniuses,

420
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,460
why is it that the pizza guy

421
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,260
is the only with the presence of mind to walk out the door?

422
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,570
S.A.R.A.H.,Have you lost your mind?

423
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,440
S.A.R.A.H.'S not here.

424
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,340
S.A.R.A.H.'S primary objective now.

425
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,210
Who the hell is that?

426
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,640
What the hell--

427
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,670
we can't hear you.

428
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,930
Oh,the partition must be soundproof.

429
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,540
-Great. What is--what is that? -I don't--

430
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,570
I am B.R.A.D.

431
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,970
Brad?

432
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,240
I hope to god fargo didn't program S.A.R.A.H.

433
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,450
On top of B.R.A.D.

434
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,580
You built S.A.R.A.H. On top of B.R.A.D.?

435
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,600
Ais are often built on top of the programming

436
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,190
of older generation ais.

437
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,440
I--I--I just figured since B.R.A.D. Was an abandoned project...

438
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,010
B.R.A.D.Was programmed as a military interrogation ai.

439
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,070
Battle-reactive automatic defense.

440
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,620
Doesn't exactly feel like he's defending us.

441
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,980
No,he has his own interpretation of defense.

442
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,550
"The best defense is a good offense."

443
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,760
B.R.A.D., Where's S.A.R.A.H.?

444
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,060
Detainees have no rights.

445
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,270
Initiating phase ii protocols

446
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,180
to achieve primary objective.

447
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,790
Remorse and reconciliation.

448
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,280
Oh,that doesn't sound good.

449
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,810
No.

450
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,290
You don't have a clue,do ya?

451
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,670
Labyrinth. Do you have a clue,josefina?

452
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,920
Sounds prettier every time I hear it.

453
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,900
You get one free pass.

454
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,530
That was it.

455
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,220
Picking up a scent.

456
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,530
Sewage?

457
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,640
Yes.

458
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,190
But mixed with the aroma

459
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,280
of highly seasoned meat.

460
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,580
Pepperoni. No.

461
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,200
Sausage.

462
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,520
Exhaust from the bunker.

463
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,660
This way.

464
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,230
Shatter-resistant.

465
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,800
shatter-resistant.

466
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,600
Why?

467
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,150
Just turn on the a/c?

468
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,700
If by a/c you mean arctic conditions,then yes.

469
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,860
Must be 100 degrees in here.

470
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,950
Hotter.

471
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,040
We're gonna die.

472
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,320
Way to be reassuring,fargo.

473
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,570
Down.

474
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,450
Oh,my god.

475
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,180
B.R.A.D.'S releasing the fire-suppression system.

476
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,140
Argonite.

477
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,970
Yeah.Which means if we don't shut it off,we suffocate.

478
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,580
Intruder alert!

479
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,100
Ah,there's my josefina.

480
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,680
O--or not.

481
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,570
Who the hell...?

482
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,260
Or what the hell?

483
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,260
with all the time I spent down here,

484
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,410
never seen sensor-cams before.

485
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,120
Must be linked to the bunker's defense system.

486
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,160
Oh,krikey! Look at them all.

487
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,880
lucky for us, we're both hunters.

488
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,700
For a moment,there, I thought we were in trouble.

489
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,630
*

490
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,370
Something funny, henry?

491
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm just appreciating the irony of our situation.

492
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,760
Which would be what?

493
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
Well,I'm leaving eureka because I'm tired of watching

494
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,410
noble ideas being turned into weapons,and here we are.

495
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,910
Here we are,at the mercy of a weapon

496
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,460
that had been turned into a noble idea.

497
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,800
Well,that's the way the system works.

498
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,690
One doesn't exist without the other.

499
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,130
Spoken like a true bureaucrat.

500
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,990
You know,I'm getting really tired of the remarks,henry.

501
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,720
Well,you won't have to put up

502
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,260
with 'em much longer,will you?

503
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,520
No,no,that's true, 'cause you're bailing out on me.

504
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,590
Of all my students,

505
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,750
you were the one

506
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,870
that had the potential

507
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,420
to do anything,

508
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,000
but you chose to do

509
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,880
the administrative shuffle.

510
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,440
Management,

511
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,850
defense contracts,

512
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,150
political glad-handing.

513
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,050
I mean,you could've furthered science!

514
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,410
In--in--in so many ways.

515
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,380
But you chose

516
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,290
to further your career.

517
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,530
How can someone with such

518
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,700
a high iq be so clueless?

519
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,140
Henry,

520
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,490
you don't get to do what you do

521
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,990
unless someone like me does what I do.

522
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,810
You think it's easy,

523
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,210
shielding you from the politics so you can work the way

524
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,830
you want to work?

525
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,250
You think I was popular bringing you to eureka,

526
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,110
in the first place?

527
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,210
I didn't ask to be brought here.

528
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,450
No. Now you're giving up.

529
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,530
You were

530
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,310
personanon grata,henry, because you didn't work well

531
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,340
within the system.

532
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,750
But I ignored that,

533
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,550
because of my respect for you

534
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,220
as a scientist and as a mentor,

535
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,050
and as a friend.

536
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,340
Idealists don't get much done without a few pragmatists

537
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,720
running interference for them.

538
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,930
So,get off your moral high horse.

539
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,000
Is the system perfect? No.

540
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,120
It's political

541
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,400
and ugly,

542
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,460
and compromising.

543
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,980
But in spite of that,

544
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,900
I feel we still do

545
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,630
more good than harm,

546
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,960
and you,of all people, should appreciate that.

547
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,250
You leave now,henry, and you're part of the problem,

548
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,470
not the solution.

549
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,360
I can't believe I survived

550
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,410
holes in time and cold war death rays

551
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,090
just to freeze to death in my own damn house,

552
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,410
er,bunker.

553
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,940
Don't say that,we're going to get out of this.

554
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,920
Sure,and then stark will step in

555
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,270
and give everybody permission to do whatever the hell they want.

556
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,990
Then it'll all start all over again.

557
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,850
Come on,carter, the whole point of eureka

558
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,570
is to push the envelope.

559
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,960
It's just

560
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,180
--the reason I do

561
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,940
I mean,the reason I chose my job

562
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,540
is to make a difference.

563
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,930
I don't think I can do that here.

564
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,930
You have made a difference to a lot of people.

565
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,470
You've made a difference to me.

566
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,790
So,are you just going to leave?

567
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,310
I don't know.

568
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,070
Well,for the record,

569
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,040
you do what's right,

570
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,630
and people admire that, and that's what makes a difference.

571
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,810
I don't want

572
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,230
other people's admiration.

573
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,290
What do you want?

574
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,210
Well,not sure if I'm ready

575
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,890
to admit what I want,

576
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,320
but,uh, in the meantime,

577
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,110
I'll settle for you

578
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,270
putting your arms around me

579
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,550
and holding on tight so I can maybe regain some sensation

580
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,890
in my lower extremities.

581
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,980
-I can do that. 
-Okay.

582
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,030
Oh,crap.

583
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,490
If I'm right,this leads directly to the smart house.

584
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,520
And if you're wrong?

585
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,390
I'll release and unending torrent of raw sewage upon us.

586
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,370
Superior species,huh?

587
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,120
There! I got it, I got it,I got it!

588
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,040
You don'T. Move.

589
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,690
Paint might lube it up.

590
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,870
You've got a better idea?

591
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,960
I do,actually. Yeah.

592
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,320
It's going to take the strength of three men.

593
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,200
I figure you're good for two.

594
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,150
Grab my butt,jo.

595
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,110
Sorry about that.

596
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,640
One...two...three!

597
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,810
Come on jo,

598
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,590
give me some weight.

599
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,640
Get ready for stinky.

600
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,150
After you.

601
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,060
No,no. Go ahead.

602
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,960
-No,you first. 
-No,really,I insist,go.

603
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,820
Beauty before brawn.

604
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,740
Oh,god! I've got to get out of this dress.

605
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,340
Fargo,please, turn around.

606
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay,sure.

607
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,220
Oh,my god!

608
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,080
Fargo,I said please don't look.

609
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,260
-You have to hug me. 
-What?

610
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,740
Trust me.

611
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,740
B.R.A.D.'S not trying to torture us.

612
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,000
It's trying to kill us.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
No,he's trying to defeat us. Come here.

614
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,770
What are you doing?

615
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,020
B.R.A.D.'S phase ii battle simulations

616
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,210
ended in either a complete annihilation

617
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,360
or unconditional surrender.

618
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,310
He just had to win.

619
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,260
Which means, you and I need to get along.

620
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,160
I--I--I was wrong,nathan, I'm sorry.

621
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,780
No,henry,I was wrong.

622
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,620
That's just wrong.

623
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,100
Fargo,what are we doing?

624
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,560
Making love,not war.

625
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,540
I'm sorry,fargo, even if we're gonna die,

626
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,280
it's never gonna happen.

627
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,160
Not literally.

628
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,120
B.R.A.D., We surrender.

629
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,890
I repeat, unconditional surrender.

630
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,070
-We're free. 
-What happened?

631
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,630
Phase ii disengages upon unconditional surrender.

632
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,500
Well-done,fargo.

633
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,780
Thanks, dr. Stark.

634
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,210
-That's it? -That's it.

635
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,460
I wish therapy were this easy.

636
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,090
Then again,if,uh,

637
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,720
everything could really be resolved with a hug

638
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,490
,I'd be out of business.

639
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,130
Do you hear that?

640
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,550
What's that?

641
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,550
Phase iii.

642
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,080
You have surrendered under false pretenses.

643
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,470
I think he heard you.

644
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,620
I'm sorry.

645
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,190
What's happening?

646
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,110
He's extracting our...oxygen.

647
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,190
I'm really sorry.

648
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,200
Once oxygen levels fall below 17 percent

649
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,270
you'll be experiencing hypoxia,

650
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,730
oxygen deprivation.

651
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,260
Could we cover the air vents?

652
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,910
yeah,they'll probably slow down the vacuum,

653
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,830
so,grab paper,anything, cover the vents.

654
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,240
-This'll work. 
-No,not my jeremiah harm!

655
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,680
Uh,fargo,you were saying before about cutting off the power?

656
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,450
Uh,yeah,that it would be bad cause it would cut off the air supply.

657
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,420
Yeah,seeing as we're all losing air anyway, let's recess that option.

658
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,950
Yes.And we shut down the power,

659
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,660
maybe that'll stop B.R.A.D.From sucking out the oxygen.

660
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,520
Fargo,where's the generator?

661
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,130
It's not your typical generator.

662
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,820
What the hell is that?

663
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,090
An R.T.G.

664
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,770
Radioisotope thermoelectric generator.

665
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,950
I live with a nuclear reactor?

666
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,140
Generator.

667
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,630
The same one they use on the cassini space probe.

668
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,910
-It's clean,safe. 
-safe.

669
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,830
Like,uh,chernobyl.

670
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,720
Right? Why don't we turn the nukie thingy off?

671
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,310
There isn't an off-switch.

672
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,770
The only way to take it off-line is to remove the thermo-couples

673
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,030
and the esp power conduits.

674
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,050
Conduits are in carbon steel encasements.

675
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,500
If we could access them

676
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,170
by shutting it down without the proper tools,

677
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,940
we could cause a release of plutonium dioxide.

678
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,960
And--and,uh, chernobyl,right?

679
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,500
Well,technically,no.

680
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,160
Lethal,yeah.

681
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,160
I reckon we're right under the bunker.

682
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,430
I didn't even see a camera.

683
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,500
Yeah,well,if you wait 'til you can see them, that meansthey've seen you.

684
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
Beauty before beast.

685
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,100
And a beauty she is.

686
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,810
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

687
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,560
No,you're not.

688
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,680
No,I'm not. But,uh,

689
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,640
thank you for all your bad behavior.

690
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,940
I should've taken advantage of you while I had the chance.

691
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,260
Well,if we get out of here...

692
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,460
What's that?

693
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,760
Oh,my god.

694
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,950
It's coming from the floor.

695
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,180
Okay.

696
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,270
Thanks.

697
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,780
It's morse code.

698
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,300
Jo and taggart?

699
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,040
they're in the subsystem.

700
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,490
okay,what--what do we tell 'em?

701
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,090
Tell 'em to sever the outtake...conduit.

702
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,970
-Sever it... 
-to interrupt the vacuum flow.

703
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,750
You do realize we'll die before I morse all that.

704
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,250
Crack. Pipe.

705
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,060
Crack pi--

706
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,320
two words I never thought I'd hear from your mouth.

707
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,330
Crack pipe.

708
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,250
What'S...?

709
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,300
Oh,crack pipe!

710
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,210
Okay.

711
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,580
Uh,which pipe?

712
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,020
Well,pick one.

713
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh god,what's that smell?

714
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,410
air flow.

715
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,390
From the bowels of the bunker.

716
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,830
I guess that's why they call 'em the bowels.

717
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,290
-We did it! -Good on ya,mate!

718
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,630
-Intruder alert! -Too late,B.R.A.D.

719
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,990
Eliminate intruder.

720
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,670
No!

721
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,280
Zoe!

722
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,900
Everybody move.

723
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
Carter, what are you do--?

724
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,090
jack! You could kill yourself!

725
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,920
Zoe!

726
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,620
Carter,are you all right?

727
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,790
Yeah. I'm all right. Is she okay?

728
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,830
I don't know!

729
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,660
S.A.R.A.H.? What's going on?

730
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,650
Is this some kind of house arrest?

731
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,060
What is that?

732
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,840
It's a diesel generator powering up.

733
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,910
Must be the original backup system.

734
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,380
*

735
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,500
S.A.R.A.H.?

736
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,140
Uh,what's happened to zoe?Show me zoe.

737
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:11,270
All right,I know I should have paid for it,

738
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,530
but I was in a hurry.

739
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,820
Disengage hostile activity. Startup sequence initiated.

740
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,300
Oh,my god.

741
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,080
Okay,she's all right.

742
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,540
I feel sick.

743
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,290
I--is it--is it the radiation?

744
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,590
I--I doubt it.

745
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,380
He didn't even crack the housing.

746
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,980
So,no chernobyl?

747
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,500
Uh,nope,you beat the hell out of the R.T.G.

748
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,150
And your,uh,

749
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,400
world series' bat.

750
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,550
I can live without that.

751
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,920
dad!

752
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,010
-Zoe,don't let the door shut! -Don't let it close!

753
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,650
What's going on?

754
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,410
Oh,so you're allowed to have parties and I'm not?

755
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,180
Come here. I thought I almost lost you.

756
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,100
Eureka is still facing imminent disaster.

757
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,710
You all need to stay here and resolve your issues.

758
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,330
S.A.R.A.H.,

759
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,740
What's going on?

760
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,180
I just want you to be happy, sheriff carter.

761
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,610
Do ya?

762
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,430

763
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,400
You're angry.You're upset about something.

764
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,530
Well,we've all aired our dirty laundry.Time for you to come clean.

765
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,240
I have done all the laundry and folded it as well.

766
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,890
It's not what I'm-- but thank you.

767
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,660
Oh,wait.

768
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,970
You want me to be happy,

769
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,470
because I was gonna leave.

770
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,620
Huh? Just like fargo left you,

771
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,150
and B.R.A.D. Got left before that

772
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,930
and then whatever the hell it was before that.

773
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,400
Well,it was a war game simulation program.

774
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,260
Shall we play a game?

775
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,000
No! No! No! No!

776
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,350
S.A.R.A.H.,Is he right?

777
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,520
S.A.R.A.H.?

778
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,020
Listen,everyone is afraid of being abandoned.

779
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,300
I mean,I'm afraid of what's gonna happen to this town when henry leaves.

780
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,510
Maybe it'll be a disaster. I don't know.

781
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,860
But I promise you,

782
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,500
for right now, I'm not going anywhere.

783
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,790
Me either, S.A.R.A.H.

784
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,800
Or me.

785
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,170
I guess I'm sticking around.

786
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,690
What about baja,sheriff?

787
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,340
You kidding?

788
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,070
You know what the crime rate is there?

789
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,720
Don't even get me started on soil erosion.

790
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,130
What's up?

791
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,230
I'm gonna have a skylight put in.

792
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
And a ladder.

793
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,870
Cool.

794
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,990
What about the pop-up artillery outside?

795
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,950
I don't know,

796
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,230
what about the shoplifting?

797
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,710
Like chocolate bars. Free chocolate bars.

798
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,710
Really like being alive.

799
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,590
Thing of the past. Swear.
