00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,551
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,427
- Jack?
- Abby? What are you doing here?

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,961
Zoe.

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,135
That's my mom.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,135
I asked you to wait.
Has she spoken to you?

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,612
- What?
- You told her.

7
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:16,881
This is so like you!

8
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,606
I don't wanna look like the bad guy

9
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,353
because you come and take away my kid.

10
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,686
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,843
We had an agreement
when you came to live here.

12
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:26,780
A year, and then you were
supposed to come back to LA with me.

13
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,423
You've already ruined your own lives.
Just leave mine alone.

14
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:30,629
Were you seeing Kim?

15
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,345
More during the months leading up
to her... To the accident.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,965
So you never visited her lab?

17
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,185
No.

18
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,492
Hey. What's up?

19
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:04,167
Noise complaint from the neighbors.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,459
What neighbors?

21
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:08,759
The ones three miles down the road.

22
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:13,066
Exactly what kind of noise are they
complaining about three miles down...

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,960
- Never mind.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,982
Oh.

25
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:31,108
Hello?

26
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:34,524
Ah, excuse me, sir?

27
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,307
- Yes?
- Hi,

28
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,521
I'm sheriff Jack Carter, and you are?

29
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:47,869
Busy.

30
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,127
What is it that you need?

31
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,740
Listen, Dr. Bajanian,
we've had a noise complaint,

32
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,874
and we're gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

33
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:56,663
But I'm working
on simultaneously configuring

34
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:00,349
the position and momentum of electrons
so they'll no longer be

35
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:05,174
conjugate variables, thereby debunking
Heisenberg's uncertainty principal.

36
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:07,575
And as exciting as that may be,

37
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,982
we're still gonna have
to ask you to keep it down.

38
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:11,206
Fine.

39
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,145
Looks like you have an oil leak.

40
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,909
That's ununseptium,

41
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:18,415
a highly volatile halogen.

42
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:21,685
Whose effects on human skin
have yet to be tested.

43
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:24,584
Right. So not an oil leak.

44
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:25,887
Carter!

45
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,319
I told you to watch your head.

46
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,986
No, you didn't.

47
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,744
Okay, you know you need
special permission

48
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,182
to use transuranic elements

49
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:36,910
- outside of Global, right?
- Of course.

50
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,181
Okay, so let me see your permit, Doctor.

51
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,042
I'm sure they're on file, Deputy.

52
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,372
While we go check that out,
we're going to, uh,

53
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,217
have to ask you to still keep it down.

54
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,685
Thanks for your time.

55
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,122
Henry, are you sure about this?

56
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,592
- Allison...
- I can set you up in a brand-new lab

57
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,464
- with twice the space.
- Kim's lab will do just fine.

58
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:02,276
Then at least let me have someone
clear out all the old stuff.

59
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,166
No, you said you were gonna leave it
the way it was the day she...

60
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,121
At least until
I had time to go through it.

61
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,461
I did and I have. It's just...

62
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,113
This has to be hard for you.

63
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:15,528
I see it as a chance to stay close
to her, continue her work.

64
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:19,071
You know, we used to finish
each other's sentences. So...

65
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,176
Okay.

66
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,845
<i>So Abby, you're heading
back to Los Angeles?</i>

67
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,092
Yep, this is it.

68
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,789
<i>I'm sorry to see you go.</i>

69
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,264
Oh, no, you're not.

70
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,248
<i>Sheriff Carter and Zoe will miss you.</i>

71
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,767
No, they won't.

72
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,158
<i>Perhaps if you weren't
taking Zoe away...</i>

73
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,049
SARAH, forgive me
if I don't feel the need

74
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:42,026
to justify my parental choices
to a talking bunker.

75
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:45,012
<i>Fine. Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.</i>

76
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,742
You wanna piece of me?

77
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,488
Are you, uh, threatening the house?

78
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,064
She started it.

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,331
Yeah.

80
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,694
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I got a headache.

81
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:58,250
- Where's Zoe?
- She's in her room. She's okay.

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,397
She's using a virtual therapy
device that Beverly gave her.

83
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,375
It's called an ATS.

84
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,169
I'll tell ya, the things
this town comes up with...

85
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,753
Oh, yeah, it's a great place to live.

86
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,247
I mean, it's sort of full
of mind-blowing opportunities

87
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,571
and brilliant minds
at the top of their game.

88
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,889
And the schools... amazing.

89
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:19,889
Yeah?

90
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:22,479
Are you really okay with this?

91
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,260
We had an agreement.

92
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,519
I know.

93
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,986
But I don't want you to do
that thing that you do,

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,500
you know, when you say you're okay with
something and six months after that,

95
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,635
we're at my parents'
50th wedding anniversary

96
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,583
and you've had one beer too many,

97
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:40,480
and you ask my mom if the ball-buster
gene comes from her side of the family?

98
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,839
You threw out my baseball cards.

99
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,572
We were having a baby.
We needed the room.

100
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,638
I had a 1989 upper deck
Ken Griffey, Jr. Rookie card.

101
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,761
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth now?

102
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,828
No, and Dear God, before you tell me,

103
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:58,248
let's just try and swing this
right around to my original point.

104
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:02,010
Are you okay with me
taking Zoe back to LA?

105
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:04,803
Yeah.

106
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:06,423
I'm okay.

107
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,821
Okay.

108
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,740
'Cause the end of the semester's coming,
and I'm gonna come back to get her.

109
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,918
So... I'll call ya.

110
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:36,957
Zoe!

111
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,811
How many times have I asked you
not to leave your stuff lying around?

112
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,298
Zoe.

113
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,005
Zoe?

114
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:57,759
Hey!

115
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,145
- I'm talking to you here.
- Hey, I'm getting my head shrunk here.

116
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,977
Well, shrink it after you're done
cleaning up your mess, okay?

117
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:08,905
Is that the, um...

118
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,702
IRS thing from Beverly?

119
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:11,925
ATS.

120
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,702
She's out of town and...

121
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:17,661
She thinks it'll help me confront my
inner fears and resolve my anger issues.

122
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:19,788
How's it working?

123
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,245
Well, I'm still pretty pissed, so...

124
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,544
Do you wanna talk?

125
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,888
No, actually.
I want you to leave me alone.

126
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,860
Okay, that's... The exact opposite
of leaving me alone.

127
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,375
I know you're upset.

128
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,227
But your mom really misses you.

129
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,018
We agreed to shared custody.

130
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,151
And I think that, um,

131
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,556
if you don't give this a shot,

132
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:53,881
you will regret it.

133
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,140
Custody.

134
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,135
Meaning ownership.

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,788
Meaning I have no say.

136
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,136
Zoe, your mom loves you a lot.

137
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,173
Well, you know, I gotta give her credit.

138
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,694
At least she's willing to fight for me.

139
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,534
I'm gonna go clean up my stuff.

140
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:34,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

141
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,398
Uh, rearranging furniture.
What are you doing here?

142
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,167
Well, I said I was taking
the afternoon off, not quitting.

143
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,641
- Okay.
- Okay, so everything back in its place.

144
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:44,989
Go.

145
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,296
Sure, why should I get
to be by the window?

146
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,843
Hey, um, did you pull those,
permits I asked you to?

147
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:54,014
What?

148
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,771
The permits for, um,
Bajanian's contraption?

149
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,479
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,558
I swear, sometimes...

151
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,494
I wonder if you even listen to me.
I feel like I'm talking to myself.

152
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,382
Jo?

153
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:14,932
Jo?

154
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,480
Hey, Sheriff. What can I get for ya?

155
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,639
Uh, nothing right now. Have you seen Jo?

156
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,987
- W- who?
- My deputy.

157
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,206
Oh, you got a new deputy? That's great.

158
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,634
I didn't get a new deputy.
I have a deputy.

159
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,207
Deputy Jo Lupo.

160
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,499
- Oh.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,131
Is he cute?

162
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,970
Okay, now you're just bugging me.
I really need to talk to her.

163
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,605
Uh, listen, maybe I could help.

164
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,482
Has anybody here ever heard of a, uh,

165
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,686
deputy Lupo?

166
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:51,834
Sorry, no. Not me.

167
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:56,166
Sorry, Sheriff. I don't think anybody
here has ever heard of her.

00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:42,374
Here I am.

178
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,793
I thought you'd be at Global today.

179
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,367
No.

180
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,169
- Jack, you need something?
- Do you know a woman named Jo Lupo?

181
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,009
No, don't think so.

182
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:00,320
Okay, this is really
gonna sound strange.

183
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:03,287
I have a deputy named Jo Lupo.

184
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,961
Small, but surprisingly strong.
Bit of a gun nut?

185
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,904
I had a conversation with her
today, I turn my back for two seconds,

186
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,396
and she's gone.

187
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:13,998
Like vanished, and no one
in the town even remembers her.

188
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,168
I think everyone is playing
a trick on me, right?

189
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:22,984
So I go to her house, and, uh...

190
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:25,590
You know, the name
on the mailbox is changed,

191
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:28,260
and there's a family with, like,
12 kids living there,

192
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,854
and the house is a different color,
which is a bit far to go for a prank.

193
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:33,913
A bit, yeah.

194
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:38,550
You think I'm losing it, don't ya?

195
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:41,233
Um... You think you're losing it?

196
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,075
I know this woman! You know this woman!

197
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:46,493
All right, maybe something's
affected your body chemistry

198
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,847
or altered your neural pathway somehow.
Were you exposed to anything?

199
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,094
Yeah, I visited a guy,
he was, uh, playing with...

200
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:54,377
a new,

201
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,309
atlantic element.

202
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,410
- Transuranic?
- Yes! Yeah, that's it.

203
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,859
- Would that do it?
- No.

204
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,562
- Okay. What else have we got?
- Well, um...

205
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,336
Maybe...

206
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,745
Maybe you fell into some freezing water,

207
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,921
and, uh, you went into hypothermia.

208
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:14,280
Or you suffered a trauma,

209
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,174
and that sent you into shock.

210
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:17,934
Wha...

211
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,057
- Yeah, I hit my head.
- With what?

212
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,480
A heavy, metal object.

213
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,671
How many times?

214
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,061
Repeatedly.

215
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,019
Well, see? That would have some effect.

216
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,376
So if that's our problem, get an MRI.

217
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:31,803
Henry, I've had a concussion
before, that's not it.

218
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,915
Do you remember Occam's razor?

219
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,907
Yeah. uh...

220
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,769
Simple things, uh, are true.

221
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,226
Close enough. So you are
either part of some...

222
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:46,754
theoretical, unknown, scientific
discovery where people

223
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,850
vanish from our world and memories,

224
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,176
or... you suffered a head trauma.

225
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,039
When you say it like that...

226
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,541
Get an MRI.

227
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,194
Yeah.

228
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,811
I'm not saying that you can't have one.

229
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,308
I'm just asking why do you want one?

230
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,500
It's not a big deal. It's just,
I bumped my head this morning

231
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:13,110
and Henry thought it'd be a good
idea if I had it looked at.

232
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,822
You having any dizziness,
nausea, headaches?

233
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:18,547
No, my head was pounding
earlier, but it's fine now.

234
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:19,758
Actually, it's

235
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:21,814
totally fine now.

236
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,522
Problem solved.

237
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:25,608
What's he even doing here?

238
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:26,799
He works here.

239
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,947
He was fired weeks ago.

240
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:33,010
Okay, brain scan it is.

241
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,696
Run an EEG and draw blood.

242
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,655
No, I just need an MRI, thanks.

243
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,818
Relax, it usually only takes me
two or three tries to hit a vein.

244
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,133
You're pretty talented.

245
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,075
- Really?
- No!

246
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,849
Do you know anyone
who'd be working on a...

247
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,521
really intense, unknown,
theoretical scientific discovery?

248
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,225
You mean like a class eight project?

249
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,203
Yes. Let's talk about those.

250
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:59,076
Sorry, all class eight research
is classified.

251
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:02,346
Oh, you know what else
should be classified?

252
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,838
A certain assistant's
american idol audition.

253
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:07,300
- What?
- No, no!

254
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,052
Zoe promised me to delete that.

255
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:10,597
What's it gonna be?

256
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12,420
Fine! Gimme an hour.

257
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:14,925
All right, so put the gown on,

258
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,521
and all metal objects
and jewelry in the tray.

259
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:18,726
All right.

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,479
Are you okay?

261
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:23,827
Uh, yeah.

262
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:25,280
Just got a lot on my mind.

263
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,370
You know, you can always
talk to Beverly.

264
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,241
First of all, no.

265
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,003
And, second of all, she's out of town.

266
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:35,657
No, she's not.
I just saw her at Cafe Diem.

267
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:39,025
R... Well, then why's she having
Zoe do therapy from home today?

268
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,463
I don't know, but...

269
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:41,688
is Zoe okay?

270
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,157
Actually, not so much.

271
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:46,483
No.

272
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:47,869
Abby's taking her back to LA

273
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,601
at the end of the semester
as a part of our custody agreement.

274
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,520
And are you okay with that?

275
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,523
Yeah.

276
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:58,489
- It's complicated.
- Well,

277
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,533
what do you think you
should do about this?

278
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,785
I don't know. What can I do?

279
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:07,031
I don't know, but if someone
was gonna take Kevin away from me,

280
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,017
I would feel like my world was ending.

281
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,226
Let's get this over with.

282
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,731
- Hey, how's your head?
- A waste of time.

283
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
The MRI was clear.

284
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,396
Well, I wouldn't rule out
your injury just yet.

285
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,156
It might not be me, though.

286
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,347
I mean, it might be a, uh,
class eight project?

287
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:33,654
And what do you know
about class eight projects?

288
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,084
Mainly that I'm not supposed
to know about them.

289
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,315
That's true. I don't think

290
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,881
that's your problem,
most of that research is theoretical.

291
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,486
I know, I know, and I know
what I'm asking isn't probable,

292
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:43,940
but is it possible?

293
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:47,828
Yeah, well... It might have something
to do with meta-material technology

294
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:49,941
or vector decomposition or

295
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,873
cellular irradiation.

296
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:54,238
- Okay.
- But none of those things

297
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,869
could remove someone
from the world's consciousness.

298
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,795
Unless...

299
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:01,874
it was some kind
of transdimensional travel.

300
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,991
Okay, let's go with that. What's that?

301
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,136
Movement between parallel universes.

302
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,381
Right... So you're saying that

303
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:11,405
Jo got zapped to another universe?

304
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,345
Or maybe you did. Theoretically,
every universe is different.

305
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,792
But the closer they are, the more alike
they are, with maybe just a difference.

306
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,087
A green sky instead of blue,

307
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,486
- cats chase dogs or...
- In a town of 3,000 people,

308
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,118
one isn't where he's supposed to be.

309
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,282
Exactly.

310
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,704
We should talk to Nathan about this.

311
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,260
He's good with this kind of thing.

312
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,876
Great! Thanks.

313
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,494
You're welcome.

314
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:34,127
I was starting to worry
if it was something to do with me.

315
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,359
Well, that's where
the smart money still is.

316
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,595
Funny.

317
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,087
Henry?

318
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,420
Henry?

319
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,937
Henry!

320
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,529
You wanna run that by me one more time?

321
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,805
People are disappearing
into this crazy light,

322
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,715
and nobody remembers them but me.

323
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,868
- People like...
- What difference does it make?

324
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,258
You're not gonna know who
I'm talking about anyway.

325
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,637
- I'm gonna double-check your MRI.
- There's nothing wrong with my head.

326
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,019
Well, what you're describing
simply is impossible.

327
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:40,878
There's no technology that could create
such an anomaly. Not even in Eureka.

328
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:43,799
Well, how about, um,
many-materials technology

329
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,258
or, like, the cell phone radiation
or decomposing vectors?

330
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,304
And now you're just
putting words together.

331
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:52,786
Okay, I don't know what I'm talking
about, but Henry said that you would.

332
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,192
- Henry...
- Henry Deacon. The...

333
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:57,192
How do you not remember...

334
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,608
He was a friend of yours.

335
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,549
I have a lot of friends.

336
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,762
Actually, not so much.
But we'll table that.

337
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,818
Um, I think it has something
to do with me,

338
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,662
okay? People interact with,
people I know, but whatever it is,

339
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:12,073
we must figure it out before it affects
the 3,000 people in this town.

340
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:15,347
You see, now I know it's in your head,
because Eureka's only half that size.

341
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,491
That means it's spreading.

342
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,395
Nathan, you gotta help me.

343
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:24,284
- Okay.
- Great. Where do we start?

344
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,810
You go home and get some rest.

345
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,204
And I'll start by
double-checking your MRI.

346
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,126
Come on.

347
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:38,609
Come on.

348
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,342
<i>- Zoe?</i>
- Hey, what's up?

349
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,792
Hey, uh, where are you?

350
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,040
- Home. Why?
<i>- All right, stay put.</i>

351
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,184
- What's happening?
<i>- I don't know, but if you see</i>

352
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,038
a big flash of light, I need you to run.
Just get away from it,

353
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,176
<i>- and you call me, okay?</i>
- Seriously?

354
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:00,707
Seriously, um...

355
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,089
I'll be in touch. Gotta go.

356
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,336
Fargo!

357
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,242
Fargo.

358
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,584
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

359
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:11,776
But you can't tell anyone
I showed this to you.

360
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:15,485
If you don't show it to me,
there might not be anyone left to tell.

361
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,816
I have no idea what that means.

362
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:19,757
Ah, you don't have to.

363
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,136
Why do you need it anyway?

364
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,338
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

365
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,468
Huh, Stark's on this list.

366
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,289
Of course he is.

367
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:30,594
He's done more class eight projects
than anyone else at Global.

368
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,771
And this guy, I know him.
Saw him this morning.

369
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,860
Uh, Dr. Bajanian?
Yeah, he's a quantum physicist.

370
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:39,496
Any chance what he's doing could
punch a hole in another dimension?

371
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,458
Not likely, but when you start dealing

372
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,795
with subatomic particles,
the typical laws of nature

373
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,009
no longer apply.

374
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,105
Okay. Thanks.

375
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,351
And, um...

376
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:51,621
You got a great voice.
Don't let anyone tell you different.

377
00:19:57,923 --> 00:20:00,205
Hey! Allison.

378
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:03,398
- What's going on?
- I need you to come with me.

379
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,327
There's a noise complaint,
outskirts of town.

380
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,360
This guys is using an element he
doesn't have permission to use.

381
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,670
- So make him get a permit.
- Yeah, well,

382
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:14,374
I'm not supposed to know this, but
he's one of your class eight scientists.

383
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,518
Carter, everyone knows who
the class eight scientists are.

384
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,142
Fargo said he's working with atoms,

385
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,858
and I think this guy Bajanian
could be a really serious threat.

386
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,635
- Who?
- Bajanian.

387
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,568
Weird guy, lives
on the outskirts of town.

388
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,974
I know who Bajanian is.

389
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,928
Who told you that he works with atoms?

390
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,464
Fargo.

391
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,332
Oh, man.

392
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:41,432
Hey, Sheriff.

393
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,799
Soup?

394
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,191
Ya hired Larry the kiss-ass?

395
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,719
- Okay, Carter, I have work to do.
- Alisson.

396
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,396
Whatever this guy's doing,
it makes people disappear,

397
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,570
and I seem to be the only one
who's noticing.

398
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,223
Please.

399
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,643
Please come with me.

400
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:16,400
And watch your head.
He's got this big booming machine

401
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,313
with lots of little things spinning...

402
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,584
You'll see.

403
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,617
Dr. Bajanian?

404
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,461
Dr. Bajanian?

405
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,257
This can't be happening.

406
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:37,070
Can I help you?

407
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,929
Where'd you put it?

408
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:40,951
- Sorry?
- Where?

409
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,685
The machine with the lights
and swirling?

410
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,776
Could you be a little more vague?

411
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,769
The thing you built to find out
how fast the electrons are moving.

412
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:51,120
I was right here this morning. I saw it.

413
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,402
What were you doing in my lab?

414
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,257
I know you're up to something.
I'm gonna figure out what it is.

415
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:57,763
Miss Blake.

416
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,879
I'm sorry about the intrusion,
Dr. Bajanian.

417
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,041
Let's go.

418
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,569
Carter, there's nothing here.

419
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:04,692
Let's go.

420
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,255
Move!

421
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,444
Not again.

422
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,241
I can't believe it got him too.

423
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,619
What are you talking about?

424
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,901
You have no idea of what happened?

425
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,539
I know you dragged me out
to an empty lab.

426
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,489
And you're starting to scare me.

427
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,230
We gotta get outta here.

428
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,102
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'm not sure.

429
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:03,633
I'm glad you thought this through.

430
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,150
We'll get Kevin, we'll get Zoe,

431
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,104
and we'll get out of dodge
while we still can.

432
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,264
Avoiding the issue isn't going
to help resolve it.

433
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,997
When the issue is that the people
I care about keep disappearing,

434
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:13,842
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

435
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,752
Listen to me.
I trusted you. I need you to trust me.

436
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,511
Let's just go back to the office,
I promise, we will figure this out.

437
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:22,069
You wanna help? Here.

438
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,909
One of the 20 people on that list
knows exactly what's going on.

439
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:26,406
Help me figure out which one.

440
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:29,495
Carter, there is nothing written
on this piece of paper.

441
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:32,420
Please.

442
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,484
I know that I can help you.

443
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:44,554
Carter, we need to slow down
and talk about this.

444
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:46,645
I'm telling you, we gotta leave.
It's spreading.

445
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:47,848
We can't stay.

446
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,623
Carter, just drink some water
and calm down.

447
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,022
- You're dehydrated.
- I'm dehydrated? You gotta kidding.

448
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,197
Just drink the water.

449
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:55,695
- I'm fine.
- Just drink it!

450
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:58,543
- Why the hell do I wanna drink...
- So I don't have to do this.

451
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:01,154
I'm sorry.

452
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,627
It was for your own good.

453
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:21,309
How are you feeling?

454
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:24,473
Like somebody stabbed me in the back.

455
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:26,462
And then stabbed me in the neck.

456
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:28,529
I'm sorry, there's nothing else
I could do.

457
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:30,197
You were practically hysterical.

458
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,823
I expect it from Stark.

459
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,354
Not so much you.

460
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,721
Stark?

461
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:36,661
Ex-husband Nathan Stark.

462
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:39,149
Egomaniacal bane of my existence.

463
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,279
That does sound like
someone that I would marry...

464
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:45,368
But, no, I've never heard of him.

465
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,593
The only way to fix the problem,

466
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,384
is to recognize that you have one.

467
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:01,092
What is that? AA?

468
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:03,183
- Carter...
- Allison, don't I...

469
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,534
I mean, apart from the...

470
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,885
Remembering people
that don't exist thing,

471
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,648
don't I seem rational to you?

472
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,903
The former seems to negate the latter.

473
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,593
- Why are you talking like Beverly?
- I'm just trying to help you.

474
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:18,078
Then think this through with me.
How many offices are there at global?

475
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:20,607
- Over 1,000.
- How many people work there?

476
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:23,573
- Maybe 100.
- Doesn't that seem odd to you?

477
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,041
We're in a transitional period.

478
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,843
Or your mind is reaching
to justify what's happening.

479
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,514
I could say the same for you.

480
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:35,047
Okay.

481
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:37,273
But you gotta let me go get Zoe.

482
00:25:37,478 --> 00:25:40,034
I can't deal with losing her.

483
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:42,515
I won't.

484
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,763
Okay.

485
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:54,564
Thank you.

486
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,475
Allison, come here.
Don't let it touch you.

487
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,839
Allison, move!

488
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,922
Everything's gonna be all right.

489
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,353
- SARAH, door.
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>

490
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,075
Not even close. Zoe!

491
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:38,824
Zoe!

492
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:40,708
- What's going on?
- Hey, sweetie.

493
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:42,812
Um, get your shoes on,
we gotta go, okay?

494
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,807
- What's happening?
- No questions, just go.

495
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:45,971
All right?

496
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,172
Okay, great.

497
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:50,712
SARAH, how many people
live in Eureka right now?

498
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:52,945
<i>My current calculations say two...</i>

499
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:54,572
<i>You and Zoe.</i>

500
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:56,895
Okay, thank you.

501
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,806
Back to the beginning.

502
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,253
Zoe!

503
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,590
- Zoe.
- I'm coming.

504
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,490
What do you remember about this morning?

505
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:08,431
What do you mean?

506
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:10,563
Okay, your mom was here,
you and I got in a fight,

507
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,627
you threw the thing at me
and you left, right?

508
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,385
Okay, mom has never been to Eureka,

509
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:16,017
I don't member getting in a fight,

510
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,543
and I don't know
what thing you're talking about.

511
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,815
The thing.

512
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:23,070
The therapy thingy... The ATS.

513
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:24,658
What?

514
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,091
For the love of...

515
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:29,850
I was sitting here.

516
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:31,217
And...

517
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,693
I had it in my hands.

518
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,528
And I stood up.

519
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,177
Dad.

520
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:40,776
I never put it down.

521
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:42,473
So?

522
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:44,482
So...

523
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:47,077
Then I go back downstairs and
I see you on the couch.

524
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,949
And I say that I'm
going off to the office?

525
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:50,384
Okay, that I remember.

526
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:51,931
But nothing before that?

527
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:53,448
Nothing that you've mentioned.

528
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,881
So that's our first shared memory.

529
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,876
- I have no idea...
- What I'm talking about.

530
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,448
That's the problem.

531
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,070
And the only way to solve a problem

532
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,366
is to recognize that you have one.

533
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,485
Okay, you sound like my therapist.

534
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,269
Or a therapy device.

535
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:12,645
Right, like the same you had, the one
I have no recollection of putting down.

536
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:14,531
I mean, I must've tried it on, right?

537
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:16,909
That's why everybody
sounded like Beverly.

538
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:18,532
Except you.

539
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:28,072
This is gonna be hard to swallow.

540
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,430
I don't think any of this is real.

541
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:35,385
Okay.

542
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,955
I think that I'm...

543
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,704
We are...

544
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,823
in a program.

545
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,621
And...

546
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,936
I don't know how to find my way out.

547
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:51,260
Dad, you're freaking me out.

548
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,401
Dad.

549
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,479
<i>Dad, can you hear me?</i>

550
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,240
Dad, can you hear me?

551
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,045
Please wake up.

552
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,589
I'm so scared.

553
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,065
Please.

554
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:23,434
- Oh, sweetie.
- Mom.

555
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,497
I drove back as fast as I could.

556
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,191
What happened?

557
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:30,678
I was doing my therapy on the ATS.

558
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,060
And Dad walked in,

559
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:34,123
and we got in a fight, and...

560
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,261
I threw it at him, and
for some reason, he put it on,

561
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:40,675
and when I walked back in,
he was shaking and he wouldn't wake up.

562
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,138
And I shouldn't have thrown it at him.

563
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:45,120
Honey, it's nobody's fault.

564
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,252
But can't you just take this off?

565
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,362
We're afraid that disconnecting him

566
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,535
could send him into paralytic shock.

567
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:54,324
So what is happening to him?

568
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:56,962
Actually, we're not sure.

569
00:29:57,085 --> 00:30:01,085
The, ATS was developed
in collaboration with Beverly Barlowe.

570
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:02,877
But we've never had this happen before.

571
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:05,416
It's a virtual version of Eureka,

572
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:07,047
down to the very last detail.

573
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,788
The user's subconscious issues
come to life in the game.

574
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:13,111
Normally, they're aware
of what they're experiencing,

575
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,066
and they can leave the program
at any time.

576
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,329
We think the concussion may have caused
a glitch in the mainframe,

577
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:20,312
that Carter is unaware

578
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:22,003
that he's in an altered reality.

579
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:23,970
Is his life in danger?

580
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,935
Someone answer me.

581
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,850
Yes. It is.

582
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,670
So let's get Beverly down here
and fix it.

583
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:35,908
Well, we can't reach her.

584
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:39,328
So we sent Henry to her house to find
any information that can help us.

585
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:42,014
Beverly, this is Henry.
I'm in your house now.

586
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,869
We really need your help.

587
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,588
So when you get this message, call!

588
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,993
Dad, where are we going?

589
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:35,398
If this isn't real, there has to be
a way out, right?

590
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:39,224
- Like an exit sign?
- Yeah, I'm not that lucky.

591
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:41,789
You said this therapy thing
is for confronting your fears,

592
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:44,312
- working out anger issues...
- I don't remember that.

593
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,790
- Yeah, well, you said it.
- And I'm not angry.

594
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,285
So maybe confronting fears
is the way out.

595
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:51,026
Yours or mine?

596
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,304
I'm wearing the thing,
so i'm guessing mine.

597
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:57,247
Okay, so what are you afraid of?

598
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:01,924
Right now, that.

599
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,744
What is that?!

600
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,128
That's what's been taking people.

601
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:10,750
Dad, what are you doing?

602
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:12,818
Confronting my fear.

603
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,647
I am so sorry. Are you okay?

604
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,578
I'm...

605
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,618
Yeah. I'm just, uh...

606
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,771
- Looking for a cup of coffee.
- Allow me.

607
00:32:42,581 --> 00:32:44,648
I cook when I'm upset.

608
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,833
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

609
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,233
What are you all doing here?

610
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,271
We're here for Carter and Zoe.

611
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:58,668
All of you?

612
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:00,918
Yeah, I mean...

613
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:03,465
He's our sheriff, and she's our girl.

614
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,345
- Did you find anything else?
- Just another ATS Device.

615
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,390
I can take it apart,
we can see the mechanics.

616
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:18,013
- Well, if he can hold on that long.
- Yeah.

617
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,328
Hey, honey.

618
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:27,753
There's a whole lot of people out there
who are worried about you.

619
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:30,480
You wanna come say hi?

620
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:32,599
Not right now.

621
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,166
You gonna eat?

622
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,963
He wouldn't leave me.

623
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,142
I'm not gonna leave him.

624
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,731
- Dad.
- Come on.

625
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,604
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

626
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,005
Why aren't we running?

627
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:00,196
We don't have to.

628
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:06,357
You're gonna go. It's gonna take you.

629
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,170
I'm gonna stay with you.

630
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:20,019
Dad! What's happening?

631
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:33,697
We're losing him.

632
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,499
Wait!

633
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:43,330
He's fighting.

634
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:58,207
- Dad!
- Jack, you're all right!

635
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,972
I thought I'd lost you.

636
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:06,708
Oh, no, never. No.

637
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:07,939
No, no, no.

638
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:09,332
I knew you wouldn't leave.

639
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:10,617
I'm here.

640
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,287
Looks good.

641
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,791
Looks very good.

642
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,994
Well, great.

643
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:36,324
Henry said you could have visitors?

644
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,469
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

645
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,601
Okay, guys, come on in!

646
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,362
You look great.

647
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,193
Zoe, hi.

648
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,673
Hi. Abby!

649
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,549
Hey, good to see ya.

650
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,483
Hey, Chris. Thanks very much.
I really appreciate it.

651
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,349
Thanks for that.

652
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:06,194
Hey, thanks for that.

653
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:07,949
Hey, thank you so much.

654
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,775
How many of you are there?

655
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,013
Hi.

656
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:23,199
Hey.

657
00:36:23,504 --> 00:36:24,676
Hey, how you feeling?

658
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:27,368
A little strange.

659
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:29,664
You know, I have all these...

660
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:30,897
memories and...

661
00:36:31,307 --> 00:36:33,053
feelings about things
that never happened.

662
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,103
Well, that's gotta be pretty surreal.

663
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:37,590
You have no idea.

664
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,540
Anyway, I just stopped by
to see if you were okay.

665
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:43,055
To see if I'm okay?

666
00:36:43,192 --> 00:36:45,063
Yeah, this is your
first day back in Kim's lab.

667
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:46,430
I know that's a big deal.

668
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:48,098
Jack, it's fine. Really.

669
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:50,571
I mean, you're the one
we should be worrying about.

670
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:52,771
They told me...

671
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,872
The therapy thing was forcing me to
deal with my feelings about losing Zoe.

672
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,050
Apparently I have...

673
00:36:58,212 --> 00:37:01,136
abandonment, entitlement,
and intimacy issues.

674
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,104
- Ha, congratulations.
- Thank you.

675
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:07,724
Even though that wasn't actually you,

676
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,788
you helped me a lot in there.

677
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,002
I don't know what I'd do without you.

678
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,216
Me too.

679
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,890
I should get going.

680
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,303
Abby's taking off, we gotta talk
before she goes, so...

681
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:23,848
All right, well, good luck and...

682
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:25,478
thanks.

683
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:26,947
Yeah.

684
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:45,158
You wanted me to stop by.

685
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,297
Yeah.

686
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,480
Yeah, yeah, I think we should talk.

687
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,380
Yeah, I know.

688
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,633
I'm happy here.

689
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,559
Yeah, I know I complain about it, and...

690
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:08,974
It definitely has its quirks.

691
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,200
- Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
- Yeah.

692
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:14,041
But...

693
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,638
I belong here.

694
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:21,804
- And I'm doing some good.
- You do. And you are.

695
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:24,031
And I think this place
has been good for Zoe.

696
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,396
You know, I think
she fits in here somehow.

697
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:29,485
Well, maybe that's 'cause she
doesn't fit in anywhere else.

698
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,958
She has some good friends.

699
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:33,585
Yeah, I've noticed that.

700
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,785
And I would never ask you to...

701
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,833
you know, not take her.
That wouldn't be fair to you or Zoe.

702
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:42,004
- Jack, listen, I...
- That being said...

703
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,513
I can't go...

704
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:48,973
months without seeing my kid.

705
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,595
Can't even go days, really.

706
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,667
So... I'm...

707
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:59,168
gonna ask for my job back in LA.

708
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,343
Really?

709
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:01,710
Yep.

710
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,618
It's funny, you remind me
the man I once married.

711
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:13,491
So what do you think?

712
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,541
I think this place needs you.

713
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,263
And it wasn't until today that

714
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,942
I realized just how much Zoe needs you.

715
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:23,674
And I can't take you away from here.

716
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,833
I can't take her away from you.

717
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:29,318
- But...
- This is where she needs to be.

718
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,424
Thank you.

719
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:50,967
I love you, Jack Carter.

720
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,384
SARAH, door.

721
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:14,411
<i>Good evening, Sheriff Carter.</i>

722
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,789
<i>Will the former Mrs. Carter
be joining you for dinner?</i>

723
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,401
Relax, SARAH, she's gone.

724
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,822
<i>What a shame.</i>

725
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,225
Sarcasm doesn't become you.

726
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:25,963
Is...

727
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:30,922
What are you doing?

728
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:33,260
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to have
all this cleaned up

729
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:34,383
before you got home.

730
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:36,253
Oh, it's okay.

731
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:38,330
It doesn't matter. Leave it.

732
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,061
Your mom and I had a talk.

733
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,517
I told her how much you love it here,

734
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:47,668
and...

735
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:50,235
That you... You wanna stay.

736
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:56,699
And I told her that I would
respect our agreement.

737
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,715
What did she say?

738
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,052
Oh, she seems to think that...

739
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,977
I need adult supervision.

740
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:11,164
So...

741
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:12,898
If you're up for the task...

742
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:16,014
I think I can handle it.

743
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,972
I never wanted you to leave.

744
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,692
I never wanted to go.

745
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:31,886
Dad...

746
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,000
Thank you for...

747
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,091
fighting for me.

748
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:49,238
SARAH, what are you doing?

749
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,672
<i>That was such a beautiful moment,</i>

750
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,460
<i>I thought musical accompaniment
seemed appropriate.</i>

751
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:55,770
Yeah, on second thought,
LA's not looking so bad.

752
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,711
Well, you're stuck with us now, so...

753
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,925
what do you say... burgers, Cafe Diem?

754
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:01,141
Sounds good.

755
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:04,258
Oh, SARAH, knock it off.
