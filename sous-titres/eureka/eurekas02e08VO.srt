1
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,360
May I help you find something?

2
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,846
I got it covered. But thanks.

3
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,913
Actually, you can
help me find the back door.

4
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:43,901
Well, it's by used games,

5
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,111
but you're really not supposed
to go out that way.

6
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,640
I won't tell anyone if you won't.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,163
He's on the move.

8
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,450
FBI! Zane Donovan, get your hands up!

9
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,795
Freeze!

10
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:01,669
Excellent response time.

11
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,364
You guys take Lake Street?

12
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,623
Went up by Lincoln Park. Less traffic.

13
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,896
Yep. It's me.

14
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,472
I think I got a live one.

15
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,008
Probably not the best idea.

16
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,118
That comes out on the pistol range.

17
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,625
Please tell me you're my lawyer.

18
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,797
No. But I think I can
keep you out of jail.

19
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,424
What'd you have in mind?

20
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:53,971
<i>You wanna hire this guy?</i>

21
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:55,901
He's the best in his field.

22
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,170
Oh, yeah, if screwing up is a field.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,941
We need a particle physicist, Carter,

24
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,104
and he's the most
promising one out there.

25
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:05,066
He was accepted
to MIT at the age of 13.

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,818
Expelled. Accepted at yale. Expelled.

27
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,903
Cornell. Oh, guess what? Expelled.

28
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:13,633
Not before winning the Spadaro
Foundation Award for superstring theory.

29
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,940
He set the bar so high, they haven't
even bothered to give it out since.

30
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:20,175
Here's a resume highlight.
"Just stole $3.1 million

31
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,825
"from the U.S. Border patrol account
for drug interdiction."

32
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,001
Allegedly.

33
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:27,254
And can't we just agree that
the war on drugs is really

34
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,704
a moralistic assault
on individual liberty, hmm?

35
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,551
- Or not.
- Hello, Zane. Welcome to Eureka.

36
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,039
- Good to see you, Sam.
- Right back at ya, Doc.

37
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,646
So we got one brainiac at
the standard recruitment rate

38
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,986
$25,000.

39
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:41,984
25,000 for this guy?

40
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,004
For 30, I'll throw in
dinner and a movie.

41
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,579
But I won't go past second base.

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,065
I'm not that kinda boy.

43
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,566
I'll give you a check.

44
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,038
Be a sweetheart and make it cash
And throw in some singles.

45
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,155
I'm chasing down
a paleontologist in vegas.

46
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,157
Well, who's this guy,
and how do I get his job?

47
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,502
Sam lovejoy,
Global Dynamics' talent scout.

48
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:01,204
I'm the guy who assembled
this dream team of intellectual prowess.

49
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:04,583
So you're the guy I can blame
for all the crap I deal with.

50
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:08,110
I just find 'em. What you do
with them after that is not my domain.

51
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:10,255
- He's all yours, Sheriff.
- Don't want him.

52
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,007
Well, you got him.

53
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,431
- Allison, just...
- Technically, he's still a prisoner.

54
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,927
- He's your responsibility.
- Until when?

55
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,181
Until you think he can be trusted.

56
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:22,638
So...

57
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,715
What do you do for fun in this town?

58
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,492

- Saison 2 | Episode 1 -
E=MC?

64
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:12,485
Obsession with firearms can be
a sign of unfulfilled sexual appetite.

65
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:14,221
I'm not saying that's you.

66
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,237
But if it is, I'm at your service.

67
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,888
Jo! Don't shoot the prisoner. Don't...

68
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,743
- If I just wing him?
- No.

69
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,829
Down. Allison wants him at GD alive.

70
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,580
Better use these then.

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,670
Bracelets.

72
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,634
They're geodetic coordinate
transceivers...

73
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,534
They'll show his location
within one meter.

74
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,473
And if he tries to run,
it's also got a restraint field.

75
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,812
An emergent graviton field generator?

76
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,604
- Very cool.
- If he tries to escape, hit the button.

77
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,857
Oh. What button?

78
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:55,574
Got a button.

79
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,407
Gimme that.

80
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:03,869
Arm.

81
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:13,670
- Where we going?
- Just go.

82
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,297
At least you know it works.

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,901
Your doctoral thesis was on
the origins of the universe, right?

84
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,815
- The first one.
- Hey, is this the new kid?

85
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,435
Who you calling kid, Spartacus?

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,136
- Cocky. I like him.
- You would.

87
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,825
I have something to show you.

88
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:33,453
Holy crap.

89
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,226
You actually built it?

90
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,398
What, exactly, did we build?

91
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,532
A chaotic inflation device.

92
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:43,520
It will recreate the origin singularity

93
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,559
in this observable containment field.

94
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:46,995
The big bang.

95
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,248
Supercritical ignition will take place
24 hours after we start the device.

96
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:53,585
And if it works, it will show us
the first moments of the universe.

97
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:56,796
And potentially rewrite every
cosmological theory we know.

98
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,007
Uh, I don't mean to be a wet

99
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,092
blanket, but won't that
blow up the planet?

100
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:02,894
Didn't think of that. Good you're here.

101
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:06,609
But seriously, this thing's going to
pump out a ton of hawking radiation.

102
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:08,141
And it's gonna go supernova.

103
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,154
So please tell me you have a plan.

104
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,674
You can just shut it off?

105
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,779
Well, actually, no.
Once induction is started,

106
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:15,899
it's essentially a runaway
cyclotron bomb.

107
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,943
That's a bad plan.

108
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:19,696
Relax. We have four generators creating

109
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,089
a layered particle field
that will contain the explosion.

110
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,276
- And one of us...
- Heads.

111
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,868
Me... Will be in the lab

112
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,651
continuously to adjust the field.

113
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,997
And as long as
the current density doesn't go

114
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,795
below 200, the field will hold.

115
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,718
I'm checking the levels
on the containment fields.

116
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,417
- No.
- Carter, it's okay.

117
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,010
We want Zane to feel comfortable.
He's part of the team.

118
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,595
Thanks, Dr. Blake.

119
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,556
I really appreciate that.

120
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,892
I don't know about
the rest of the team, but I'm starving.

121
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,602
So what's for lunch?

122
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,365
When the device ignites,
field must be at full strength.

123
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,798
So let's go through
the containment protocols again.

124
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,557
- Got 'em right here.
- It'll hold.

125
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,870
Well, I don't want to take any risks.

126
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,325
Scientific leaps require risk.
That's why GD is here,

127
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:16,167
to pull together great minds
so we can take risks.

128
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,920
Those self-esteem classes
are really helping out, Nathan.

129
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,506
- Got a great team.
- Well...

130
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:23,216
It's safe.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,216
Here's to scientific leaps
and the beginning of

132
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,337
the universe.

133
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,830
Vincent, baby, gimme a bird on a raft,

134
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,976
keep off the grass,
and pin a rose to it, will ya?

135
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,120
Chicken on toast. Onion, no lettuce.
Sherrif?

136
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,989
Hey, Vince,
gimme two breasts, all wet...

137
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,191
J-just

138
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,516
chicken on a plate.
Two chickens on a plate.

139
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,405
- How's our boy doing, Sheriff?
-  He's behaving.

140
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,657
The best ones are always wild like

141
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:48,900
a porcini mushroom.

142
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,891
Tough, sometimes, sure,
but that's what gives this town flavor.

143
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,985
I was that way once. Ah, grazie.

144
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,916
- You miss it?
- Sure. These are my people, my peeps.

145
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,015
I been to every state of the union,
and this is the only town I fit in.

146
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,105
This is my family. You know, I...

147
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,676
I happen to have a knack of finding
new members of that family.

148
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,154
If you could find a member
without a felony record,

149
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:10,978
that would be just super.

150
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,390
Thanks, Vincent.

151
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:18,960
Where's he going?

152
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:26,877
Ow! What the hell?
I was getting napkins.

153
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,513
Sorry.

154
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,935
My bad.

155
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:35,246
I'm not eating that.

156
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,601
What? It's chicken.

157
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:39,614
You know how chickens are raised?

158
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,212
- Don't. Just let me enjoy my meal.
- Jammed together

159
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:45,242
in a windowless warehouse,
wading in feces until...

160
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,634
They get decapitated.
Or pecked to death.

161
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:50,982
When you eat that chicken,
you're eating all that hate.

162
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:59,521
Come on. I have to sleep in here?

163
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:02,718
At least you're not wading
in your own feces.

164
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,068
GD has an apartment for you,
but you're a criminal.

165
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,301
Don't deserve it.

166
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:08,405
You may think I'm a criminal,
but my mom loves me.

167
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,490
She wouldn't appreciate
you insulting her boy.

168
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,243
Enjoy your stay.

169
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,142
And... don't bother. It's unpickable.

170
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,981
Ithaca lock company.

171
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,416
Sloped tumblers.

172
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,577
Nice.

173
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,170
Can I at least watch tv?

174
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,965
The Mariners are playing the Yankees.

175
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,592
Sure, sure. It's gonna be a good game.

176
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,519
No pay channels.

177
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,845
Right.

178
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,565
<i>Current density, stable.</i>

179
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,199
390 electrovolts.

180
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:51,420
In 24 hours, we'll get to see
how the universe began.

181
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,306
Any historic words?

182
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:56,600
Let's light this candle.

183
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,882
- <i>Are you sure you wanna do that?</i>
- I didn't have any lunch.

184
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:25,190
<i>Pork rinds have over 960 milligrams
of sodium per serving.</i>

185
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,301
All right, you know what? New rule.

186
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,584
No one's allowed to say
anything about what I eat.

187
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,415
<i>Whatever you say, Jack.</i>

188
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,887
I can hear you judging.

189
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,708
Oh, hey, what's up?

190
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,920
You and your job can be really annoying.

191
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,926
Yeah. Tell me about it.

192
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,321
You know, Jasper Cole
was gonna ask me out.

193
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:54,745
But he didn't.

194
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,262
Because of you.

195
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:59,724
Yeah, that's right, Zoe.
I'm controlling him with my mind.

196
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:02,521
No, 'cause you're the Sheriff,
I'm the Sheriff's daughter.

197
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:05,008
And I have this big,
fat label right across my head,

198
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,609
and that's all anyone sees.

199
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,025
- I hope you're happy.
- Honestly?

200
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,197
If being the Sheriff's daughter keeps
you date-free for a couple months...

201
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:16,856
- Months?
- Or years. Then, yeah,

202
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,118
I'm pretty happy.

203
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,197
- How are you, dad?
- Pretty good.

204
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,023
Yeah, no, pretty good. Yeah.

205
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,276
That's right.

206
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,471
Right?

207
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,196
Morning. You want some breakfast?

208
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:38,448
How...

209
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,992
This panini press
makes rocking quesadillas.

210
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,037
- Who...
- Magic of the Internet.

211
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,247
This works like a wireless keyboard.

212
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,970
The IR Signal talks to
the receiver in your computer.

213
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,544
Took some curveballing getting
the pad togo on the web, but

214
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,702
had delivery guys flying
in and out all morning.

215
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,917
Give me that. Give it to me.

216
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,386
- You're sending all this stuff back.
- The restocking fee's gonna be killer.

217
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,807
Who paid for all this?

218
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:08,394
About that. You really shouldn't leave
credit card info on your hard drive.

219
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,411
That's just poor security.

220
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,389
Oh... My... God.

221
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,160
Watch him.

222
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,030
On the upside, I got them
to raise your credit limit.

223
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,473
Yeah, you're welcome.

224
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:23,785
Don't even try.

225
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,560
You may get to him,
but you won't get to me.

226
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,633
Jo Lupo.

227
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:32,904
- Yeah?
- I got 19 boxes from Liza's lingerie...

228
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:36,300
And can I just say God bless?

229
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,424
I had to guess the size.

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,468
You should really try everything on.

231
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,303
I'll make popcorn.

232
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,237
You don't really need him, do you?

233
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,576
I dunno.

234
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:02,240
Who?

235
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,413
Zane Donovan.

236
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:07,152
You... you can find some
other particle physicist, right?

237
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,913
Somebody without a felony record.

238
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,123
I suppose so.

239
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,862
You gotta go tell Allison...
So I can take him back to the Feds

240
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,378
and start rebuilding my credit score.

241
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,979
- Okay.
- Great.

242
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,634
What you doing?

243
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,304
Watching.

244
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,623
That looks bad.

245
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,972
Shouldn't you be watching this
instead of that?

246
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,256
This is funnier.

247
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,324
Didn't you say that if we were
below 200 we were in trouble?

248
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,038
Hey, I was watching that!

249
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:52,972
Am I wrong? Shouldn't we
make these numbers go up?

250
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,002
Maybe that'll help.

251
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,184
Maybe?

252
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,720
See ya.

253
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:15,911
He wasn't acting like Henry. Couldn't
remember what he told me yesterday.

254
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:18,573
- And where the hell is Stark?
- I don't know.

255
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,825
You were saying how
dangerous this experiment is.

256
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,819
What happens if Henry's
asleep at the switch

257
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,718
when the big bang goes boom?

258
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,243
It's bad, isn't it?

259
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:29,779
Yeah.

260
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,413
Do my shoes match my dress?

261
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,750
- What?
- Just look at me for a second.

262
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,589
- Wait... No. I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

263
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:44,967
How do you feel?

264
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,437
Hungry.

265
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,307
Do you feel like
you're thinking clearly?

266
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,028
What was the question?

267
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,957
You gotta focus for me, okay?
You gotta get on your phone,

268
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,084
and you're gonna have to call
a meeting of experts.

269
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:19,278
Good. Good.

270
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,420
Wait. A meeting with who?

271
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,341
Anyone involved in that experiment.

272
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:25,424
It's gonna explode
if you don't keep an eye on it.

273
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,024
- Yeah.
- Right.

274
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:29,561
Oh, Wait. Do I need to push 9 first?

275
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:33,599
Carter, I'm kind of busy.
Can't run here every time you call.

276
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,879
Thank God you're normal. Started
to think I was the smartest one here.

277
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,271
We got a major problem.

278
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:41,482
People are regressing.
They're starting to act dumb.

279
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,345
Dumb?

280
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,654
So what's the protocol? What do we do?

281
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,705
Only one thing we can do.

282
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,494
Pull my finger.

283
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,375
<i>What do you mean,</i>

284
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:00,688
they're stupid?

285
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,338
I mean stupid. Like... Stupid. stupid!

286
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,673
Carter, you can't catch stupid.

287
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,011
This may be my favorite
conversation of all time.

288
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,500
Look, something happened to Allison
and Henry and Stark and who knows else.

289
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,142
But it happened  in the middle
of that chaotic inflation thing.

290
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:18,561
You left that thing running
without anyone watching it?

291
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,088
We got it covered.

292
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,064
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

293
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,619
You gotta clear out that building
before that thing blows.

294
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:28,229
- It could take out the whole facility.
- Don't worry about it, we'll fix it.

295
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,990
What? We always fix it.

296
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,589
We don't always fix it.

297
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,434
Henry does it sometimes,

298
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,705
or Stark, or Allison.

299
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:39,123
I'm just saying, we usually have
smart people to lean on.

300
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:42,084
Hey, I'm smart. I'm plenty smart!

301
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,036
I mean... science smart.

302
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:45,796
Don't get snappy.

303
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,922
- OK, you're coming to GD.
- I'm not touching that experiment.

304
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:53,396
If I start pushing buttons, I could
accelerate the decay of that field.

305
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,516
- Need the guy who designed the machine.
- You said they're all dumb.

306
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:01,720
We need to figure out why. Let's start
with a list of all the people affected.

307
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:02,897
How you feeling?

308
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:04,945
You feel dumb?

309
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:06,224
No. You?

310
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,526
How could you tell?

311
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,362
Might be just affect the people at GD.

312
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:13,656
I'll head up there,
you pull evacuation plans.

313
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:15,531
You should help.

314
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:20,172
- How you holding up?
- Well, people keep calling.

315
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,359
I was making a list
of scientists for you.

316
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:25,711
Okay, here it is.

317
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:30,969
Everybody on this list works for
a different department at GD.

318
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,484
What do they have in common?

319
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,051
- Well, they all work here.
- Thank you. Yes.

320
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:39,648
Very helpful.

321
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,794
Have you shut down all the...

322
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,104
dangerous projects?

323
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:44,855
No. That's a good idea.

324
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,190
I'll write that down.

325
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,345
No, no, no, I'll do it!
I'm the head of Global.

326
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:50,861
- Okay. I know, I know.
- Just listen, I...

327
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,989
Look, I pulled all manuals from the...

328
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,824
the c-chaotic thingy, and...

329
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,453
I don't understand any of it.

330
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,499
We're gonna figure this out. I promise.

331
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,258
I'm scared.

332
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:09,380
- I feel like I'm losing myself.
- Why don't you stay here?

333
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,576
S-sit down, and you stay at work.

334
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,080
And I'll go find a doctor.

335
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,937
A normal doctor. Okay?

336
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,914
We're gonna sort this out.

337
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,516
I hope.

338
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:36,991
Excuse me. Are you...

339
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,534
dumb?

340
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,622
Sorry. What's the square root of 3,006?

341
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,667
- Don't know.
- Apologies.

342
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,573
I was never any good
at combinatoric math.

343
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,672
But if you threw me a couple of
Chomsky nominal form equations,

344
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:54,066
- I'm your gal.
- Great.

345
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:57,428
There's a dumb virus going around, you
gonna help figure out what's causing it.

346
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:58,512
A dumb virus?

347
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,068
Yeah. Wish I could. But, see, I'm a vet.

348
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:07,980
And if you brought me a marmoset
with cognitive decline,

349
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,737
I'd be happy to help. But...

350
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,375
I... no. I...

351
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,654
don't work on people.

352
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:16,969
- Today you do.
- No. You don't want me to.

353
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:18,157
It's not good.

354
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:27,679
You're wearing one of my presents
under there, aren't you?

355
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:29,919
Come on, you can tell me.

356
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,054
Okay.

357
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:37,573
I deserved that.

358
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:40,094
This is nice work.

359
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,522
How did you get enough phase power
for the field and the biometric lock?

360
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:44,959
Redox battery?

361
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,460
No. It's a nano-titanite cell.

362
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,079
Sweet.

363
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,197
How do you keep the amp load
from shorting out?

364
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,861
It's a dielectric waveguide.

365
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:57,163
Nice.

366
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,200
Hey, do you have the specs
on that chaotic inflation test?

367
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:03,619
Why?

368
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,747
Why don't you let me take a look
at the containment structure for you?

369
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,668
And if I'm helping you,
maybe you could help me.

370
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,336
And here it comes.

371
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:15,214
There's only one thing
I want from you, Jo Jo.

372
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,428
A sandwich.

373
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:22,048
Yeah, the Geneva Conventions state
that I get a sandwich for lunch.

374
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,053
And you'll read this.

375
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,217
And help.

376
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:30,521
Yeah.

377
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:37,121
<i>Marco!</i>

378
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,140
<i>- Marco!
- Marco!</i>

379
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,071
<i>Polo.</i>

380
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,497
<i>One of you says Polo.
The game is Marco Polo.</i>

381
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:50,653
<i>God.</i>

382
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:52,767
<i>- Polo!
- Polo!</i>

383
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:56,119
Tell me you found something.

384
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,591
Well, I'm not sure,
because this really isn't my field.

385
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,846
However, everybody I've tested seems
to have a critically low level of GABA.

386
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:05,890
I didn't know I had any GABA.

387
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,052
Gamma amino butyric acid.
It's a neurotransmitter.

388
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,457
Okay, and if you don't
have enough, it...

389
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,899
- Lowers intelligence?
- It could, yeah.

390
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,176
Critically reduced levels cause
Alzheimer's disease in monkeys.

391
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:19,069
Okay, so where's it coming from?

392
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,072
- Air conditioning, water coolers...
- I have no idea.

393
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,778
And our neuropharmacologist
is currently playing candyland.

394
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:27,669
Okay...

395
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:32,320
Gather everyone who's thinking straight,
meet me in the conference room... Fast.

396
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,501
Conference room.

397
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,546
All right, we got a botanist,

398
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,299
a math theorist, a chemist,
a nutritionist,

399
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,621
and a... lepi... potomus.

400
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,561
- Lepidopterist.
- Right.

401
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:45,915
Butterflies.

402
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:47,213
Fantastic.

403
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:51,400
All right, everyone, if you wanna gather
around, I trust you've been briefed.

404
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,856
You all know that the big bang device
is in danger melting down.

405
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,317
And the people who built it
are incapacitate. So...

406
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:01,675
who do we have who can help
with this experiment?

407
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:05,475
You know, it's not their field.

408
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,360
You need a physicist
or maybe a molecular theorist.

409
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:10,204
Great, we got a room full of geniuses

410
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,579
and all we can do is eradicate plant rot
and do triage on a butterfly.

411
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,478
Let's switch gears.

412
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:18,977
All right. What we have to do
is cure someone who can help us.

413
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,964
If we can find out what's knocking down
the GABA, maybe we can reverse

414
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,164
the mental decline.

415
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:26,136
Right? So, who can help
with that? Anyone?

416
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,505
GABA knockdown...

417
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:32,586
- You. What do you do?
- Epigeneticist.

418
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,729
The butyric acid cycle could be affected
by any number of factors.

419
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:37,356
Enzyme overgrowth,

420
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:41,193
- radiation exposure, a virus.
- Radiation can cause this?

421
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,655
If it disrupts the TRNA synthetase.

422
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,741
Okay, well, the chaotic thing

423
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:51,031
- was pumping out a lot of radiation.
- No. I don't think so.

424
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,052
I've done studies with radiation
on animals before,

425
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:55,839
and that device would have to be tuned

426
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,836
to a precise wavelength
in order to cause this effect.

427
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:03,966
What if somebody
was tuning it on purpose?

428
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,677
- Ooh. Well, it's possible...
- They'd have to know

429
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:08,637
big bang nucleosynthesis
and string theory.

430
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:09,773
Yeah.

431
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,746
I have a guy in my jail cell
who might know those things,

432
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:16,046
and he'd think it was pretty hilarious
to turn everyone at GD into a moron.

433
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,023
Alright. Work on curing Allison
and all the others.

434
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:21,515
Any of you with a medical background,
you go with Dr. Glenn.

435
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:22,828
The rest of you...

436
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:25,978
Start learning physics.

437
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,560
<i>Carter, we got a problem.</i>

438
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:32,990
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

439
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,253
<i>No, it's about Zane.</i>

440
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,970
Are you sure you locked the cell?

441
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,586
Of course I locked the cell.

442
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,442
We gotta find him.

443
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,913
Well, we can track him with these.

444
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,052
Or even better...

445
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,268
He got out of the bracelet.

446
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:56,018
He... How?

447
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,819
By mistake...

448
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,172
I may have told him
how to hack the lock.

449
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:07,251
All right. Thanks, sergeant.

450
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,519
The state police are on
every road out of town.

451
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,719
They'll find him.

452
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:14,758
No, they won't. He's good.
He knows how to hide.

453
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:16,664
Well, we've got the GD computer.

454
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:18,985
It's running probabilities
for any escape route,

455
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:22,018
every phone call he's ever made,
every map he's downloaded.

456
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,905
No one in this world knows any better
than this computer.

457
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,157
Someone might.

458
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,764
That's awesome.

459
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,045
I know.

460
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:37,164
Hey, where is everybody?

461
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:38,891
Carter had me send 'em home.

462
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:41,091
Something about a... chaotic...

463
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,305
Something or 'nother.

464
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,029
Ah, was it that thing I helped build?

465
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:50,508
Yeah.

466
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:53,136
I remember something like that.

467
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:55,828
You okay?

468
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,211
Not even.

469
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:00,973
Can't keep a thought in my head
for, like, ten seconds.

470
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:02,835
Car's busted.

471
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,361
Nothing to do.

472
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:06,611
That's bunk.

473
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:17,090
Still the smartest guy I know.

474
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,008
Not saying much.

475
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,650
What if this doesn't get better?

476
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,039
I guess we'll just be dumb together.

477
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:01,873
You know, breaking
and entering's just a bad idea.

478
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:04,261
Well, I must say I'm impressed.

479
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:07,691
What did you do, refocus
some of your satellites to pick me up?

480
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:10,114
Figured 50 miles from Eureka
was far enough.

481
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:12,550
No. You vacationed here
when you were ten.

482
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:14,448
I figured it's off the main roads,

483
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,684
a place to hide out
for a couple of days first.

484
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,788
Well, I guess my FBI file was
more detailed than I thought.

485
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,178
It's not in your file.

486
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,459
Then, that computer of yours must
have an amazing predictive algorithm.

487
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:26,982
Didn't use a computer.

488
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:29,546
I called your mother.

489
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:34,593
You called my mother?

490
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,566
I need to know what you did.

491
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,943
Okay.

492
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:45,241
You were right.

493
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:47,189
That cell has a damn good lock.

494
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:50,028
I had to order a new master key
off the Ithaca lock web site.

495
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,490
They run a pretty tight ship.

496
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:53,362
I had to give your social
security number.

497
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:56,531
That's not what I'm talking about. What
did you do to the big bang experiment?

498
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:59,243
- What are you talking...
- What did you do to make them stupid?

499
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:02,146
- That's crazy!
- All right, this isn't a joke anymore.

500
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:04,665
Okay? This is serious. I need
them back on their game.

501
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:07,000
You think I would intentionally
mess up that experiment?

502
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:09,833
- Yeah. And I'm running out of options.
- Well, I wouldn't.

503
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:11,808
Because it's beautiful.

504
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:14,087
If that thing up there works, it's...

505
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,051
It could change the laws of physics.

506
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,065
Then why are you running from it?

507
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:23,892
As I see it, there are two sides.
You're with me or you're against me.

508
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:28,241
It's your problem. Why should I help?

509
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:31,258
Because if you'd stop being a selfish
jackass for more than 5 seconds,

510
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,443
you might discover
you could be a part of something.

511
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:36,807
A community.

512
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:40,242
What makes you think I give a crap
about finding a community?

513
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:41,710
Because we all do.

514
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,604
And you're smart enough to know that.

515
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:50,811
- He's just standing there.
- He's thinking.

516
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,200
Well, he doesn't look like
he's thinking. He looks sick!

517
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,621
That's because containment's
down to 14%.

518
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:58,280
When that chaotic device blows,
that field's gonna fail.

519
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,726
You got 43 minutes to find a way
to make it stronger.

520
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,398
Yeah, so figure it out.

521
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:04,330
And the answer is...

522
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:05,752
Clear the building.

523
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:09,146
- Anyone who's still here, get 'em out.
- Non essential personnel are gone.

524
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:12,149
Focus, all right?
You're one of the top guys here.

525
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,501
You not only won
the Spadaro foundation award,

526
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,194
they don't bother to give it anymore.

527
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:19,323
Yeah, they stopped giving it out because
someone stole Mrs. Spadaro's money.

528
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,981
They hacked her system.

529
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,620
Even I couldn't find how.

530
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,207
If I couldn't help her,
I can't help you.

531
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,708
It would take me 18 hours
to rebuild that thing.

532
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,416
And if it blows without containment,

533
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,628
it'll cut right through the metal
shielding and gut the building.

534
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:35,856
Well, you're all we've got.

535
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:37,644
So...

536
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,186
Could you bring in more shielding?

537
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,753
That's good!

538
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,640
It would take at least 100 tons
of metallic hydrogen sheets.

539
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,010
- That's not good.
- How about another field

540
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:49,557
around the field or double it
or reinforce it with something?

541
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,565
- Duct tape!
- Yeah, like duct tape.

542
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,398
It's a layered particle field.

543
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:56,818
The only way to reinforce it
is with another layered particle field.

544
00:29:57,623 --> 00:30:00,161
- Keep going.
- Like an emergent graviton field.

545
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:02,126
- The bracelets.
- They're in the car.

546
00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:04,368
Go! I'll crack the control circuits.

547
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,788
Well... So does that mean we're good?

548
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,254
<i>All right, we're going to build a second
force field to contain this one.</i>

549
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,787
I need binned gradients
and a way into the aiming circuit.

550
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,919
<i>Danger... Containment level critical.</i>

551
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,388
- Guys, this is where you say something,
- I think it was...

552
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,848
- Red.
- Or red-like.

553
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:29,114
- Yeah, definitely.
- Fantastic.

554
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,149
- Found it!
- Awesome!

555
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:37,691
<i>We're in business.</i>

556
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,303
Here! Got 'em.

557
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:41,845
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

558
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,865
- Not helping.
- What else do we have to do?

559
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,370
The bracelets generate
charged gravitons.

560
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,370
If I can jack into
the aiming circuit, get the

561
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,956
timing, I might reinforce
the field to contain the explosion.

562
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,584
I have not a clue
about anything you just said.

563
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,294
He's gonna contain it.

564
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:00,364
- What?
- I'm sorry, Jack.

565
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:03,510
I just realized this is how
you must feel all the time.

566
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:07,266
Thank you, Henry. Very kind.

567
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,513
I think you want to turn on
that extra shield now.

568
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:11,977
No. I've gotta time it right.

569
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:13,977
I overcranked
the snot out of this thing.

570
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,984
The field only lasts three seconds.

571
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:17,232
Not yet.

572
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,276
Not yet.

573
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,288
Don't let me die in this crap town.

574
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:34,327
Now!

575
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,875
So that's what all the fuss was about?

576
00:31:58,998 --> 00:32:00,939
Are you kidding? It's the big bang,

577
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,574
the beginning of the beginning.

578
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,947
This data's gonna keep
physicists busy for 50 years.

579
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:08,226
It kinda looks like a scoop of...

580
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:09,743
rainbow sherbet.

581
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,285
I think it's... It's pretty.

582
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,200
Not as pretty as you.

583
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,750
Oh, that's so sweet.

584
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,566
How are you feeling?

585
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:23,646
Kinda hungry.

586
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:31,969
The machine's off. Why is everybody
still acting like a moron?

587
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,684
Because the experiment wasn't the cause.

588
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:36,895
Are you sure?

589
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,500
The experiment
produced hawking radiation.

590
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:42,109
And all of these tests prove that

591
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,106
doesn't affect brain tissue.

592
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,114
Um... So what's causing this?

593
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:48,247
I don't know.

594
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,034
And I don't know how to reverse it.
So what do we do now?

595
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,204
We don't give up.

596
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:56,393
Okay.

597
00:32:58,197 --> 00:32:59,222
Okay.

598
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:09,514
I called the CDC and the NIH.
They're on their way.

599
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,550
Good! What are those?

600
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,489
The CDC is
the Center for Disease Control,

601
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:18,645
and the NIH is the National...

602
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,273
Something of Health.

603
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,317
No. Anyway... Dr. Glenn

604
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,276
is gonna be taking all the...

605
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,446
affected people to GD

606
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:30,336
for some tests.

607
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,617
You're a real good friend, Jack.

608
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,041
I just...

609
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,498
I just feel bad 'cause
I keep things from you.

610
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,334
- What are you talking about?
- The Beverly stuff.

611
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,504
You know...

612
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:45,922
What she did to Kim.

613
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,394
What did Beverly do to Kim?

614
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,642
Maybe you could find out.
You're really good at that stuff.

615
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,899
Yeah, sure. Sure.

616
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,231
How... That's... That's cool.

617
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:05,859
- Can I try?
- Oh, yeah.

618
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,278
Stay with me. We're talking about Kim.

619
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,781
You... You can have
a turn right after me.

620
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,993
Sheriff, come here! Come here!

621
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:18,621
Yeah. Hey... Sam, good.
We could use a boost of brain power.

622
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,984
Meet my latest and greatest...
Madame Ofenskaya.

623
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:23,706
- Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

624
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:25,670
She's pittsburgh's best astrologer.

625
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:29,132
Slap her to a telescope,
you'll be talking to aliens by Kwanzaa.

626
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:31,176
Don't you mean astronomer?

627
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,319
What's the difference?

628
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,192
Oh, crap.

629
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,558
Well, you can get in line for the yo-yo.

630
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,092
Now Sam's got it, he didn't go
anywhere near that experiment.

631
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,490
Right.

632
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:48,725
Hey, Vincent, can I get another
chicken san? It was dee-lish.

633
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,862
Oh, sorry. We're fresh out.

634
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:53,323
Vince, you can order some more.

635
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:56,243
From where?

636
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:57,869
From right there.

637
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,919
You are smart!

638
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:10,845
And you're not.

639
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,176
- And he's not.
- Can I...

640
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:14,300
Let me yo.

641
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,138
- I wanna...
- No, no.

642
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:17,973
Henry... did you have

643
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,954
some tasty chicken yesterday?

644
00:35:20,556 --> 00:35:21,726
Sure. We all did.

645
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,864
Right. I didn't. Neither did Zane.

646
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,424
I'm a vegetarian.

647
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:36,848
Oh, please, Sheriff.
That sounds kinda nutty.

648
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:39,536
Maybe. But everybody who was
affected had your chicken.

649
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:41,527
Do you use growth hormones?

650
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,412
Tetracycline, nafcillin?

651
00:35:43,713 --> 00:35:46,296
My chicken is completely organic.

652
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:47,840
Right, okay.

653
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,972
Maybe something's getting
into their feed.

654
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,048
I need to see your livestock.

655
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,840
- Where's the rest of them?
- He's the only one.

656
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:01,641
Took me seven years of somatic

657
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,144
cell transfer and
DNA stripping to make Chester.

658
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,417
He's a clone?

659
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:07,484
He has ears, you know.

660
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:10,442
Little rhode island red,
mix in some golden

661
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:13,069
montazah, a dash of lakehorn and...

662
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:15,789
He's the perfect bird.

663
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,779
Aren't you, chester?

664
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,618
Yes, you are!

665
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:23,379
If you only have...

666
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:25,353
If...

667
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,020
If you only have one chicken,

668
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,303
then where's the meat come from?

669
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:48,442
Oh, this may be the grossest
thing I've ever seen.

670
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,775
Where do you think chicken comes from?

671
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:53,026
From chickens.

672
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:55,980
Chickens that have been murdered,
but not anymore.

673
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,432
The avian holocaust is over, my friend.

674
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:01,738
So you're growing independent
parts from stem cells?

675
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:03,256
It's a breakthrough.

676
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,416
I used to clone the whole chicken.

677
00:37:05,553 --> 00:37:07,801
Now I just grow the parts
people want to eat

678
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:09,417
so I don't have to kill anything.

679
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:11,544
If you're growing...

680
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:14,294
Meat with no brain,

681
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:16,674
then... Is it safe?

682
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:18,917
It's perfectly safe. It's organic.

683
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:21,971
And with my new grow lights,
five times as productive.

684
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:23,883
I just installed them.

685
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,031
Maybe your grow lights
are making the meat

686
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,028
five times as stupid.

687
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:31,402
So, disconnected from the neural net,

688
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,396
the only way you can make these...

689
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:38,113
Pieces of meat grow
is if you flood it with bicuculline.

690
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,999
Yes, but that's organic.

691
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,693
It's a plant extract.

692
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:43,451
The grow lights enhance the process.

693
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:46,020
But it's also a GABA blocker.

694
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,323
- GABA. Hey...
- Yes.

695
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,354
It's depressing the GABA production,

696
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,626
and it's causing the cognitive decline.

697
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:53,966
Oh, my god.

698
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,506
I had no idea.

699
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,537
Do we have to tell Chester?

700
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:04,339
He'll be so ashamed.

701
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:07,392
<i>That'll do it?</i>

702
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:09,834
The sulfonate should
flush out the biculline

703
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,939
and bring the GABA back into balance.

704
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,104
- Maybe.
- Well, why wouldn't it work?

705
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:16,736
Because I'm winging it here.

706
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,904
Maybe is the best you're going to get.

707
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,103
I'm gonna be okay. I...

708
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,699
I have to go first.

709
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:30,745
They're my people.

710
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,478
Don't worry about it.

711
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:35,050
She's very smart.

712
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,100
It'll work.

713
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:39,476
Okay, this might hurt just a little bit.

714
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,648
I'm actually not very good with people.
I'm used to giving shots to mangabeys.

715
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:44,124
What's a mangabey?

716
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:46,613
No idea.

717
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,100
Hold on. There. Good.

718
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:00,129
You know, as scary as it was being dumb,
it was also kind of liberating.

719
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:01,374
Speak for yourself.

720
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:04,339
What, you found nothing
positive in the experience?

721
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:06,567
Maybe one thing.

722
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,247
So, all the facts of the world

723
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:12,595
at your fingertips again?

724
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,001
Hen oida hoti ouden oida.

725
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:18,379
Either that's very profound,
or you're badly brain damaged.

726
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:21,834
What's the project status?

727
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:25,113
Well, everyone at GD wants
to get their hands on the data.

728
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:27,555
- All big bang whores.
- They'll have to wait.

729
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,485
You get first crack at it.
After Nathan, of course.

730
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:32,685
- Thanks.
- Well,

731
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,994
if you will excuse me,
I've a building full of people

732
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:37,863
who are behind on their work,
starting with those two.

733
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,941
And you can get going
as soon as Carter thinks

734
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:41,569
you're ready to be on your own.

735
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:47,867
So... Any idea when that might be?

736
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,158
When you're too old to run.

737
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:52,677
Nah, go.

738
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:54,830
Find the secrets to the universe.

739
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:59,166
I think I'm gonna get some pie.

740
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:03,197
- Vince, can I get a slice of pie?
- Sure.

741
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:06,157
Wait a minute.
I keep one bomb from exploding,

742
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:07,830
and you think you can trust me?

743
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:09,128
No, it wasn't that.

744
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:12,475
It's was Mrs. Spadaro.

745
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:14,827
Turns out she's giving
her award this year because

746
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,405
someone made
an anonymous gift to her foundation

747
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,233
of $3.1 million.

748
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,192
You gonna turn me in?

749
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:27,169
There's a federal statute
protecting the anonymity

750
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,117
of charitable donations. So...

751
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:32,021
Mrs. Spadaro's money is safe.

752
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,539
- Thanks, Vincent.
- Yeah.

753
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,750
Thanks. I guess you want these back.

754
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:40,412
I'm sure you'll find some use for them.

755
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:42,462
Thanks.

756
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:48,680
The ballet.

757
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:50,994
What?

758
00:40:51,428 --> 00:40:53,369
Take her to the ballet.

759
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:57,645
But if you get out of line,
I will make those cuffs permanent.

760
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,490
Thanks for the tip.

761
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:00,680
It's all right.

762
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:11,899
You okay?

763
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,983
I'm 16. My parents are divorced.

764
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,982
And I live in the weirdest
small town on earth.

765
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,745
Yeah, you know, I'm awesome.

766
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,494
You're also the sheriff's daughter.

767
00:41:21,631 --> 00:41:23,171
Oh, yeah. Than for reminding me.

768
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:25,499
Honey...

769
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,946
People use labels
to make their life easier.

770
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,797
You know, which is fine. But...

771
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,433
You define who you are.

772
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,560
You have to...

773
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,748
Break people's expectations.

774
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,814
Oh, my god. That's Jasper.

775
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,485
That's cute?

776
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,114
Yeah.

777
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:52,849
Okay, you know what?
It's time to break expectations.

778
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:54,604
No, that's not what I meant.

779
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,751
That's your dad.

780
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,308
Yeah, but...

781
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,380
he's cool with me going,

782
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,734
if you still want to.

783
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:09,249
To my parents' lake house
for the weekend? Sweet.

784
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:11,427
I mean, if you still wanna go.

785
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:13,745
Oh, my god, yeah. I mean, I'm so there.

786
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,918
No, you're not.

787
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,937
Yeah, Sheriff?

788
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,450
I'm watching you.

789
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,945
He's... He's not being serious.
