00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Just a normal day in Eureka:</i>

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,701
Day's not over yet.

3
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,402
Yeah, like that was gonna last.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,471
Hello, 1947.

5
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:07,872
Confused?
Let me clarify.

6
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,840
The five of us got
transported back in time,

7
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,275
through some worm-hole thingy,

8
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,626
thanks to the bridge device.

9
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,261
We eventually found
our way back home,

10
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:16,428
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

11
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:19,768
Henry? Married.
Zane and Jo never dated.

12
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,542
But Jo's in charge of GD security.

13
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:24,484
Kevin, different,
much to Allison's surprise.

14
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,723
And Fargo,
the head of global dynamics,

15
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,160
much to everyone's surprise.

16
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:30,865
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride back with us

17
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,737
to the present, where
there was one crappy rule.

18
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,942
We can't tell anyone.

19
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,944
If people ever found out
about our trip,

20
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:37,979
we'd be in trouble.

21
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,115
And I finally kissed Allison.

22
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:42,418
63 years ago.

23
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:43,921
Which complicated things a bit

24
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,589
when I found out
that Tess never left.

25
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:47,892
Look at you, handsome.

26
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,262
Tess! You're not in Australia.

27
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,298
Yeah, that would be true.

28
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:53,700
She's pretty amazing.

29
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,036
Must be why you asked her
to move in with you.

30
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:59,207
I spend a year realizing
we don't work as a couple.

31
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:01,842
We break up, and she's here,
thinking that it's great.

32
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,410
But that's Eureka for you.

33
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:05,447
Same town, big changes.

34
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,031
Last item, nolweps.
Where are we?

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,896
On track, sir.

36
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,362
You'll be really pleased
with the progress

37
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,197
in that whole nolwep area.

38
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:25,967
Good, so I can expect them
to be ready for field testing

39
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:27,368
by next month?

40
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:29,203
I'll get back to you on that, sir.

41
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,439
Today, Dr. Fargo. Today.

42
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,341
Of course, sir.
Over and out.

43
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,210
[Beep]

44
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:37,045
Sorry to interrupt.

45
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,413
Just wanted to let you know
I was running home

46
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,282
- to see Jenna for a bit.
- What's a nolwep?

47
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,984
- What? Calm down.
- This job is hard.

48
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,852
I can't tell Mansfield I don't
know what he's talking about

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,754
or he'll have me fired or killed,

50
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,022
and I think those are the same to him.

51
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,423
Okay, Fargo, take a deep breath.

52
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,392
Nolweps are non-lethal weapons

53
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,960
used for crowd control
and peacekeeping.

54
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,695
Dr. Parrish runs the lab.

55
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,263
- Non-lethal.
- Section three.

56
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,399
Dr. Parrish. Got it.

57
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,935
Okay, just so you know,
he can be a bit of a handful.

58
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,670
Maybe you should come with me.

59
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,305
Fargo, you're the boss now.

60
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,973
You can handle it.

61
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,908
Section three.

62
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,977
I can handle it.

63
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:20,088
- Vinny, can I get a coffee?
- You got it.

64
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,790
And we've got plenty more
boxes if you need them.

65
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,792
Thanks, Vince.

66
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:25,393
Hey, babe.

67
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,995
- Hello.
- You excited?

68
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,898
About...
The movers coming today, yes.

69
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,933
Oh, don't tell me that you forgot.

70
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,535
- How could I forget that?
- Okay, well, listen,

71
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,970
they've got the furniture
and the big stuff.

72
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,639
But I have at least another
carload or two to go.

73
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,740
I don't trust some dude
named Boris with my cat.

74
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,709
Yeah.

75
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,144
You've got a cat?

76
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:44,879
We're...

77
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,180
You know, I'm...
I'm more of a dog guy,

78
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,415
but yeah, yes, yeah.

79
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:50,418
My catadioptric telescope.

80
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:51,652
Oh, that cat.

81
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,420
You gave it to me for my birthday

82
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:56,456
last year.

83
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,525
Vince, I'm gonna need a double.

84
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,927
- Coming up.
- Okay, honey, come here.

85
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,629
Mmm, I'll see you at home.

86
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:04,631
Kinda love the sound of that.

87
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,866
Home.

88
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,767
Bye.

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,974
What's the matter, sheriff?

90
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,242
You don't exactly look delighted

91
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,810
that Dr. Fontana's moving in.

92
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,579
You should be.
She's a peach.

93
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:23,148
Yeah, well, it's...
No, shut up.

94
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,583
It's your fault.

95
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,218
I already had to break up with
her once, and it sucked.

96
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,820
And now I have a second chance
that I'm not sure that I want.

97
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:31,155
Well, I don't know
if that's my fault entirely.

98
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,857
Oh.

99
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,692
And if you're not sure,
sport, don't tell me.

100
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Tell her.

101
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:38,029
Not that it's any of your business,

102
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,497
but I don't want to hurt Tess.

103
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,868
You can't always
be the good guy, sheriff,

104
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:46,136
not that it is any of my business.

105
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:47,137
Uh-huh.

106
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,271
Have a good day.

107
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,240
Good day.

108
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,479
Wow.

109
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:00,049
Look at me...

110
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,517
Oh, other me.

111
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,386
Nice.

112
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,722
I was gonna go with
"disturbing" but okay.

113
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:07,323
Thanks for coming with me, Jo.

114
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,825
I'm head of security now.

115
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,693
You're my boss...
Also disturbing.

116
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:13,595
It says here I assigned Zane
to the nolwep lab.

117
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,896
Don't care.

118
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,399
So you're not looking
to rekindle things?

119
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,801
In this reality,
nothing's ever even happened.

120
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:21,404
He's that snarky jerk I first met,

121
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,306
but I am not gonna let him get to me.

122
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:27,176
Why does everyone keep avoiding me?

123
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:30,077
Dr. Fargo.

124
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,244
Oh.

125
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,777
I am...I'm so sorry.

126
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,311
Are we gonna have
to be worried about that?

127
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,911
No, no, no.

128
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,478
Nope, all good.

129
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,813
And I will have that report
to you by noon today, sir.

130
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,284
No one's ever called me "sir" before.

131
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,886
Looked to me like he was scared

132
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,354
of you.

133
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,189
Anson.

134
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,393
Biological pathogens lab.

135
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,361
Oh, no wonder.

136
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,963
Apparently I moved the guy's
deadline up three times

137
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,931
and wrote him up
for underperforming.

138
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,800
Other me is kind of a jerk.

139
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:08,202
You didn't get that from the posters?

140
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:14,474
Dr. Parrish, hello.

141
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,409
I was hoping for a demonstration.

142
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,479
Another surprise inspection.

143
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:19,748
Goodie.

144
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,850
They're so productive.

145
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,524
The latest nolwep prototypes
are still in development.

146
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,824
They're not ready for demonstration.

147
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,293
General Mansfield is expecting one.

148
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:39,463
We just need to see
what you've got.

149
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,465
Anytime you want, Lupo.

150
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,533
Fine.

151
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,436
Stand here.

152
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:50,670
I can see why they didn't want him

153
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,639
in the lethal weapons lab.

154
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,006
Unidirectional plasma field.

155
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:58,310
Allows passage from your side,
not from ours.

156
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,581
Cool.

157
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:04,782
- Zane.
- Relax.

158
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,717
Just shoots bean bags.

159
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,621
Not cool.

160
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:14,156
I told you it wasn't ready.

161
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,264
[Bees buzzing]

162
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,532
Africanized honeybees.

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,367
Since when are killer bees
non-lethal?

164
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,403
They're test subjects
for the riot suppression system.

165
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,071
Bee and human brain
chemistry are similar.

166
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,340
The R.S.S. Neurochemically
induces feelings

167
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,509
of serenity and trust.

168
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,844
A crowd beamed with the R.S.S.

169
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:40,979
Will peacefully disperse.

170
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:42,981
Watch how it calms the bees.

171
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,882
[Energy pulsates]

172
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,120
Not seeing the calming.

173
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,188
Still adjusting the signal strength.

174
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,729
Does anything in this place

175
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:06,797
actually do what it's supposed to?

176
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:11,968
[Metallic rattling sound]

177
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,437
I wouldn't poke at those if I were you.

178
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,739
They're immobilization mines.

179
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:17,140
I-mines shoot a gel webbing

180
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,708
that hardens on contact, restraining...

181
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:21,510
Forget it. Just send me
all your design specifications

182
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,878
and fix this.

183
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,580
Fix it all.
[glass shatters]

184
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,226
The bridge device?
Or what's left of it anyway.

185
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,428
I got a new name,
I got a new identity.

186
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,896
I need a project, and this...

187
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,230
Well, technically I own this already,

188
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,665
so Douglas trucked it...

189
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:50,800
We cannot rebuild
the bridge back to your time.

190
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,935
And even if we could,
you've seen too much.

191
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:55,770
I mean, it would be
potentially catastrophic.

192
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:57,906
Maybe we could use it
for something else.

193
00:07:57,973 --> 00:07:59,240
I don't know, it could be repurposed,

194
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:00,741
say, for space travel.

195
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,542
I don't know, history's full of accidents

196
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,710
that led to invention.
Come on, Henry!

197
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,178
The contacts are fried,
and you'll never be able

198
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,512
to rebuild the power coupling.

199
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,913
You say that, but I never had access

200
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,214
to materials like this,
technology like this before,

201
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,050
not to mention your expertise.

202
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,085
[Sighs]

203
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:20,622
All right, there is a chance

204
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,024
that I can replace the blown conduit

205
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:27,562
with a high T.C. Superconductor.

206
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,164
Chance favors the prepared mind.

00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:31,535
Louis Pasteur?
You're giving me Louis Pasteur?

208
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,978
Come on, what do you say, partner?

209
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,214
For old times' sake.

No.

"The nolweps are semi-operational."

00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,228
No.

215
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,997
What's this doing out here?

[Beeping]

217
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,866
Blinking.

218
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,703
And beeping.

219
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:10,839
Hey!

[I-mine beeps faster, louder]

00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:18,779
At least it works.

Jo?

223
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:21,882
Someone?

224
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,250
Anyone?

225
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,151
Help.

227
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,246
this was an assassination attempt!

228
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,114
Easy, Fargo.

229
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,783
An assassination attempt
with a non-lethal weapon

230
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,984
seems a little pointless,
don't you think?

231
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,120
I almost suffocated.

232
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,254
And these were my favorite pants.

233
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,689
Sure it wasn't just a prank?

234
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,424
Even if it was, this is still an attack

235
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,858
on the Director of .D.

236
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,860
Well, technically the other
Fargo was director of...

237
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,495
Well, now this Fargo's boss,

238
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:00,130
and he demands a full investigation.

239
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:01,631
And if you stop talking about
yourself in the third person,

240
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:02,632
I'll look into it.

00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:03,699
[Clears throat]

242
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,233
The head of security for G.D.,

243
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,734
and I will look into it.

244
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,302
Nice suit.

245
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,637
The mine came from Dr. Parrish's lab.

246
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,406
We'll start with him and Zane.

247
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,907
Ah, Zane, what a shocker.

248
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:15,376
Seriously, Jo, you dodged a bullet there.

249
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:18,045
Smug, disruptive horndog bullet

00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,746
with his stupid t-shirts and...

251
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:22,719
Maybe I'll talk to Zane.
You talk to Parrish.

252
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,889
Fine.

253
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,624
Oh, hey, sheriff, vinspresso?

254
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,225
I'm working.

255
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,426
And then he's unpacking.

256
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:30,694
- Ah.
- Uh-huh.

257
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:33,331
Just taking a scone break.

258
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,933
Oh, is it okay if I use the top drawer

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,569
in the bathroom?

260
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,671
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

261
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,472
Oh, and my cat

262
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,842
looks great on the mantel,
by the way.

263
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,513
The mantel's for Mickey Mantle's bat.

264
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,148
His bat, not cat.

265
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,686
Okay, yeah, I can... I can put it back.

266
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,056
- No problem.
- Okay.

00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,957

[Loud thud]

269
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,462
Nothing. Sorry, I...
Let me just deal with this.

270
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,232
Hey, Zane,

271
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,633
could I talk to you about
the mine that went off on Fargo?

272
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:12,803
Booting me from one brain-dead
assignment to another.

273
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,604
The guy deserves what he gets.

274
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:16,639
Are you saying that you did it?

275
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,174
I'm saying he's a tool.

276
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,242
I've been here for hours.
Ask Vincent, law dog.

277
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,276
Dah!

278
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,280
Zane, you okay?
Zane!

279
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,748
Za...Wha...

280
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:29,583
You all right?

281
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,986
Any idea how your I-mine
got into that hallway?

282
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,455
Aside from me putting it there?

283
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:36,190
Explain now.

284
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,891
You heard Dr. Fargo.

285
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,026
He demanded a demonstration,

286
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:41,594
so I gave him one.

287
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,229
I wouldn't want his report
to be incomplete,

288
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,131
now would I?

289
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:50,902
Non-lethal weapons
are very serious business.

290
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:52,837
We're not done.

291
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,873
Dr. Parrish admitted
to setting the I-mine.

292
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,676
I knew it.
Why does everyone hate me?

293
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,177
Oh, everyone doesn't hate you.

294
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,679
Most express indifference
to mild dislike.

295
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:06,180
Really?

296
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:09,383
I found this on the firing range.

297
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,985
Don't you think you're
kinda asking for it?

298
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,754
I want Parrish brought to justice.

299
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,456
Oh, I'm sure
he didn't mean any harm.

300
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:19,158
Have you considered why
he reacted that way?

301
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:21,093
Impossible deadlines,
pitting labs against each other,

302
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,827
surveillance everywhere.

303
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:24,195
That wasn't me.

304
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:26,230
Why am I on the hook for what
other Fargo did?

305
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,298
You need to talk to Parrish now,

306
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,267
convince him and his team
that you're gonna reinstate

307
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,568
a calm and respectful
working environment.

308
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:36,571
Oh, I'll talk to him all right.

309
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,872
We better go with him.

310
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,140
Good idea.

311
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,042
Ah, hey, sweetheart.

312
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,779
You remember,
Dr. Charles Grant, sweetheart.

313
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:49,215
He's our new science historian.

314
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:50,416
Oh, it looks like they've

315
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:51,717
already put you to work, Charles.

316
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:52,784
Uh-huh.

317
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,419
Oh, barium aluminate.

318
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:57,521
You're building an electron gun.

319
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:58,788
Can I help?

320
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:01,392
Oh, sure. Absolutely.

321
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,727
I mean, it's not...

322
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:06,197
It's not gonna be terribly interesting.

323
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,633
All right, you boys play with your toys.

324
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,470
I will be at Cafe Diem editing
that paper for the academy

325
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,605
if you need anything.

326
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,374
And I apologize for the state of the place,

327
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,341
those shabby old tools.

328
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,743
Sometimes Henry acts

329
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,277
as if he's been a bachelor his whole life.

330

[Chuckles]

331
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,655
You know, if I was married
to a girl like that,

332
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,259
that knew how to build
an electron gun...

333
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,928
But I'm not the man she married.

334
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:42,334
Let's...
Let's try the circuit.

335
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,837
Hey, Henry, thanks for this.

336
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,305
It means a lot.

337
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,806
Ready?

338
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,074
Yeah.

339
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:52,042
- Here we go.
- Okay.

340
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,943
[Machine humming]

341
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,343
Oh, my God.

342
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,710
Oh, my God.

343
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:58,877
We're in business.

344
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:01,477
I can attach
the particle chamber directly,

345
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:04,779
and the increased density will...

346
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,450
- Did you... Just see that?
- Yeah.

347
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,053
Good.

348
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,890
What did we just do?

349
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,795
[Clears throat]

350
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,564
Attention, everyone.

351
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:30,032
I apologize for disrupting your work.

352
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
- I apol... Really?
- Do it.

353
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:34,135
Fine.

354
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:37,472
I apologize for disrupting
things here today.

355
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,573
Your work is important.

356
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:44,044
Your work is important
to Global Dynamics.

357
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,912
And to me.

358
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,047
Right.

359
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,616
You sit up there in your office

360
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,917
lording it over all of us.

361
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,650
The only time you ever
come down here

362
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,451
is to harass us or snoop around.

363
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,986
I didn't want to put you on the spot,

364
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:59,022
but general Mansfield needed...

365
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,391
Of course, Mansfield.

366
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,591
And what's that supposed to mean?

367
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,692
Okay, calm and respectful, Fargo.

368
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,095
You're nothing but Mansfield's puppet,

369
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:09,863
his lapdog,

370
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:11,097
his tool.

371
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:12,565
What's up with the creepy eye thing?

372
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,733
You think you actually earned

373
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:16,902
that fancy job of yours, kiss-ass?

374
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,570
Okay, there's something
wrong with him.

375
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,239
Apologize, Parrish, or else.

376
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,707
Fargo, just let it go.

377
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,175
Or else what?

378
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,310
You gonna unleash
your goons on us?

379
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:26,878
Well, who you calling a goon?

380
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,145
You're just pissed 'cause
none of the crap

381
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,947
in your stupid Toys"R"us lab works.

382
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,015
I'm pretty sure the I-mine
worked just dandy.

383
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,349
Wouldn't you say?

384
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,884
- Why you... Apologize!
- Never!

385
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,119
It's about time
somebody stood up to you,

386
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,453
you little tin pot dictator!

387
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,288
Shoot him, Jo!
Shoot him now.

388
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,390
All right, everybody,
let's just calm it down, okay?

389
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,058
- Parrish, put down the gun.
- Hold on.

390
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,893
Put the bean bags down now!

391
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,260
Stop.
Oh... Ah!

392
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,695
[Groaning]

393
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,902
Stop!

394
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:59,070
[Alarm sounds]

395
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,572
Before something like that happens!

396
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,248
Allison's taken everyone
to the infirmary for testing.

397
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,283
All discernable chemical leaks
have been contained,

398
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,319
but I'm still ordering
a lockdown and quarantine.

399
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,155
I'm back at "all discernable leaks."

400
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,758
Just let me do my job, okay?

401
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,092
Okay.

402
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,360
Find out what's making
them act like that.

403
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,828
And the freaky eye thing,

404
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,397
first Parrish, then Fargo.

405
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,965
Well, it could be
some sort of a brain virus

406
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,901
or... or Hulk juice.

407
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:26,703
Dr. Anson, meek little guy,

408
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:28,371
dropped a beaker earlier,
a red liquid.

409
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,106
Anybody nearby
could have been exposed.

410
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,008
- Which lab?
- Biological pathogens.

411
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,778
Bio... And this didn't concern you?

412
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:37,814
The biohazard filters
didn't show anything unusual.

413
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,316
Well, it could be some sort
of new, undetectable

414
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:40,317
super germ.

415
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:41,785
We gotta find out...

416
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,554
All posts, be on the lookout
for Dr. Chris Anson.

417
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:47,191
Detain him by any means necessary.

418
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,727
Uh, Jo.

419
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:53,130
I'm wondering if you might
have been a smidge exposed.

420
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm fine.

421
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,635
Everything is under control.

422
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:04,807
Right.

423
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,139
Fine.

424
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,097
This is an outrage.

425
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,678
I demand to be let go.

426
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,349
So everyone is negative

427
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,846
for chemical exposure from the spill.

428
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,572
Leukocyte and histamine
levels are normal.

429
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:16,783
There's no infection.

430
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,126
So it's not contagious.

431
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:20,078
Fargo out.

432
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,732
Fargo, wait.

433
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm also seeing unusual
levels of adrenaline,

434
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:26,903
elevated blood pressure,
and heart rate.

435
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:28,371
I need to keep you under observation.

436
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,990
I have a facility to run,
in case you've forgotten.

437
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:34,893
And you're getting in my way, again.

438
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,111
Fargo, come back here.

439
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:37,328
Blah, blah, blah.

440
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,129
Keep everyone inside
the infirmary, please.

441
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:40,864
Hey, I got your call.
You need a hand?

442
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,299
Yes, please, I really do.

443
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,834
If you can... Check her out.

444
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,402
Okay.

445
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,889
It has been a little tense
around here today.

446
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,122
Oh, yeah? Not just here.

447
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,222
Why, is something wrong?

448
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,471
Well, I was... I was
hoping that you might know.

449
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,489
It's like Jack has cold feet
all of a sudden

450
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,723
about the move.

451
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,524
I finally make the leap,

452
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,891
and now I'm not so sure
that he wanted me to.

453
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,924
You know, Carter hasn't
been himself lately.

454
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,439
Why don't you just, you know,
give him some time?

455
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,339
Allison, I've given him the past year.

456
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,371
I thought that we were on
the same page about this,

457
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,320
you know?

458
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,602
Yeah.

459
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,820
Tess.

460
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:22,555
I thought you were packing.

461
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,290
Actually, I had her come in

462
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,391
to work with Dr. Anson.

463
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:29,477
Yeah, he's been developing
a viral psychotropic,

464
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:31,428
- amongst other things.
- Could that be the reason

465
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:32,929
why people aren't acting
like themselves?

466
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,830
I sure hope so.

467
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,182
Unless there's something else
that you wanna tell me.

468
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,050
Stage three quarantine in place.

469
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,419
- All exits have been sealed.
- Look, I really gotta go.

470
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,569
Yeah, well, take your time.

471
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,871
We're not going anywhere.

472
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,608
This kinda thing happen
often around here,

473
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:58,740
objects disappearing into thin air?

474
00:18:58,808 --> 00:18:59,723
No.

475
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,374
Well, not a lot.

476
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,892
Not to me.

477
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,310
I can't figure it out.

478
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,663
All the components seem to be...

479
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,314
Inert.

480
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,668
The device is not causing
the dematerialization.

481
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,070
Wait.
What if I...

482
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,924
Oh, my God, it's us.

483
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:29,941
It's us.

484
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,727
It's us!

485
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,445
Oh, hey!

486
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:37,649
Thought you might be hungry.

487
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:40,184
So are you boys
putting something together

488
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:41,485
or are you taking it apart?

489
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:42,569
- Putting it together.
- Taking it apart.

490
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:43,720
Taking it apart again.

491
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,655
We were actually debating

492
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,374
under what hypothetical conditions

493
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:51,927
a person might cause an object

494
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:53,696
to dematerialize.

495
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:54,980
Interesting.

496
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,365
Possibly exposure to certain radiation.

497
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:59,867
Pair annihilation would
cause a huge gamma ray burst.

498
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,135
We would have noticed the E.M.P.

499
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,253
Yeah, what about passing

500
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,154
through a small rupture
in space-time?

501
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:06,356
[Chuckles]
Right, but that's impossible.

502
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:08,558
Right, that's impossible.

503
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,310
Uh...

504
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,694
Well, carry on.

505
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,213
Turkey sandwiches.

506
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,698
Ugh.

507
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,499
- There he is.
- Dr. Anson!

508
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,550
What? Huh?

509
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,517
What do you want?

510
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,765
One sec.

511
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,998
Thought you said he was meek.

512
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,799
He was.

513
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:39,167
Okay.

514
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,885
Why don't you put down
the giant lunch box of death?

515
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,103
Okay.

516
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,221
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,588
What was in the beaker
you spilled?

518
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,172
Easy, Jo.

519
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,807
You don't wanna talk.

520
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,924
Take it easy, Jo.

521
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:58,711
Uh-oh.

522
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,262
It's happening to me too, isn't it?

523
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,013
Yeah, big time.

524
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,552
What did you do?

525
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,795
Okay, Jo, let him go.

526
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:08,793
Let him go.

527
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,925
[Grunts]

528
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:11,398
Let... Let him go. Let him go.

529
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:13,069
There you go.

530
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,419
Let him go. Let him go.

531
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:16,795
It's over.
Okay.

532
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:19,487
All right. Stay with me.

533
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:20,961
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

534
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,008
Stay with me.

535
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,250
With this, we find out what's going on

536
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,350
and we fix it, okay.

537
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:32,988
Come on, come on.

538
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,591
[Grunts angrily]

539
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,159
Hey.

540
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,425
Anson's coat and the zombie
juice he spilled on it.

541
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,025
Great, this should help
isolate the cause.

542
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,791
Good thing too,
because the medical results...

543
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,192
What do you want me
to do about it?

544
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,693
See? And it's spreading.

545
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,195
These people here, all new cases.

546
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,563
What's wrong with everybody?

547
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,931
I don't know, they're all angry.

548
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:53,601
These are the physical
and mental symptoms of rage.

549
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:55,970
So we're dealing with
a bunch of mad scientists?

550
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,473
Well, some madder than others.

551
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,410
I mean, everyone deals
with anger differently,

552
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:01,980
depending on personality, physiology,

553
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:03,816
learned coping mechanisms.

554
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,986
Emotional control can vary widely,

555
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:09,325
but everyone here seems to be losing it.

556
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,427
Losing it?

557
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,029
What do a bunch
of pampered scientists

558
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,332
have to be upset about?

559
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,634
Shh, shh, quiet.
Keep your voice down.

560
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,672
Everyone's got stuff
building underneath

561
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,042
that they need to vent.

562
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,712
Okay.

563
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,614
Well, of course you would say that.

564
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,983
You think that it's better
to let things go unspoken.

565
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,551
What?

566
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,052
Sure, yeah,

567
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,720
I mean, if it's gonna
make things more complicated

568
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:31,588
or someone's gonna get hurt.

569
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:33,857
I think that Tess would disagree.

570
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:35,391
I'm her friend, Carter.

571
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,926
She knows that there
is something wrong

572
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:38,227
between you two.

573
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:40,596
- I'm going to talk to her.
- When?

574
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:41,797
Things are getting worse around here

575
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:43,131
in more ways than one.

576
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,768
Allison, I have everything under control.

577
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,804
[Shouting, scuffling]

578
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:50,675
Power grid failure.

579
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:53,878
Emergency backup engaged.

580
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:56,347
Power grid failure.
Emergency backup engaged.

581
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,619
You were saying?

582
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,913
I knew I shoulda gone with them.

583
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,114
What is that?

584
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,682
An effigy?

585
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,350
Doesn't even look like me.

586
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,384
What are you doing about it?

587
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,386
I'm trying not to throttle someone.

588
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,953
Don't push me!

589
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:23,289
Jeez, it's like
a Romero movie out there.

590
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,124
Tested the stuff on Anson's sleeve.

591
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:26,959
It's raspberry wine cooler.

592
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:28,293
What is he, a High School cheerleader?

593
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:29,828
Well, unless it's a new bio-weapon,

594
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:30,996
we're no closer
to figuring this thing out.

595
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,163
Okay, just say it.

596
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:33,931
I drove Anson to drink on the job.

597
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,165
Are you enjoying my failure?

598
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,766
All right, more tests on Dr. Parrish

599
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,001
might isolate the neurological anomaly.

600
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,603
Here come the big words.

601
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,037
What genius idea
does Dr. Perfect have

602
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:44,072
to rattle out next?

603
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,507
- Fargo.
- You people are useless.

604
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,908
The situation is critical out there.

605
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,544
You're wasting time.

606
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,345
Jo, Jo, Jo.
Get outta my way, Carter.

607
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,448
Wait, you can't walk out,
not like this.

608
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:57,117
Right, because you know how
to do my job better than me,

609
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,285
just like always.

610
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,720
That's not what I'm saying,

611
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,055
trust me.

612
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,561
Move! Now!

613
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:06,597
Move now.

614
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:08,031
Jo.

615
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:09,968
Listen to me.

616
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,436
Okay, listen to me.

617
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:15,873
Wait, wait.
You can hold this together.

618
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:21,345
We can't fix this without you.

619
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,315
Jo.

620
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,350
[Groaning]

621
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,064
Fargo, let's go.

622
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,565
You can do this.

623
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,549
Tess, are you in here?

624
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,154
Where the hell are my guards?

625
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,658
My staff is all gone too,

626
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:18,726
and they let all the patients go.

627
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,563
Not all of them.

628
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,103
Tess must've tranquilized him

629
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:31,737
to help save him from himself.

630
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,714
What's wrong with him?

631
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:46,717
High fever, shallow breathing.

632
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,452
Ahh!
[screams]

633
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,059
[Grunting]

634

[Screams]

635
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:08,501
If this is happening to him...

636
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,270
The others will be getting
worse, and so will you.

637
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,406
I gotta find Zane while I still can.

638
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:23,214
Oh, and it's all my fault.

639
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:32,422
Scientific discovery
starts with bold ideas,

640
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,289
you said.

641
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:38,192
The me that never was said that.

642
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,761
Yeah, I took the liberty
of looking myself up

643
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:43,263
in the archives.

644
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,564
And there was no Nobel Prize,

645
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,933
nor the institute that you founded.

646
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:50,702
Well, no, because I wasn't
in my own time to do them.

647
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,270
I was here.

648
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:56,842
I'm...I mean, I am here.

649
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,545
It's confusing.

650
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,249
Everyone I know is gone.

651
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:09,454
Everything I might have done
has been erased.

652
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:12,056
So you see, Henry,

653
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:13,958
this machine,

654
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,660
it's all I got.

655
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,431
[All shouting]

656
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,239
Zane?

657
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,141
[Groaning]

658
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,147
[Chuckles]

659
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:42,648
Look at you.

660
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:44,083
[Laughs]

661
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,817
What kinda career is this
for a grown man?

662
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:48,920
You musta really rocked
that aptitude exam.

663
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:50,755
I wanted to be a librarian!

00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:56,193
[Groans]

665
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:00,529
You need to come now.

666
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,798
Bite me, Lupo.

667
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,036
Don't tempt me.

668
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,240
[Groans]

669
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:16,075
Big affirmative on Zane being infected.

670
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:17,609
I'm taking him to the infirmary

671
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:19,877
before I kill him myself.

672
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,980
Copy that, Jo. Hang in there.

673
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,049
We're on our way.

674
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:26,350
Jack, Jack.

675
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,185
Tess, yeah?

676
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,386
Parrish came after me in the infirmary.

677
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:30,353
- I had to tranq him.
- Okay.

678
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:31,587
Whatever happened to him

679
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:35,223
is getting worse.

680
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,558
Hey!

681
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:40,227
That's G.D. Property.

682
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:42,396
Oh, crap, run!

683
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:43,496
Run!

684
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:45,798
Go, run!

685
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,772
Go, go, go!

686
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,342
[All shouting]

687
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,476
You're all fired!

688
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,875
Good job, Fargo. Problem solved.

689
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,176
This is insane.
Most of G.D. was affected.

690
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:12,682
Well, all of G.D...

691
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:14,183
Except for you,

692
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,651
and me, and Allison.

693
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,922
So that means we weren't here

694
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,524
when whatever happened happened.

695
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:24,825
Right, so where... Fargo?
Where'd it start?

696
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:28,895
Eh, I'm trying to think.

697
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:31,497
[Groaning]

698
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:33,865
[Shouting, clattering]

699
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,749
We were all here before we got mad...

700
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,451
Parrish, Zane, Jo, and me.

701
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,019
And now we just need to figure out

702
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,087
which of the 50 projects could do that.

703
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:56,055
I'm going with the frisbee ray

704
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:57,823
pointed at the tank of dead bees.

705
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:59,191
Allison, we think we figured out

706
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,624
where the anger epidemic started.

707
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:02,693
Can you make it down to Parrish's lab?

708
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,995
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.

709
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:08,997
[People shouting, growling]

710
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:16,168
Move.

711
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:43,860
Allison? Jo?

712
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:45,694
What's going on?
Are you okay?

713
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,098
We're trapped with
two jerks and a murderous mob.

714
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,933
Thanks for asking.

715
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,334
Jack, we have to go get them.

716
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:54,534
Yeah, we're working on it.

717
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,668
If I die because of you, Parrish,

718
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:56,903
you're a dead man.

719
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,204
Very helpful, Fargo.

720
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,671
You wanna check on the bees?
Tess?

721
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,039
Already on it.

722
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:03,842
Why do I get the stupid "bee-topsy"?

723
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,144
Because you can't kill dead bees.

724
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,412
Allison, is Parrish there?
Can he help us?

725
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,380
Fargo, I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?

726
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:11,448
I'm gonna rip that stupid face

727
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,283
off that tiny little head of yours.

728
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,519
That would be a "no."

729
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:18,021
And my head's plenty big.

730
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,756
Well, Parrish's brain
is basically overheating.

731
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,090
It's being flooded with vasopressin,

732
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:24,259
a neurochemical linked
with anger and aggression.

733
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:25,860
No kidding. Is Zane there?

734
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:27,861
Can he tell us what the ray
in his lab does?

735
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,029
The R.S.S.,

736
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,198
it does three things.

737
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,000
- One, two...
- Okay, never mind.

738
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:35,735
Can't you just ask Fargo?

739
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:37,336
Dealing with the bees here.

740
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:38,537
Okay, okay.

741
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:39,871
Deep breath.

742
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,575
Happy place.
The R.S.S.?

743
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:46,245
It was designed to produce oxytocin

744
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,249
to induce a calming effect.

745
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,483
Oxytocin differs from vasopressin

746
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,552
by only two amino acids.

747
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,787
I mean, structurally
they're almost identical.

748
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:56,488
Vasopressin killed the bees too.

749
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:58,889
Looks like the prototype
triggered the wrong chemical.

750
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:01,325
No, but that thing didn't work.

751
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:02,792
Parrish cranked it up and nothing.

752
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,060
Yeah, but if the bees were already angry,

753
00:32:04,127 --> 00:32:06,529
could you even tell
if they got more angry?

754
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:07,830
No, you couldn't.

755
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:10,032
The R.S.S. fires infrasonic waves.

756
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,933
That means that it can
penetrate through walls,

757
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,001
which is why the whole
building was affected.

758
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,669
Okay, so what happened
to Zane and Parrish

759
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,805
when the ray went off
happened to all of G.D.?

760
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,239
Oh, that's just great.

761
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:21,207
So the calming ray is an anger ray.

762
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,908
What can go wrong next?

763
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,075
[Clattering, shouting]

764
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,049
Carter, Carter, they're getting in.

765
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,018
Jo! Jo, why...

766
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,589
Why are you...

767
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:43,461
All right, we lost Jo.

768
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,462
Carter, the tranqs aren't gonna hold.

769
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,764
The vasopressin
is overwhelming their systems.

770
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,867
You have to reverse the effects fast.

771
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,602
Carter...

772
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,671
Allison.

773
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:54,839
Okay, we gotta move fast.

774
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,107
Can you flip the switch,

775
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,775
make the anger off, happy on?

776
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,543
Are you kidding me?

777
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,778
"Hello, I'm sheriff Carter.

778
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:04,213
I'm gonna save the day
with my everyman logic."

779
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,548
[Laughs]

780
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:06,783
Hey, we're on the same side,

781
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,984
and I don't sound like that.

782
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,353
Yeah, you do.

783
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,821
Well, a little bit, but look, look, look.

784
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:13,122
I think that you might be right.

785
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:16,024
I think that we can retune the beam.

786
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:17,258
In order for it to reach people in time,

787
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:18,325
we'll have to amplify the signal

788
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:19,860
and set it off in a central location.

789
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,328
Hello!
Homicidal maniacs out there.

790
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:24,297
Well... I'm thinking.

791
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:26,098
No, no, no.

792
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,567
I'm the boss, me.

793
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,402
[Cell phone rings]

794
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,870
What now?

795
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:33,972
Dr. Fargo, I've been
expecting your call concer...

796
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,740
Go frak yourself, Mansfield.

797
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:36,741
[Cell phone beeps]

798
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:38,909
Fargo, not helping!

799
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,410
Pull it together, Fargo.

800
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,046
This isn't about you.
Allison's stuck in zombie land.

801
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:45,247
Why are you so mad?
I thought you were unaffected.

802
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,482
I'm not! You're pissing me off!

803
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,684
Well, I'm the head of G.D.,
so you can shut the hell up

804
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:51,319
and do what I say!

805
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:55,156
[All shouting]

806

Attention, un... Stop, stop.

808
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:10,134
Stop.

809
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:13,570
All this started with Fargo.

810
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:17,107
Huh? You want him?

811
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:18,741
Carter, what are you doing?

812
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,577
Go get him!

813
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,845
This is his fault.

814
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:24,146
Carter!

815
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:25,747
It's his fault!

816
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,116
You're better than this.

817
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:30,218
He's a terrible man.

818
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:31,219
Back off.

819
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:33,822
Ahh!

820
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,223
He did this to you.

821

Ahh!

Ugh, I'm just relieved

835

everyone's not mad at me anymore.

I'm still a little mad at you.

I apologize for the I-mines, Dr. Fargo.

838
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:18,169
It was immature and unprofessional.

I'm... Glad

840
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,706
you're back to your old self, Dr. Parrish.

You do have a tiny head.

I'm so glad.

843
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:34,380
I'd better call Mansfield
and get the groveling over with.

844
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,382
I bet you never had to do that.

845
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:38,016
Yeah, you'd lose that bet, Fargo.

846
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,285
Hey, it doesn't really matter

847
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,220
if I think you can do the job,

848
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,954
although I do.

00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:46,924
It only matters that you do.

She did a great job today.

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,508
She did.

856
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:06,609
She did, especially
knowing how she feels

857
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:08,244
about me right now.

858
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:11,846
And not to mention how she's
gonna feel about me later.

859
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:13,848
You gonna tell her?

860
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:15,549
Yeah.

861
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:17,350

I'm sorry, Carter.

Yeah, me too.

864

But you can't always be the good guy.

865
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:29,862
Right?

866
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,800
Our readings show

867
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:37,002
only standard background radiation.

868
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,270
So unless you can measure

869
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:39,707
an aberrant quantum fluctuation...

870
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:41,642
No, there's only one other option.

871
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,210
We could be manifesting

872
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,446
a negative stress energy tensor field.

873
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,014
But if that's true...

874
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:49,517
Then anything we touch
could be sent backward

875
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,319
or forward in time, and lost forever.

876
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:56,057
Dr. Monroe, stay back.

877
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,191
Why? What's wrong?

878
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,326
Don't come any closer, please.

879
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:00,960
Something's happened to us,
I can't explain it,

880
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,727
but anything that we touch...

881
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:04,095
Disappears?

882
00:38:04,163 --> 00:38:07,297
And you can't explain it?

883
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,000
Really?

884
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:13,502
I don't understand.

885
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:18,940
They're for you.

886
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,143

those old tools of yours
until they fall apart,

888
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:26,648
so I coated them with thermal
depolymerization paint.

00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,751
poof.

891
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,119
It's a gag. It's a prank.

892
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:36,021
No, I... I got it.

00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:38,022
I'm just getting back at you

894
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,024
for magnetizing all my pots and pans.

895
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,860
That was one of your better ones.

896
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,661
See, this is something that we do.

897
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:44,729
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

898
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:48,032
Okay.

Henry, I don't know
what's going on with you,

900
00:38:50,335 --> 00:38:53,203
but will you let me know
when you're yourself again?

901
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:07,415
She is something else.

902
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:08,816
If I didn't know better, I'd say you had

903
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:10,784
a little crush on your wife.

904
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:16,156

00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,425
Much better.

907
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,693

you'd never know

00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,399
we had a full-blown insurrection.

911
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,733
Great.

912
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,135
Guess I can't avoid
going home any longer.

913
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,670
You were great today.

914
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,205
How you kept it under control
even with Zane, that was...

915
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:36,241
I couldn't have done it
without you, Carter.

916
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,242
And years of special forces training.

917
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,310
Well...

918
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,313
Hey, what you said

919
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,282
about my thinking I know
how to do your job and...

920
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,419
It's fine. I wasn't myself.

921
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,388
Well, just if...

922
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,490
If that's what you think,

923
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,192
I'm sorry.

924
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,128
If I stepped on your toes,

925
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,296
it's just because

926
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,199
I miss you.

927
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,734
I miss my deputy.

928
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,006
Wow.

929
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,074
We make a good team.

930
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,343
Always will.

931
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,612
Yeah.

932
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,717
So you gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on me?

933
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,052
No.

934
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,553
You had that coming.

935
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,623
Yeah, think I know someone
who might agree with you.

936
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,692
Good luck.

937
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,868
[Door opens]

938
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,347
The movers?

939
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,719
I cancelled them.

940
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,821
Fair enough.

941
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,894
Was it the cat?

942
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,530
Was it... the drawers?

943
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,532
I mean, do you just
wanna slow things down?

944
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,733
Because...

945
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,734
No.

946
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,907
Tess, you deserve the truth.

947
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,712
So here it is.

948
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,915
I'm so sorry, Tess.

949
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,919
I'm... so...

950
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,988
So sorry,

951
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:36,758
but I don't think we should
move in together at all.

952
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:55,442
So what next?

953
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:00,815
Well...

954
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,191
I think you should take
that job in Australia.

955
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:11,227
I think it's what you're meant to do,

956
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,796
and I know that you're gonna
be happy there.

957
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:17,430
How could you possibly know that?

958
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:20,332
I just do.

959
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:26,504
The same way I know that you and I

960
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:30,440
are not meant to be.

961
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,710
And I wanted to save you the pain

962
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,479
of watching it all unravel.

963
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:37,414
Too late.

964
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:46,854
Sorry, Tess.

965
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:56,867
I love you.

966
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
