1
00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:02,380
<i>Previously on</i>
Eureka.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,885
I would love to know
who's responsible for all this.

3
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:08,739
I am.

4
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:11,321
Well, you're not alone.

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,047
You have friends.

6
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:18,937
Marry me, Allie...

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,250
Again.

8
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:32,328
All I'm saying is that it's a big step,
and I'm a little surprised at myself,

9
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,755
but, it's unsettling.

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,094
I'm almost 17...
Lots of kids my age are doing it.

11
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:37,999
Kids your age are doing lots of things.

12
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:41,065
- I thought you'd be proud of me.
- I am, I am!

13
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,988
I'm just adjusting
to my little kid growing up.

14
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:47,375
I'm waitressing part-time at Café Diem.
Not like I'm walking down the aisle.

15
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,221
I know, and that place isn't safe.

16
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,429
Who knows how many radioactive isoscopes

17
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,933
Vincent has flying around
that nuclear reactor he calls a kitchen.

18
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,207
Isotopes...

19
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:59,437
And it's fusion reactor.
It's not fission... It's much safer.

20
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,076
Not helping.

21
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,943
- So, are you gonna see Henry?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:06,998
It's time for my weekly chest whipping.

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,656
It's his hearing, today,
so, it might be the last one.

24
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,076
They're not gonna convict him.
I mean, they can't... He's Henry.

25
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:17,567
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Just...

26
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,457
Wear a lead apron.

27
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:22,786
Okay.

28
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,966
Triple campucinne
double foam latte for Zane,

29
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,969
and Bavarian espresso hammer for Jo.

30
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,264
I'm here...
Where do I start?

31
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:37,559
You are late little Miss,
so, you can start by bussing tables.

32
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:39,244
Great.

33
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:43,326
Doing the final test of the Viper,
today.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,531
You wanna celebrate, later?

35
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:47,216
Obviously.

36
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,795
- What?
- I'm just wondering,

37
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,330
when you're gonna quit playing hard
to get and give me an answer.

38
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,645
I want to, Nathan.

39
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:05,096
There's a reason why things
didn't work out with us, before.

40
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:07,818
You always put your work, first.
It...

41
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,884
Allie, I'm not that guy, anymore.

42
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,452
How can I prove it?

43
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:17,140
I think you're gonna be given a chance.
The DOD liaison's gonna be here, soon.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,894
- They're not gonna fire you.
- Yes, but, what if they do?

45
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,606
What if the DOD blames me
for Henry's breach, and reinstates you?

46
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,775
You'll be my hot little assistant.

47
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,863
- I'm serious.
- It's gonna be fine...

48
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,157
I promise.

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,578
It's Fargo.
Viper test is ready... We better go.

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,005
Oh, my goodness...
Guess who popped the question!

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,122
Big test today, Fargo.

52
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,080
DOD will be here.

53
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,367
Don't push the wrong button.

54
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,206
Shut up, Larry.
You all set, Dr. Edison.

55
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,859
Yes, I am...

56
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,760
Prepare for defeat, boys.

57
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:22,225
Martha here is gonna make me proud.

58
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,636
Oh, my God...
What's she doing here?

59
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,385
The Fixer.

60
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,293
Her latest book makes
Sensu look like Mary Poppins.

61
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,217
You are so dead!

62
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,195
- Who's "the Fixer?"
- Eva Thorn,

63
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,993
the woman's a wall street legend.
She's dismantled and rebuilt

64
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,815
more fortune 500 companies,
than anyone in history.

65
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,826
She coined the term "downsizing,"
fired Lee Iacocca.

66
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:49,670
Why would the DOD send
a corporate killer to Global Dynamics?

67
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,479
Guess is, not to hand out promotions.

68
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,112
Oh, God...
This is it... Here she comes.

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,251
- Eva Thorn, this is a huge honor.
- You must be Douglas Fargo.

70
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,628
She knows my name...
She knows... She know my name!

71
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,173
Fargo, I have a feeling
Miss Thorn knows everyone's name.

72
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,594
- Doctor Blake, please, call me "Eva".
- Pleasure.

73
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,623
And I assume tall, dark and brooding,

74
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,641
here, is Nathan Stark.

75
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,763
Eva, I am so curious,

76
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,147
as to why the Department of Defense

77
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:31,733
would send a business tycoon to Eureka.

78
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:33,417
I'm here to help.

79
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,622
The DOD asked me
to review operations for a few days.

80
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:42,061
See if I can offer up
any suggestions for improvements.

81
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,579
Here in Eureka, we have
the greatest minds in the world,

82
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,751
solving the greatest mysteries
in the universe.

83
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,699
Can't put a price tag on that.

84
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:54,172
Maybe you can't,
but I'm pretty sure I can.

85
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:56,953
Global Dynamics is gonna have
to start earning it's keep,

86
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:58,968
and I believe I can help you do that.

87
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:00,865
Show me what you got.

88
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,391
<i>Stand by, all personnel.</i>

89
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:12,355
<i>Viper defense system
initialization sequence will begin.</i>

90
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,756
This is GD's advanced weapons
testing facility.

91
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,879
The variety of terrain options afford us
many different attack scenarios.

92
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,561
So, tell me what you're testing, today.

93
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,539
The Viper anti-Missile defensive ray

94
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,347
makes the Star Wars program
look like an erector set.

95
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:32,129
System can track up to twelve targets.

96
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,089
The turrets admits haffie empowered
photons in control bursts.

97
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,299
We've had 19 successful tests.

98
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,302
- Today, should make a perfect 20.
- Not if Martha can help it.

99
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,517
Martha?

100
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:45,235
Ethan Edison...
Ethan, this is Eva Thorn.

101
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,433
He designs our target drones.

102
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,333
Martha's my latest design.

103
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,833
I really think she stands
a chance against the Viper.

104
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:55,274
Manning the Viper with Fargo
in the GD control room is Zane Donovan.

105
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:59,153
He's been working with Dr. Stark on
perfecting the Viper's tracking system.

106
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,226
The same Zane Donovan,
who crashed the New York Stock Exchange.

107
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:05,528
<i>Allegedly.</i>

108
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:07,328
All right...

109
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,990
<i>Let's show Miss. Thorn
what the Viper can do.</i>

110
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,583
You go it.
Viper system is online.

111
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,419
Tracking system

112
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:15,952
<i>is active.</i>

113
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,131
Dr. Edison,

114
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,258
time for a little target practice.

115
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,789
The drones will proceed
1,000 meters down range,

116
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,789
then, turn back
and commence the simulated attack.

117
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,898
The Vipers mission...

118
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:34,605
knock them all down.

119
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,228
<i>Here they come.</i>

120
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,703
<i>Viper's locked and loaded.
Stand by... She's about to go high.</i>

121
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,654
- Anytime, now!
- There's only one drone left.

122
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,265
Come on, Martha.

123
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,603
Dr. Stark, what's going on here?

124
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,774
Hold on...
Martha is targeting the Viper.

125
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,326
What the hell.

126
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,489
Hit the failsafe!

127
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,538
Martha's not responding
to any of my commands.

128
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,083
Impressive.

129
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:47,553
Great.

Rook takes rook on G7.

134
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:07,872
Check.

135
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,122
Patience, Jack...

136
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:17,208
Sometimes,
the best offense is a good defense.

137
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:20,567
Speaking of which,
is that why you fired your lawyer?

138
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:23,509
It is... In my case,
there is no defense.

139
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,510
I lied... I endangered lives.
I put Global Dynamics at risk.

140
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,400
But, you also saved Allison's son.

141
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:33,467
Doing the right thing
for the wrong reason is still a mistake.

142
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,742
Rook on G7 to G8.

143
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,399
That's not what I'm talking about.

144
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,576
Some things

145
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,053
can't be forgiven.

146
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,990
No matter how much I wish they could.

147

Knight takes pawn on D5...

148
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:52,988
Check mate.

149
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,138
Check mate.

150
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,277
What's going on?

151
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,979
The DOD's confiscating
Henry's equipment, as evidence.

152
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,832
Evidence of what...
That he never threw anything away!

153
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,544
Don't take that.

154
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:28,215
The court order says everything goes.
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,449
Well, that isn't right.

156
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,541
Allison know about this?

157
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,839
I think she's focused
on more personal matters.

158
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,445
Yeah... Like what?

159
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,915
- You know.
- Nope.

160
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,709
She hasn't mentioned
any new developments?

161
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,212
- Yeah.
- Stark... proposed.

162
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,923
- You okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,266
Yeah, good for her.

164
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,830
She's happy... I'm happy.

165
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,128
- Sure.
- Absolutely... Yeah.

166
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:06,400
You know... We didn't have a future.
Didn't even have a present.

167
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:09,963
If you say so.

168
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,606
What was that?

169
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,278
Wait for it.

170
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,636
Let me guess...
Someone lose a UFO?

171
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,171
It's not a UFO.

172
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,091
It's a military attack
drone named "Martha".

173
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:33,511
- Well, that's so much better.
- And it's not lost, it's just not here.

174
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,680
Yeah, but, the Fixer is
and given her reputation,

175
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,140
if we don't find it,
none of us may be here for long.

176
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,602
- Hold on, a fixer is...
- Silly nickname, but what can you do?

177
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:44,981
Carter, this is Eva Thorn.
She's doing a performance review of GD.

178
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,567
- You got your work cut out for ya.
- So do you.

179
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,964
Let's get Ms. Thorn settled
and continue our tour,

180
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,571
while the Sheriff handles this.

181
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:56,466
Any spare office will do. I just need
some place to keep my things safe.

182
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,274
Already taken care of,

183
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,789
and I would be honored
to show you around.

184
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,916
Give us a chance to talk
about your new book,

185
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,337
"Great rewards require great risk."

186
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,234
I couldn't agree more.

187
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,823
Big reader, Larry.

188
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,957
Never judge a book by it's cover,
Sheriff.

189
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,177
- Shall we?
- Lead the way.

190
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:20,875
I really hate him.

191
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,312
Carter, we have to get that drone back.

192
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:26,600
I can't exactly arrest it for speeding.

193
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,806
We're trying to reestablish
microwave control,

194
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:32,381
but we believe the guy
who built her is trying to protect her.

195
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,340
Why would he wanna protect the UFO?

196
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,909
His name is Ethan Edison.
He's in the section seven test range,

197
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:41,241
and you should go Sheriff him up.

198
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,626
Your fiance is in a mood.

199
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,314
- How did...
- Small town.

200
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,423
Oh, I haven't said yes.

201
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,676
Well, it's none of my business.
Now, I got a UFO to catch, so...

202
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,002
I don't know what happened.
I swear I stayed within test parameters.

203
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,852
- Look, nobody's blaming you.
- I'm blaming you.

204
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,362
Nineteen tests,

205
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,716
that's 19 victories for the Viper,
nineteen losses for me.

206
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,642
I finally win, everyone's mad at me.

207
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,647
- Nobody's mad at you.
- I'm mad at you.

208
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:17,073
We're just trying to figure out
why your fancy clay pigeon went AWOL.

209
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,259
Martha is a learning computer, okay?

210
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,577
And she is developing
at an incredible rate.

211
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:25,153
It's like she went from being a toddler
to a teenager, over night.

212
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:28,535
Well, your teenager just stole a car,
a gun, and ran away from home.

213
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,461
Now, she's dangerous,
and we need her back.

214
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,046
Believe me, Sheriff,
I'd like nothing more.

215
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,838
But given her current state of mind,

216
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,843
the last thing that you should do,
is threaten her.

217
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,721
Well, okay, given...
But we need this fixed.

218
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,392
Martha's not responding
to her control signal

219
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,408
and she's flying below radar range.

220
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,523
Eureka's electro-magnetic
security barrier

221
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,217
should keep her contained in the city,
but I'm worried about her, Sheriff.

222
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,402
She's growing up way too fast.

223
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:57,589
Believe me, I get that...
But we need her back.

224
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,524
Vin, nobody orders the same dish twice.

225
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,845
French, Italian, Namibian.

226
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,748
How am I supposed to memorize the menu?

227
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,926
There's only one rule at Café Diem's.
If you want it, we got it.

228
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,621
Come with me for a sec.

229
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:17,607
Now, if you're gonna work here,
you need know navigate the fridge.

230
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,005
Navigate?

231
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,668
It's like Narnia.

232
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,304
Ponchos on the left. Take the shuttle
if you need food from the back.

233
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:33,161
Now, here's what I need.
We have a VIP coming for lunch

234
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,801
and I wanna whip up
something special, so...

235
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,061
Good luck.

236
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:49,493
See anything?

237
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:50,695
<i>Not yet.</i>

238
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,928
You run Edison's file?

239
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,830
Yeah, graduated Cal Tech,

240
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,355
where he married his lab partner, Mina.

241
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:01,010
15 years, he's been building drones,
and Global keeps shootin' 'em down.

242
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,866
<i>Never had a win before today.</i>

243
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:05,017
Well, he finally made up for it.

244
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,918
I vote for a coffee break.
We can visit Zoe.

245
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,144
Yeah, no time, and rather not.

246
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,888
Carter, you gotta be more supportive.
A little independence is good for her.

247
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:17,735
See, that's where it starts. Next,
it's gonna be "I want my own place,"

248
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,945
<i>then "Did I mention
my boyfriend's moving in"</i>

249
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:23,449
"because we love each other, now."
And "Congratulations! You're a grandpa."

250
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,728
And I hope all in that order.

251
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:29,851
Hey, exactly how big is this thing?
Like, bigger than a bread box?

252
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,134
Oh, crap.

253
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,793
Meet me at the Sheriff's office.

254
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:44,887
Hi.

255
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,840
Martha is it?

256
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:48,539
Yes.

257
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,228
We have a lot of people looking for you.

258
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:55,724
Ethan has been worried sick.

259
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,650
I'm gonna call him,

260
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,279
right now,
so, he can come take you home.

261
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,533
- Jo, drop it. Don't threaten her.
- Her... What about us?

262
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,716
Noted.

263
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:27,638
Jo, we gotta get her
off the streets, okay?

264
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,142
Just follow us for a second.

265
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:55,869
Easy.

266
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,210
Nice killer drone.

267
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:02,096
Where the hell she go?

268
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,383
I'm guessing there.

269
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:16,629
So, it's an invisible killer drone.

270
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,607
- Just keeps gettin' better.
- What's the plan?

271
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,919
Kinda improvising here, Jo.

272
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,908
She's at my one o'clock.
You know football?

273
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,268
- Three brothers, yeah.
- Blanket blitz on three.

274
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,111
One,

275
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:37,541
two,

276
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:39,001
three.

277
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,265
Got it!

278
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,453
What do you want me to do?

279
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:54,577
The cell.

280
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,838
Get her in the cell.

281
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,509
I can't believe that worked.

282
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,509
We rule.

283
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:27,949
We so don't rule.

284
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:37,158
- You tried to arrest it?
- We tried to contain it.

285
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:40,063
By putting a weaponized
attack drone in jail?

286
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,347
Well, when you put it like that.

287
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,846
I don't presume to know
how to do your job, Sheriff,

288
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,487
but these numbers are concerning.

289
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:52,715
They show the various incidents
in Eureka over the past 50 years.

290
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,535
What are the red dots over there?

291
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:59,197
That would be the period
since you've been here, Sheriff Carter.

292
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,838
I take it... red is bad.

293
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,118
Yes, red is bad... Red is costly.

294
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,551
To be frank,
your budget can't afford you.

295
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,266
- So, this is somehow my fault?
- Numbers don't lie.

296
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:21,228
- I don't cause the problems here.
- Can the two of you get along?

297
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:23,736
- Not likely.
- Martha is out of control.

298
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:27,609
We need Ethan to find a way to find her,
before things escalate anymore.

299
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,012
Okay...

300
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,947
Let's get everyone off the street,
till she's found.

301
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,546
Declare a Marshal law on review day...

302
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:39,910
- Not exactly a highlight for a resume.
- I gotta protect the town.

303
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,691
You protect you...
It's what you do best.

304
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,664
I'm gonna go with him.

305
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,568
So, you and Carter
don't exactly get along.

306
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:04,773
Not exactly.

307
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,399
Allison seems to think
rather highly of him.

308
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,842
We all have our blind spots.

309
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:12,529
For what it's worth,
I think you were dead on.

310
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,748
When you're running a place like this,

311
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,457
people need to follow orders,
not question them.

312
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,162
They just need to be reminded
who's in charge.

313
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,409
Can I go?

314
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,293
Of course.

315
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:33,681
Here's Ethan's.

316
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:41,058
Get it off your chest.
I know it's killing you.

317
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:44,680
Honestly, I don't know how
you can consider marrying him, again.

318
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,231
I don't know, Carter...
Maybe I still love him.

319
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:50,292
Then, you guys have something in common.

320
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:52,077
He loves him too.

321
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:59,352
- Sorry, I thought you were Ethan.
- No, but we're lookin' for him.

322
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,722
Well, he should be home any minute.

323
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:03,142
Why... Is something wrong?

324
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:05,332
You might wanna hold off
on the champagne.

325
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,778
Mina and I have just worked
for so long to get a win,

326
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:17,996
I just didn't have the heart to tell her
how the test went until we found Martha.

327
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,345
Well, Martha found me.

328
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:22,074
She attacked me
and then she turned invisible.

329
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:25,542
- Where do you think she is?
- I don't know, but, I know Martha.

330
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,880
And if she wanted to hurt you,
you wouldn't be standing here right now.

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,159
But cloaking...
Clever girl.

332
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,861
She must've somehow figured out
how to upgrade her system.

333
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:36,113
Are you telling me
you didn't program that?

334
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:39,287
No... See, each version
has different abilities.

335
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:43,098
Right, like thermal defense,
infrared, x-ray,

336
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,330
but cloaking always drains
the fusions power cell,

337
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,451
so, I left it out, this time.

338
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:48,997
Trust me, she has it.

339
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,833
Maybe that photon blast
that she absorbed

340
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,156
somehow super charged
her micro processor.

341
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:56,955
Well, we better get her back,
before she hurts someone.

342
00:20:57,075 --> 00:21:00,086
Hey, listen... The only reason
that she came after you,

343
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,229
is because she's on the defensive.

344
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,809
But, if she's cloaking, she's gonna
have to come home to recharge.

345
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:12,364
I want everything boxed up
and taken back to Global Dynamics.

346
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:15,309
Every drone is to be
disassembled and analyzed.

347
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,195
Nathan, what are you doing?

348
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:19,252
My job... I'll take it from here.

349
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:22,409
Does it matter that all this is evidence
in an active police investigation?

350
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,189
No, you had your shot, Sheriff.

351
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,330
This is all property of GD, which means
it is out of your jurisdiction.

352
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,957
Doctor Stark, please, don't do this.
My work's all I have.

353
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,127
It's not your work anymore, Dr. Edison.

354
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:35,937
Martha's become a dangerous
and expensive liability.

355
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,833
I'm sorry, Ethan.

356
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:39,551
You violated test parameters.

357
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:40,719
You're done.

358
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:44,431
It's okay, Ethan.

359
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:47,018
Well, it's now 12 o'clock.

360
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,663
Still on for Café Diem.

361
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,991
Pompous and jackass.
How can anyone be attracted to Stark?

362
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:05,470
Besides the ruggedly handsome,
successful, powerful thing.

363
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,753
Thanks, Jo.

364
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:09,130
Zane, Ethan swears that the photon blast

365
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,551
made Martha smart enough
to upgrade her own system.

366
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:14,906
No way. Software maybe,
but hardware, not a chance.

367
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,172
- So, who'd want to do this to her?
- I don't know.

368
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:20,618
But they'd have to know how to high-Jack
an encrypted frequency to control her.

369
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:24,471
He also says that cloaking drains
her battery, so she'll need to recharge.

370
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:28,141
But, if Stark took all of his equipment,

371
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,594
maybe she'll follow him to GD.

372
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:33,033
No, the security's too tight.
He'll need another source.

373
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:35,345
It'll take a fusion reactor
to be running good.

374
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:38,819
A fu... Well, how about the one
in the back of Vincent's kitchen?

375
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,489
That'd work.
How'd you know that?

376
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:45,627
Father knows best.

377
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,998
<i>All right, I've had just
about enough of Narnia.</i>

378
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:53,218
Take the shuttle.

379
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,941
Yeah, if I could find it.

380
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,051
Who eats fennel, anyway?

381
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,110
Excellent.
A flying shuttle.

382
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:06,815
Not exactly roomy, but whatever.

383
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,902
You have a passenger.

384
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,927
What's wrong...
Does your battery need charging?

385
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,779
Okay, but make it quick.
I'm freezing to death.

386
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:33,457
Everybody down...
Invisible drone on the loose.

387
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:39,832
You...

388
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,466
may wanna lay off the Vinspresso,
Sheriff.

389
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,429
I think I got everything.

390
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,330
What took you so long?

391
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,956
I was lost. I'd still be in there,
if your Cylon shuttle thing

392
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:52,476
- hadn't shown me the way out.
- What Cylon shuttle thing?

393
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,147
It was just behind me.

394
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,776
You guys go to the corner. Go.
You guys, down!

395
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:05,958
Martha.

396
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,041
Martha.

397
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,581
Really?

398
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:34,810
Martha.

399
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,085
Jo, stand down.

400
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,088
Martha.

401
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,968
Remember me?

402
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:42,724
Piggy backs.

403
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,111
Good times.

404
00:24:46,677 --> 00:24:47,920
Martha's here.

405
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,079
How did she...

406
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:57,290
Look out!

407
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,640
- You okay?
- Yeah, she out?

408
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,434
I don't know.
Everyone else okay?

409
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,714
Yeah.

410
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,311
- I'm okay.
- Larry isn't.

411
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,083
I don't get it.
I mean, she seemed so nice.

412
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:41,900
Yeah.

413
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:44,852
Go home, sweetie.

414
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,565
- Why?
- Because working here isn't safe.

415
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,602
I can't worry about you and do my job.
So...

416
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:53,555
Sorry.

417
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:55,557
You know, you can't control me forever.

418
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:56,944
Maybe not,

419
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,026
but I can, today.

420
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,675
Sorry.

421
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,651
Well, Larry's unconscious, but alive.

422
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,469
Martha and I were face to face.
Why'd you take a shot at Thorn?

423
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:11,851
- Poor judgment.
- There's plenty of that to go around.

424
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,118
I appreciate what you did, Sheriff,
but this town is outta control.

425
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:18,022
I want you to take this thing back
to Global Dynamics

426
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:21,818
and have it permanently dismantled.
As far as my review is concerned,

427
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:23,430
it's not looking good.

428
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,726
Perfect.
So what do we do, now?

429
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:34,679
We finish what we started...
What's this?

430
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,477
That would be a remote transmitter.

431
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,604
So, someone has been controlling Martha.

432
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:45,976
- Someone who wants to hurt Thorn.
- Everyone's job is on the line.

433
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,943
I'm sure there's a lot of people who
would celebrate, if she wasn't around.

434
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:52,025
One person in particular.

435
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:57,909
We think she tied into the cafe's
power supply to stay cloaked...

436
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,663
Then, she fired on Thorn.

437
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,731
It's not in her programming
to attack someone, unprovoked.

438
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,880
That makes sense.
We think she had a little outside help.

439
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:07,504
Didn't she...
Mina.

440
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,358
I'm sorry.

441
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:12,024
You were chilling champagne,
before the tests were even over.

442
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,094
You knew that Martha was gonna win.

443
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,987
- Well, I hoped.
- No, you didn't.

444
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:18,598
You guaranteed it.

445
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,476
Sorry, I don't understand.

446
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,295
What'd you do?

447
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:25,605
Give her some extra bells and whistles?

448
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:27,607
Just to give her the edge.

449
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:28,942
Mina?

450
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:32,403
It's not easy living in a town
where everyone's exceptional.

451
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:36,074
Especially when they're given every
advantage to succeed, but you're not.

452
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:39,928
Ethan pours his heart into his work,
but there are always restrictions

453
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,955
that guarantee Martha's destroyed.

454
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,707
My husbands a brilliant man

455
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:45,809
who's only allowed to fail.

456
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:47,794
For once, I just...

457
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:50,521
I just wanted everyone to see

458
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:52,340
how talented he really is.

459
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,583
Thank you, sweetheart.

460
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:58,230
That's very touching,
but you went too far.

461
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,472
And now, a man is in a hospital.

462
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:02,225
Well, Larry.

463
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:05,574
I may have boosted Martha's abilities,
but I had no idea she'd escape,

464
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:06,896
let alone, hurt anyone.

465
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,441
We found this remote transmitter
attached to her.

466
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,857
This didn't come from me.

467
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:16,990
It's not sophisticated enough
to keep her under control for very long.

468
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,785
- But, why go after Thorn?
- If Martha was after Thorn,

469
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:23,257
there's no way she would have missed.

470
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,915
Then, Thorn wasn't the target.

471
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:32,231
Hey, Vince, did you find anything,
when you were cleaning up over there?

472
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:34,418
Let me ask my waitress.

473
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,968
Oh, right, I can't...
You fired her.

474
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:40,578
Look all you want.
This mustard isn't gonna clean itself.

475
00:28:50,555 --> 00:28:51,915
Hey, check it out.

476
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,652
Larry had that book with him all day.

477
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,298
Yeah...
Since when does paper melt?

478
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,873
Never judge a book by it's cover.

479
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,338
I want you to take it apart.
Find out what made it go on the attack.

480
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,756
Sort of a shocking autopsy.

481
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:17,557
You don't do an autopsy on a machine.

482
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:21,793
From what I saw, she's more human
than a lot of people I know.

483
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,665
Well, let's find out why.

484
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,016
Okay.

485
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,272
Why me?

486
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:28,668
Because I read your file

487
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,772
and I want the best person for the job.

488
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,433
Unless you don't think
you're that person.

489
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,128
No, no...
I definitely am.

490
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:38,504
Just need to grab my gear.

491
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,450
Let's get you started.

492
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:51,036
Larry.

493
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,163
Larry.

494
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:56,476
Oh, hey.

495
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:01,636
Don't be upset, guys.
Doc says I'm gonna be just fine.

496
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:05,060
We brought some reading material
to speed your recovery.

497
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:09,429
- It's not what it looks like.
- Really,

498
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,814
'cause your book there is programmed
to the same encrypted frequency

499
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:15,136
as the transmitter
we found on the drone.

500
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,402
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

501
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:19,888
You've been controlling Martha
the entire time.

502
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:22,656
- Some of the time.
- What the hell were you thinking?

503
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:26,343
I knew the DOD was coming
and when I realized who they sent,

504
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:27,955
I freaked.

505
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:31,541
I developed my ELF signal capturing
remote to use against enemy drones.

506
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:34,161
Just wanted to show it worked.

507
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:36,792
By destroying the entire Viper system.

508
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:37,686
No.

509
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,175
I high-jacked the signal
before the test,

510
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:42,819
but I was just as surprised as you,
when Martha took out the Viper.

511
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,305
I wanted to show my design
to Thorn at Café Diem

512
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:47,688
and land Martha outside.

513
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:51,228
But Martha snuck in and ambushed me.

514
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,396
Mina Edison boosted
Martha's learning capacity.

515
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:56,105
- She out smarted you.
- I'm really sorry.

516
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,611
Well, you're lucky that we got her back,
before things spiraled out of control.

517
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:04,287
- What's that?
- Security breach.

518
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:07,358
Section seven...
It's Martha.

519
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,711
So much for things
not spiraling out of control.

520
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:28,009
She's leading them into town.

521
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,154
And now, she's completely autonomous.

522
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:32,833
- She's been planning this all along.
- Planning what?

523
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,314
Martha can disengage from Larry,
she can beat the Viper system,

524
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,900
but, then, she goes down,
after a couple pops from our cap guns.

525
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,278
She was playing opossum.

526
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,112
It was her only way into GD
to activate the other drones.

527
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:46,574
Now you have an artificially intelligent
drone army looking for pay back.

528
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,316
Jo, signal a lockdown.
Everyone inside... I'm heading out.

529
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:05,802
I know... I can see that.
Now, please, everybody, just go home.

530
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:10,483
I'm almost 17, SARAH.

531
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:13,187
I mean, he can't keep controlling
everything I do.

532
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,957
<i>Your father does the best he can.</i>

533
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:17,721
What kind of crappy platitude is that?

534
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,180
<i>The usual kind, I guess.</i>

535
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,060
<i>I'm receiving orders from officer Lupo
for a level four lockdown.</i>

536
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:26,440
Lockdown from what?

537
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,996
<i>I don't know, but she was quite clear.</i>

538
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:35,733
SARAH?

539
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,436
Tell me that was you.

540
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,091
SARAH?

541
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,935
They're taking out the power beacons
for the EM shield.

542
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:57,118
What is that?

543
00:32:57,238 --> 00:33:00,356
It's an electro magnetic security
umbrella that covers the town.

544
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:03,359
It's like an invisible fence over Eureka
that the drones can't breach.

545
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,861
They've hit 4 of 26.

546
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:08,197
If they take down too many beacons,
no way we can keep them in Eureka.

547
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,357
<i>All right... Listen up.
Everybody, I need you indoors, please.</i>

548
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:22,187
<i>Please, get off the street and indoors.</i>

549
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:23,770
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

550
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:29,802
It's not a good time, so stay inside.
It's like War of the Worlds out here.

551
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,263
Yeah, it's like War of the Worlds
over here, too.

552
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:33,431
What?

553
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,919
Martha's here.

554
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,193
I'm on my way.

555
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,821
It's okay...
I'm right here.

556
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,390
<i>Primary systems restored.</i>

557
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:11,747
Here, take a seat.
You okay?

558
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,846
Did she hurt you...
SARAH, lights.

559
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:15,405
No, she's gone.

560
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,476
I actually think
she was trying to help me.

561
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,354
Help you what?

562
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,373
Get away from you.

563
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,944
Only 12 beacons left.

564
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:29,817
We're below 50% shield strength.

565
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,535
We need to bolster the shield,
before they take it down.

566
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:35,159
- No, we have to take it down first.
- What?

567
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:37,030
I don't think
Martha wants to hurt anyone.

568
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,739
I think she's the emotional equivalent

569
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,619
of a pissed off teen,
who needs some space.

570
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,200
Except Martha's not a teen.
She's not even human.

571
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,586
When we were at the cafe,
she saw me ground my daughter,

572
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,489
she broke into my house
and set her free. She may not be human,

573
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:50,633
but, I don't think she's bent
on world domination.

574
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:52,686
That's not a chance I'm willing to take.

575
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,388
We need air support, now.
Dr. Stark, you wanna make the call.

576
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:58,031
If you go on the attack,
then, so will she.

577
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:00,560
Sometimes, the best offense
is no defense.

578
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:05,481
- Something like that.
- No, Carter articulated a good point.

579
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:07,608
We escalate...
So does she.

580
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,403
Taking the barrier down first,
could be seen as an olive branch.

581
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:13,281
Or a surrender,
which is something I never do.

582
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:16,327
I'm here under the authority of the DOD.
I'm gonna use it.

583
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,241
It's Eva Thorn.
I need General Mansfield.

584
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,872
We have an emergency situation
here in Eureka.

585
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,207
Prepare the fighters.

586
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:28,337
<i>General Mansfield,
she is unqualified for this.</i>

587
00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:31,799
<i>I'm sorry, but Thorn has the full
backing of the DOD. It's her call, now.</i>

588
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,094
<i>General, she is sending your men
into harms way.</i>

589
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,305
<i>Luckily, that's what
they've been trained for.</i>

590
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,964
<i>I'll keep watching.</i>

591
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,894
Carter, the fighters are in the air.

592
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,813
Shut down the EM shield
before they get here.

593
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:48,158
<i>Martha needs to know we trust her.</i>

594
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,376
Even if we do,
Thorn's controlling the planes.

595
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:51,496
For the moment.

596
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,527
What...

597
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:57,014
- What are you saying?
- She thinks we're incompetent.

598
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:58,868
Let's prove her right.

599
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:04,791
<i>Omega One, this is Alpha Leader.
We are minutes away and closing.</i>

600
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:06,751
Your targets are dead ahead.

601
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:19,055
<i>Electromagnetic security barrier
is now inactive.</i>

602
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,465
What... Why are the barriers down?
I thought you were fixing it.

603
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,811
Oh, sorry.
I must've pushed the wrong button.

604
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,270
I do that, sometimes.

605
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,484
<i>Omega One, this is Alpha Leader.
We have contact.</i>

606
00:36:31,644 --> 00:36:33,110
Then take them down.

607
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,661
<i>Omega One,
your transmission's breaking up.</i>

608
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,032
<i>- Say, again.</i>
- Shoot the drones down.

609
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:41,942
Alpha Leader, do you hear me?

610
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:45,457
Somebody must've high-jacked the signal.

611
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:46,467
Crazy.

612
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,285
<i>Omega One, we're going hot.</i>

613
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:51,962
<i>Permission to engage.</i>

614
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,689
Negative, Alpha Leader.

615
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:55,971
Fire only if fired upon.

616
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,344
You are making a disastrous mistake.

617
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,597
Okay, Carter...
I really hope you're right.

618
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,135
Tell me about it.

619
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:06,002
Right... So you're sure
Martha'll hear us on this thing?

620
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:08,354
Yeah, but whether she listens
to us is another matter.

621
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,532
<i>Omega One, we're being targeted.</i>

622
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:18,765
If you have any words of wisdom,
like "Don't start World War III",

623
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:20,111
now's the time.

624
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:23,953
Listen, Martha, it's Ethan.

625
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,343
<i>I know that you're upset,</i>

626
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:29,158
<i>but violence is not the answer.</i>

627
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:31,723
And there's going to be consequences
for your actions, young lady.

628
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,849
If you want respect,
you're just gonna have to earn it.

629
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:36,227
Give me that.

630
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:38,050
Okay, Martha, so here's the deal.

631
00:37:38,294 --> 00:37:40,845
I know it sucks having someone
control everything you do,

632
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:42,953
<i>but it's worse
than having someone not care at all.</i>

633
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:45,217
<i>I've had my fair share of running away
and believe me,</i>

634
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:46,976
<i>it is no picnic out there on your own.</i>

635
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:48,585
<i>So, my advice to you</i>

636
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:53,107
is take a lap,
let off some steam and come home.

637
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:56,444
Parents only make us miserable
because they care.

638
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:59,906
- And don't start World War III.
- Right... And that.

639
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,170
<i>Omega One, targets closing.
Request permission to fire.</i>

640
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:09,231
<i>Negative, Alpha One.
Hold your fire.</i>

641
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:11,125
Don't do it, Martha.
Come home.

642
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,457
<i>You just have to trust me.</i>

643
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,504
<i>Listen to me, Martha.</i>

644
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,438
<i>Omega One, all targets have disengaged.</i>

645
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,183
That's my girl.

646
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,406
You and your team went behind my back

647
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,428
and undercut my direct order.

648
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,305
- Some of us went in front of your back.
- And we were right.

649
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,273
- You were lucky.
- Yeah,

650
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:13,106
but have you seen the graph
with all our red dots?

651
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,189
Where the lunatics
are running the asylum?

652
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:18,859
I used to think the same thing.
But they're not lunatics.

653
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:21,614
They're not all lun...

654
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,657
There's a fine line
between genius and crazy.

655
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,394
But sometimes,
the things that they create are...

656
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:28,869
amazing... like Martha.

657
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:32,206
Which would've been destroyed,
had they done things your way.

658
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:34,167
But your way could've been worse.

659
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,980
Great rewards require great risk.

660
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:39,005
Big reader, are you, Sheriff?

661
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,659
I heard it, somewhere.

662
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,085
So what happens, now?

663
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:47,430
Doctor Stark,
I've decided on a trial basis,

664
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:50,808
that you will resume your duties,
as director of research.

665
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:53,483
No, no I won't.

666
00:39:54,054 --> 00:39:56,188
- Not without Doctor Blake.
- Of course not.

667
00:39:56,657 --> 00:39:58,849
You may know science,
but your people skills

668
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:00,234
leave a lot to be desired.

669
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:04,697
Doctor Blake, you will be
the new director of operations.

670
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:07,241
So, we'll be co-heads
of Global Dynamics?

671
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:09,452
No, more like CEO and COO.

672
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:11,474
Who's gonna be the chairman?

673
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:13,581
For the time being, that would be me.

674
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:17,368
GD needs corporate partnership,

675
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,975
private capital, synergy.

676
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:23,389
There's gonna be
some big changes around here.

677
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:25,605
What is all this?

678
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:28,206
It's our first sponsor...
It's very exciting.

679
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:30,156
I'm gonna leave this to you two.

680
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:32,980
I have a drone shaped hole
in my office to attend to.

681
00:40:39,535 --> 00:40:42,291
I just wanted to say...
It's been a really rough day

682
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:45,321
and you really came through
for everyone.

683
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:46,599
Thanks.

684
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:49,227
So...

685
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,300
you and Stark.

686
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,582
Yeah, I think so.
Maybe.

687
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:02,905
- You really think I'm making a mistake?
- No,

688
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,078
no... I...

689
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:08,636
I think...

690
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,790
whatever you decide,

691
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,492
I'll be here for you.

692
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:16,102
Really?

693
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:21,482
Yeah...

694
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:24,776
No, not really.

695
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,286
Get outta here.

696
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:36,088
You were willing to walk away
from Global for me.

697
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,417
I told you, I wanted us to be together

698
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,760
in the office, always.

699
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:45,256
Nathan, do you really think
we can make this work?

700
00:41:45,661 --> 00:41:46,853
I know we can.

701
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:49,097
Okay.

702
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,556
- Is that a "Yes?"
- That's a "Yes."

703
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:02,897
Vincent, I think we're gonna need
a bottle of Champagne.

704
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:10,762
Hey.

705
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,229
- Hell of a first day, huh?
- Yeah,

706
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:16,914
- thanks for letting me come back.
- Well, yeah, I overreacted.

707
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:19,207
Sorry, I'm late.

708
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:21,834
Yeah, I'm afraid you are.

709
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:25,045
Champagne coming up.

710
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,287
Let's go.
