1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,980
No.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,840
Nope.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,840
Nope.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,740
Oh,my god,no.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,440
Carter,the xg-55 assault cannonuses
a 30-round magazine?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,410
- On what planet?
- Less commentary,more addition.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,080
What's my score?

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,520
53%.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,460
Yeah!
Third time's the charm.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,490
Third time's the "f," again.
No advanced weaponry for you.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,610
I have to knowevery gun in the rack?

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,090
And what? You should get special treatment
because you're the sheriff?

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,060
I see what's going on here.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,580
I know you feelyou were passed over
when they brought me in as sheriff.

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,580
And yet I aced the examfirst time.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,830
Jo,it's not a contest.

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,140
I was assigned hereby washington.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,920
If you an issue,take it up with them.
And give me the remote.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
Happy to.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,840
After you pass the exam.
It's regulation,carter.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,520
Okay,jo,I'm the sheriff.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,570
Which means I needyour trust,
I need your respect,

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,560
and most importantly,I need the
remoteto the freakin' gun rack!

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,100
Sorry.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,250
You can't enforce the rules if
you're not willingto follow them first.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,630
Better hit the books.

27
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,500
***********

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,950
Nothing yet,mate.

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,590
Spencer,start the moviealready.

30
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,630
I'm working on it.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,110
- Crikey.
- Hd.

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,910
So many pixels thatyou and
I can't even see them.

33
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,320
when that satellite reorients
another seven degrees-- ho ho!

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,470
- Tv heaven.
- spencer,how do you work this thing?

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,530
Nobody touchesthe master commander.

36
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,080
Vincent,we need food.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,240
Grub,grub,grub!
Patience,heathens.

38
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,450
Roasted jalapeño maize kernelswith demi-glace.
Get 'em while they're steamy.

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,670
But it's movie night.
I need my popcorn.

40
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,120
Expand and indulgeyour palate,fargo.

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,140
Philistine.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,570
We're locked on!

43
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,950
In seconds,a first-run flickdestined for the
multiplex will be comingto your local spencerplex.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,570
Oh,ripper!

45
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,840
You're the sheriff.
It must be for you.

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,400

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,140
********

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,940
Spencer? Yeah,it's friday night.
Did you ask himto keep it down?

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,720
No,I'm not shirkingmy responsibilities.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,320
As a matter of fact,
I'll sendmy deputy over right away.

51
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,790
Not a problem.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,660
All right,bye.

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,460
Spencer's movie night'sgetting a little rowdy.

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,380
And I handled it last time.

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,560
Oh,good,then you know the way.

56
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,450
You know what they sayabout payback,right?

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,180
She's a bitch?

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,160
spencer!

59
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,410
Spencer!

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,320
Spencer!

61
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,890
Hello!
Officer of the law!

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,580
What's wrongwith you people?
Turn it down!

63
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,600
What?
Why?

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,190
Your neighbors arecomplaining about the noise.

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,580
Which neighbors?

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,240
The state of idaho.
Turn it down!

67
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,560
Have a sit,jo.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,950
Like a tinny?

69
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,990
- Vinnie,get jo a beer.
- I'm on duty.

70
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,340
I can respect that.
Like it to go?

71
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,900
looks human,but it's just a guise.
I've seen it.

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Hideous under the skin.

73
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,910
my god.
What do they want?

what are we watching?

78
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,210
They came to conquer.

79
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,290
When did that come out?

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,470
N-next week.

81
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,090
Picture's amazing.

82
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,260
Yeah,it is.

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,290
he's just the host.
The creature's protected inside.

84
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,570
how do we get it out?

85
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,620
we cut it out.

86
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,770

87
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,040
Maize kernel?

88
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,210
I mean,that is like--

89
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,810
unbelievable.

90
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,200
Yet believable.

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,040
- Definitely.
- Like being there.

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,390
And now I gotta go.

93
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,900
Hey,you guyskeep it down,okay?

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,130
Ugh,we'll walkyou out.

95
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,270
You know,just in caseof alien invasion.

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,020
Strength in numbers.

97
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,470
Right.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,830
Spencer,that wasa life-altering experience.

99
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,360
Hey,guys,hey!

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,160

Allison.
It's late.

108
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,010
It's 7:00.
In the morning.

109
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,550
Have you been hereall night?

110
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
Yeah.
Guess I gota little caught up.

111
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,180
How's the budget going?

112
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,600
It's not.

113
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,230
I have to justify a number that
will keepglobal cutting-edge.

114
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,890
No.

115
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,670
And still give congresssomething to slash.

116
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,830
You saw what they didto nasa.

117
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,120
So when doescongressman faraday get in?

118
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,590
He's in.

119
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,660
Flew in from mcchordair force base last night.

120
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,390
And he expects hard numbers and a field
testof the px-319 project at 9:00 A.M.

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,100
Hopefullyhe'll be impressed.

122
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,700
No,hopefully he's forgotten that
you called hima shameless grandstander

123
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,440
in front of the defenseappropriations committee.

124
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,130
He brought thatupon himself.

125
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,960
The man's smart,but the likes the
soundof his own voice too much.

126
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,260
Who does thatremind me of?

127
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,730
Oh,maybe a littlegroveling will help.

128
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,550
Whatever it takes.

129
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,900
Global's futureis all I care about.

130
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,050
That sounds familiar too.

131
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,620
This has to go smoothly,allison.

132
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
And not just for global.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,460
Maybe you can talkto sheriff carter.

134
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,090
See if he can keep thingsquiet around here.
For a change.

135
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,530
I'll see whatI can do,nathan.

136
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,840
Nothing like a little vincespresso
to start the day off,huh?

137
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,140
I'm waiting.

138
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,350
- For what?
- Aw,come on.

139
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,400
You're a woman.
You're making small talk.

140
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,850
You're buying me coffee,which means either,"a,"

141
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,830
you're into me,or,"b," you want something.

142
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,090
Could you be more sexist?

143
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,330
Come clean,or I'll makemy own assumptions.

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,730
Okay.
Allison blake,really into me!

145
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,560
- All right!
- Spread it around!

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
We have a visitorin town.

147
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,720
- See,was that so hard?
- We do?

148
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,460
Congressman faradaygot in last night.

149
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,380
And you'retelling me this why?

150
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,300
We're underbudget review.
Faraday's tourhas to go smoothly.

151
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,350
Nathan would just like youto keep a lid on things.

152
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,790
He has great faithin your abilities.

153
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,810
No,he doesn'T.

154
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,000
No,he doesn't,but we still needa
day or two of quiet.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,700
In this town?
That's easier saidthan done.

156
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,240
Sheriff,something'shappened to spencer.

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,550
I didn't hear that!

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,100
What's wrongwith the monkeys?

159
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,420
They should be at each other's throats,
but they look fine.

160
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,550
They are fine.
The device isn'T.

161
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,800
Are you tryingto sabotage me?
Stark's on his way nowwith the congressman.

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,060
- I'm runningdiagnostics,but--
- no "buts!"

163
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,260
If you can't getthe job done,dr.Sharat,
I'll find someone who can.

164
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,390
You realize I don'twork for you,right?
In fact,you workfor everyone else.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,870
Now I have to tell stark we have
nothingto show faraday.

166
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,400
If I go down for this,I'm taking you with me.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,760
- Fargo,I thinkyou're overreacting.
- Stop making this about me!

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,810
Sabotage.

169
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,050
Dr. Stark,I'm afraidthere's been a delay.

170
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,570
my office,15 minutes.

171
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,220
I want a detailed explanation,
and it'd better be good,fargo.

172
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,320
So,congressman,as you can see,

173
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,790
everything we do hereat global
dynamics is about pushingthe boundaries--

174
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,260
of the scientificfrontier.

175
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes,I read the brief.

176
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
But we both knowwhat it's really about.

177
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,520
Cranking out the best war toysbefore our
enemies do.That'll primeyour funding pump.

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,580
I know.

179
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,660
And our px-319 projectwill revolutionize
the way we engageenemies in battle.

180
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,890
So you keep telling me.

181
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,960
How about we skip the sciencefair
and get right to it then?

182
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,450
We're preparing a simulatedfield
test as we speak.Should be ready...

183
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,490
a little later.

184
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,860
Then I suppose we'll seeabout your funding...
a little later.

185
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,390
I may be overreacting,but four years,
he has never,ever been late.

186
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,490
Let's do this.

187
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,480
jo,put the gun away.

188
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,880
And walk intoa potential trap.
I don't think so.

189
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,150
She's not normallythis high-strung.

190
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,520
She has some issues.

191
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,410
No signs of a break-in.

192
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,860
Wow,what a relief.

193
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,180
Did you see anythinglast night?

194
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,810
- Last nht?
- Movie night.

195
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,830
Ah,right.

196
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,630
- jo?
- What are you implying?

197
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,650
Nothing.
Can you killthe flashlight?

198
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,910
I'm investigatinga crime scene,
following procedure.

199
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,250
Maybe you shouldtry it sometime.

200
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,470
Can you maybe dial it down till we
figure out that there's been a crime?

201
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,100
Obviously I can't dust thatfor prints now.
Or that.

202
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,250
- Wallet and pda.
- Well,he probablyhasn't gone far.

203
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,140
Unless he was taken.
By force.

204
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,580
Against his will.

205
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,290
Okay,no more coffeefor you.

206
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,200
- Is that blood?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,100
And it leads that way.
Let's go.

208
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,870
Yeah,he's justpulling in now.

209
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,800
Good.

210
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,850
Beverly,I am not asking you to do
anything inappropriate.

211
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,940
Of course not. I'll just keep my eyes
and ears open like you said.

212
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,820
he has a tremendous amount of say over our funding.
It's all in the town's best interests.

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,060
I completely understand.

214
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,370
What do you thinkyou're doing?

215
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,370
Nothing,congressman.

216
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,260
Then what's in your hand?

217
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,800
Nothing.

218
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,930
Really?

219
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,380
Don't lie.

220
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,920
I was just looking for-- you're hurting me.

221
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,190
Then scream.

222
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,500
You scream.

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,680
You remembered.

224
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,980
You're hard to forget.

225
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,480
Spencer!

226
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,480
Spencer!

227
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,620
Taggart,for god sakes,pick up.

228
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,360
Tag,where are you?

229
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,390
We're too late.

230
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,570
Spencer!

231
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,830
Spencer!

232
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,370
Spencer!

233
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,910
It's too narrowfor a tractor path.

234
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,170
Yeah,these crops have beenflattened,
not cut.

235
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,940
- Do you hear that?
- What?

236
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,440
What?

237
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,480
Spencer!

238
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,970
Spencer!

239
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,860
Spencer!

240
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,740
Spencer!

241
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,910
- Spencer,are you all right?
- What happened?

242
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,170
I can't--I can't talk about it.

243
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,610
Why not?

244
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,820
They're watching.

245
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,850
********,Your hands?

246
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,990
- They left me here.
- Who?

247
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,900
I--I can't-- I can't--

248
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,550
spencer.

249
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,460
You're not alone.

250
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,840
He's clearlytraumatized.

251
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,820
Well,maybe beverlycan reach him.

252
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,780
Yeah,all right,I'll take him there.

253
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,550
You okay?

254
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,860
No,but I will beonce he is.

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,980
********

256
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,400
- What do you think?
- He probably passed out.

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,490
Some friends playeda prank on him.

258
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,900
really?

259
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,150
Come on.

260
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,470
There's alwaysa logical explanation for...
these things.

261
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah,that soundedvery logical.

262
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,080
Okay,jo,what's your theory?

263
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,740
Well,it's a crop.

264
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,020
Yep.

265
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,250
And there's a circle in it.

266
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,940
No.

267
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,400
No,no,no.

268
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,890
I don't care how weirdthis town gets,
there's one thingthat I know,

269
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,760
and that's thatthere are no aliens.

270
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah,jack carter.
Oh,hey,allison.

271
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,100
That makes two today.

272
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,790
I know,I know,I know.
You don't want to hear about it.

273
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,930
Okay,I'm on my way.

274
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,980
Someone else disappeared.

275
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,810
Fargo.

276
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,790
That's one thing I canscratch off
my "to do" list.

277
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,540
Or keep it on therefor later.

278
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,780
We're clean?

279
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,810
Nothing about whatwe just did is clean.

280
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,530
You know whatI'm talking about.

281
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,420
I sweep every roomevery hour.

282
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,590
No one can hear us.

283
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,450
The consortium believesthe artifact
was excavated and moved.

284
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,930
- To eureka?
- To section five.

285
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,300
Well,even you can't getaccess to that.

286
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,550
No.

287
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,530
But nathan stark can.

288
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,560
You think he'll justtake you on a tour?

289
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,250
If there's somethingworthwhile in it for him.

290
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,610
You'll need leverage.

291
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,920
That's why I'm here,dr.Barlow.

292
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,760
You know him betterthan anyone.

293
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,340
You'll need to barter with the one
thinghe loves more than anything.

294
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,680
- Allison blake.
- Science.

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,120
Stark livesto push boundaries.
To leave his mark.

296
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,830
He can't do thatwithout funding,so--

297
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,190
so his sin is pride.

298
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,240
I heard somewhere it comesbefore a fall.

299
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,390
please...
h-help him.

300
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,570
Spencer.

301
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,830
Spencer,you know me.

302
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,520
You're safe here.
You can talk to me.

303
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,560
No,let the bill die.
I'll reintroduce itwith my name on it.

304
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,700
We'll attach a rider.

305
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,440
That'll makeour mutual friends happy.

306
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,770
Okay.

307
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,210
Spencer,what is it?

308
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,690
Nothing.

309
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,600
I didn't see anything.

310
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,900
Okay,dr.Stark,I'm ready to be impressed.

311
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,230
You will not bedisappointed,congressman.

312
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,380
Allison,could you--

313
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,010
oh,okay. I'll catch up.

314
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,410
This way,congressman.

315
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,320
Hey,so,um,how's spencer?

316
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,000
Uh,he's been better.
How's fargo?

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,240
Last person to see fargowas dr.Sharat,and he missed
a critical meeting with stark.It's not like him.

318
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,550
Spencer was acting odd too.
I need to talk to dr.Sharat.

319
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,400
Uh,you know,that's gonna have to wait.
She's kind of in the middleof something important.

320
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,850
Well,so am I,and you called me,so--

321
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,500
by decade's end,wars will befought from
command screens such as this one.

322
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,940
There will no longerbe a need for
massive troops on the ground.

323
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Dr.Sharat?

324
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,720
The px-319 transmitsa low-frequency signal
that delivers a subconsciousmessage of fear

325
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
and paranoia to amygdala deep in the brain,

326
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,860
causing the enemy turn against one another
in a violent rage,as this demonstration will show.

327
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,570
Um,just one moment.

328
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,820
a violent rage?

329
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,750
This is worth 80 million?

330
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,610
dr.Sharat?

331
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,160
The satellite's telemetrymust still be off.

332
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,600
- Still?
- Fargo didn't tell you?

333
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,090
We had a meeting.
He didn't show up.

334
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,520
Just--just give me a few minutes.

335
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,500
That's all right,dr.Sharat.

336
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,950
I've seen enough.

337
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,970
Dr.Stark,a word.

338
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,670
So I understand you spoketo douglas
fargo this morning.

339
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,410
The man's lost his mind.
If you find him,shoot him.

340
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,470
I'll take that as a yes.

341
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,160
Thank you for your time.
Nice monkeys.

342
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,040
Carter.

343
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,270
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
Vincent did what?

344
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,240
Perfect.

345
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,330
- Vincent just--
- no,I don't want to hear it.

346
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,440
Jo,I need you to get downto cafe diem.
Vincent disappearedduring the lunch rush.

347
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,030
Jo,come in.
Over.

348
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,990
Jo.

349
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,920
Okay,today's officiallymissing persons day.
But you don'twant to hear it.

350
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,350
A day or two of quiet wasn'tan
unreasonable request.

351
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,870
Look,nathan,you need an allyon
the defense committee.

352
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm ready to be that ally,but you've
got to show mesomething worthwhile.

353
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,020
And I will have that demoready
for you shortly.

354
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,730
Forget the demo.

355
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,030
I'm talking aboutsection five.

356
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,100
Access to section fiveis by special
clearance only.

357
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,110
Which you can give me.

358
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,920
Nathan...

359
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,050
I want youto get your funding.

360
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,130
But I'm not justgonna rubber stamp a multibillion
dollar budgetlike my predecessors have.

361
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,650
And I can'tin good conscience
support something I've never seen.

362
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,840
It's that simple.

363
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,550
There you are.
Been trying to raise youall morning.

364
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,750
Got it under control.

365
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,210
Really? Because every timeI turn around
someone elsehas gone missing.

366
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,360
Fargo.
Now vincent.

367
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,760
Okay,look,I know.
And I know what needsto be done.

368
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,900
What I don't knowis why you insist
on telling mehow to do it.

369
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,740
- What is your problem?
- My problem is you.

370
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,790
Sheriff cobb treated melike a partner,
not an appendage.

371
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,850
When something goes wrongaround here,
people look to me.

372
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,270
They don't know you.
They don't trust you.

373
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,220
Because you don't trust me.
You've been on a tearsince day one.

374
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,640
I think you needto back off.

375
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,260
Okay,I'm sorry you're pissedbecause
you didn't get the job.

376
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,410
But right now,I really don't care.
We have to findthese people.

377
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,130
And I know,we're going to,but we
have to work together.Okay?

378
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,450
Are you with me?

379
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,780
All right.

380
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,400
We'll work together.

381
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,340
Okay.

382
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,300
Good.

383
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,730
So we're okay?

384
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah.

385
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,230
We're okay.

386
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,870
Okay.

387
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,630
Carter

388
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,060
Carter,wake up!

389
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,870
What the hell are you doing?

390
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,330
What am i doing?

391
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,800
I found it outby the crop circle.

392
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,200
I think spencer spentthe whole night
rolling it all overthe fields to make them.

393
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,500
That explains whyhis hands are so messed up.

394
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,820
It's a little difficult to breathe
with you camped outon my diaphragm.

395
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,700
Right.
Sorry.

396
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,920
- You all right?
- Yeah.

397
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,230
Jo.

398
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,300
It was jo.

399
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,720
Jo hit you?

400
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,300
Yeah,with the butt of an mps auto
assault12 shotgun.

401
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,950
Or a model 50tactical takedown rifle.

402
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,530
Damn,I'm nevergonna pass the test.

403
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,140
Oh,no.

404
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,580
Oh,no.

405
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,640
Tell me this wasn'tfilled with weapons.

406
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,680
- No,no,it wasn'T.
- You're lying to me,aren't you?

407
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
- Oh,big time.
- What is going on?

408
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,130
Well,let's see.
Um,spencer thinks alienshave landed.

409
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,070
Vince and fargo are missing.
And jo's gone...

410
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,720
G.I. Joe.

411
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,140
You think they'reall together?

412
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,160
I think they were togetherat spencer's party,
and something happened.

413
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,370
That,or we are beinginvaded by aliens.

414
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,940
Henry,please tell meyou don't
believe in aliens.

415
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,600
I believein occam's razor.

416
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,510
It's the basis formethodological reductionism.

417
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,510
Oh,yeah.
Slowly,still dizzy.

418
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,870
Okay,given two equallypredictive theories,
you choose the one thathas fewer assumptions.

419
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,130
So,a tree has fallenin the forest after a storm.

420
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,020
First hypothesis holds thatthat tree
was blown down by the storm.

421
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,420
Second rivalhypothesis claims that that storm
forcedan alien spaceship to crash into the tree.

422
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,370
- See?
- No.

423
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,320
I need to look closerat spencer's trailer.

424
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,830
I'll go.

425
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,330
Okay.
That'll give me a chanceto get over to beverly'S.

426
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,970
What for?

427
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,850
We've got four people who are
probably together,and definitely armed.

428
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,950
Spencer's the missingmember of that team.
I think they're headedover there.

429
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,210
- Be careful.
- You too.

430
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,610
welcome to section five.

431
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,210
You're doingthe right thing,dr.Stark.

432
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,380
I'm counting on it.

433
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,760
Step onto the gridfor identity verification.

434
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,580
Um,that'sa radiation symbol.

435
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,820
Once you enter the chamber,
we'll breach containment.

436
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,220
You'll have 15 secondsto view the artifact.

437
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,910
Any longer will exceedexposure limits.

438
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,150
You're notgoing in with me?

439
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,510
We could onlyafford one suit.

440
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,190
Openingthe doors now.

441
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,520
believe it or not,congressman,
it's terrestrial in origin.

442
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,000
We just don't know who created it.

443
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,170
My god.

444
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,300
That's one theory.

445
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,780
Then...
we strike.

446
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,190
Hard and fast.

447
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,750
Your basic grab and go.

448
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,130
He won't be alone,so watch your asses.
Let's move out.

449
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,870
What makes you thinkjo and the
others are coming for spencer?

450
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,720
Occam's razor.

451
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,550
You're spending way too muchtime with henry.

452
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,660
Borrowed thisfrom section four.

453
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,400
I want to stop 'em,not vaporize 'em.

454
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,750
It's a pep.
Pulse energy projectile rifle.

455
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,300
It's for crowd control.
Completely non-lethal.

456
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,250
- Did you passthat weapons test?
- It's notthat hard,carter.

457
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,340
- Allison,sheriff,what is going on?
- Where's spencer?

458
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,460
Inside.
He's getting worse.

459
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,190
- What happenedto your head?
- Had a trust issue.

460
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,760
Their leader is here.

461
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,700
He looks human,but it's just a guise.

462
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,640
You can see it.

463
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,530
Hideous,under the skin.

464
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
We will not let anythinghappen to you,
spencer.

465
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,940
Will we,sheriff?

466
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,750
No.
I'm gonna stay in positionedhere in the foyer.

467
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,630
Allison,why don't youtake the back and pep
the hell out ofanything that comes from behind.

468
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,070
Okay.

469
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,910
He picked eurekafor a reason.

470
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,480
"He"?

471
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,530
he can't be trusted.

472
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,110
I--I need to--I need to go.

473
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,390
We have to captureand interrogate him.

474
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,670
He must be stopped.

475
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,770
- Who?
- Their leader.

476
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,070
He's infiltratedour government,
and now he's herehiding in plain sight.

477
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,330
- Oh,jeez.
- what?

478
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,160
He's talking aboutthe congressman.

479
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,450
He is?

480
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,750
Spencer's not their target.

481
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,300
Faraday is.

482
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,800
That...

483
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,000
I don't even knowwhat to call it.

484
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,620
It could changeeverything.

485
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,200
It already has.

486
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,260
Fargo?

487
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,040
What the hell are you do--

488
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,900
Have you lostyour minds?

489
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,660
Deputy!

490
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,390
Fargo!

491
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,770
Who are you people?

492
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,750
The question is,who are you?

493
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,830
All right,that's--

494
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,230
No.

495
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,850
Nope.

496
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,580
Call carter.

497
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
Henry,give ussome good news.

498
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,830
They were watching a moviecalled
they came to conquer.

499
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,810
Don't tell me.
Alien invasion.

500
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,080
Invasion,abduction,dissection.
This movie's got it all.

501
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,350
okay.Still,it's a big leap from watching
a movie to thinking it's the real thing.

502
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,890
we're talking about spencer here.
I'm assuming he didn't get this at blockbuster.

503
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,360
Not even close.

504
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,200
Looks like he hijackeda satellite
signal to intercepta digital broadcast.

505
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,760
Then he bounced the signal...

506
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,290
off a global dynamics satellite
to cover his tracks.

507
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,700
Oh.

508
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,780
"Oh." Is that a good "oh"or a bad "oh"?

509
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,200
the number of the satellite is gd-85.

510
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,120
Oh,no.

511
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,300
Don't tell me. That's the one thatscrewed
up your monkey test.

512
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,610
They lost the satellite signalfor
a few hours friday night.

513
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,630
- I'm assuming--
- spencer got it.

514
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,260
- There's nathan's car.
- henry,we gotta go.

515
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,230
Nathan.

516
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,910
- Are you all right?
- ********

517
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,830
What happened?

518
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,320
Taggart,his deputy,and my assistant--ohh--

519
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,230
took faraday.

520
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,480
Yeah,they're infected with your
paranoia-inducingmonkey beam.

521
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,540
Oh,impossible. It was sent from a
secureglobal dynamics satellite.

522
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,940
No,possible.
Spencer hacked into it.

523
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,420
If anything happensto faraday--

524
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,930
well,it won't now that we know
where they took him.

525
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,180
Where did they take him?

526
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,470
Well,where would you go if you were
about to doan autopsy on an alien?

527
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,200
Taggart's lab.

528
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,890
I'm callingglobal security detail.

529
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,320
No,you're not.

530
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,720
A crazy cabal is aboutto dissect
a U.S. Congressman. I am.

531
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,230
They're not crazy.
They're paranoid.

532
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,880
And if they see a bunchof people with weapons,
this is gonna get wacoreally fast.

533
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,900
My point exactly.

534
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,230
They're armedand dangerous.

535
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
I don't seeanother choice.

536
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,620
Can't you just reversethe paranoid thing?

537
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,360
You don't know how.

538
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,780
I know how to savea U.S. Congressman.

539
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,230
Carter!

540
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,760
This is stark.

541
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,890
Tell tactical commandI need a detail
sent to taggart'scompound.

542
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,160
Code black.

543
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,650
How many are you?

544
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,970
We know what you are.

545
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,990
We know where you're from.

546
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,270
And believe me,by the timeI'm done with you,

547
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,460
we'll knoweverything else.

548
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,870
- Have you come to harm us?
- What do you people want?

549
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,630
We want answers.

550
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,530
Set up a perimeter!
Standard breach formation! Let's go!

551
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,450
- Sheriff carter,please stay back.
- I need to get in there.

552
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,800
- No,he does not.
- Let me negotiate this.I know these guys.

553
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,120
So do I. Look,sheriff,
I don't like thisany better than you do.

554
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,710
But if something happensto that congressman,
what do you think'sgonna happen to eureka?

555
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,700
- We just need more time.
- Give us a chanceto talk to them.

556
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,810
Sorry,allison.
I can't risk it.

557
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,710
Okay.

558
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,990
Okay.
If that's the waythis has to be.

559
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,850
Thank you for yourcooperation,sheriff.

560
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,300
Carter!

561
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,570
Sheriff,stop now!

562
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,820
Hold your fire.
Repeat,hold fire.

563
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,180
Tell your peopleto lay down their weapons.

564
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,240
I don't have any people!

565
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,010
He's right.

566
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,140
He's just the host.

567
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,460
The creature'sprotected inside.

568
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,320
How do we get it out?

569
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,160
We cut it out.

570
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,890
- Who is it?
- It's carter.

571
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,890
I'm unarmed.

572
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,110
Open the door.

573
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,380
And,uh,what is thisin reference to?

574
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,800
Taggart,I know you havethe congressman in there.

575
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,570
Copy that.
We have the shot,dr.Stark.

576
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,920
Don't do it,nathan.
Give him a chance.

577
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,330
You alone?

578
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,320
Oh,yeah.

579
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,980
Should we take the shot?

580
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,440
Hold fire.
We lost the target.

581
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,830
come in.

582
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,350
I hope he knowswhat he's doing.

583
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,880
Come out of the housewith your
hands on your heads.

584
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,670
Jo,any minute this placeis gonna be
swarmed by the only peopleon the planet

585
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,400
who are better armedthan you.

586
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,350
- We'll do what we have to.
- No,you're gonna get hurt.

587
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,690
Or worse.

588
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,650
we can't trust him.
He's one of them.

589
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,130
Then don't trust me.
Trust your own common sense.

590
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,300
oh,so what,I'm stupid now?
I know what I saw.

591
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,290
You guys...

592
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,590
are sufferingfrom a mass delusion.

593
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,260
Nice try,mate.

594
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,840
Think about it,jo.
What makes more sense?

595
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,160
That he's an alien?

596
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,880
Or that you guysare delusional?

597
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,340
Shots fired.
We need to move in.

598
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,400
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry,allison.

599
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,080
Go ahead.

600
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,420
Okay,who gave fargo a gun?

601
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,660
Prepare for full breach.

602
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,000
You were all watching a moviein spencer's
trailer called they came to conquer,right?

603
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,440
In which aliens invade a small bucolic
town in the pacific northwest.

604
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,130
Spencer saw their ship.

605
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,870
And he is their emissary.

606
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,660
Taggart,taggart!

607
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,440
What spencer saw was congressman
faraday'shelicopter arriving.

608
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,210
His trailer is directlybelow the flight path.

609
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,190
What time did you arrive?

610
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,480
Congressman.

611
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,120
Just after midnight.

612
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,230
Okay.

613
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,990
About the timethe party broke up?

614
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,710
Vincent?

615
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,750
Spencer bounced the movie off
a global dynamics weapons satellite

616
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,610
that was being used to beamwaves
of paranoia into lab monkeys.

617
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,050
There was a malfunction,wasn't there,fargo?

618
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,740
It failed.

619
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,800
That's why you took off.

620
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,010
Unfortunately,it didn't fail.

621
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,070
When spencer bounced the signal,
you became the lab monkeys.

622
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,700
We have the alienright here.

623
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,040
Get out of our way.

624
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,540
Maybe you do havean infiltrator.

625
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,880
But it's not him.

626
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,720
It's me.

627
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,820
I'm the new guy,right?

628
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,050
I didn't pass your test.

629
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,920
I didn't see how muchthis town needs you.

630
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,820
Fair.

631
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,580
But I need you too.

632
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,140
You're not an appendage,jo.
You're my partner.

633
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,150
And there's no onein this town that I'd rather
havewatching my back than you.And that's the truth.

634
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,490
So...

635
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,260
please.

636
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,490
Trust me.

637
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,960
We're coming out!
Hold your fire!

638
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,940
Hold fire.

639
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,020
Everyone stand down.

640
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,470
They're unarmed!

641
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,780
Everybody's okay!

642
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,650
So everybody's okay?

643
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,360
Oh,no,they'refreakin' bug nuts.
Restraints now.

644
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,950
We reprogrammed the signal to stimulate
the brain'spleasure center.

645
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:51,700
I chose delivery footageeach should
find benign and peaceful.

646
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,090
Well,you sure know jo.

647
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,050
Congressman.

648
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,870
I trust thisunfortunate incident in no
way will affectour budget considerations.

649
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:08,070
I was abducted,threatened,and humiliated
by your people in your town on your watch.

650
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,080
But in spite of this incident,
what I saw in there yesterday takes precedence.

651
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,480
Dr.Stark.

652
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,150
- We'll be talking.
- I'm sure we will.

653
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,750
Ms.Blake.

654
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,860
So are we funded?

655
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,680
For now.

656
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,870
Guess I owe you one,sheriff.

657
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,690
Getting the congressman outrelatively unscathed.

658
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,770
a big one.

659
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,050
Thank you,carter.

660
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,700
By the way,I didn't do it for you.

661
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,090
You don't say.

662
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,110
multi-velocity xk exterminator.

663
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,270
Very good.

664
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,440
Bmfg liquidator.

665
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,320
- Type and sizeof magazine?
- Trick question.

666
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,540
It usessingle-chamber artillery.

667
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,380
Wow,carter.
Keep this up,you're gonna pass the exam.

668
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,550
Yeah,I don't know.
I tend to choke the exam.

669
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,290
Well,this is the exam.

670
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,460
The manual didn't say anythingabout
it having to be written,so I...

671
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,080
thanks for the tutoring.

672
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,900
Don't mention it.

673
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,780
You gonna get that?

674
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,800
I didn't think so.

675
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,170
