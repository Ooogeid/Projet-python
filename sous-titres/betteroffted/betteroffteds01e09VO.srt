1
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:08,220
A well-run company is like
an intricate machine.

2
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:11,771
A lot of moving parts working together
in perfect precision.

3
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:20,648
You might say Veridian Dynamics
is like a finely tuned watch.

4
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:24,231
That's Dale. He even has
a big hand and a little hand.

5
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:27,243
You guys are great.
Ahead of schedule and under budget.

6
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:28,505
So what is it?

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,072
We call it "The voice of God."

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,421
- No, we don't.
- No, we don't.

9
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:35,774
Hypersonic sound, or H.S,

10
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,744
projects a narrow beam of sound

11
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,581
which can only be heard
by a specifically targeted person.

12
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:43,327
Field testing shows
that the subject, or "victim,"

13
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,045
as I like to call people "helped"
by Veridian technology,

14
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,658
can be hundreds of feet away
and will hear the message

15
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,633
as thought it's being whispered
only to them.

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,009
It's highly persuasive.

17
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,280
Advertising companies
are very excited

18
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,693
because it will allow them
to burrow even deeper

19
00:00:56,818 --> 00:00:58,182
into the human brain.

20
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:02,650
Let's zap Rick.
He's always using the copy machine.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,147
We get it.
You need to make a lot of copies.

22
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,650
Just don't set it too high.

23
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,041
At full power,
the sound wave is so intense,

24
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,445
it can cause vomiting.

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,139
A machine that causes vomiting.

26
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:16,033
that could have all kinds
of applications for the military...

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,728
And fashion modeling.

28
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,437
It's me... God.

29
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:25,543
You want me
to stop using the copier?

30
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:30,067
But why?
I don't make that many copies.

31
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:33,968
No, I'm not questioning you.

32
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:38,286
This is what it would be like
if god was insecure.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,072
This place may be
a perfectly tuned machine,

34
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:46,957
but the thing about
a perfect machine,

35
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:50,473
it only takes the smallest glitch
to throw the whole thing off.

36
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,536
That's not right.

37
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,466
Really not right.

38
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,478
This is such a circus.

39
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,937
You're a baby, you know that?

40
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,606
- A big baby.
- Veronica, it's toxic.

41
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,630
We had to call in
the contamination guys.

42
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:36,747
- Am I allowed to ask what ate my desk?
- All we know is it came from a leak

43
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:39,033
from Dr. Bhamba's biocomputer
upstairs.

44
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,392
A biocomputer.
It's half machine, half living organism.

45
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:45,563
If you think that sounds creepy,
you should see it at feeding time.

46
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,917
Speaking of useless,
half-living organisms...

47
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:52,057
I brought doughnuts...
A festive treat

48
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,340
while we wait out
this little inconvenience.

49
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,061
Don't think you can buy
your way out of this with doughnuts,

50
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:58,957
Just give me a status report.

51
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,037
Okay, and a buttermilk log.

52
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:02,832
The biocomputer,

53
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:05,330
which I have humorously
named "Johnny"...

54
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,945
Has been leaking an acid-like goo,

55
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,525
or "ass-goo," for short.

56
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,912
Anyway, we're stumped.

57
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,968
Johnny has been running nonstop
for three years,

58
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,981
and we've never had a problem
like this before.

59
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:21,242
Sadly, until we find the reason
for the leak, it will continue.

60
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,930
Is it even safe to work
in the building?

61
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,246
Just get it fixed.

62
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,706
And you need to grow a pair.

63
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,034
<i>Veronica assigned Dr. Bhamba
to room 4-d,</i>

64
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,313
<i>which is known as
"the ridiculously tiny office."</i>

65
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,554
This office is ridiculously tiny.

66
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,748
<i>Other employees were left
to find their own office space.</i>

67
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:50,050
- People, people!
- Please, help us! 

68
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,356
I hate seeing you put out like this.

69
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,329
I said, I hate seeing you
put out like this.

70
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,124
Thank you.

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,429
Make sure that it...
It's more powdery.

72
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,057
I'm supposed to share
an office with Wallace,

73
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,958
that food-taster guy
in the basement.

74
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,460
Unless anyone else has an idea?

75
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:17,131
Take the freight elevator?
It's faster.

76
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:18,632
Thanks.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,885
That's exactly the idea
I was looking for.

78
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,818
I don't know anything about women...

79
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:29,046
At least, according to my wife...
But I think...

80
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:33,272
- Linda wants to move into your office.
- I know, but it'd be awkward.

81
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,867
Even though she has a boyfriend,
there's always been this...

82
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,401
Attraction between us.

83
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,486
I mean, she is smokin' hot.

84
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:43,782
Anyway, you're right, but
I just don't think it's a good idea.

85
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:46,266
So I do know something about women.

86
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,132
I am gonna call my wife

87
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,789
and tell her how hot Linda is.

88
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,143
Oh, wait.

89
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,060
- Experimental cracker?
- God. No.

90
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,125
But you keep chewing.

91
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:12,806
Pretty.

92
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,444
Maybe I wasn't being that clear before.
Can I move in with you?

93
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,832
But what about Wallace
and all his crazy foods?

94
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,074
That's gotta be fun.

95
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,603
He told me he needs
a good woman in his life

96
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,037
cause his mom just died.

97
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,369
Then he coughed up some of
the experimental cracker he's eating

98
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,887
and swal lowed it again.

99
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:38,055
I mean, sure, every girl dreams
of a romantic moment like that,

100
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,297
but it was all happening so fast.

101
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,535
Well, I'd love to help you, Linda,

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,133
- but I don't have a big office.
- In here. In here... In here...

103
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,607
And there's that terrible echo.

104
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,103
Of course. I'd be happy
to have you share my office.

105
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,418
Thank you. I'll be right back.

106
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,275
And your pen-holder's gonna be perfect
for my tampons.

107
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,433
I'm kidding.

108
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:04,947
But seriously,
I'm gonna need a couple of drawers.

109
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,578
I can do this.
It'll be fine.

110
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,996
We'll just have to make sure
we keep things professional.

111
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,264
God, I've been lugging that thing
all over the place.

112
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:31,699
Oh, boy.

113
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:36,952
<i>Machines...</i>

114
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,127
<i>When you were little,
you wanted to be one.</i>

115
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:42,651
<i>Now we're working
to make that happen</i>

116
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,154
<i>by taking the best things
about people</i>

117
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:48,148
<i>and the best things
about machines...</i>

118
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:51,905
<i>And combing them</i>

119
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,791
<i>into something strong</i>

120
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,499
<i>and, we hope, loving...</i>

121
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:09,730
<i>I wasn't the only one being affected
by the goo coming out of Johnny.</i>

122
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,299
<i>All the scientists from
the biocomputer floor</i>

123
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:14,099
<i>had been reassigned to other labs. </i>

124
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,685
- Why don't you go talk to her?
- Talk to her?

125
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,753
Would you talk to a rainbow
or a sunset?

126
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:22,691
If I wanted to get it on
with refracted light, I would.

127
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,295
If only I was a worm.

128
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,676
I could cut myself in two
and date my lower half.

129
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,635
We all wish we were worms, Lem,

130
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,283
but that's never going to happen.
Now get in there.

131
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,124
I'm Lem.

132
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:45,714
I'm lucy.
I work upstairs in robotics.

133
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,463
I shouldn't be talking to you.

134
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,220
I just created a robot-boyfriend
who gets very jealous.

135
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,305
Wait. I'm kidding.

136
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:55,933
We broke up.

137
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,811
That's funny.
You're funny.

138
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:00,846
I can be funny.

139
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,233
Want to see me throw something
at that guy or touch the ceiling?

140
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,223
That's lame.

141
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,197
But it's cute you're trying
so hard to impress me.

142
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,384
You should meet me
for a drink tonight

143
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,910
after I've dinner with my mom
and pretend to go to bed.

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,853
<i>One drip on a desk.</i>

145
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,636
<i>That's all it took
to throw things out of whack.</i>

146
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,284
<i>And when that happens,
it changes the way you look at things.</i>

147
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,502
Are you staring at my butt?

148
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,312
No, your butt
is in my staring place.

149
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,515
So technically, it's staring at me.

150
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,851
Sorry.
It's from a small town.

151
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:41,762
It's never seen a big businessman
like you before.

152
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,845
Well, tell it to act
more professional.

153
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,024
It's making a spectacle of itself.

154
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:57,580
I was worried about sharing an office
with someone I'm attracted to,

155
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,836
but the problem

156
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,415
is being stuck with someone
with such annoying work habits.

157
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:03,958
Mama. Say...

158
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,592
Look, he's trying to say it,
only he pronounces it Maw-maw.

159
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:14,982
Excuse me.

160
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,265
I need to get some word one.
Maybe you should also.

161
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,517
And I'm sure the fish
has things to do, too,

162
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,978
like protect his treasure
from that diver.

163
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,646
First of all, "the fish" has a name.

164
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,899
He's Macgyver.

165
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,109
That's right...
Macgyver and the diver.

166
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,469
And second of all,
they're gay-married.

167
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:34,128
- And don't you dare judge...
- You do know I need your report

168
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:37,031
on the hypersonic sound project
in two days?

169
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,161
Look who's all, "get to work."

170
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,296
Macgyver, why do you think
Ted's like that?

171
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,918
Who do you think
he didn't get enough love from?

172
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:48,545
That's right... His maw-maw.

173
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,000
<i>Are you ready?</i>

174
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>I'm ready.</i>

175
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,743
<i>Are you ready?</i>

176
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:56,687
<i>I'm ready.</i>

177
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>Is your report ready?</i>

178
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:00,348
<i>No, it's not ready.</i>

179
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>- I should have your fish do it
- He can only write "mama"</i>

180
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,606
I had a great time last night.

181
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,600
I've never been
to a dance-aoke bar before.

182
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,928
Technically, it's a karaoke bar,

183
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,392
but I like to bring it
when I perform.

184
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:17,949
Listen,

185
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:21,745
I had a great time also. I'm just
so sorry about the way it ended.

186
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:26,583
Good night, Lem.

187
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:28,502
Good night.

188
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,761
You were allergic to my perfume.

189
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:40,402
It could've happened to anyone.

190
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,801
I'm not wearing any now.

191
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,194
How you doin'?

192
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:51,191
I'm Brody.
I was assigned to this office.

193
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,860
With this beautiful, exotic lady.

194
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,381
I'm not exotic.
I'm asian.

195
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:00,146
There are more of us
than there are of you,

196
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,494
so statistically,
you're the exotic one.

197
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,929
What? Wait... What?

198
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,541
You heard
the statistically average lady.

199
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,915
Is it possible
to overdose on antacid?

200
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,286
I hope the answer's yes.

201
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,381
Here. Let's find out together.

202
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,428
They just yelled at me upstairs.

203
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,837
They're mad because this leak is hurting
productivity in our department.

204
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:26,046
Someone even suggested making
the cubicle workers

205
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,352
- do their jobs in hazmat suits.
- That seems a little...

206
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,403
Save your breath.
They told me no.

207
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,494
I need this leak fixednow, Ted.

208
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm not waiting on Bhamba.
He's so stressed,

209
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,751
he spends his day staring out the window
he drew on the wall of his office.

210
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,953
I put Lem and Phil on it.
Believe me,

211
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:43,723
no one wants this problem solved
more than I do.

212
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:47,537
Is Ken having trouble with Barbie
in their Malibu dream house?

213
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,825
I must say, the thought of you guys
in there together sickens me.

214
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,085
You're jealous?

215
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,669
Jealous implies I can't have
something I want.

216
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,582
This is more like
if someone borrows my stapler...

217
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,343
Even if I'm not using the thing,

218
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:04,029
I still don't like the thought
of someone else pounding away on it.

219
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,191
See that?
She's working for ten minutes now.

220
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,392
- I'm actually getting some...
- I need a break!

221
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,060
Tell me about your ex-wife.

222
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,408
Lovely woman. Sex was good.
Crazy as hell.

223
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:17,611
Back to work.

224
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,316
So she was crazy?
I'll bet that's why the sex was good.

225
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:22,994
Why'd she leave?

226
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,565
Sure, le t's talk about
my wife taking off one day,

227
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,220
abandoning me and our child,
flying off to save the world

228
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,672
while leaving the wreckage behind
of our broken family.

229
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,340
That'll be a fun afternoon.

230
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,515
It's not bad to go
to a sad place sometimes, Ted.

231
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,256
And I hope you've talked
about your wife to someone.

232
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,861
Because it's important to work
through relationship issues

233
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,459
and figure out what went wrong.

234
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:46,116
Otherwise, you'll just keep making
the same mistakes over and over again.

235
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,791
You know what I mean?

236
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,438
I guess I hit a nerve.
He's got more problems than you,

237
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,811
and you poop in your air.

238
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,751
Now I know why Barbie and Ken
are sold separately.

239
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:04,553
Can I move in with you?

240
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,037
It was impossibl to get work done
with Linda in my office,

241
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,998
so I moved in with Veronica.

242
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,752
She and I both appreciate a quiet,
professional work environment.

243
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:24,115
Sorry, I couldn't get any workone
with that hair screaming at me.

244
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,056
The leak has put Veronica
under a little stress, too.

245
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,169
The next day,
the stress intensified,

246
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:33,115
and so did Veronica's way
of coping with it.

247
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,737
Still, it's easier
than being with Linda.

248
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,220
Besides, Veronica goes
to a lot of meetings,

249
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:47,138
so I get the place to myself.

250
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,952
They've decided upstairs
to make me the fall guy

251
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,052
for this whole biocomputer thing...

252
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:53,915
A project that wasn't even mine.

253
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,183
- It just dripped on my floor.
- That's a gun.

254
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,004
Blame the bird
that dropped the turd...

255
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,189
- You have a gun.
- Not the hat that got the splat.

256
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:02,777
That's a basic rule of business.

257
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,260
- Don't these people know anything?
- What are you doing?

258
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,600
That always works.

259
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,727
- Mother...
- You're a guest.

260
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,188
I can't have you flinching
every time I shoot a gun in here.

261
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,922
So it's not really working out
with Veronica.

262
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,452
Have you been able to plug the leak
in the biocomputer?

263
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,661
Because I need it plugged.
I need it plugged bad.

264
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,601
According to my wife,
I'm not good at reading men, either,

265
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,805
- but it sounds like...
- I can't go back to my office

266
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,003
because Linda's work habits
drive me crazy.

267
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,756
And I can't say anything because then
we'd just get in a fight,

268
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,639
and I don't want to fight.
I like Linda.

269
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,592
I just need things back
the way they were!

270
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,262
- I suppose...
- Just do it.

271
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,993
Are you avoiding me?

272
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:55,185
It's the opposite.
I've been looking for you.

273
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,395
- I've been in your office.
- I know.

274
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,737
I feel like things have gotten weird
since I moved in,

275
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:02,275
and I think I know why.
Maybe we should talk about it.

276
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,578
I'd like to.
I can't.

277
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,616
I'm in the middle of... Something.
So... Darn it.

278
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,223
Christmas was great

279
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:19,751
'cause it was a real white Christmas.
It was just awesome.

280
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,920
This polymer should plug the leak,

281
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,545
but it's a temporary fix.

282
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,452
Unless we figure out
why it's leaking,

283
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,677
- it's gonna keep happening.
- Look at that gorgeous creature.

284
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,138
I have to stop him
from getting my girl.

285
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,453
God. Lem, you're using science
for no good.

286
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,563
We took an oath
we would try to do that less.

287
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:43,131
I'm cranking this all the way up.
I'll bet brody is a lot less suave

288
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,860
when he's covered in his own vomit.
I know I am!

289
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,393
That's gross.

290
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,996
Oh, my god, I emptied
the stomach of the woman I love.

291
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,451
Okay, fellas, time's up.

292
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:00,625
We're gonna go fix the biocomputer.
Follow me.

293
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,543
But the polymer
still needs more testing.

294
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,475
If you come with me now, I won't ask
what you did to that poor woman...

295
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,470
To make her throw up like that.

296
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,259
Fair enough.

297
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:11,469
My god...

298
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:13,534
It's beautiful.

299
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:18,281
Half computer,
half living organic matter.

300
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:20,687
That looks like barf.

301
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,091
I Miss lucy.

302
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,980
I just want to shoot
this thing full of polymer

303
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,278
- and get on with our lives.
- Wait.

304
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,653
Since it hasn't been tested,
there's a 20% chance

305
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,467
that when the polymer interacts
with the corrosive acids,

306
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,754
the entire thing could explode.

307
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,714
Let's see, 20%...

308
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,972
And there's a 100% chance
Linda's still in my office.

309
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:44,544
Let's do it.
Stand back!

310
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,904
There was a 1-in-5 chance
that this could end badly,

311
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:56,747
but that was a chance I was willing
to take to get my life back to normal.

312
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,415
Wait!

313
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,988
I know what's causing the problem.

314
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:05,315
The biocomputer has an ulcer.
That's why it's leaking fluid.

315
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,213
This thing has been running nonstop
for three years.

316
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,983
It's stressed.
But since it's a biocomputer,

317
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:13,834
instead of crashing like a machine,

318
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,284
it's secreting acids
like a living organism.

319
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:17,910
How do you know that?

320
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,748
I realized it
when I saw you chugging antacid.

321
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,439
I guess I've also been under
a lot of pressure.

322
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:28,967
With Linda moving in my office
and all, it's...

323
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,644
It's been a difficult time.

324
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,884
So what do we do?

325
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,274
We're men.

326
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:37,764
- We ignore your vulnerable moment.
- I meant about the biocomputer.

327
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,114
All it needs is a way to communicate
when it's stressed.

328
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,742
I can write a program
that's triggered by an acid buildup,

329
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:47,023
a sort of acid interface,
or "ass-face" for short.

330
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,338
I'm not sure these abbreviations
are really worth the time they're saving

331
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,426
As much as I hate to admit it,

332
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,336
we have something in common.

333
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,008
We both get stressed out
when we don't communicate.

334
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,914
Plus, I'm pretty sure neither of us
can fold a fitted sheet.

335
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:05,834
We need to talk.

336
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:09,129
- Not now, Ted. I'm working.
- Now you're working?

337
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:12,213
I've got this report due tomorrow,
remember?

338
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,386
But, fine, what did you want
to talk about?

339
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:20,114
Your work habits
and how bad they are

340
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,766
and how much that bugs me.

341
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,019
This can wait.
Go ahead.

342
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:28,938
To begin with,
your work habits are bad.

343
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,619
And in conclusion, that bugs me.

344
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,847
That's not why you've been so tense.

345
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:36,614
You know why you've been so tense?

346
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,493
Does it have anything
to do with your workabits?

347
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,523
- Damn.
- You still want me.

348
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,530
I'm in your staring place,

349
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:46,938
but you're still too wounded
by your ex-wife leaving you

350
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,440
to know what to do with that.
So you don't want to be with me

351
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,366
because you're afraid
I might leave, too.

352
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,921
You flirt with me,
you stare at my butt,

353
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:57,318
- but that's as far as you can go.
- As far as I can go? You flirt, too.

354
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,371
- You're the one that has a boyfriend.
- You're the one that has a...

355
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:01,930
Good... that's a good point.

356
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,470
But six weeks ago,
I did not have a boyfriend,

357
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,408
and you still wouldn't be with me.

358
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:10,213
Fine. From now on, no more flirting.

359
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,003
We keep it professional.

360
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,818
Fine with me... boss.

361
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,738
Good.

362
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:17,655
Starting now,
you're just another butt-less coworker.

363
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,555
Good.

364
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,742
Then the door has nothing
to hit on my way out.

365
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,131
I found your sweater in the lab,
so I had it dry-cleaned.

366
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:36,925
That was nice of you.

367
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,633
Listen, lucy, about what happened...

368
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,270
Look, it's the exotic dude
from the lab.

369
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,143
Come on, babe.
Tea's ready.

370
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,451
Sorry.

371
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,723
I thought he was a jerk at first,
but then when I threw up,

372
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:54,854
he brought me home
and took care of me.

373
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:56,843
Weird?

374
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,672
If I hadn't gotten sick,
this never would've happened.

375
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,159
So you owe me $12
for the dry cleaning.

376
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,158
Thanks to Phil,
the biocomputer healed

377
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:10,361
and was brought back
to the land of the half-living.

378
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,932
More importantly, everyone could
go back to their own work spaces.

379
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,162
<i>For some, it was bittersweet.</i>

380
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,876
You'll always have
your sneeze-related head injury.

381
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,012
<i>For others,</i>

382
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,931
<i>getting their office back
was julie-andrews sweet.</i>

383
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:33,951
You did this, Phil.
And to recognize your efforts,

384
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:36,587
we're promoting you
to senior lab associate.

385
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,778
I was promoted to that a year ago.

386
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:40,415
Really?

387
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,775
You shouldn't have been.
You probably owe the company some money.

388
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,410
I'll check into that for you.

389
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:48,432
Thank you.

390
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,536
Here are the test results
for the sound transmitter.

391
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,055
Your presentation is at 3:00,

392
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,393
- you have a few hours to look it over.
- Thank you.

393
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,147
Very professionally done.

394
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:03,777
My process is just different than yours,
but I am professional,

395
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:07,015
and I believe professionalism
is our new mandate?

396
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:10,058
Thank you letting me share your office,
and good afternoon.

397
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,479
Good afternoon.
