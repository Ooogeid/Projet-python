00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,454
www.seriessub.com

4
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:06,383
Sometimes, a project comes along

5
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:08,357
that kicks the stress level up.

6
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:12,428
I need to stay especially calm,
so my people will stay calm.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,100
Cats and kittens, what is going on with
the multi-language translator device?

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,338
Ted's overcompensating
for his stress.

9
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:23,481
- The project must be in huge trouble.
- Our lives as we know them are over!

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,692
I just want to make sure
we're on track with the translator.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,779
The Germans are gonna be here
this afternoon for a demonstration.

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,697
Oh. Well, we can do that.

13
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:34,870
- What'd you come in here all calm for?
- The Germans are worried

14
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,301
about working with us,
because, ironically, they think

15
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:40,498
that we are ruthlessly efficient
and bent on world domination.

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,014
That's like when Irish auditors thought
our accounting department drank

17
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,792
- and wrote overly depressing poetry.
- Maybe you could put away

18
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:49,025
some of your
especially evil creations.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,626
- In case they want to see the lab.
- Evil?

20
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,006
We don't create evil things.

21
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,399
Some might see this long-range
people-skinning laser as evil-ish.

22
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,283
That was designed so you could peel
an orange in your kitchen

23
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,938
while sitting in your living room.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,273
It's used to peel enemy soldiers,
while you sit at the Pentagon.

25
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,332
What about this device?
It'll make it easier for people

26
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,737
to talk to each other,
and with the exception

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,929
of almost everything
my wife ever says to me,

28
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:18,285
- communication is always good.
- They use it to interrogate prisoners.

29
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,221
Why don't we clear everything away,

30
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,582
- except the ficus?
- You mean the man-eating ficus?

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,752
All right. I'll try
to keep the Germans upstairs.

32
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,214
Is everything we do down here evil?

33
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,509
Well, that's crazy.
We make a lot of nice stuff, like,

34
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:36,387
kills.

35
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,098
Slowly kills.
Quickly kills.

36
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,560
Helps shed unwanted pounds!
But also kills.

37
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:44,927
Oh, my God

38
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,231
Maybe we're evil scientists.

39
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,266
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,196
I laugh like that when faced
with an unpleasant truth.

41
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:58,784
That's why I got thrown out
of that Al Gore movie.

42
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,427
Hey, excuse me.

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,007
This isn't a library. You can't leave
your trash wherever you want.

44
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:13,993
Jeez.

45
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,635
Brett, you see that
awesome youtube video

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,805
of that goat that sounds like a man?
He keeps yelling "Mark!"

47
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,100
I love that goat.
He's all... "Mark! Mark!"

48
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,839
Do you mind?

49
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,590
That's the last time forward
anything to you guys.

50
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,755
<i>Worried about the deal
with the Germans,</i>

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,812
<i>Veronica was also
under a lot of stress.</i>

52
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:38,810
We believe
the multi-language translator

53
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:40,830
will create a furor in Germany,

54
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,393
a furor that will sweep
across Europe,

55
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:45,409
crushing...
No.

56
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,282
What's going on?

57
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:10,731
Do you live here?

58
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,609
Do all the cubicle workers have
little hobbit holes like this?

59
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:17,780
No, some of us nest in trees,
others have underground warrens.

60
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:21,700
Actually, I just found this empty room,
so I decorated a little,

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,687
and come here occasionally
to get a break

62
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,394
- from that corporate pit out there.
- Was that thumping noise

63
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,843
the sound of you banging
your head against the wall,

64
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:31,335
summoning the hobbits
to feast and dance?

65
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,878
Why don't you lay off?

66
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,427
If you want. I'm sorry.

67
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,451
I'm a little sensitive
about the hobbit jokes,

68
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:40,178
because I think of myself
as having big, floppy feet.

69
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:42,388
I know. It's crazy, right?

70
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,543
Fine. Don't reassure me
about my giant feet

71
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,918
which I might be
too sensitive about.

72
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,664
Again, thank you.
Anyway, that thumping sound

73
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,986
was this game I came up with
to blow off steam.

74
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,202
You take a bagel,
you stand on this coffee stain,

75
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:03,325
and you try to bounce it off that wall
and into that air vent.

76
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,203
It's pretty tricky.

77
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:07,915
Not for me,

78
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:09,915
because I'm good at everything I do.

79
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,289
I'm not bragging, because bragging is
the one thing I'm not good at.

80
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:16,273
Although, if I wanted to be,
I'd be excellent at that, too,

81
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,090
- as I've just proved.
- Really?

82
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:22,428
You'd be better at Linda bagel?
Because, you know... I'm Linda.

83
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:25,764
And I'm Veronica.
So bagel me.

84
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,348
Veronica is late for our big meeting
with the Germans,

85
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,337
who, of course, are right on time.

86
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,158
What? It's a positive stereotype.

87
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:39,831
Anyway, now I am stuck
having to charm them all by myself.

88
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,629
Which suddenly, I am fine with.

89
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:46,754
Pots-damn!

90
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,015
Hello, I'm Ted crisp.

91
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,958
Guten tag, I'm Hans Muller.
This is Carl Hoffman

92
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,919
und our C.E.O. Greta Schulz.

93
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,921
Hello, I am being happy to meet you.

94
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,506
You and I... Do it, I hope.

95
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,676
The coming together?

96
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,554
Okay. I hope so, too.

97
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:08,015
Fraulein Schulz is not fluent
in English.

98
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,249
She hopes this deal
between our two companies

99
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:11,642
will come together.

100
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:16,337
Thanks for the clarification,
Herr buzz kill.

101
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,607
Nothin' but vent!
Do I look like a bus?

102
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,655
'cause I just took you to school.

103
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:24,686
Suck my big hobbit feet!

104
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,452
Keep your flippers in your clown shoes.
We're going again.

105
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,418
The multiple language
trslator device

106
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,806
will instantaneously
translate any language into any other

107
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,870
and turn this dial
to the desired language.

108
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,978
Sorry I'm late.
There was an emergency

109
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:57,314
with the dough-based projectile
ventilation targeting system.

110
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,857
Please... Continue.

111
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,700
Phil, who speaks fluent German,

112
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:02,480
will now speak into the device,

113
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,113
which will translate
what he says into english.

114
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,110
Hello.
I am your friend.

115
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:13,053
Do not be afraid.
It's me! Phil!

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,776
- I thought you worked on the voice.
- We made it more awesome.

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,922
Who wouldn't want to sound
like a 90-foot robot, you know?

118
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,779
Our ships are hovering
above all your cities.

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,024
Oh, God.
We have unhappy Germans.

120
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,057
Nothing good has ever come
from that.

121
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:36,311
Okay, we will have this voice fixed
in a couple days.

122
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,732
In the meantime, why don't you relax?
Maybe do some sightseeing?

123
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,836
Yes, on us! Throw on
some leather shorts,

124
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,826
dark shoes, socks up to the knees,

125
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,865
and stomp around our fine city.

126
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,119
Perhaps Ted can stomp me.

127
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,047
Ah, stomp with me.

128
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,584
I not wish to die
from Ted's under-boot.

129
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,103
I got new under-boots.

130
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:02,963
I'd hate to have
to scrape you off them.

131
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,489
Don't translate that.

132
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,593
Tell her I'd be happy
to take her around.

133
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,488
I saw what was going on in there

134
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,174
between you and her.

135
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,225
When you show her around town,
keep your hands off her gretels.

136
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,832
I was just being friendly.

137
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:26,520
This deal is too important,
and sex can screw things up.

138
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,651
Why do you think the three stooges
went through so many curlys?

139
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:35,920
Look at her.

140
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:39,219
I can have a personal relationship
and not screw up a business deal.

141
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:40,817
I'm notlike the three stooges.

142
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,187
I have never spent the night
in a mummy museum

143
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,376
or smuggled a chicken
into the opera.

144
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,426
Hello, Toad.

145
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,338
Ted.

146
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:51,845
Eat me?

147
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,390
Let's go to dinner.
I'm gonna teach you the word "with."

148
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,435
Phil and Lem couldn't stand
the thought of being evil scientists.

149
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,026
Maybe if we came up
with something that's pure good

150
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,029
that the company
couldn't possibly use for evil.

151
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,990
Or... What if we invent something
that's already pure evil?

152
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,779
Then maybe the company will
turn it into something good,

153
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,721
like a horrible device
that drops heavy things on your feet

154
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,707
and tells you the end of movies
you really wanted to see.

155
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,211
I thought you saw "The 6th Sense,"
I was setting down my end of the sofa.

156
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,694
I hadn't, and my toe
will never be the same.

157
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,508
How are glasses and mustache doing
with the translator voice?

158
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,802
Glasses and mustache
are the same person.

159
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,609
And Lem and Phil
need a little bit more time.

160
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,797
The Germans
aren't going to like this.

161
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,862
They're in no hurry to leave town.

162
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:42,646
Oh, my God. You're jackhammering Gretel
like she's the Berlin wall.

163
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,709
It was a little more romantic
than that.

164
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,965
There was a lot of cheering in German,
followed by heartfelt congratulations.

165
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,696
If something goes wrong,
you could blow this whole deal.

166
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,296
You think nothing will go wrong,
because it's you.

167
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,674
I do not think that, although nothing
will go wrong. It's me.

168
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,582
That's hubris. You're cocky.
You think you can't lose.

169
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,629
It's very self-destructive.
You should take a hard look at...

170
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,711
Linda, rematch in 30 minutes,
and this time, there's no way I lose.

171
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,380
Okay, but I don't think
you used my proper title.

172
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,509
Oh, queen Linda the dainty-footed.

173
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,530
Anyway. You're gonna end up
making a fool of yourself.

174
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:22,330
Why is Veronica talking to you
like a waitress at medieval times?

175
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,064
I made up this bagel toss game,
when she loses, I make her say stuff.

176
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:27,900
And she always loses.

177
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,339
Chick throws a bagel like
the horse is still attached.

178
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,446
That works better for horseshoes.

179
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,820
Look, Veronica's got the better job,

180
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,910
the better car,
the better shoe size.

181
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,058
This is the only thing I'll ever do
that I'm better at than she is.

182
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,855
It's the most important thing.

183
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,308
I can see by the spittle
flying out of your mouth

184
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,823
that you're in a good place,
but you should know,

185
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:49,254
she will strike back.

186
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,952
I don't care. It's worth it,
as long as I keep winning.

187
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,530
Which I will,
because I am Linda of Linda bagel.

188
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,537
That's hubris. You're cocky.

189
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,206
You think you can't lose.
It's very self-destructive.

190
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,625
You should take a hard look at...
It's greta.

191
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,519
We've got a date. It'll be awesome.

192
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,649
This little extra work requires
your royal touch, queen Linda.

193
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,443
Heavy is the head
that wears the $10 haircut.

194
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,156
No problem. It's as easy as throwing
a bagel through a vent.

195
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,826
Oh, I'm sorry. For some people,
that's practically impossible.

196
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,393
In spite of not being able
to speak very well,

197
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:29,034
Greta and I were having
no trouble communicating.

198
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,552
It is here.

199
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,539
Herr Muller bring for me.

200
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:42,766
Surprise.

201
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,912
I tell Lem and the little bird man,

202
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:48,991
"mach schnell.

203
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,066
I must speak with mein Ted."

204
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:54,361
Really? They fixed it.
That is fantastic.

205
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,950
I really like you, Ted.
You're a very special man.

206
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,406
Is that Phil's voice?

207
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,751
What's wrong?

208
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,751
I like this voice.
It's warm and friendly

209
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,295
and almost gender-neutral.

210
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:15,007
The device works.
Our business deal will be a success.

211
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,106
Kiss me, Ted.

212
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,156
Kiss me hard on the lips.

213
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:24,766
What?

214
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:28,437
I thought you'd be happy
we can finally know each other.

215
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,398
Our relationship wasn't
just about sex, was it?

216
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:32,910
No.

217
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,067
Nein.

218
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:38,371
Then let's go into the bedroom,
we can make love and talk

219
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,116
and make love and talk all night.

220
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:59,259
Phil, why on earth would you use
your voice for the translator device?

221
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,438
It was the fastest way to fix it,

222
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:03,374
we already had
my voice in the computer

223
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:06,239
- from a failed project.
- Stupid thing wouldn't stop screamin

224
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,870
- when putting it on the burner.
- It was critical.

225
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,884
"You really need that much butter?"
Screw you, frying pan.

226
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,607
Okay, fellas. Excuse us.

227
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,527
So here's the deal.
Greta and I are dating.

228
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:21,551
But... It's hard for me
to fulfill my manly duties

229
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,909
when Phil keeps telling me
how much I'm pleasuring him.

230
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:27,371
- Oh, my god.
- Yes. You said that a lot last night.

231
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,588
Guys, I need your help.
I really like Greta,

232
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,283
and I don't want this thing between
us to go south, plus if it does,

233
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,659
I could foul up this deal,
and Veronica will kill me.

234
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:37,029
Recording and loading a new voice
could take days.

235
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:40,133
We still have those Nixon tapes.
I guess we could pull from those.

236
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,793
I'm beginning to think
you guys really are evil scientists.

237
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,345
Hi, Ted.
How are things going with Greta?

238
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,587
- You screw that up yet?
- No. We really like each other.

239
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:52,026
Plus, she is very happy with
the new voice on the translator.

240
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,398
The guys just need
a little time to tweak it.

241
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:58,254
- It's close, it's close. It's so close.
- Man. I have to go.

242
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,615
I need you to design me
a perfect bagel.

243
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,292
Perfect but somehow evil?

244
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,692
Like halfway down your throat,
it triples in size

245
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,797
or tells you the end to "Rocky IV"?

246
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,208
No, just a dozen perfect,
aerodynamically balanced bagels.

247
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,294
A perfect bagel, there's no way
that could be used for anything bad.

248
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,712
I'm using them to cheat.

249
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,950
Linda sucked me
into this stupid game,

250
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,399
and your super-bagels
will help me destroy her.

251
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,949
- Boom. We're back in the evil business.
- And throw in a pint of cream cheese.

252
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:29,558
I don't care how evil you are. You don't
show up with bagels and no schmear.

253
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,067
So if a guy asked you not to talk
during sex, would you be offended?

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,361
No woman likes to be told
to shut up during sex.

255
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,322
Wait. Did Paul from accounting
tell you to ask me that?

256
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,451
Because all we did was make out,
and all I said was, "get off my hair."

257
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,602
Paul from accounting? Really?

258
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,440
No. Gotcha.

259
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,124
Would you leave?
I have a lot of work to do.

260
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,417
What is all this?

261
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:59,045
- Veronica's retaliating.
- Why don't you just let her win?

262
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,714
What are you afraid of?

263
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,091
Not to enter
the time-wasters' hall of fame?

264
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,386
No. My position there is secure
from getting my art history degree.

265
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,832
I just can't make myself lose.

266
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,685
I've tried,
but it feels so good to beat her.

267
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,685
Find a way to end it without losing.

268
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:16,688
When Rose gets frustrated with checkers,
she flips the board over.

269
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:19,207
I once tried the same thing in Vegas
with a craps' table.

270
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:21,943
Got it up just high enough
to tear every muscle in my back.

271
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:25,530
Interesting. Like when Van Gogh
got so frustrated with his paintings,

272
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,298
he ripped up his canvases.

273
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:30,827
That little factoid cost my parents
$60,000 in tuition.

274
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,721
<i>Since I couldn't tell Greta not to talk,
I tried to make it so I couldn't hear.</i>

275
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,837
Ted, the music is so loud.

276
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,335
Ich weiss. Ist es nicht erotisch?

277
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,181
I know your friend's voice
bothers you,

278
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,041
but isn't it worth it
to hear my feelings and instructions

279
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,896
about the best way
to touch my breasts?

280
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,025
If we can't communicate,

281
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:06,097
then this is all just about sex,
and that doesn't work for me.

282
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:09,104
Es ist nicht nur sex, Phil... Greta.

283
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,575
Sehen sie das problem?

284
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:15,205
Why don't you take that schnitzel
you brought me and go home?

285
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,807
Ich will das zu den schnitzel ast.

286
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,001
Den schnitzel macht dich glucklich.

287
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,046
That's because I thought
the schnitzel meant something.

288
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,756
But I was wrong...

289
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,106
so wrong...
about you and the schnitzel.

290
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,185
Good morning. Fraulein Schulz
has decided we do not want

291
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,510
to partner with your company
on the device.

292
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,395
Goodbye.

293
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,815
Was much promising, but not true.

294
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,353
Damn it, Ted.

295
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:49,531
You were much promising
but not true.

296
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,033
She wanted to use it
with Phil's voice during sex.

297
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,748
I don't care if she wanted
to use Phil during sex.

298
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:57,664
You screwed this up because you were
so sure you were smarter than

299
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,567
- the Three Stooges.
- You're right.

300
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,875
And I like Greta.

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,128
I don't want it to end like this.
I'll go talk to her.

302
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:09,994
Greta, wait. Can we talk?

303
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,228


304
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,016
Damn it. I told them
not to put Klingon on this thing.

305
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,018
Warten sie, Greta.
Konnen wir sprechen?

306
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:19,769
You have one minute.

307
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,506
Veronica just called.

308
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:31,406
She's about to play another game
and wants to use the bagels to cheat.

309
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:34,122
We're completely corrupted now.

310
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,511
We're like Michael Corleone
at the end of "The Godfather."

311
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:39,289
- Damn it, Lem!
- You should watch a movie occasionally.

312
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,500
Look at them.
They're so beautiful.

313
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,277
Using them for wickedness would be like
beating a unicorn to death

314
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:47,047
with a bag of rainbows.

315
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,893
Maybe we should take a stand.

316
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,469
Maybe we should say this is the one
thing that must not be used for evil.

317
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,222
Or maybe we say that the next thing
we make must not be used for evil,

318
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,802
but this one we're fine with.
And maybe the next one after that, too.

319
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,062
But someday,
they will push us too far.

320
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:06,316
- And then next time after that, we...
- No. The time is now...

321
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:09,603
12:35.

322
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:13,198
Let's discuss this for another 20 min,
and then commit to something.

323
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,162
Good. You made it.

324
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,997
Go inside.
I'll be in in a minute.

325
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,124
Lem and Phil
are bringing me something.

326
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,874
It has nothing to do with the game.

327
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,115
It's a...

328
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,170
lucky hat.

329
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,901
I may decide not to wear it.
So if I come in without a hat,

330
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,568
don't give it a second thought.

331
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,134
I have devastating news.

332
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,679
Somehow, security found out
about the room.

333
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,265
I don't know how. Nobody does,
and nobody ever will, so just drop that.

334
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,935
But they don't like people
screwing around on company time,

335
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,646
so they're coming right now
to lock it up.

336
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,815
No! It can't end until I win.

337
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,405
Fine, I'll play without my...

338
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:52,570
Whatever the hell I said
I was waiting for. Come on.

339
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,826
Okay, Ted, I will give you
another chance.

340
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,037
Lock the door and take me,
and don't be gentle.

341
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,348
Aber konnten wir uber unsere
gefuhl nicht gerade sprechen?

342
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,795
And none of that silly foreplay
this time. Just go for it.

343
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,845
I've tied it up.
Your turn, meat.

344
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,889
You gonna blow it?
Huh, meat? You gonna choke?

345
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,205
I'm Linda. I'm choking.

346
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:25,323
I've got a big chunk of pressure
lodged in my throat.

347
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,857
It's like a chicken bone.
Come on, chicken bone. Chicken bone.

348
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,684
I'm really gonna miss this.

349
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,277
Oh, Ted. That feels so good.
More, more. Don't stop.

350
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:37,122
What the hell is that?
What are Phil and Ted doing?

351
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:40,065
Is that distracting?
Come on, chicken bone, focus.

352
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,703
Don't think about Ted nailing Phil.

353
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,593
You are so good with the sex, Ted.

354
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,875
- What?!
- Throw the bagel, chicken bone.

355
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,093
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

356
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,338
This is it.

357
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,751
This is
for the world championship...

358
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:00,862
of the world.

359
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,899
I did it! I beat you!

360
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah, whatever. Seriously,
what is up with Ted and Phil?

361
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,907
I have to get that bagel.
It's going in my trophy case.

362
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,202
Also, I have to get a trophy case.

363
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,626
It's way back there.

364
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,166
You sure this is right?

365
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,584
I've never been so sure about being
unsure of anything in my life.

366
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,756
Good. Then we're on the same page.
Let's do it.

367
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,201
Veronica, we've made a decision.

368
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:48,005
Maybe we should ask her
why she just fell through the ceiling.

369
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,312
No. No small talk.

370
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:53,650
These bagels are the one thing
we will not allow to be used for evil.

371
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,773
I won.

372
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:04,040
Congratulations. The deal
with the Germans just went through.

373
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,287
And to you too
for falling through the ceiling

374
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,790
in a metal tube and winning that game.
That's gotta feel good.

375
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,459
You'll have to speak up.
I'm temporarily deaf in one ear.

376
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,566
As you may know, I fell through
the ceiling in a metal tube.

377
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:17,465
But at least I won that game,
and that feels good.

378
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:23,580
These super-bagels are terrible. You can
totally taste the high impact carbon.

379
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,275
That's because they're
98% high impact carbon.

380
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,936
Whenever you go past 97%,
it's hard to mask the taste.

381
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,594
So I was able to navigate
that tricky situation with Greta,

382
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,989
so you were wrong.
I am not like the Three Stooges.

383
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,703
A couple of wise guys, eh?
