00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:09,297
It's not always easy to know who you are
and to be comfortable with that.

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:11,712
Like Alice...
She still thinks she's 20.

4
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:16,990
And Ernie...
He thinks he's a gangsta.

5
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:21,300
And Linda... she thinks she and Veronica
can talk about their personal lives,

6
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:23,774
- like girlfriends.
- Hey, girlfriend...

7
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,249
Boss. Sir.

8
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,696
So my boyfriend wants us
to move in together.

9
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:32,552
Why would he want that?

10
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:34,741
No, I mean he wants me
to move in with him.

11
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:38,126
- Then where am I supposed to live?
- You're sabotaging this conversation.

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,734
- Just till we get to the meeting.
- I can get it done in that time.

13
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,834
We've been back together for 6 months.
He's a nice guy. My cat loves his dog,

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,087
and he has better furniture
than I do. Done!

15
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,510
Okay, fellas, nerd it up.

16
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,487
We've been developing
a new search engine.

17
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,639
And unlike language-based
search engines,

18
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,725
this face-matching technology
uses visual recognition.

19
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,268
Less nerd, more english.

20
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,567
- You take an image of a person...
- Or "picture".

21
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:06,774
- And scan it into a computer...
- Or "magic box".

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,329
I'm not embarrassed to say,
this is helping.

23
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,405
Now once the photo...
Like your corporate head shot...

24
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:13,572
is scanned,

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,569
the search engine
will find that face

26
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:19,294
on every video or still image
that's ever been uploaded

27
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,330
- onto the Internet.
- It can find the subject

28
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,020
in a crowded stadium,

29
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,793
in the backgroundof home movies,
security cameras, webcams.

30
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,979
It's like having eyes everywhere,
but not in a bad way,

31
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:31,924
like that time we spilled
that container full of eyes.

32
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,636
With this technology,
we have finally defeated privacy.

33
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,456
I just have to say,
a technology like this

34
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,307
could have serious consequences.

35
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:44,270
I mean, we are opening up
a huge can of... Awesome.

36
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,276
Look al those pictures.
This must be how a bee sees me.

37
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,237
There you are in the background
of some fancy restaurant.

38
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,072
Looks like a mas getting sick.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,984
The guy died,
which is apparently what you had to do

40
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,123
at that place to get
the waiter's attention.

41
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:01,370
More, more, more!

42
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:05,166
What's this?

43
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,794
Looks like you on some kind
of stage with a... magician?

44
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:14,216
Somebody must have taken this
with a phone and put it on the Internet,

45
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,886
perhaps for our pleasure.

46
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:23,429
Hey, everyone,
Linda's moving in with her boyfriend.

47
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,792
Unless your boyfriend is
a half-naked magician,

48
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:34,320
I say we stay on the topic of...
"What the hell is that?"

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,217
Boy, I cannot figure out
this weather.

50
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:50,637
I mean, I woke up...
It looked like rain. I get to work,

51
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:52,463
and you're a magician's assistant.

52
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,503
What can I say?

53
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:55,925
I love him.

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,092
Who?

55
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,428
- Mordor.
- Is that the magician?

56
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,471
His name is Mordor.
What do you think?

57
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,380
Eight months ago, I saw him performing
in a lounge off the vegas strip.

58
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:09,063
We shared an instant
animal attraction.

59
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,399
He invited me up on stage,
and I never left.

60
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,986
Boy, when you undo
that bun, you really undo that bun.

61
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,618
Now I fly to Vegas
every other weekend to perform.

62
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,633
For those two days, I don't have
to be in charge of anything.

63
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:24,308
It's a total release.

64
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,785
All I have to do is
please the man I love

65
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,550
and twice nightly lock him
in a watertight drum,

66
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,001
which also pleases him.

67
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,950
You look like you could use
a handkerchief.

68
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,256
Here, use mine.

69
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,575
Okay, I will get it for you.

70
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,222
Look! It is never-ending.

71
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,865
When will it end?

72
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,308
Never?

73
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,494
I always dreaded
this day would come,

74
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,892
that people here would find out
about my other life.

75
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:56,694
People are gonna have their fun
for the next couple of days,

76
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,364
and something weird will happen, like
someone will invent carnivorous shoes,

77
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,662
- and this whole thing will be old news.
- Ta-da! It is ended.

78
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,674
I can't function here
if people know that

79
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,209
twice a month I put an half an ounce
of spandex and hide a dove in my...

80
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,588
Let's just say it's not comfortable
for me or the dove.

81
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:20,021
Anyway, it would
undermine my authority.

82
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:21,927
So I've decided to quit the act.

83
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,084
But what about... Odor?

84
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,309
It's Mordor,

85
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,442
Mordor the unforgiving,
and I just hope he understands.

86
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,622
<i>Our new search engine
had exposed veronica's private life,</i>

87
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,499
<i>and it was about to change Phil's.</i>

88
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,079
Great. Here's a video
of me at the mini-mart,

89
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:44,520
buying my wife some
tamp-you-know-whats.

90
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,495
Here's me in a cowboy outfit.

91
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:50,251
No way.

92
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,290
Looks like
I'm on some kind of a ranch.

93
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,044
And there you are riding a bull
at a rodeo.

94
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,266
This can't be me.

95
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,881
Why would I be on a bull
without zinc on my nose?

96
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,402
Look at this...

97
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:03,549
"Byron McNurtney wins eighth
bull riding competition."

98
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:05,210
This isn't you.

99
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,004
The search engine found someone
who looks exactly like you.

100
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,039
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

101
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,067
It's like looking into some
bizarre alternate universe

102
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,157
where I can drive a bull
and wear tall shoes

103
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,522
with throwing stars
attached to them.

104
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,403
Those arboots with spurs.

105
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,528
Wild!

106
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,949
Here he is, surrounded by women.

107
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,322
All my life, I thought my average looks
were holding me back.

108
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,581
How does this mcnurtney guy
do all that

109
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,792
with the same ham hocks
and chitlins?

110
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,340
For most people, there's a gap
between who they'd like to be

111
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,671
and who they really are, but not me.

112
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:44,926
I'm not bragging.
I just happen to know who I am.

113
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:48,097
Hey, Ted, you're not seeing
anyone right now, are you?

114
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm totally fine with that.

115
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:53,352
I heard you're moving in with Don.
I'm totally fine with that, too.

116
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,570
Yes, I'm very happy,
and I want you to be happy.

117
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,524
So I'm setting you up
with my friend Rebecca.

118
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,032
She's beautiful,
and she's a veterinarian.

119
00:06:01,157 --> 00:06:03,558
When you meet her, if you start
trembling and pee on the floor,

120
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,699
- she'll be okay with it.
- Well, that is my move.

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,208
I don't know if I want
to meet anyone right now.

122
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,025
I'm busy with work and with Rose.

123
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,414
My herb garden's
finally coming together. I've got...

124
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:17,876
How weird that you would show up
right at this moment.

125
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,337
So coincidence, huh?
That's what you're going with?

126
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:23,382
You must be ted.
I'm rebecca.

127
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,708
Setting me up with your friend...
That's happening, like, right now.

128
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,472
Apparently it is. Sorry about Linda.
She's as subtle as a weimaraner.

129
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:35,853
See, that's funny because weimaraners
are high-strung dogs.

130
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,918
And they're notorious
for setting up their friends.

131
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,151
Sounds like they're the yentas
of the canine world.

132
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,094
Look what's going on here.

133
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:51,326
I did not major in chemistry,
but I know it when I see it.

134
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,796
You should go out to dinner together.
How about Friday night?

135
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,294
I can watch Rose.
Rose is his daughter.

136
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,664
So it looks like we have two choices...
We go out Friday,

137
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,172
or you put Linda to sleep.

138
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,051
I don't care about your problems...

139
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,706
<i>Doing a magic act and spending
time with the man she loved</i>

140
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,694
<i>had been veronica's way
to relieve stress.</i>

141
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,560
<i>Since that pressure
wasn't being relieved,</i>

142
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,687
<i>it was coming out in other ways.</i>

143
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:21,797
<i>It started harmlessly...</i>

144
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,360
<i>But she needed more.</i>

145
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,037
'sup, V-Ness?
I got your mail on.

146
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,664
Looks like a shout-out from
the "c" to the "e" to the "o"!

147
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,084
Finally she found
something that worked.

148
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:44,282
There we go.

149
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,511
<i>And for the next few days,
Veronica slapped her stress away.</i>

150
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,722
I'll take some coffee...
anything but dutch blend.

151
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,808
Sorry. All we have is dutch blend.

152
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,094
Maybe just a bagel.

153
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,485
I checked your computer,
Ms. Palmer. It can't be fixed.

154
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,447
How about now?

155
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,992
So people are not
loving the slapping.

156
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,823
You think I like it... touching
all those strange faces?

157
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:17,788
It's gross.

158
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,999
Plus, you could get fired.
I mean, it is a weird-ass thing to do.

159
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,002
Yes, Ted, I know.

160
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,919
I shouldn't hit people on the staff.

161
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,880
I've been hearing that
since grade school.

162
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:30,213
I think you need to look
at the bigger problem here.

163
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:32,368
Clearly, crawling around
a stage on all fours

164
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,692
with a dove in your thong
has kept you from acting crazy.

165
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,181
First of all, you're way off
on how the trick is done.

166
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:41,465
Also, now that I've been exposed,
I have to choose between my two lives,

167
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,071
and I'm choosing this one.

168
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,364
You love Mordor.
You love working with him.

169
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,022
You can't just throw away
a part of who you are.

170
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:49,736
You know I'm right.

171
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,742
- Don't do it.
- The hand wants what the hand wants.

172
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:57,077
Don't do it.

173
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:01,485
We're cool.

174
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,262
<i>Luckily, Mordor was
in town for a big show.</i>

175
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:08,796
<i>So I went to see him, hoping to get him
to call her so they'd get back together.</i>

176
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,563
I'm not talking to that woman.

177
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:13,281
I've worked for years to get a show
in this town, and when I finally do,

178
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,929
she just disappears forever...
Like my first rabbit

179
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,350
and my mom

180
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,210
and everybody else who's ever
come into my life.

181
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,180
Veronica needs you,

182
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:25,602
- and I think you need her.
- What makes you so sure?

183
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:27,816
Help! I'm trapped!

184
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,068
Save me with your magic!

185
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,987
There's a latch, remember?

186
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,033
Sorry, Kevin.

187
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,618
It's Mordor.

188
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,287
Veronica told me she loves you,
and she does not love easily.

189
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:45,081
She is like a portuguese
water dog in that way.

190
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,299
I just met this cute veterinarian,
and she says things like that

191
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:50,505
and then has to explain it,
like I am now.

192
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:52,974
I'm sorry.
I won't call veronica.

193
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:54,593
She sawed my heart in half,

194
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:58,385
it wasn't one of those plastic hearts
that come in two pieces in the kit

195
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,825
with a pair of fake legs.

196
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,267
Damn it. I keep telling people
how my tricks are done.

197
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:11,934
I'm guessing that's not you eating
sushi off that naked woman,

198
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,154
and not just because
you're allergic to mercury.

199
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,531
I figured it out.

200
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:18,235
What's been missing
from my life is confidence.

201
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,101
That's the only thing keeping me

202
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:21,870
from being Byron Mcnurtney.

203
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,914
- Well, then you're screwed.
- Or am i?

204
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,776
I'm thinking confidence
may be one of those things

205
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:30,566
people can't tell if you really have
or are just pretending to have,

206
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,881
like the female orgasm.

207
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:35,476
So you're saying
by just acting confident,

208
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,351
- you can Mcnurtney-ize yourself?
- That is my theory.

209
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:41,265
Well, then as men of science,
let's put it to the test.

210
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,658
Mcnurtney's always
surrounded by women.

211
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:46,478
Let's see if, using nothing
but confidence, you can attract one. 

212
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,358
But I'm married to a woman who seethes
with both indifference

213
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,993
- and jealousy.
- You don't have to sex the female.

214
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,543
Just get her phone number.

215
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:57,615
You talked to Mordor?

216
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,949
How did he look?
Is he okay?

217
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,995
Did you touch his ches
it's so hard not to.

218
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,854
No. Linda's setting me up
with a friend of hers,

219
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,173
so I think I'm gonna see
where that goes first.

220
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:11,295
You left him right before
one of the biggest nights of his life.

221
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,570
 He'll be fine.

222
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:16,551
Listen, he needs you.
Kristi, his new assistant?

223
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,136
She thought that abra cadabra
was a country in Europe.

224
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,477
Kristi, the waitress
from the lounge?

225
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,725
She's an idiot.
She could get Mordor killed.

226
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,829
You have to be smart
to be an assistant.

227
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,513
You have to be totally in sync
with your magician,

228
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:34,026
know when to pull the wire,
slip him the key, ice his nipples.

229
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,646
Well, after meeting Kristi,

230
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,990
looks like Mordor's gonna have to
pick a lock with flaccid nipples.

231
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,607
All right, damn it.

232
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,746
I'll do the show
one last time.

233
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,630
Only 'cause I know how important it is,
and I can't leave him hanging.

234
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,812
Occasionally I leave him hanging,
but it's part of the act...

235
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,112
Or sometimes fore play.

236
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,259
So, the number for the pizza
place is on the fridge.

237
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,428
You know how to get in touch with me,
and don't let Rose on the computer.

238
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:06,292
She's grounded from the internet. 

239
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,354
Did you see pictures
you shouldn't have?

240
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:12,168
- I bought a boat!
- Not just any boat. It sleeps 12, 

241
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,151
and we're not keeping it.

242
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,202
Well, have fun, you two.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

243
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,492
There's nothing I wouldn't do.
I know. I was your roommate.

244
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:22,578
All right.
You guys he fun.

245
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,864
- Good night.
- Good night.

246
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,082
So why aren'tyou
dating my dad?

247
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:33,316
Well,
because it's complicated.

248
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,998
Sometimes grown-ups find
themselves at different places,

249
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,854
and they're not always
open to the...

250
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,843
I have a boyfriend. That's why.
I don't know why I spaced on that.

251
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,403
<i>And while I was getting
to know someone new,</i>

252
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,963
<i>Phil was trying to be
someone new.</i>

253
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:51,561
- Hello there.
- Hello.

254
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,688
Phil Myman. Scientist.

255
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,748
Two people behind you
in the lunch line yesterday.

256
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:00,070
I trust you enjoyed
your applesauce.

257
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:02,051
It was fine. Apples and sauce,

258
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:05,094
- What could be bad about that?
- I'm gonna have to correct you.

259
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,119
It's actually apples
made into sauce.

260
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:09,538
So... Phone numbers.

261
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,332
Those things
are crazy, right?

262
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:14,459
Can I help you?

263
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:18,630
- Do you know her phone number?
- It's the same as mine.

264
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,349
Don't pick up when I call.

265
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,858
- And then what happened?
- She told it was my birthday,

266
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,984
They brought me a cake,
and they sang to me.

267
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,436
So she's a liar.

268
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,169
I know what you're getting at

269
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:36,777
You want me to be with Linda,
but it's not gonna happen. 

270
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,565
I have an opinion about that.

271
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,362
It's not up to you, honey.

272
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,529
When you call the shots,
we end up buying boats. 

273
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,316
A boat, one time.

274
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:47,367
$140,000.

275
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,161
I think we're done here.

276
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:54,998
Good morning, Lem.

277
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:57,669
Oh, my god.

278
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,547
Women, they think
just because they're stronger,

279
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,841
- they can get away with anything.
- It wasn't a woman.

280
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,017
- It was her boyfriend.
- Men, just because they're stronger,

281
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,499
- they can get a...
- no, no, it was a good thing. 

282
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,415
He saw me as a threat.

283
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:13,689
I'm a scientist, Lem.
I've been a threat to humanity,

284
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:16,254
the environment, even Jupiter once,
but never 

285
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,303
to a hot girl's boyfriend.

286
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:21,160
I've goose bumps.

287
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,905
It's like this is the beginning
of a whole new Phil.

288
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,166
Actually, no. I looked down
Byron Mcnurtney road,

289
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,496
and it leads straight
to the emergency room.

290
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,511
No, I've decided I'm gonna
stick with who I am.

291
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,059
 Isn't there some
sort of middle ground?

292
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,736
Nope

293
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,447
- Then what happened?
- We had birthday cake

294
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,775
and talked for a while.
Can we go to lunch now?

295
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,936
You don't seem excited.

296
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:51,897
Let me show you
what you could have.

297
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:53,933
We've this search engine,
so I pulled together

298
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,264
a bunch of stuff on Ted
for you to see.

299
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,364
Here he is at the company
picnic playing volleyball.

300
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,192
Look at his muscles
when he serves.

301
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,355
And in this one, he's helping Rose
into a ride at Disneyland.

302
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,323
Look at his face.

303
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,136
The way he looks at her,

304
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:13,481
So concerned and caring...
It just melts your heart.

305
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:16,753
Oh, my god.
You're obsessed with Ted.

306
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,419
- That's ridiculous.
- Look at you.

307
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,214
You spend more time thinking about Ted
than you do your own boyfriend.

308
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,551
I could focus on him if someone
would take Ted off the table.

309
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,263
Is that why you want me to go out
with him, to make him unavailable?

310
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:38,351
I just thought we'd make a great couple.
You'd make a great couple.

311
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,695
Are we gonna stay here
all day, or are we gonna go eat lunch?

312
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:47,397
To help the man she loves,
Veronica decided to do one last show.

313
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,814
I'm here to support her.

314
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,607
She doesn't want to get nervous,
She told me to sit in the back 

315
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:54,459
Come on, let's all sit in
the front where she can see us!

316
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,823
Oh, god.
Veronica's gonna freak out.

317
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,288
Plus they have better seats than me,
so I'm not happy either.

318
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:11,162
What are you doing backstage? Get in
here quick. You'll let the dove out.

319
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:15,965
I like to let him flap
his wings a little, 

320
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,305
tire him out before I load him in.

321
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,730
I gotta know. What is
the last thing the dove sees?

322
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,741
He's blindfolded.
It's better for both of us.

323
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,362
- What do you want?
- I came to warn you

324
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,829
so that you're not surprised
when you go on stage.

325
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,169
- There's a lot of people from work.
- What?

326
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,449
I can't do the show in front their. 

327
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,849
They're just here to laugh
at me. I'm not going on.

328
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,280
If you go out there with self-respect
and confidence,

329
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,114
they'll be the ones who look foolish.

330
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:46,129
Halfway through the act,
I drink from a large saucer of milk. 

331
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,633
And then Mordor
and I bathe in it.

332
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,040
The first two rows
have to wear ponchos.

333
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:53,928
Listen, you have to do this.

334
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,877
You should be true
to yourself.

335
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:59,137
If you're not, it would be
like telling the guy you love

336
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,606
that you're ashamed
of who you are together.

337
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,970
Are you ready, Athena?
Oh, hey, Ted.

338
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,913
Listen, if you don't mind,
Athena and I have a preshow ritual.

339
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:10,750
It's kind of a prayer/sex thing.

340
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,323
So if you could leave
or find something to read?

341
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,495
So what's it gonna be?

342
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,544
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

343
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,132
And then we're gonna do
some magic.

344
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,564
<i>The act was a side of veronica
we had never seen.</i>

345
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,311
<i>And you totally could not tell
where she kept the dove.</i>

346
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,681
One.

347
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:45,942
Two.

348
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,129
Three.

349
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,226
<i>And after that night, no one
ever laughed at Veronica again.</i>

350
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,899
Veronica,
how can you leave all this?

351
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,549
I'm not going anywhere.

352
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,362
<i>After that, veronica wasn't
just her old self,</i>

353
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,268
<i>she was something better.</i>

354
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,521
<i>She was whole.</i>

355
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,480
Hey, V., sorry your mail's wet.

356
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,982
I had to fish it out of
the toilet, yo crazy story.

357
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,328
Here you go.

358
00:19:58,132 --> 00:19:59,948
If it happens again,
you're fired.

359
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>And having accepted
who he was,</i>

360
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,144
<i>Phil said good-bye
to the rodeo not taken.</i>

361
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,342
<i>And Linda also realized
something about herself.</i>

362
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,317
Don, we went
over this last night.

363
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,499
I haven't been honest
with myself.

364
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:19,384
This just isn't
the right relationship for me.

365
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:21,795
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,683
Flowers?
What are these for?

367
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,487
Ever since my wife left,
I have been sitting on the sidelines

368
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,946
afraid to get back in the game,
and that's not me.

369
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,580
You made me realize
I want to be with somebody.

370
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:41,015
- You do?
- Yeah.

371
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,075
It felt really great
to be with Rebeca,

372
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,037
and I want to see her again.
She's smart and funny and cute.

373
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,232
I told you guys
you'd be great together.

374
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,261
 Anyway, thanks you're the best. 

375
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:01,926
 Your mail's wet.
Crazy story! 

376
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,670
 Yo where is my conner?
