1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,165
How'd your date go last night?

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,858
It depends,
if a guy bites his cuticles

3
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:14,263
and then swallows them,
does that make him a cannibal?

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,318
Then, I had a date with a cannibal

5
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:19,040
and not with a guy
who has a disgusting habit.

6
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:21,395
Zing-bang! I'm getting an award.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,314
Bang-zoom! I'm getting a muffin.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,422
{\pos(190,230)}The Veridian charitable foundation

9
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,493
{\pos(190,230)}honors someone
who's been outstanding,

10
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,862
- this year, they've chosen me.
- For what?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,615
- For being outstanding.
- For being outstanding at what?

12
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:34,906
{\pos(230,270)}I'm getting an award.

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,982
{\pos(230,270)}As an honoree, you'll have to raise

14
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:40,403
- a bunch of money for the foundation?
- That's the part I'm dreading.

15
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:42,143
{\pos(190,280)}Linda, you do it for me.

16
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,718
{\pos(190,280)}That wasn't so bad.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,514
{\pos(190,275)}I have no choice in,

18
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,255
{\a6}do you know which charity
Veridian's giving the money to?

19
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:50,675
I'm getting an award.

20
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,138
Billy?
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:59,765
{\a6}I'm in town,
I thought we could grab a bite.

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,185
Are those fresh nuts?

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,732
Don't be alarmed.
I'm Ted's big brother.

24
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,818
You okay?

25
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,017
You gonna barf?
It's okay if you do.

26
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,322
- No one will judge.
- Help me up.

27
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:14,312
Right.

28
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:17,702
So you can viciously do to me
what I so lovingly did to you?

29
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,538
I'm not gonna do anything.
This is where I work.

30
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,678
Sack attack!

31
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:29,010
- Excellent.
- I totally got you. I totally got him.

32
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:32,209
Yes it was masterful,
like watching a chess game.

33
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,519
Hey, Ted, I can't find Rose,
I've looked for her everywhere.

34
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,564
- I'm upside down!
- I know one thing for sure...

35
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,804
wherever she is,
she's right side up.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,406
No, I'm not.

37
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:52,557
Until we find her,
we'll have to just use

38
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,941
this spare Rose that we got
growing out of your back.

39
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,357
- Come here.
- What?

40
00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:00,325
That was fun. I'm gonna go
see if it made me any taller.

41
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:06,083
It's great having you around.
Rose doesn't have a lot of family here.

42
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:09,253
Relax. I'm not setting you up.
So how long can you stay?

43
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,009
I heard there might be a job

44
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,189
out in Fresno,
selling baby-proofing kits.

45
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,885
They have problems with babies
breaking into homes.

46
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,390
And selling boxes?

47
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,966
Could you stop holding mom
in front of your crotch?

48
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,913
I had a falling-out with my boss
'cause I kept sleeping with his wife.

49
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,162
It's a real shame,
'cause I sold boxes

50
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,398
better than I sold
attack dogs or fatty scooters.

51
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,598
You're a great salesman.
I was hoping that job would stick.

52
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,872
- What if I got you something?
- Seriously?

53
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:36,906
I'd love that. Plus, I'd get
to hang here for a while.

54
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, Rose and I
would like that, too.

55
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:41,721
I love you, but not
like in a brotherly way.

56
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:44,374
It's all about the sex for me.
Don't pretend you don't want it.

57
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,667
You've been thinking about it all night.
So I'm coming in for a kiss.

58
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,120
- Don't try and fight it.
- You've picked up my signals.

59
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,533
Why don't we just skip
right to second base?

60
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,179
Where's your mommy now?

61
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:57,522
Too easy!

62
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,958
<i>The next morning, I asked Veronica</i>

63
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,358
<i>if it was possible
to get Billy a job at Veridian.</i>

64
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,998
I'm getting an award.

65
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,548
<i>When I got Veronica's attention,
she told me Veridian wasn't hiring,</i>

66
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:12,392
<i>so I talked to the owner of the company
that sells us our lab supplies.</i>

67
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,755
I don't know, Ted.

68
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:16,321
I got an idiot brother
of my own I'm not giving a job to.

69
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,597
He's not an idiot.
He's a good salesman.

70
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:21,291
Actually,
I'm a really good salesman.

71
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,163
I figured out a way
to sell Veridian 3,000 bakers.

72
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,216
So I got Billy can job
selling lab supplies.

73
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,853
You know that:
"You can never have too many beakers"?

74
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,210
It's not a saying,
and now I know why.

75
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,260
Lonnie. Great job on that
presentation. Have a beaker.

76
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,552
No, thank you.

77
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,217
I didn't know he had a brother.

78
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,185
I did. I did all that research
when I dressed up as Ted for Halloween.

79
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,688
Did you know his great-grandfather
was a cattle wrestler?

80
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,731
- Rustler
- Wrestler.

81
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,045
He used to go from town to town
fighting livestock for beer money.

82
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,825
I had an aunt who fought a cow
for beer money once.

83
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,537
- The cow never forgave her.
- They're very unforgiving.

84
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,452
- What are they doing?
- It's how they process information.

85
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:08,661
Billy is the new rep for the company
that supplies our lab equipment.

86
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:11,792
Anything you need, you go through him.
And this is the latest catalog.

87
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,572
You dropped something, Theodore.

88
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,510
Pick it up, Theo-dorable.

89
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:19,075
I'm not picking it up,
Billy-has-a-little-Willy.

90
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,725
- What are they doing?
- That's how they process emotion.

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,015
{\Run.dummy}It's getting away.

92
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:29,059
I'll see you at home later.
Don't be late.

93
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,604
All right.

94
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,149
Don't hurt us.
We're not like you.

95
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,964
No, I'm not gonna hurt ya.

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,810
So, what kind of stuff
you guys need?

97
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,480
Nothing currently. We're pretty
careful with our resources.

98
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,076
Although we once meant
to buy 6 4-inch Petri dishes

99
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,824
and instead bought 4
6-inch Petri dishes.

100
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,493
It was crazy slightly bigger.

101
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,322
You guys need to loosen up a little,

102
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,483
so I am gonna take you
to a very exclusive club.

103
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,593
We're gonna have a drink,
talk about lab supplies.

104
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,376
We can't leave work
in the middle of the day.

105
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,097
We're not Somali pirates.

106
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,600
If you get little crazy
once in a while,

107
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,227
you stop being scared
of living your life...

108
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:14,355
That's when things get interesting.

109
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,359
I have always harbored ambitions
of being slightly more pirate-like.

110
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,779
We looked cool
with eye patches when we had pink eye.

111
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,989
Okay, Ted's brother, we're in.

112
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,594
I did a research on the charity

113
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,198
- the foundation gives the money to.
- Why?

114
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,753
- Wanted to know where money was going.
- Why?

115
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,039
I wanted to make sure
it was a good cause.

116
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,349
I don't have
a debilitating personality disorder

117
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,348
that keeps me
from caring about anything.

118
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:47,846
- It's not debilitating but liberating.
- The money is going to a charity

119
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,275
that provides female mentors
for underprivileged girls,

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,283
preparing them
for leadership positions.

121
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,688
- Your consciousness has been raised.
- That sounds wonderful.

122
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,357
- I hate it when you mock me.
- I'm serious.

123
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,526
And when you mock me
for pointing out that you're.

124
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,527
I'm not.

125
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,654
And when you mockingly
insist you're not.

126
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,776
Seriously, this is actually a cause
I can relate to.

127
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,575
A female mentor would
have been very valuable

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,287
for a young Veronica,
who was bursting with potential,

129
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,612
yet vulnerable,
like a fawn in the woods,

130
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:17,459
but tough, like a fawn in the woods
with a machine gun.

131
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,059
So you're saying you,
or this terrifying, murderous fawn,

132
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:24,151
- could have used some guidance?
- Yes, we would have liked that.

133
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,747
You and I are gonna raise
more money for this charity

134
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:29,362
than it's ever raised before.

135
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:32,079
The forest will run red
with the blood of creatures

136
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,749
who doubted little Veronica

137
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:36,562
and will now pay
with their furry little lives.

138
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,321
There's no middle ground with you.

139
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:41,400
Either you don't care at all
or you care 100-and-crazy%.

140
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:42,858
What else is there?

141
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,447
Now saddle up, Linda,
and say good-bye to common sense.

142
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,528
<i>Final call.
Flight 25 now departing...</i>

143
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,779
I've heard about clubs
like these at airports,

144
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:58,369
but I thought you had
to be an admiral to get in.

145
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,543
Look around, boys.

146
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,629
Full bar, cheeses, nuts
and it's all free.

147
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,888
Welcome to Shangri-La.

148
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,801
This place is amazing.
I never want to leave.

149
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,386
- We should go.
- We've to go.

150
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:13,161
Oh, my God. There's a pilot.
That guy's a hero.

151
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,501
We'll go over,
give him one salute, then leave.

152
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,811
- If we're gone from work too long.
- So what if you do?

153
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,864
So someone gets mad at you.
Who cares?

154
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,189
You know what I do
when someone gets in my face?

155
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,110
I tell 'em to deal with it.

156
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,405
Deal with it.

157
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,448
That'd be a cool thing
to say sometime.

158
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,992
Why not today? Why not right now?

159
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,329
- Hey, you, deal with it.
- Yeah, deal with it.

160
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,177
I'm getting me
a damn cube of cheese!

161
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,173
Can we take our pants off in here?
Easy.

162
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,458
I have to justify to accounting
buying so many beakers.

163
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,020
But I'm helping my brother
get his life back on track,

164
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,962
people will know how many milliliters
of pencils they have.

165
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,430
Oh, excuse me.

166
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,061
And...

167
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,584
they make great coffee mugs.

168
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:00,436
Surprise.

169
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,466
I got you guys 600 beakers.

170
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,482
You could use them for beakers.

171
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:07,362
What's that?

172
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,887
- Just a bag full of something.
- Full of what?

173
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,488
A 62-year-old white male.

174
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,951
We bought a cadaver
from your brother, Ted.

175
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:16,019
- Deal with it.
- Deal with it.

176
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,414
Why would you buy a cadaver?

177
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,943
We were being all boring
and ordering stuff,

178
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,568
We decided to do something
totally loco,

179
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,171
- so we bought it.
- No, not "it." "It" implies one.

180
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:30,130
- Oh, man. What did you guys do?
- One of these will arrive every month.

181
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,359
That's right, once a month
they send us a new cadaver,

182
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,809
What are you geniuses gonna do
when dead bodies start stacking up?

183
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,421
We're gonna deal with it.

184
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,715
- Just like you'll deal with it.
- Everyone's dealing with things now.

185
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:46,006
I gotta go yell at Billy.
And I know you guys.

186
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,378
Don't name that corpse,
because it's going back.

187
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:54,389
So who are we hitting up next?

188
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,324
We're at Fleming in marketing.

189
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,501
We'll get 500 bucks from this mutt.

190
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,773
- Can I be the bad cop this time?
- I've seen you smile when you cry

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,511
and skip when you're upset.

192
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,252
I don't think that's a good fit.

193
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,963
Hey, can I get you anything?
Are you comfortable?

194
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,484
Of course he is,
comfortable being a sack of crap

195
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,337
- who doesn't give a damn.
- We are raising money for a good cause.

196
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:16,555
We left you a brochure,
but you never got back to us.

197
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,557
- Shut up, Brett.
- I didn't say anything.

198
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:22,118
Oh, that's rich.
We're gonna need $10,000 from you.

199
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,505
$10,000? That's... that's crazy.

200
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,423
Crazy?
What's crazy is Gina Morales not having

201
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,973
an experienced businesswoman
to help her write a letter

202
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,653
to get into college.

203
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,267
Veronica, easy.

204
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,233
Gina's problems
aren't entirely his fault.

205
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,183
Fine.
I'll go get 200 milliliters of coffee.

206
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,297
I'm sorry. It's just...
she loves those damn kids.

207
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,044
Look, you're a nice guy.

208
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,797
Let me try to talk Veronica
into taking just 500 bucks.

209
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,925
- Oh, man. Would you do that?
- Yeah.

210
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:55,402
But if you tell anybody
I did you a solid,

211
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:58,229
I will tear off your head
and tinkle in your skull!

212
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,563
I'm just kidding.

1
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:02,267
I'm just kidding.
But, yeah, I'm dangerous.

2
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,713
Billy, you here?

3
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:09,345
Yes, and we have company.

4
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,124
I invited the lobsters for dinner.

5
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:13,987
But don't say anything.
I plan on killing and eating them.

6
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,322
We are celebrating.

7
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:17,866
I racked up some great commissions
at work today.

8
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,860
About that, Lem and Phil...

9
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,412
they don't need a year's supply
of cadavers or even one.

10
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:25,499
I don't know if it's returnable.

11
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,499
It's not like
we used it or anything.

12
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,543
It still has
that new-dead-guy smell.

13
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,713
It's just that my boss
was so impressed.

14
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,217
But if it's a problem for you, I'll tell
him that he's gotta deal with it.

15
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,700
Yeah. Bosses love hearing that.

16
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,389
Daddy! Uncle Billy bought me
a bunch of presents.

17
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,350
And best of all, he said
he might live here for a while.

18
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:47,467
Now hold on.
That's only if the job works out.

19
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,188
Forget about returning that thing
we were talking about.

20
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,571
- I'll figure something out.
- Yeah, Are you sure?

21
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,716
I don't want to reject your body.

22
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:00,033
You got enough of that
from every girl in high school.

23
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,873
And, dad, watch this.

24
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:03,954
Hey, uncle silly.

25
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,205
Come here, you!

26
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,546
I convinced Lonnie, the guy
who works in the computer room,

27
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,382
to keep the cadaver for a while.

28
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:18,760
It might be a little creepy at first,
but the cadaver will get used to him.

29
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:25,350
So you must be from that charity
that the foundation's working with.

30
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,684
Yes. We're going to visit the honoree,
Veronica Palmer.

31
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,215
Some of them are a nervous.

32
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,691
They've never been
in a corporate environment before.

33
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,056
Don't be afraid.
Just don't go to the fourth floor.

34
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:37,339
That's where we keep
the monster factory.

35
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:41,742
I'm just kidding. But, seriously,
stay clear of the fourth floor.

36
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,870
I was coming to see you.

37
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,049
There's a new rule in the computer room.
They just came up with it today...

38
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,167
"No dead bodies
in the computer room."

39
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:59,527
Can you believe it? You bought
those pants you've always wanted.

40
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,837
My wife doesn't know I'm not at work.
Is there any rule we haven't broken?

41
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,515
These pants make my legs
feel so cool.

42
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,605
I can't believe my lower half's letting
my upper half hang out with it.

43
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,105
The people over there are pissed
cos you drank all the pineapple juice.

44
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,607
Deal with it!

45
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,320
Let's order some expensive equipment
we've never had the nerve to buy before.

46
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,281
Maybe we should just stick
with the stuff you guys need this time.

47
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,905
If we stuck with the stuff we needed,
I never would have bought these pants.

48
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,331
And I wouldn't have squeezed
ten cubes of cheese into a ball

49
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,930
and eaten it like an apple,

50
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,626
which I should not have done,
but I am dealing with it.

51
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,377
I just had a disturbing conversation
with Mrs. Boudreaux from the charity.

52
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:42,132
- Ted threw a dead body at her.
- Oh, my God!

53
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,222
That's not the disturbing part.
In fact, I find that deeply funny.

54
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,397
What's disturbing is,
the Veridian foundation

55
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:51,103
keeps 95% of the money we raise
and only gives 5% to the girls charity.

56
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,207
Really? That's horrible.

57
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,782
We need to talk to Mr. Page,
the head of the foundation.

58
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:58,293
It's time for this fawn
to strap on a machine gun,

59
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,945
spread its wings and fly.

60
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,781
Okay, what exactly
do you think a fawn is?

61
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,898
The purpose
of the Veridian foundation,

62
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:10,038
is to let the world know
of the good works Veridian does.

63
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,009
So you spent 95 cents
of every dollar

64
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,167
telling the world
about the other 5 cents?

65
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:17,587
If some trees are clear-cut and nobody
hears about it, did it really happen?

66
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:20,340
Of course it did,
and people always find out about it,

67
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,173
so what we need to do is publicize
the occasional good thing we do

68
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,345
so people are aware
of how wonderful we appear to be.

69
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,460
This isn't about some stupid trees.

70
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:29,948
These girls are living,
growing things,

71
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,388
and you're trying to hold them back.

72
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,645
Gina Morales!

73
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:35,188
Hey, Mr. Page.

74
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,773
- Can I get you anything?
- We're not doing that.

75
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,133
You're gonna give everything
we collected to that charity.

76
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,926
People suffered for that money.

77
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:43,382
We were awful.

78
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,075
You know what's funny? We raise money
to help girls enter the business world,

79
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,537
and when they finally do,
they still act like little girls.

80
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,831
I'll need the donations
you've collected by tomorrow.

81
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,632
Now if you'll excuse me, girls...

82
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,794
We're not done here.

83
00:13:58,391 --> 00:13:59,854
This woman opened her heart,

84
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,505
and that happens so rarely,
you could hear the hinges squeak.

85
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,139
I will not let you slam
that Rusty heart door shut.

86
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,678
{\Go, Linda. }Release your anger.

87
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,098
You will not crush
this woman's spirit and love,

88
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,579
you spineless,
condescending bureaucrat.

89
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,852
Good, Linda.
Only your hatred can destroy him.

90
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,417
You, sir, are a bad egg.

91
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,898
Yes! Now strike!

92
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:28,004
- Where did that come from?
- I am a good mentor.

93
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,713
I need you guys
to lower the temperature in here.

94
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,807
Watch him until I figure out
what to do with him.

95
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,001
And put more money
in our lab supplies account.

96
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,597
- What did you do?
- We bought a family of robots.

97
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,088
And a large wind tunnel.

98
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,478
We want to see how long it takes
to drive robots crazy with wind.

99
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:46,927
Deal with it!

100
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:50,680
What if I tell Veronica that you've
burned through the company's money,

101
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,149
she notifies H.R., they investigate,
and you guys lose your job?

102
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,161
Does that count
as "dealing with it"?

103
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,334
My legs are completely numb.

104
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,777
Only the tightness of my pants
is holding me up.

105
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,863
I think I feel that cheese apple
making its way North.

106
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,642
Billy, call me.
It's about Lem and Phil.

107
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,285
Don't say "doody" so many times
in your outgoing message. Mom may call.

108
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,545
We need your help.

109
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,667
- We don't.
- I'm in the middle of something.

110
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,013
My brother has pushed
Phil and Lem off the rails.

111
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:24,339
I went crazy in a meeting and headbutted
the president of the foundation.

112
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,693
That wasn't crazy.
It was deeply funny.

113
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:29,598
It was kind of cool.
His head made a "boop" sound.

114
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,776
Then we were so pumped up
and a little dizzy...

115
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,324
that instead of giving
the foundation guy the money,

116
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,583
we gave it to the girls charity.

117
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,479
It was incredibly satisfying.

118
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,930
Until we found out
that collecting donations from people

119
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:44,693
and then giving them
to whoever you want is a class 2 felony.

120
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,737
Just go back to the foundation guy,

121
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,030
tell him you got
a little carried away and...

122
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,824
Oh, wait. You booped him.

123
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,078
- Have you guys been drinking?
- Little bit.

124
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,540
Please, Ted. I can't go to jail.

125
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,293
You have to talk to that weasel
and ask him to let us off the hook.

126
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,544
Screw that.

127
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,381
Tell him we'll see him in court and then
headbutt him hard. Crack that egg.

128
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,427
I will go try
and straighten this out.

129
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,450
Meanwhile, think about
what you'd rather have for Xmas...

130
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:14,347
a wind tunnel,
a family of robots or a corpse.

131
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,247
Screw them.

132
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,855
They took my foundation money
and they gave it to a charity.

133
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,983
Plus, they headbutted me. And then
they poured themselves a drink.

134
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,875
Then the one
with the bun on her head...

135
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,654
She stood over me while she posed
for a picture doing this.

136
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:33,074
What was that? Get the money back
or they're going to jail.

137
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,260
You a lot of nerve coming in here.

138
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:37,421
Some nerve !

139
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,739
He did not like being headbutted
and then posed over.

140
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,669
I got your message.
Are you pissed at me?

141
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,292
Yes, I am pissed at you.

142
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:50,008
I told not to sell things
to Phil and Lem, but you did it anyway.

143
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,452
No. I held back. The robot family
normally comes with grandparents,

144
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,513
but they're sitting heartbroken.

145
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,151
So I should thank you for creating
a huge mess instead of a gigantic one?

146
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,353
Just say it, Ted.
What's your problem?

147
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,866
I have been cleaning up
after you since we were kids.

148
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:06,399
You bring a stray possum,
I'm the one that has to walk it,

149
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,734
which, is impossible

150
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,444
because they play dead,
and you end up having to drag it.

151
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,317
I was gonna train it
to drive a golf cart!

152
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,316
But you didn't. So I'm the one
that ended up with a weird pet

153
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:17,964
that I have to take to college.

154
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,705
I am still cleaning up after you.
You can't keep a job.

155
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,389
- 3,000 beakers later, I got you one.
- Which I'm trying to be good at.

156
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:26,771
- Don't you want that?
- I can't even talk to you right now.

157
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,852
Veronica and Linda are in real trouble
with this jerk from the foundation,

158
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,932
so now I gotta go
clean up that mess.

159
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,073
Do you know how many times
I didn't get laid in college

160
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,827
because girls don't like getting
hissed at by a jealous possum?

161
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,190
I know it's not customary for charities
to give money back to their donors,

162
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,599
but if you like helping girls,
I know two who would really be helped

163
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:54,030
if you returned all the money
they gave to you.

164
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,282
Do you know how crazy
you sound right now, young man?

165
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:59,000
Crazy or really on to something?

166
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:08,003
I just got told to go screw myself
by a 60-year-o woman.

167
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,304
{\Brought me back to when}Thought I was 10 like when I asked
grandma why her house smelled funny.

168
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,729
- What are you doing here?
- Teddy, you are gonna kiss us.

169
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:17,053
We got Veronica and Linda
off the hook.

170
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,557
You said you were having a problem
with that page guy from the foundation,

171
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,017
so me and these two roughnecks
thought we'd help you out.

172
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,520
We documented the whole thing.

173
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,780
- First we got the corpse...
- Who we named "Roger." You said not to,

174
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,888
but we haven't been
listening to you lately.

175
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:33,502
Then we put the corpse
in the trunk of page's car.

176
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,502
Roger did not want
to get in at first.

177
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:38,912
He went all floppy, like,

178
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:41,411
- "don't put me in there."
- Classic Roger.

179
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,665
Then we put a nail in page's tire
and followed him after work.

180
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,251
Eventually, his tire went flat,
and he pulled over to change it.

181
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,068
- Page went looking for his spare.
- That's when Roger leapt into action.

182
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:54,132
Page opened the trunk,
and hello, dead guy.

183
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,551
Then like a textbook douche,
he did what douches do...

184
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,986
rather then complicate his life
for a single minute,

185
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:00,635
he dumped the body.

186
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,460
Then we showed him the pictures.

187
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,217
He agreed it'd be better
if they weren't posted on the Internet.

188
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:08,730
And so he decided to look the other way
with Veronica and Linda.

189
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,838
- Unbelievable.
- This was our last hurrah.

190
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,931
Lem and I are done being crazy.

191
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,404
When it starts out great...
all pilots and square cheese...

192
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,733
but ends up with you
having to cut your friend

193
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,623
out of skintight leather pants.

194
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:23,917
I will not miss those.

195
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:25,747
So?

196
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,749
What you did was reckless and wrong.

197
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,171
But... it worked.
So... thanks.

198
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,842
Actually it felt good to be the guy
cleaning up the mess for a change.

199
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:40,762
So are we okay?

200
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,556
Yeah, we're okay.

201
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,900
<i>The Veridian foundation...</i>

202
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,546
<i>helping the world</i>

203
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,570
<i>then telling people about it</i>

204
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,656
<i>makes us feel so good.</i>

205
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,507
<i>The Veridian foundation...</i>

206
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,828
<i>Helping the world</i>

207
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,495
<i>by telling people
we're helping the world.</i>

208
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:13,135
I miss mugs.

209
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,310
So Billy gave up lab equipment.

210
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:19,120
He's moving with the woman who cuts
the cheese at the airport lounge.

211
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,951
We'll all be having fun with that.

212
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:24,851
{\pos(192,220)}And Veronica got the Pentagon to finance
a study on how robots tolerate wind.

213
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,782
{\pos(192,220)}$3 million later, it turns out,
they don't notice it.

214
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,812
{\pos(192,220)}I appreciate you sticking up for me
with Mr. Page.

215
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,617
{\pos(192,220)}You're tougher than thought.

216
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,653
{\pos(192,220)}You're like a fire-breathing,
razor-back fawn.

217
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,008
{\pos(192,220)}Oh, my God. This is a fawn.

218
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,836
{\pos(192,220)}Then what was I thinking of?

219
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:49,122
{\pos(192,220)}A monster. That was it.
I always confuse those two.
