1
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:10,307
And finally, through a small incision in the skull

2
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:13,284
the nano device is placed directly into the brain.

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:17,711
Where, once it's activated it causes everything
the subject eats to taste sweet.

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,123
The applications for weight loss are enormous.

5
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:23,163
And while elective brain surgery doesn't taste that great

6
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:26,105
it still taste better than dieting and exercise.

7
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,489
Excellent work, everybody.

8
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:31,324
Thanks for staying late.

9
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:32,884
Oh, shoot.

10
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:34,968
What's the matter?

11
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,478
My driver died a few days ago,
and I haven't got a replacement yet.

12
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,324
Oh, I'm sorry... I could give you a ride home.

13
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:45,798
I suppose that's ok. But I can't start you
with what my old driver was getting.

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,632
You don't have to pay me, I... I just
thought it would be a nice thing to do.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,708
Allright. Yes. Thank you, right?

16
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:56,287
Thank you? Yes.

17
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,297
I'll go get my things. Oh, we can
stop and do an errand on the way?

18
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,334
Sure.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,592
Oh, still free.

20
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,927
Then we pull the car around.

21
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:09,626
We've never really getting along.

22
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,238
I think maybe some one-on-one time might thaw the chill.

23
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,619
I always thought Veronica lived here.

24
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:18,954
Me too. You know, she just finds a comfortable
chair and powers down for the night. 

25
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:24,100
Come on, we are gonna be late.

26
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,919
You are the one who didn't want
to share the bathroom mirror.

27
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,288
Hey, guys. I thought we'd go to McTaggert's for a beer.

28
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,849
Now, tonight, without warning?
Don't you have to get home to your daughter?

29
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,855
Nope. Her mom's visiting after a year in Botswana,

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,440
which by the way is a year Botswana's never gonna get back.

31
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,861
Anyway, they're hanging in New York for a week,

32
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,941
until Stacy finds another country to go fix,

33
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:48,738
so she doesn't have to work on herself.

34
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:50,514
So... I am free.

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,648
I wish my wife will go to Botswana.

36
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,373
The thing is, we kind of have plans.

37
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,673
Although, if you wanted to...

38
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:03,113
Oh, I see. You're going some place you don't want me to come.

39
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:04,259
That's cool.

40
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,129
You'd think it was lame.
I promise I wouldn't.

41
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:10,275
Well, then maybe...
Phil, can I talk to you for a minute?

42
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,644
It's not about you.

43
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,865
An occasional drink is fine, but being
friends with your boss is a slippery slope.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,090
Guys, we can get past the boss thing. I consider you friends.

45
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,969
Phil, can I talk to you a little further away for a minute?

46
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,024
Still not about you.

47
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,125
You think you're their friend,
but when push comes to shove

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,849
they're always your boss and they know it.

49
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:39,284
Yes, but Ted is not like that. He's
a good guy... Don't touch that!

50
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:43,151
Besides there will be a lot of street crowd.

51
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:44,836
It's "street cred".

52
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:47,334
You know, credibility.

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,790
Oh! Now that finally makes sense.

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,112
Thanks for swinging by my grandmother's place,

55
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:58,104
and for helping me carrying all her possessions.

56
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,682
You're really handling all this pretty well.

57
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:04,987
I can't believe your grandmother and
your driver both died on the same week.

58
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,254
What?

59
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,592
Oh, that's funny.

60
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,317
No, they were the same person.

61
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:11,873
You hired your own grandmother to drive you around?

62
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,123
She needed money, but she didn't want to hand out.

63
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,123
She was a very proud woman,

64
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:17,848
and a very proud driver.

65
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:21,750
You wanna maybe talk about her?
You know how you feeling about losing her.

66
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,311
Oh, that's sweet, but ...

67
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,155
No.
Are you sure?

68
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:31,884
I worry it could change our relationship and
make it difficult to continue working together.

69
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,881
But I suppose that's a risk I'm willing to take.

70
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:36,922
Or...

71
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:40,276
I could just go.
Don't be silly. Let's talk.

72
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:41,793
Would you like some  wine?

73
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:43,932
I would like a whole bunch of wine yes. 

74
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:48,061
Ok, but we'll have to pour it ourselves,
my housekeeper died this week.

75
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,609
I have never been in the subbasement before.

76
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:55,437
They don't want the executives
down there because of all the ***.

77
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:59,800
When you work for a company this
intense, you have to find ways to relax.

78
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:02,777
We tried the Veridian chess club, and the courting club,

79
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,673
but those were just some meat markets.

80
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,067
Besides, nothing release tension, like this.

81
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:15,449
Welcome to Medieval Fight Club.

82
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,401
Bosses.

83
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,329
Everybody has one.

84
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:32,158
Without bosses, we'd be like these worms...

85
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,374
Disgusting.

86
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,065
Bosses make everything better. 

87
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,992
So listen to your boss...

88
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:41,198
and don't question them.

89
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,833
Otherwise, you're no better than a worm.

90
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:58,257
You have to fight your way up the ladder.

91
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,306
Newbies start as peasants as farmers.

92
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,425
Here are your soil rags.

93
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,505
Sorry, we have to stay in character.

94
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,265
The King is watching.

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,202
Isn't it Gill, the I.T guy?
In the surface world.

96
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:13,877
Here he is our king.

97
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:16,903
Listen fellows, this all seem really ...

98
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,221
Cool?

99
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:20,428
Sure. Let's go with cool.

100
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,325
But I think I'm gonna take off.

101
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,363
Ted, wait!

102
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,081
You are the first executive that's ever been down here,

103
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,871
you leaving like this makes us look like fools.

104
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,112
And we haven't been fools for months.

105
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,377
Let him go.

106
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:36,782
It's not your fault.

107
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,541
Bosses and employees shouldn't hang out.

108
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,999
It's like a ventriloquist trying
to be friends  with his dummy.

109
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:43,578
At the end of the day you know
who is sleeping in a suitcase.

110
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,810
The dummy.

111
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:50,207
Allright, I was the one who pushed
first to hang out, so I should endure this.

112
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,765
I mean suffer through. I mean support you.

113
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,616
Because that's what friends do.

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,681
And she married my grandfather at 18.

115
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:03,313
Now my grandfather had an amazing life.

116
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,784
He came to this country with nothing and made a huge fortune.

117
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,192
And then one day...

118
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,492
tragically ...

119
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,812
he got deported.

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,519
Oh, that's so sad.

121
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,201
I have a question.

122
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,335
We have been drinking all night.

123
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,209
How can you be sotally tober when I'm completely ***?

124
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,489
Oh, I have always been like this.

125
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:30,424
My body just doesn't process alcohol like that.

126
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,247
You want one of these?

127
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,589
You want one of these?

128
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,861
That's what I thought.

129
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,073
Linda.

130
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:05,833
My grandfather ...

131
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,862
I never liked him.

132
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:12,238
He smelled of onions and once cheated on
my grandmother with Eleanor Roosevelt, who...

133
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,774
hated men, but loved onions.

134
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,319
Why are you telling me all of this?

135
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,416
Because I never told anybody.

136
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,715
I'm the one who turned him in.

137
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,114
I had him deported.

138
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,774
I declare Ted... the Victor,

139
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,837
and Victor the loser.

140
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,464
God that was fantastic.

141
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,569
Are you allow to fitght more than once in one night?

142
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:02,904
You have done well by bringing a
warrior of such pluck into the fold.

143
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,541
I told you this would work out.

144
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,989
We haven't been this celebrated
since we fixed the king's mopeen.

145
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,715
My ex wife is spoiling hell of our daugther.

146
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,268
I could spoil her too but one
of us has to be a good parent.

147
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,727
Really, sweety?

148
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:24,310
Ice cream for breakfast.

149
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,691
No, you're right. I don't let you do that.

150
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,139
You know what I do let you do?

151
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,634
Get vaccinated.

152
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,730
Ok, I love you too Rose.

153
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,896
That bitch is driving me crazy.

154
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,397
Oh. Easy
Hey, hey, she's 7s.

155
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,282
Not Rose, my ex-wife.

156
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,676
Oh, Stacy. Yes she was ...

157
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,814
crazy.

158
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,703
Crazy-A.
Totally.

159
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,457
You were an animal last night.

160
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:53,064
Noone has ever won four battles in a row.

161
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,658
I gotta admit this fight stuff is a blast.

162
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:56,911
And It wasn't just the winning.

163
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,665
It was the constant winning.

164
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,331
I can't wait to get back in tongith.

165
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,859
There's no meeting tonight.

166
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,584
We only get the basement once a week.

167
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,233
I took care of that.

168
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,790
I had the AA meeting moved to the utility closet

169
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,215
so we can have the basement.

170
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,302
Medieval Fight Club two nights in a row.

171
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:13,522
Man, my cock piece just got tighter. 

172
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,930
See, it's good to be friends with the boss, huh Phil?

173
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:19,723
Well, I hate to break it to you, but we can't make it tonight.

174
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,891
My mom's birthday.

175
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:24,734
Oh, that's okay. See you next time.

176
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,068
I can't miss MFC, it's a rumor start.

177
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,503
Would it be weird for me to bring my mother?

178
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,036
Yes.

179
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:37,621
Morning Linda.

180
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:42,626
I couldn't sleep all night. I really
messed things up with Veronica.

181
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:46,627
Last night she opened up and told me something very personnal.

182
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,129
Now I know too much.

183
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:51,004
What if she has me fired or deported, I mean who knows what?

184
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,341
Hello, Linda.

185
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,617
I need to see you in my office.

186
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:58,474
Ok, you hear that everyone. Veronica,
needs to see all of us in her office.

187
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,016
No. Just you.

188
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,428
I don't why I drink.

189
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:07,513
I always end to get laid or fired.

190
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,020
I have to start drinking.

191
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:12,528
I like those odds.

192
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,656
Linda, there is no  easy way to say this.

193
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,204
You're firing me.

194
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:20,421
No, that would be easy. You're fired.

195
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,955
What I want to say is...

196
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,716
I've been keeping that secret about my grandfather for years,

197
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,594
and it felt wonderful to finally get it off my chest.

198
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,856
Oh really?

199
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,505
I'm glad to hear that.

200
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,050
So thank you for listening to me.

201
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:37,657
We're letting you go.

202
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:38,763
What?

203
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,982
That would be another way to say it.

204
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,317
Anyway, I slept like a baby all night.

205
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,137
Actually,

206
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:49,403
I thought you might be afraid that I tell people your secret.

207
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,938
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

208
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,663
I hadn't thought of that at all.

209
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:55,333
But do what you're going to do, Linda.

210
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,388
I'm not gonna do that.

211
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,493
We are friends. Friends don't do things like that.

212
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:02,855
Friends.

213
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,604
I like the way that sounds.

214
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,580
Ok, we are friends.

215
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,243
Good. Because you can never have too many.

216
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,595
I used to feed my sister in her sleep
so she wouldn't be skinnier than me.

217
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,010
Wow. You are my first friend that
has ever done something like that.

218
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,718
It feels so good to finally admit it to someone.

219
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,350
Hey, let's take the morning off so we can talk some more.

220
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:29,105
I take you to breakfast. Some place where
the meals don't end with the word slam.

221
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,345
I don't know.not know.

222
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,067
I've got a lot of work to do on Doppler project.

223
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:34,865
You're with the boss. Relax.

224
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,675
Besides I can give the Doopler project to Joe.

225
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,947
Really?

226
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:40,950
Because I do hate the Doppler project.

227
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,703
And I hate Joe. So everybody wins.

228
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,509
No one gets in! No one gets in!

229
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,178
Allright, I'm calling it.

230
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,490
Did I win?

231
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,860
Well, he didn't get in, but... no.

232
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,961
And this defeat bring you all the way down to court jester.

233
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,788
Ted, in order to advance to esquire there is but one knave

234
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,366
standing in your way.

235
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,364
I propose a mutual surrender.

236
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,991
Valiant try, you giant ball of wuss.

237
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:24,072
I declare Ted, the Victor.

238
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,583
Hey guys, no hard feeling huh?

239
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,543
No, we like that you're successfull at everything you do.

240
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:37,506
And you realise a forfait takes
you down to court jester as well.

241
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,830
Fine, whatever.

242
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,095
But it's going to be the same jokes you heard last night.

243
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,815
Your hair looks nice.
You like it?

244
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,650
Veronica took us out to get our hair done.

245
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,714
We've been spending tons, and tons,
and tons of time together this week.

246
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,636
Well, at least you two are bonding.

247
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:05,185
We're not bonfing, I'm being absorbed.

248
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,445
Well, whatever it is you doing, keep
it up, because you hair looks great.

249
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,298
You think I care what my hair looks like right now Ted?
Linda then loudly explained

250
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,660
that her hair wasn't important to her right now.

251
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:16,882
Because being friends with Veronica, came at a price.

252
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,512
Sure, there was shopping...

253
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,923
I once slpet with my boyfriend's therapist
to find out if he was cheating on me.

254
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,393
He wasn't.

255
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,521
And there were massages... 

256
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,973
And the I accused Omar Sharif of being a terrorist.

257
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:35,808
So he'd get kicked of my hand so I could get his first class seat.

258
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:40,902
And midnight girltalk. 

259
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,754
Hello?
Hi, it's me.

260
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,265
I'd asked you over, but

261
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,700
my sister's in town for my grandmother's funeral.

262
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,690
But the friendship came with a price.

263
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:56,982
Veronica keps dumping all this stuff on me.

264
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:59,999
I'm like her brain toilet. I don't
know how much more I can take.

265
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,835
Just because she is your boss doesn't
mean you have to put up with it.

266
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,658
Or jump every time she calls you.

267
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,051
Phil, Lem!

268
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,026
Is he coming?
Jus go! Go!

269
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,011
That's weird. I could have swore he saw me.

270
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,297
Hey friend. I was thinking we'd have lunch today.

271
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,768
One o'clock? Excellent.
I ... I don't think that's such a good idea.

272
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,447
Afterwork drinks?

273
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,504
Veronica, I am sorry. It... it's just that...

274
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,417
I see. You're dumping me.

275
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,516
No, no! It's just... I really enjoyed spending time with you

276
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,929
and I don't deserve this much pleasure.

277
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:37,118
I know, I'm messed up. I'm just a big old buck of crazy.

278
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:41,589
But I thought again, because of my own
inadequacies, we should take a little break.

279
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:45,902
Well, isn't that funny, because I've been wanting to take a break too. 

280
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,038
So, this works out perfectly.

281
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,122
Goodbye.

282
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,977
You want to take a break from Medieval Fight Club?

283
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:58,272
But don't you want to see my
new tunic? It has clovers on it.

284
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,245
You bought a tunic?

285
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,660
It's a big investment, considering that you're
gonna stop coming when Rose gets home.

286
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,958
That's right, you're gonna stop coming when Rose gets home.

287
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:08,400
No way. I am hooked.

288
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,397
I'll just get a sittera couple nights a week.

289
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,940
But is not gonna the same without my two court jesters.

290
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,546
The thing is...

291
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:19,007
we've been under a lot of pressure from
the model trainclub, to get back into that.

292
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,547
Also I have a chance of being the first black mayor of tiny town, so...

293
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:26,608
Well.

294
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,638
I guess I can't force you to keep coming to Fight Club.

295
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,646
Oh, by the way...

296
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:36,576
I'm gonna need to see the specs on the test altering brain implant

297
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,165
on my desk by 9 a.m.

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,171
No way!
We can't have it done that quickly.

299
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,201
Well, looks like you're gonna be up all night.

300
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:46,166
Although,

301
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:49,070
if you had a good enough reason to not be working,

302
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:51,919
I suppose I could wait a few days.

303
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:55,864
Maybe the Fight Club would be a good reason?

304
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,900
That's what I want to hear. Come on guys, it's gonna be fun.

305
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,935
Be there or be squire!

306
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,975
"Be there or be squire!"

307
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:08,453
I said that two years ago.

308
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:12,121
You were right, Lem. Its true bossy nature came through and attacked.

309
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:15,074
We have to figure out a way to get Ted to drop ou the Fight Club.

310
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,777
Yes, but how?

311
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:20,467
What if we pit him against the Groth?

312
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,706
The Groth?

313
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,676
Well...

314
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:28,153
I guess it was put on this earth for a reason.

315
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:36,217
I don't think so fellows.

316
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,385
I'm done with Medieval Fight Club.

317
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,328
I have a girlfriend now.
It's just this one time.

318
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,725
Please, the Groth!

319
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,379
For us?

320
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:51,289
Meanwhile, it turned out Veronica
didn't like taking a friendship break.

321
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:52,324
Hold it!

322
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:58,192
And since Veronica was the boss, she
had lots of ways to make that clear.

323
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,123
There you go Joe, enjoy your extra room.

324
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,894
Bring him to me.

325
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,390
You ok, Ted? You look a little nervous.
You can call it off now and never come back.

326
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,513
No, I just got off the phone with Rose.

327
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,881
She's gonna stay a few more days in New York with her mom,

328
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,739
who didn't clear with me first. So now, if I say no, 

329
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,301
I'm the bad guy.

330
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:38,289
But... stuff happens. No biggy.

331
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,811
Who dares challenge?

332
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:49,505
What the...

333
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,343
Linda,

334
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:01,611
I feel like you've been wanting to get
our relationship back the way it was.

335
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:02,795
What gave you that idea?

336
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,342
The fact that you turned my cubicle into a hobbit hole?

337
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,791
No, let's not get into who shrunked who's office

338
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:10,263
or who cancelled who's dental plan.

339
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,521
The point is...

340
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,780
we had something special and you'd like to get back to that.

341
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:16,177
And I accept.

342
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,583
Veronica, I'd like to be friends,

343
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:21,501
but real friends don't just talk about their problems all the time.

344
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:24,022
Real friends listen to each other.

345
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,696
Okay.

346
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,908
I'm listening now.

347
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,512
Ok, well let's see ...

348
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:33,860
here's something.

349
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,521
When I was growing up, I wanted to be a gymnast,

350
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,815
and every night after my parents went to sleep,

351
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,251
I used to sneak out of bed, and put on my leotard.

352
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,805
And one night, when I thought my parents were asleep...

353
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you.

354
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:48,760
You going on and on about yourself, it feels...

355
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,843
needy.

356
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:52,325
Needy?

357
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:56,647
I tell you one thing that happened to me, 

358
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,345
one thing that's important in my life ...

359
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,923
You're doing it again.

360
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,006
And I find it off-putting.

361
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:03,974
I'm sorry,

362
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,385
I can't be friends with you anymore.

363
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:08,748
You've changed.

364
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,297
Hey.
No, it's ok, I got it.

365
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:18,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

366
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,798
I am preoccupied.

367
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:26,039
I almost killed a man in the basement.

368
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,426
Last week, a story like that would have surprised me.

369
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,892
So who'd you almost kill? Was it Joe? I
hate that guy, he took off my cubicle.

370
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:34,054
No, I've been doing that Medieval Fight Club,

371
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,002
Since Rose has been with her mom, I...

372
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,406
I got a littl ecarried away.

373
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:38,602
Your ex wife's in town?

374
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,537
No, no, she blew in New York for a couple of weeks.

375
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:45,565
And since she's never around I have to drop
everything so that Rose can go be with her.

376
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,323
Well, when Rose gets back, she wants to stay up late, 

377
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,849
have ice cream for breakfast,

378
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,938
and then I don't let her because
I'm an actual parent not Willy Wonka,

379
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,273
so I'm the bad guy.

380
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:56,370
Rose gets mad at me and...

381
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,176
I'm going back to the basement.

382
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:00,361
Why? Is your ex-wife down there?

383
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,289
What?
Because it sounds that's who you've been fighting all week.

384
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,854
Either that or you turned into some gigantic nerd.

385
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,453
First of all, you are speaking to a knight of the realm.

386
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:15,638
So show some respect.

387
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,843
Second of all, you might be right.

388
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:22,482
There's a single dad's club that meets
on the the fifth floor every week.

389
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,267
Maybe you should check it out.

390
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:27,451
I guess I could go beat up some single dads.

391
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,348
That's actually what you're saying. You're smart.

392
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:32,453
In the basement they'd drowned as a witch.

393
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,951
Actually, they just would have sprayed
you with water, it's more like a...

394
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,306
Medieval wet tee-shirt.

395
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,396
Good news, Ted. We took a vote and made you the new king.

396
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,130
Then we took an other vote, and you died.

397
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:46,098
Gloriously in battle.

398
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,531
Listen, fellows.

399
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:50,615
I owe you an apology, I've been
working out some personnal stuff

400
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,708
and I acted like a jerk.

401
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,772
I hope I could make it up to you.

402
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,094
Just...

403
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,156
rest in peace, King Ted.

404
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,784
He means...

405
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,006
you're dead, so don't come back.

406
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,334
I got it.
Just making sure

407
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,589
because you're a guy who can miss these odds.

408
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,540
At least you two got an apology from your boss.

409
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:16,275
All I got from Veronica was a week's worth of frustration.

410
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:28,197
