3
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:09,703
There's Linda.

4
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,056
Things have been a little awkward
since we kissed

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,428
and I told her I couldn't
be with her.

6
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:16,751
Actually, the kiss was
a bit awkward, too,

7
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:17,936
and clanky.

8
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:23,990
- Hi.
- Hello.

9
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:28,840
Listen, I hope things are okay with us,
since we're not gonna,

10
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,525
you know, be together.

11
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,969
You mean you're not getting
on the elevator?

12
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,705
You know what I mean.

13
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:36,626
It just can't happen for us right now.

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,515
But I think you are a great person, and
I know you are gonna find someone--

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,650
Ted, this is my boyfriend Don.

16
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,041
Hey.

17
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,671
Well, that was fast.

18
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,389
Hey, it's nice to meet you, Ted.

19
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,074
And you're right.
Linda is a great person.

20
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,553
Ted, we didn't go anywhere.

21
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:00,201
This is the same floor.

22
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,711
I know. I like this one.

23
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:10,674
Lem, you ever get the feeling the ooplasm
cultures are looking up at you,

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,140
worshipping you like a vengeful god?

25
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:14,435
No.

26
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:18,365
Cytoplasm cultures sometimes,
but never ooplasm.

27
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:21,385
Sometimes you are a complete
stranger to me.

28
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:24,763
Coffee? I think there's still some
of the fancy stuff the company

29
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:27,634
- got us for Christmas instead of bonuses.
- You mean got you for Christmas.

30
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,111
Because you were too scared to tell them
they left you off the guest list.

31
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:32,349
Look, I don't need any coffee.

32
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,047
And I知 sorry I知 not
the alpha male you are.

33
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,210
Ooplasm.

34
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:47,741
That's crazy.

35
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:57,740
Did you put hydrochloric acid in this mug?

36
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,678
Oh, yeah. I was trying to get the stains out.

37
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:00,901
You know, soap would work,

38
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:03,651
and it wouldn't kill someone if
they accidentally drank it.

39
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,500
But soap leaves a film.

40
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,154
Hello?

41
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,515
Motion sensors.

42
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,202
I'm motioning.

43
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,146
I'm motioning.

44
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,767
Please sense me.

45
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:48,213
It tastes like cinnamon, hazelnut

46
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,966
and just a hint of hydrochloric acid.

47
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,252
It gets dark whenever you leave the room.

48
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,290
Oh...

49
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,385
Now how can I stay mad at you
when you say things like that?

50
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:08,224
Who's that incredibly handsome guy
with gidget over there?

51
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,745
Uh, that's Don, Linda's formerly ex,

52
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:12,806
currently current boyfriend.

53
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:15,760
- You're still hung up on her, aren't you?
- No, I知 not.

54
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm the one that didn't want
to get involved.

55
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,429
I can't, because my daughter
really likes her, and

56
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:23,358
Linda talks about taking off one day,
and that's exactly what Rose's mom did,

57
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:25,279
- so I can't run the risk of that happening--
- Stop.

58
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:28,314
I need to be out of this conversation
by tomorrow.

59
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:29,817
Oh, uh, one other thing.

60
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:33,720
Lem mentioned that there's, uh, something weird
going on with the motion sensors in the lab.

61
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,197
Oh, yeah, we replaced all
the sensors in the building

62
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,883
with a new, state-of-the-art system
that's gonna save money.

63
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,769
It works by detecting light
reflected off the skin.

64
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,441
Well, Lem says it doesn't work at all.

65
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,226
Lem's wrong. It does work.

66
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,877
Although there is a problem.
It doesn't seem to see black people.

67
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,840
- Because that's what they like to eat.
- Fine.

68
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,981
The system doesn't see black people?

69
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,680
I know. Weird, huh?

70
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:08,115
That's more than weird, Veronica.
That's basically, well...

71
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,021
- Racist.
- The company's position is

72
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:12,138
that it's actually the opposite of racist,

73
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:15,229
because it's not targeting black people,
it's just ignoring them.

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,548
They insist the worst people
can call it is "indifferent".

75
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,298
Well, they know it has to be fixed, right?

76
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,215
Please... at least say they know that.

77
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,612
Of course they do, and
they're working on it.

78
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,208
In the meantime, they'd like to remind
everyone to celebrate the fact

79
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:32,176
that it does see Hispanics, Asians,
pacific islanders and Jews.

80
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,329
Oh, great, she saw me looking at her.

81
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,414
Now she's gonna think I知
hung up on her, which I知 not.

82
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,764
Oh, man, she saw me doing it again.

83
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:54,712
Now I have to go over there and
show her I知 cool with her and

84
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:55,747
Don.

85
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,043
I'm not gonna play racquetball
with you. You'll win.

86
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,649
- Not if you distract me.
- I'm not flashing you again.

87
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:04,835
That was a onetime deal because I forgot
to get you a birthday present.

88
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,491
Oh, Ted, you remember Don,
my boyfriend.

89
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,241
Of course. You hold a hell
of an elevator door.

90
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,061
There's a lot more to him than that, Ted.

91
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,538
He's funny, smart, speaks French.

92
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,509
Say something in French, Don.

93
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,620
<i>Non.</i>

94
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:22,139
That was French and funny in one syllable,
which makes it smart.

95
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,633
Do you wanna play racquetball with him?
He'll kick your ass.

96
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:27,875
You play? Because I just got back into town,
and I don't have a partner.

97
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,449
Except in bed.

98
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,173
Go on.

99
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:35,601
- I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to...
- No! No, no, I値l play.

100
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,300
<i>J'adore le racquetball...</i>

101
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,587
<i>Don.</i>

102
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,074
So we got the children's hospital
all set up and running.

103
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:50,763
I left Liberia and went to Paris.

104
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:53,805
Uh, Linda and I went there the
first time we were together.

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,135
We found this vendor who makes
the most amazing chocolate crepes.

106
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,534
She loved them so much, I got the recipe so
I could make 'em for her when we got back home...

107
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,254
<i>It turned out Don was
really a good guy.</i>

108
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,807
<i>Linda was right.
He was funny and smart.</i>

109
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:10,429
<i>And for some reason, he could name
every freshwater fish in North America.</i>

110
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:13,372
Plus, he once played miniature
golf with Tiger Woods.

111
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,753
Good morning, Lem.
You're here bright and early.

112
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,290
No, I was here all night.

113
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,290
Really? Sweet.

114
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:32,642
You single guys... wish I could spend
all night in the lab.

115
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,868
I wasn't in the lab all night
because I知 single.

116
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,854
I was stuck here because I知 black
and the door wouldn't open for me.

117
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,063
What? Why didn't you call security?

118
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,933
I did. Spoke to Lamont--
Nice guy.

119
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,932
He spent the night trapped in his kiosk.

120
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,906
This is ridiculous. You have
to talk to Veronica.

121
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,341
- I'm going to.
- No, I mean you really have to.

122
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,466
I'm going to.

123
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,823
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I might.

124
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:55,657
You have to stand up
for yourself this time.

125
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:59,771
This isn't just delicious flavored coffee.
It is your dignity we're talking about.

126
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:03,456
I have my dignity. Now will you please
take me to the bathroom?

127
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,445
All right, I see your point.

128
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:12,317
Guess I could get a couple of the black employees,
and we could go talk to Veronica.

129
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,614
Good idea. Safety in numbers.

130
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,684
She is....

131
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,785
way too attractive and
intimidating to face alone.

132
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,066
Plus, if I get enough guys, maybe
she won't know which one's me.

133
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,624
Nothing.

134
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,103
We never should've let
that white guy off.

135
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:34,022
We're eight black men in an elevator.

136
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,706
Of course the white guy's gonna get off.

137
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,523
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

138
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:41,528

139
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:44,925

<i>we enjoy varieties of people,</i>

<i>Veridian Dynamics.

150
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,881
I had a really good time
with Don last night.

151
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,166
Yeah, I heard.

152
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,647
Great news.

153
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,990
And he is obviously crazy about you.

154
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,267
He 's obviously crazy about you, too.
Good job, Ted.

155
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:30,702
Everybody loves everybody.

156
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:32,872
Wait. I--I知 saying I like Don.

157
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,518
And I知 saying fantastic.

158
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,061
It doesn't sound like
you're saying, "fantastic."

159
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,933
I mean, you're using the word,
but it sounds all...

160
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,025
yell-y?

161
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:48,648
- Oh. Is that one of Don's crepes?
- Yeah,

162
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:50,033
they're really, really good.

163
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,579
I'd love to taste it.

164
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:54,742
Sorry. That was the last bite.

165
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:03,602
This was the company's plan.
We're gonna die in here.

166
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,265
Yeah, we'll get the last laugh next week
when everyone is wondering

167
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,050
what that smell is.

168
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,178
I thought you guys might
need a little help.

169
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:21,867
Veronica?

170
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,535
Oh, god. This looks way too aggressive.

171
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,870
No, it 's okay. I think I know
why you're all here.

172
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,531
Well, most of you.

173
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,573
Um, I have something prepared. Um...

174
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:38,469
"Veronica, you are a terrific Boss."

175
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,410
Thank you, Lem, I値l take it from here.

176
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:43,329
Let me start by apologizing
on behalf of Veridian for this

177
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,114
inexcusable situation.

178
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,794
I understand what you're going through.

179
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,131
I know what it's like to see
the ugly face of discrimination.

180
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,632
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

181
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,490
When I was 16,

182
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,771
I was 5'9"

183
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:00,184
and stunning.

184
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:02,309
I mean, off-the-charts gorgeous.

185
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:05,894
At school, I was like a swan
among ugly ducklings.

186
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,173
All the other girls hated me, and...

187
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,531
like our light sensors are doing to you,

188
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,153
totally ignored me.

189
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,302
If it wasn't for the modeling contracts
and the comfort of college boys,

190
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,033
I don't know if I would've made it.

191
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,433
Wow.

192
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,662
Wow, I had no idea.

193
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,740
No, how could you?

194
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,431
You're still not 5'9".

195
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:26,763
Thank you.

196
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,509
My point is,

197
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,747
the company is committed
to fixing this problem,

198
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,082
and they will.

199
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,552
Anything else?

200
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:42,475
"Great boss... always fair...
hair like spun gold..." No, that's it.

201
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,771
Well, my door is always open to you.

202
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:47,480
Please close it on the way out.

203
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,436
I laid into Veronica pretty good.

204
00:10:57,471 --> 00:11:00,439
I figured it was my only shot,
so I took the gloves off.

205
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:02,346
Well, that sounds great,
Lem. Sounds like you

206
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,055
gave the company a
really strong message.

207
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,922
Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,924
She said they're working 24/7
to make things right.

209
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:16,239
Manual Drinking Fountain
(For Blacks)

210
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,799
- Separate drinking fountains?
- Thank god we don't have a company bus.

211
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,661
Okay, they realize it didn't work.

212
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,973
Although there's a lot of fighting upstairs
about whether it was the idea

213
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:29,409
or the execution.

214
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,818
- Look, Veronica.
- Yes, Lem?

215
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:34,274
- I think we know
what I'm going to say.

216
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,445
- No! Go ahead. You tell
her, Lem. You earned it.

217
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,390
I am really angry about this.
Or just angry.

218
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,289
You know, whatever feels right to you.

219
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,449
You have every right to be angry.

220
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:46,531
The good news is, I'm told
they've fixed it.

221
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,463
- Really?
- Yes. You won. Nice work.

222
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,591
You can walk away tall.

223
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,781
Thank you.

224
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:56,797
- I just...
- Walk... away... tall.

225
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,393
I think she's telling you to walk away,

226
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,756
but tall.

227
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,286
Oh. Right.

228
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,587
Go, Veridian!

229
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,727
Look at you, letting him be heard.

230
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,607
Sometimes it's important to listen
to the people who work for you, Ted.

231
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,202
Someone just told me the
most incredible thing.

232
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,737
Oh, god. Another one.

233
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,509
Okay, this isn't a joke.
Eight black guys walk into an elevator...

234
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:23,883
We know.
It's being handled.

235
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,901
Whoa, excuse me.

236
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,816
Maybe if Don were
telling you this, you'd

237
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,874
let him finish and then
go out for smoothies.

238
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:35,896
That chick gets weirder every day.

239
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,466
I don't know what
happened. She's been mad

240
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,286
at me ever since I told
her I liked her boyfriend.

241
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,731
I guess I should go talk to them about
the drinking fountains,

242
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:44,120
although they're not gonna want
to pull them out too fast

243
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,555
because it'll look like they're admitting
they made a mistake.

244
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,403
The thing is, it was Linda's idea for me
to date Don in the first place.

245
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,062
So seriously, what the hell?

246
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,288
Okay.

247
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:53,635
She set you up, hoping you would have

248
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:55,089
a bad time because you're not over her.

249
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:58,420
But you had a good time, so now she's
mad because it means you are over her.

250
00:12:58,455 --> 00:12:59,455
Got it?

251
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:02,505
That's weird. Linda and I haven't had sex.
It's complicated.

252
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,163
You and I had sex that one time,
and it's no big deal.

253
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:08,433
Well, I'm different than other women, Ted.
And by "different",

254
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:09,918
I mean "better".

255
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:15,907
Hey...

256
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:19,653
- Look at that. The lights are on.
- Yes, they are, Phil.

257
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:22,614
See? Got them to fix it.

258
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,600
When you stand up for yourself,
you get things done.

259
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:29,474
I learned that the first time I sent back
undercooked chicken at a restaurant.

260
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,788
Yes, I ended up paying
for two chickens,

261
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,592
- but still...
- They didn't fix the system.

262
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,528
Sure they did. The lights were on when
I got here, so...

263
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,170
All they did was hire a bunch of

264
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:42,305
minimum-wage white guys to follow
the black employees around...

265
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,556
And activate things for us.

266
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:47,799
This is Stu.

267
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,274
He's a huge idiot

268
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,759
But he was born with the god-given talent
to trigger a light sensor, so...

269
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,205
Here we are.

270
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:59,675
- This tastes salty!
- Well, that's because it's salt...

271
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,436
You huge idiot.

272
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,731
What is it?

273
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:03,766
Salt.

274
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,010
Salt.

275
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,805
- Salt!
- Okay, you know what? You have to do something,

276
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,429
because I don't care for all this yelling.

277
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,252
It's time for me and the guys
to ride again.

278
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,787
Stu, we're leaving.

279
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,889
I think this might be salt!

280
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,782
You really shouldn't eat things in here.

281
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,132
Okay, what are you doing?

282
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,397
I was told to do exactly what you do.

283
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:58,015
They didn't mean that. That doesn't even make
any sense. What they meant... okay, cut it out.

284
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,163
Can't risk it, bro. This is the first job
I've had in, like,

285
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:02,259
two years?

286
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,599
Can you believe this?

287
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:13,370
I know, isn't it great?

288
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,887
We all get our own free
white guys.

289
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,440
- You like it?
- Yeah!

290
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,411
Hey, Todd's the best.

291
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,922
He anticipates everything I need.
Plus, he picked up my dry cleaning.

292
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,715
Oh, and he got this kink out of my neck.

293
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,004
Really?

294
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,421
My white guy sucks.

295
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:31,378
Well, maybe you're just
not using yours right.

296
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,613
- Yeah, maybe it's on you, dude.
- Shut up, Stu.

297
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:37,977
I got the worst black guy.

298
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:46,070
I can't be friends with Don anymore.

299
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,739
Really?

300
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:51,177
Go on.

301
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,584
In fact, I never want to see him again.

302
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,997
I'm surprised to hear you say that since
you said he was such a great guy.

303
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,061
I know, and he is.
But it turns out, I hate him.

304
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:01,802
Do you really?

305
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,837
Yes.

306
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,640
I want to crush his handsome skull
with a hammer.

307
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:07,141
Well, that's horrible.

308
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:09,718
Anything else?

309
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,604
Well, then I'd chop him into pieces and

310
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,065
I'd feed him to all his precious
North American freshwater fish.

311
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,644
- Then, with whatever's leftover, I...
- Okay, easy, Ted. I am dating the guy.

312
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Right.

313
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,773
So I should get going.

314
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,980
Good-bye, Linda.

315
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:35,211
You know, we have a meeting
now in the conference room.

316
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,392
Oh, yeah.

317
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,661
I'll walk with you.

318
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,416
This whole black thing has turned
into a complete nightmare.

319
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,239
Really? There's a problem with operation
white shadow?

320
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:58,543
Human resources says it's against the law
to just hire a bunch of white people

321
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:00,270
because that's discrimination.

322
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:04,330
So now we also have to hire black people to
follow our black people around,

323
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,670
which doesn't make any sense because
our system won't see them, either.

324
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:11,540
So then we'd have to hire more white
people for those black people,

325
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:15,430
which we can't do without hiring
more black people.

326
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:19,863
Oh, Ted, I'm having the most
awful, awful, awful day.

327
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,867
So am I.

328
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:30,575
And suddenly the day takes
an unexpected turn.

329
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,319
Not that I'm complaining.

330
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,591
<i>I had a terrible day,</i>

331
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,700
<i>but things were finally
starting to look up.</i>

332
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,961
Ted, wait.

333
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:46,475
I don't think this is a good idea.

334
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,942
You couldn't have mentioned
that a couple seconds ago?

335
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,440
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,680
If we did this, it would be fun.

337
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:54,500
I mean, it always is with me.

338
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:58,410
I'm not bragging. It just is.
Plus, you and I are good together.

339
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,270
But the thing is, you wouldn't
be doing it with me.

340
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,035
Oh, come on, Linda!

341
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,864
Okay, I see what you're saying.

342
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,375
Listen, you're not...

343
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:09,445
you know...

344
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:10,645
What, Ted?

345
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,125
Embarrassed? Upset? Disappointed?

346
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:15,460
Itchy? Hungry? Earning
twice your salary?

347
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,759
Don't worry.
I'm not any of those things.

348
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,230
Maybe a little hungry.

349
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,880
Plus, the salary thing.

350
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:24,115
Now let's talk about the problems of
institutional racism.

351
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,080
Boy, when the moment's gone with you,
it's really gone.

352
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,650
I've been doing some reading.

353
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,640
We're on the wrong side of this issue.

354
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,950
Well, why don't they just get rid of
the new system

355
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:37,670
- and put the old one back in?
- It'd be too expensive. Ted...

356
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:40,129
This isn't about race.
It's about money.

357
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,700
It's always about money.

358
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:44,350
"Money before people."
That's the company motto...

359
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:47,300
Engraved right there on
the lobby floor.

360
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,343
It just looks more heroic in Latin.

361
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:02,520
<i>It turned out Lem had also been thinking about the money issue,</i>

362
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,889
<i>and he put together some interesting
numbers to show us.</i>

363
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:10,409
<i>And then we all went to speak
to management</i>

364
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,090
<i>in a language they could understand.</i>

365
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,910
Within a margin of error of plus
or minus 1%.

366
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,820
And so if the company

367
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,980
keeps hiring white people
to follow black people

368
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,610
to follow white people to follow
black people, by...

369
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,250
Thursday, June 27, 2013...

370
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,568
Every person on earth will be
working for us.

371
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:32,105
And... we don't have
the parking for that.

372
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:33,950
- No way.
- Now...

373
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:37,370
let's take a look at how this would
affect health care costs.

374
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,651
Gee, Ted, it seems like, financially,

375
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:43,026
it makes more sense to just go back
to the old system.

376
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:45,800
Great idea, Veronica.

377
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,885
That's why you're earning
twice my salary.

378
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:55,390
<i>And so the company reinstalled the old
motion detectors,</i>

379
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:57,047
<i>and things got back to normal.</i>

380
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:57,940
See?

381
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:01,550
You stood up for yourself, and finally,
the problem got solved.

382
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,919
- Good for you, Lem.
- Thank you.

383
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:08,576
I'm really gonna enjoy living my life without
having white people hovering around me.

384
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,684
Veridian to black people:
We see you!

385
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,920
- We're a good team, Ted.
- Yeah, we are.

386
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,620
Here. I bought you some briefs.

387
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:27,392
The boxers you were wearing
didn't highlight your assets.

388
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,920
Penisly speaking.

389
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:32,910
Thank you. And I promise to never tear off
my clothes in front of you again.

390
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,220
I didn't say "never".

391
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:36,443
I'll just let you know when you're ready.

392
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,908
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ted.

393
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:40,236
Don.

394
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:43,280
- Don stopped by for lunch.
- You guys want join us?

395
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:46,615
Thanks. No, I, I've got some
briefs to look over.

396
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,046
Veronica?

397
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,894
Well, that was a lovely invitation.

398
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:52,435
Now you can walk away tall.

399
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,935
Walk away...

400
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,171
Tall.

401
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,842
Walkin' away tall, Boss.

402
