1
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:09,071
{\pos(192,220)}Sometimes, big companies
make big mistakes.

2
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:10,247
{\pos(192,220)}Like yesterday's,

3
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,756
{\pos(192,220)}which caused a million fish
in Lake Michigan to grow fur.

4
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:15,389
{\pos(192,235)}Luckily,
today's mistake is a little one.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,441
{\pos(192,235)}Someone pried a window open
on the 20th floor.

6
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,853
{\pos(192,235)}Wanna go scare the crap
out of floors 1 through 19?

7
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,562
{\pos(192,235)}{\First of all,}Be careful with the dummy.

8
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:24,805
{\pos(192,235)}He's scheduled to get hit
by a train at 4:30.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,775
{\pos(192,235)}Secondly,

10
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,558
{\pos(192,235)}I have to go to human resources.

11
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:30,099
{\pos(192,235)}They made a mistake
on my new I.D. badge.

12
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:32,019
{\pos(192,235)}"Ted Chips." That's funny.

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,241
{\pos(192,235)}Although not as funny
as your real name.

14
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,465
{\pos(192,220)}Ted Crisp? That's not funny.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,992
{\pos(192,220)}It's not "make people think
someone jumped off the roof" funny,

16
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:41,332
{\pos(192,220)}but it's still pretty funny.
And don't bother with H.R.

17
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:44,059
{\pos(192,220)} I can fix any I.D.
with a razor blade and some wite-out.

18
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:46,504
{\pos(192,220)}Trust me,
I've been 21 since I was 15.

19
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:50,095
{\pos(192,220)}Thanks, anyway. I think I'll just let
H.R. handle it, play by the rules.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,300
{\pos(192,220)}You love rules.

21
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:54,959
{\pos(192,220)}You should marry a rule
{\pos(192,220)}and have little rule children,

22
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:57,223
{\pos(192,220)}then build a house made of rules.

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,725
{\pos(192,220)}You mean a house
made of my own children?

24
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,513
{\pos(192,220)}That's between you
and your conscience.

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:08,979
All right.

26
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:10,820
Let's call up your file

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,188
and see what the problem is,
Mr. Chips.

28
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:15,160
It's "Crisp." Ted Crisp.

29
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,405
{\pos(192,190)}No, it says "Chips."

30
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:18,661
"Ted Chips."

31
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,454
I know, but that's not my name.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,692
Don't take this wrong,
but are you sure?

33
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:26,377
Because it is very unlikely the system
would make a mistake like that.

34
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,190
{\pos(192,220)}I think I know my last name.

35
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,673
{\pos(192,220)}It's the one thing my father and I
agree on.

36
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:36,497
Let's see if this helps.

37
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,140
It did not help at all.

38
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,643
This is a first.
The system just deleted you.

39
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,604
What do you mean, deleted me?

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,230
Can you re-lete me?

41
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,277
There's no record of you anywhere.

42
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,820
So what happens now?

43
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,906
Don't worry.
I'll just report it to I.T.

44
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:01,513
That's gonna be some paperwork.

45
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,347
- Teddy, how's it going?
- Good, Ryan, how are you?

46
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:10,588
My wife's knee
is giving her problems again.

47
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,089
- Damn it.
- I know.

48
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:16,218
I told her, "you weigh 400 pounds."
"The {\human }knee is not designed for that."

49
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:17,819
That's great advice.

50
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,639
Listen, my badge
is giving me a little problem.

51
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,283
- Can I borrow yours to get in the lab?
- No can do.

52
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:26,675
That would be crossing the system,
and I never cross the system,

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,065
which isn't hard, because, frankly,
it is a great system.

54
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:33,225
<i>My problem was growing
as big as Ryan's wife.</i>

55
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,356
<i>Now neither of us
could get through a door.</i>

56
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,429
<i>And so my team was gonna have
to go on without me.</i>

57
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:41,404
This jet pack project
is gonna be so exciting.

58
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,996
Jet packs are the ultimate dream
of every scientist.

59
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:47,272
Skies teeming with ordinary citizens
strapped to rockets.

60
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:50,544
Flying through the air
at 60 miles an hour in any direction.

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,672
A lot of people are going to die.

62
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:56,634
Where's Ted? It's not like him
to be late to a meeting.

63
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,344
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

64
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,989
Maybe he's dead.

65
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,932
He's not dead, Patricia.
You think everyone's dead.

66
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
People die.
Ask my dead neighbor.

67
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,394
He could be at the vending machine.

68
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,730
Perhaps that new yogurt
caught his eye.

69
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,902
He doesn't eat yogurt. He's Ted.

70
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,528
He's more likely out hitting a home run
or foiling a robbery...{\ or}

71
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,445
Stop it!
We're scientists,

72
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,252
not people who can examine
every variable of a phenomenon

73
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,827
to determine an accurate understanding
of a specific event.

74
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:23,994
Ted's late.

75
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:27,998
We can't know why any more than we can
unlock the secrets of the universe.

76
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,752
See how order breaks down
without Ted?

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,520
If only he was here, he could tell us
what to do without him.

78
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,496
I spoke to them.
They say it's just a computer glitch.

79
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,606
And since they back up the system
every week,

80
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,654
the easiest way to get you restored
is to just reboot.

81
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,268
- Good. So when do they do that?
- Never.

82
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,144
That's the easiest way.

83
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,000
But rebooting would shut down
Veridian's entire worldwide operations,

84
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,738
and that means money,
which the company never parts

85
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,235
with unless forced to
by a government stronger than they are,

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,396
and there's only 3 of those left.

87
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:02,206
This is ridiculous,

88
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:04,257
And frankly,
I don't like not existing.

89
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,894
It... saddens me.

90
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:10,248
They'll fix it. And don't be sad.
You'll get all wrinkly.

91
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,805
You missed an important meeting.

92
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,875
- Were you having yogurt?
- Will you let that go?

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,301
- He doesn't eat yogurt, right?
- Right.

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,304
That new one does look intriguing.

95
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,142
Look at them.
They don't know what to do with that.

96
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,463
Ted temporarily can't go to the lab.

97
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,899
Reschedule the meeting
for the conference room.

98
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:36,152
All the components {\for the jet pack }are in the lab.
Moving them is not practical.

99
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,652
We have a test flight
scheduled in two days.

100
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,487
That means a lot of coordination...

101
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,449
No wonder the system deleted you.

102
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,225
Fine,
I'll take care of your precious lab.

103
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,800
Leave it all to me.

104
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,791
You're in charge of the lab.
I leave it all to you.

105
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,252
- Me?
- I don't like it down there.

106
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,214
It's chilly, the people are odd,
and it smells like science.

107
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,597
I'm not a huge fan of that place,
either.

108
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:04,178
Last time I was down there, I got chased
by some weird 8-legged bird.

109
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,891
The octo-chicken.
We had such hopes for that.

110
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,433
Anyway,

111
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,527
if you have any problems...
any at all,

112
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:12,811
you come see me.

113
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:17,204
Although, that would be a huge admission
of failure on your part.

114
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,782
The online protections are important.
The charts... Hang on.

115
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,409
Who are you?
{\and }What are you doing in my office?

116
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,829
I'm Jim from marketing.
They told me this was my new office.

117
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,248
<i>Individuals...</i>

118
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,838
<i>We believe everyone is special,</i>

119
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,442
<i>irreplaceable</i>

120
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,010
<i>and will follow the thing
walking in front of it.</i>

121
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,728
<i>That's why we celebrate
all individuals,</i>

122
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,269
<i>Even ones going nowhere.</i>

123
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,441
<i>Because you can't spell "individual"</i>

124
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,809
<i>without "Veridian"...</i>

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
<i>and "u"...</i>

126
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>and an "l".</i>

127
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,946
I can't take it anymore, Janet.
First the lab,

128
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,482
now my office.

129
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,616
I still work here. I exist.

130
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,084
I know you exist.

131
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,161
The computer's the one
you have to convince.

132
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,622
Can't you just add me back
into the system?

133
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,490
Do you have a 4-57 code?

134
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,994
I might.

135
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,596
Why, yes, I do.

136
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:23,173
Only new hires

137
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,259
are assigned 4-57 codes,

138
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:29,115
and only people with 4-57 codes
can be entered into the system.

139
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,394
What if I reapply for the position?

140
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:38,393
I fill out an application
for a job that I already have.

141
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,857
Finally,

142
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,443
you say something that makes sense.

143
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:46,822
<i>While I was figuring out
how to get back in the system,</i>

144
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,583
<i>Linda was figuring out
how to be in charge.</i>

145
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,568
Everybody, be quiet.

146
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,000
Now let's start again,

147
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,298
and say it in Layman's terms.

148
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,668
See if you can follow this.
Lem is an idiot.

149
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,999
See if you can follow this.
That hurt my feelings.

150
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,124
Snap!

151
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,258
And why do you get to be in charge?{\ anyway?}

152
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,927
As I recall, you were the only one
who ran from the octo-chicken.

153
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:11,930
It freaked me out
when it came down from its web.

154
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,144
You're weak
and have no leadership qualities.

155
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,314
I can lead.

156
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:18,020
Maybe you're just a crappy follower.
Did you ever think of that?

157
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,116
Can we please
get back to the jet pack?

158
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,709
- Because it has to fly in 24 hours.
- And since I'm the one going up in it,

159
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:27,054
it'd be nice
if the hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio

160
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,864
was below the burn flash point.

161
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,242
I miss Ted. How do you know
if two people have chemistry?

162
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,923
How do you manage
all those scientists

163
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:42,378
with their egos and bickering
and full-frontal nerdity?

164
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,263
Just listen to everyone carefully,

165
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:47,299
make them feel heard, study the issues
and make firm decisions.

166
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,441
Could you give that to me
in Layman's terms?

167
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,111
All right, look,
they're like animals.

168
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,432
They respond more to tone
than actual words.

169
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,019
They also like treats, it's why
I keep caramels.

170
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,588
I can't believe the company
is treating you like this.

171
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,482
Doesn't it make you want to scream

172
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,283
or put your fist through a wall

173
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:08,445
or rub your junk
on the C.E.O.'s chair?

174
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,950
And I only use my junk for good,
not evil.

175
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,913
With great junk
comes great responsibility.

176
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:21,834
You filed a job application?

177
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,711
I need a 4-57 code
to get back in the system.

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,672
That triggered a 2-29 protocol.

179
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,641
Which means I now have to give you
a job interview...

180
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,594
Theodore Margaret Crisp.

181
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:33,934
Job interview?

182
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,432
And it's pronounced "mar-gar-ray".
It's a family name.

183
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,644
It means "lamb of god."

184
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,473
I don't care.
Now let's begin this charade.

185
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,941
Or as "mar-gar-ray"
would say... "sha-rod".

186
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,777
So why should we hire you

187
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,779
over any of
the other qualified applicants?

188
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,030
Other applicants?

189
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,154
Your filing this application

190
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,410
caused the system to think
the position was open.

191
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,534
Can't you just hire me
without doing {\all }this?

192
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,622
Sorry.
That would be breaking the rules.

193
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,501
But it's me.
And you.

194
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,714
Look, it's only a formality.
You're going to get your job back.

195
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,674
The process is just gonna be long

196
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:14,873
- and extraordinarily humiliating.
- I'd like to believe, after everything

197
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,930
I've done for this company
over the years,

198
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,516
they'd show me a little more loyalty
than this.

199
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,936
I know It's hard to accept that
giant companies don't care about people.

200
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:26,304
I know how hard it was for me
when I first realized it...

201
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:27,579
when I was 8.

202
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,991
If the company doesn't need me,

203
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,403
then I don't need it,

204
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:32,703
so...

205
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,364
I'm going home.

206
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,452
And I may not come back.

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,662
Come on, Ted, we'll sort it out.

208
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,873
{\In the meantime}Meanwhile,
we'll set you up with a laptop

209
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,791
in a nice, roomy handicapped stall.

210
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,712
It has its own bathroom.

211
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:57,429
Ted went home?

212
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,098
I heard his job interview
did not go well.

213
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,684
- What if he never comes back?
- This is real, people.

214
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:04,561
This is real.

215
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,654
He is supposed to inform us
when he leaves the premises.

216
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,651
- It's not okay. It's not...
- All right, all right, that's enough!

217
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,714
Listen to my tone and not my words.

218
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:17,060
We can't just stand here
and let them take Ted away from us.

219
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:19,243
He is the shiniest employee we have.

220
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,208
Did you just say "shiniest"?

221
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,322
Again, listen to my tone
and not my words.

222
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,208
We have to do something.

223
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,633
Linda's tone is right.

224
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:29,897
We can't function without Ted.

225
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,192
So what do we do, interim boss?

226
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,973
We have to work together
and come up with a plan.

227
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,557
We suck at working together.

228
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,505
Then let's go talk to the one person
who can un-suck us.

229
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,210
Follow me, people.

230
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,364
I am showing leadership.

231
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:56,822
And I have caramels.

232
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,504
I'm flattered you guys are all here.{\ Really, I am.}
But the company doesn't care about me.

233
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,581
This is a good learning moment
for the girl.

234
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,584
You are born alone
and you die alone.

235
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,627
You're Dr. Bhamba, right?

236
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,672
We are not here
because the company needs you.

237
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,713
We're here because we need you.

238
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:17,801
You bring out
the best in each of us.

239
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,971
You take a bunch of barely
functional, socially awkward,

240
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,431
semi-creepy scientists

241
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:25,530
and one beautifully normal
product tester,

242
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,561
and you make us a team.

243
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,273
We love you, Ted.

244
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,404
And I like working with all of you.

245
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,700
Consider me hugged.

246
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:48,832
I was thinking...

247
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:54,087
I was leading, and I thought,
what if we crashed the mainframe?

248
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:58,175
When it rebooted,
he'd be back in the system, right?

249
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:04,181
We can feed it a virus that
overloads it with illogical information.

250
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,018
It would think it's malfunctioning,
then would shut down and reboot itself.

251
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,437
How Linda does
when we explain how stuff works.

252
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,441
You guys would be willing
to do that for me?

253
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,779
You'd be risking your jobs.

254
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,615
Come on.
Let's break some rules.

255
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,241
Let's crash it up.

256
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,392
All right. I'm in.

257
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:31,583
But I don't get it. You've always said
breaking the rules is wrong.

258
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:34,499
Rose is right. We can't do it.

259
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,312
Because we should never
break the rules.

260
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,966
She goes to bed in half an hour.

261
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,893
<i>It felt good to be wanted
and to be back in charge...</i>

262
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,185
<i>and to have rose safely tucked in bed
so she wouldn't ask questions</i>

263
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,041
<i>and so we could use her toys.</i>

264
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,192
Patricia, you will stand by the elevator
here to make sure nobody gets by.

265
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,861
I still have some excellent caution tape
from when my neighbor died.

266
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,988
That's right, Linda. People die.

267
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:06,377
All the security guards at Veridian,
including Ryan,

268
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,074
have a full-access badge
that opens every door in the building.

269
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,805
I'll distract Ryan

270
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,005
while Ted gets his badge.

271
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:18,880
While Linda does that,
I will run the badge down here

272
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,503
to where Lem and Phil

273
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:23,719
are waiting outside the door
to the mainframe computer room.

274
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,762
Which one of those am I?

275
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,116
I know. I'm pepper.
Because I'm spicy.

276
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,458
And I'm salty, like a sea captain.

277
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,093
- I haven't yet heard "Bhamba."
- Dr. Bhamba.

278
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,440
- There it is.
- You are our technical expert.

279
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,067
So it is your job
to disable the cameras

280
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,853
outside the computer room.

281
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,612
Those cameras are complicated.

282
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,161
They are a high-resolution,
3-chip matrix system.

283
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:46,620
This will be a challenge.

284
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:53,609
Bhamba... 1.

285
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,369
High-resolution, 3 chip matrix system...
0.

286
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:10,627
They were supposed
to bring my new badge by.

287
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:13,477
- Did it get here yet?
- Nothing's crossed my desk, Teddy.

288
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,180
It should be here any second.
Why don't you go ahead?

289
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,467
I wish there was a badge
to get into that.

290
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,319
Amen.

291
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,321
Shoot.

292
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,531
Is your card not working?

293
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,088
It's not the card.

294
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,828
It's these damn breasts of mine.

295
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,812
I'm taking this new medication,
and it's making 'em so big and perky.

296
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,211
Do they look strange to you?

297
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,339
Don't worry about those breasts.
They're top-shelf.

298
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,735
You can't tell from over there.

299
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:47,258
Come closer.

300
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:00,956
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,477
This reminds me of this time
when I was in college...

302
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,740
Did you disable the camera?

303
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,134
Did you disable
your stupid-question filter?

304
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,559
I thought I did.

305
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,170
Oh, my gosh, it was just so crazy.

306
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,007
We were all playing in the mud,

307
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,425
I get into the shower,
obviously totally nude,

308
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:30,858
- and guess who's in there?
- Who? Who?

309
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,558
My two sorority sisters.

310
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,036
They were...
just vaginas everywhere.

311
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,071
- Man, I love those.
- Right?

312
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,649
Well, I gotta go make my rounds.

313
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,722
- You wanna come with me?
- Sure.

314
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,363
Let me just get my badge.

315
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,356
My badge is gone.

316
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:56,486
So is my underwear?

317
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,337
Got it.

318
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,300
You have your flash drive
with the virus on it?

319
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,136
- Aye!
- You're so salty.

320
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:14,306
Don't move!

321
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,875
I caught them all
trying to break in.

322
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,634
<i>Security stopped us
before we could crash the mainframe.</i>

323
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,347
<i>And since Veronica was our supervisor,
that's who they took us to see.</i>

324
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:41,795
None of this would've happened
if it weren't for you.

325
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,367
My boobs worked their ass off.

326
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,088
You rallied all these people.
You got 'em out of the lab

327
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,627
and into the sunlight
and down to my house.

328
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,302
You stepped up.
That's what leaders do.

329
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,383
Thanks.

330
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:58,320
It turns out it's easy to lead
when it's for something you care about.

331
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,183
I hope I made myself clear.

332
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:05,876
Yes, sir, I understand.

333
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,075
You've all disappointed me.

334
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,938
That's punishment enough.

335
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:14,616
I'm kidding.

336
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,884
Get in here.

337
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:21,665
You tried to shut the computer down
by driving it crazy?

338
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,834
Making it think it was malfunctioning
is the only way to get it to reboot

339
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,052
and put Ted back in the system.

340
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,109
Ma'am.

341
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,483
I should have you all
fired or demoted

342
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,594
or put you in the tank
with the octo-chicken.

343
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,806
What you did was thoughtless,
reckless, unprofessional,

344
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,225
<i>Veronica yeled at us
for half an hour.</i>

345
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:43,603
<i>Finally, she ran out of adjectives
and was done.</i>

346
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
... vertical and lactose intolerant.

347
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:49,693
Any questions?

348
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,027
I have one.

349
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,737
How did they find us so quickly?

350
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,365
They tracked Ryan's missing badge
to the basement.

351
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,200
They can track his badge?

352
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,211
Our new badges can be tracked.
That way,

353
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,955
- the system always knows where we are.
- That's creepy.

354
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,107
If the system lived
in its mother's basement,

355
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,689
it would be exactly
like this guy I used to date.

356
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,560
Ma'am.

357
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,320
Speaking of badges,
I'm gonna need all of yours.

358
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,415
After the jet pack test
this afternoon,

359
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,145
you're all being bumped down
to lower security clearances.

360
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,471
Don't take their badges.
This is my fault.

361
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:20,605
That's very noble, Ted.

362
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,249
The company would be a much better place
if someone like you were working here.

363
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,734
You'd better come back in one piece.

364
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,244
- You're my ride home.
- If I don't make it back,

365
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:36,235
my mom will pick you up.

366
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:37,861
Wait!

367
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,078
Legal says you have to wear
a parachute.

368
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,290
Why? At the height I'm going,
a parachute will be useless.

369
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,542
Not from a legal standpoint.
Good luck.

370
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:53,715
<i>The truth was, legal couldn't care less
if Lem wore a parachute or not.</i>

371
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,640
<i>In fact, it wasn't even a parachute.</i>

372
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,701
{\pos(192,230)}<i>It turned out something had happened
that convinced Veronica</i>

373
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:02,200
{\pos(192,230)}<i>to also break some rules
and go against the system.</i>

374
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,225
You want me to replace Ted?

375
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,978
I didn't say that.
I just want you to hire this applicant

376
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,564
to fill Ted's position,
which the system says

377
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,065
is technically vacant.

378
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,365
But, Chet, the interviews
were just a formality.

379
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,862
We were always gonna hire Ted
for Ted's position.

380
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,211
Look, I love Ted.
He's one of our best people.

381
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:20,365
But this kid's fresh out
of business school

382
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,452
and comes
at a fraction of the price.

383
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,705
If it would help you make
the transition, I'm sure

384
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,415
he'd let you call him "Ted".

385
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,657
I hope I made myself clear,
Veronica.

386
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,312
Yes, sir, I understood.

387
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:40,360
<i>Veronica realized
from our nearly flawless plan</i>

388
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:43,231
<i>that overloading the system
with illogical information</i>

389
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,774
<i>would make it crash,</i>

390
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,720
<i>and so she spent
the next several hours</i>

391
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:50,346
<i>collecting as many other badges
as she could.</i>

392
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:56,839
<i>Then, knowing the system
would track the badges,</i>

393
00:19:56,964 --> 00:20:00,406
<i>she made it think that 75 employees
crammed into a knapsack</i>

394
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:02,700
<i>and shot themselves into space.</i>

395
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,314
<i>Since this made no sense,</i>

396
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,344
<i>the computer freaked out
and crashed.</i>

397
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,063
<i>It was the reboot
heard round the world.</i>

398
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:40,782
The plan was a success,
and just like that, I existed again.

399
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,286
What changed your mind
about breaking the rules?

400
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:50,651
What are you talking about? I never
break the rules, you shouldn't, either,

401
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:53,585
cause you couldn't pull off a caper
if it was sitting on a plate of lox.

402
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,962
Thank for not doing
what you didn't do.

403
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,310
It's nice to have you back,

404
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,134
{\pos(192,200)}but if you hate the company so much,
why'd you return?

405
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:03,636
{\pos(192,200)}That's why.

406
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:07,679
{\pos(192,200)}I like cupcakes.

407
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:11,306
{\pos(192,200)}I don't, especially
when they're frosted with emotion.

408
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,441
{\pos(192,200)}- Welcome back.
- Thanks, guys.

409
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,186
{\pos(192,180)}These aren't for you.

410
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,112
{\pos(192,180)}We're heading up to the 20th floor.
The window's still open.

411
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,239
{\pos(192,180)}Wanna come break some rules?

412
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,201
{\pos(192,180)}Sure, let's go
make it rain cupcakes.
