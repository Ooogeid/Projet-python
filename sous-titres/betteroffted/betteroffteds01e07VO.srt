1
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:10,384
Do you think I look like
a possum in this shirt?

2
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:12,929
No.
Why?

3
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:15,595
My wife went on and on
this morning about

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,975
how this shirt makes me
look like a possum.

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,226
Sometimes I don't know
how you put up with that woman.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,564
Usually I hold perfectly
still until she goes away.

7
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,521
The company has a problem.

8
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,391
A recent survey found employee morale
has dropped from "low"

9
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:32,810
Which they were okay with:
To "I'd like to burn this place down"

10
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,910
Which, frankly,
I'm surprised is one of the options.

11
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,366
This is Clark.
He conducted the survey.

12
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:41,576
Right now he's telling Veronica
what the employees think about her,

13
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,972
which means right now,
Veronica hates Clark.

14
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,641
63% found you too intimidating.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,881
Is there such a thing
as too intimidating?

16
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,424
Is there?

17
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,426
Answer me, you little bean counter.

18
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:56,305
I've told you three times
I don't like being called that.

19
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,642
Sorry.
I was told my evaluation was at 11:00.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,998
We're done.

21
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,666
It seems everyone's afraid of me,
which to me, sounds like their problem,

22
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,899
- but apparently not.
- The company is worried

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,104
that a decrease in morale
is hurting productivity.

24
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:11,698
We think it would help
if you softened your image a little,

25
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:15,218
compliment people, be more supportive.
If people feel appreciated,

26
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,450
they work harder.

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,743
I'm sure we're all gonna have
to make adjustments.

28
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:21,044
Not you.

29
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,253
Everyone likes me?

30
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:30,671
- You so desperately want to be loved.
- No, I don't.

31
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,480
Yes, I do.
I mean, who doesn't?

32
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:36,935
Mr. Crisp, you had
a near-unanimous rating of "excellent."

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,557
In fact, there were
even several write-ins of "adorable."

34
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,877
Brother.
Look out, Jesus.

35
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,663
Wait. "Near-unanimous"...

36
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:49,108
Does that mean a few less
than unanimous or a few more?

37
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,449
Really the only group
you didn't score well with

38
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,849
were men over 50
in lower management.

39
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:57,658
Too bad, Ted. Men over 50
in lower management loved me.

40
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,412
- No, they didn't.
- Shut up, you little bean counter.

41
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,831
I don't get it.
What did I do to men over 50?

42
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:06,528
You're young,
good-looking, successful.

43
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,586
Honestly,
they probably just resent you.

44
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,304
Maybe I'll just have
to make them get to know me.

45
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,424
I mean, my father's over 50,
and he...

46
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:15,872
Wait.

47
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:22,103
- You wanted to see me, boss?
- Yes, employee.

48
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:25,005
As part of an effort
to raise morale,

49
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,646
I've been told to find out
what would make our workers happy,

50
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,716
and I thought I'd ask you,
since you're the smartest,

51
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,589
most observant person
in the whole company.

52
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,821
Let me guess. You've also been told
to compliment people.

53
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,366
See how smart you are?

54
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:40,828
Thank you.

55
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,496
But what makes you think I know
how to make employees happy?

56
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,624
Because
you're the suggestion box lady.

57
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,001
They call like that you upstairs.

58
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:52,896
I've never put my name on any
of my helpful but ignored ideas.

59
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,342
- How do they know they're from me?
- Other people suggested

60
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,468
that you stop hogging
the suggestion box.

61
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,225
Sitting out there
in those identical cubicles,

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,187
people start to feel anonymous.
There's no sense of community.

63
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:10,648
Personally,
I've always felt disconnected,

64
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,342
like I'm just some faceless cog
in a giant,

65
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,735
dehumanizing machine.

66
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,821
Slow down, chairman mao.

67
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,323
I don't need a manifesto.

68
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,659
I need something
to make people happy.

69
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:27,107
The company could start
by letting us individualize our space,

70
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:30,167
you know, decorate our cubicles,
put up photos and artwork.

71
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,336
Really?
That's all it would take?

72
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,565
You drones are so easy.

73
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,008
That's not a compliment.

74
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:42,793
Good morning.

75
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:58,737
Rick, I think I've been replaced
by someone who likes cats.

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,992
My cubicle's been decorated
with space stuff.

77
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,953
It's a very aggressive move,
but by who?

78
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,018
Nice sweater, Lily.
I support your decision to wear it.

79
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,709
Hi, balding guy.

80
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,350
I love what you've done
with the hair you have left.

81
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,564
Hello, mob.
You look confused.

82
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,905
We were just wondering
about our new...

83
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,568
and lovely cubicles.

84
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,571
- Linda suggested...
- Great. I love where this is going.

85
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,870
That you all be allowed
to decorate your workplaces

86
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,703
to express your individuality.

87
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,981
The company thought
it would be too risky to just let

88
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,835
people do whatever
the hell they wanted,

89
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,285
they've expressed
your individuality for you

90
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,835
in four exciting
and inoffensive themes...

91
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:56,670
Green bay packers.

92
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,087
Cats.

93
00:04:58,974 --> 00:04:59,876
Space.

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,331
And classic cars.

95
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,957
Isn't that great?

96
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,597
Enjoy your new personalities.

97
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,177
Nice job, Linda.

98
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:14,731
I know!

99
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,122
Can you believe this place

100
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,845
and the things they do
to all of us sometimes?

101
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,045
<i>Teamwork... </i>

102
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,662
<i>It's a beautiful thing.</i>

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,499
<i>In business, it means working together
for a common goal.</i>

104
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,046
<i>X- rays show
that when people work together, </i>

105
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,458
<i>they're happier </i>

106
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,329
<i>and less likely
to do something weird...</i>

107
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,650
What about me screams
"cat lady" to you?

108
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,903
Maybe the way you pounce on a fella
who's just trying to get cup of coffee.

109
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,755
The company personalized my cubicle
with all the stupid cat stuff.

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,078
What are they trying to tell me,
that I'm gonna die old and alone,

111
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,622
with a hundred cats chewing
on my decomposing body?

112
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:17,875
If you fed the cats once in a while,
your story would have a happier ending.

113
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,480
Would you just say they're wrong
about me, please?

114
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:24,411
In spite of what my new poster says,
I'm having trouble hanging in there.

115
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,531
The company does all sorts
of crazy things.

116
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,845
That doesn't mean
we have to be crazy, too.

117
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,181
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go seduce a 55-year-old man.

118
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,854
Manny, right?
I'm Ted.

119
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,480
I know who you are.

120
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,941
I have always heard
so much about you.

121
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,860
You're practically
a legend in this place.

122
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,903
I can't believe it's the first time
we've met

123
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,198
It's not. We've worked together
on three projects before.

124
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:53,078
I meant the first time we've met,
outside of those three projects.

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,539
It's not.
What do you want, Ted?

126
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,083
I want to take you to lunch.

127
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,457
Screw that.
Just fire me now.

128
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,381
- I won't make a scene.
- No, it's not like that.

129
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,009
30 years I give to this company,

130
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,583
30 years, and this is how it ends.

131
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:13,057
A: inside voices,
and B: no one's firing you.

132
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,435
I just wanna get to know you
and you to know me.

133
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,688
You can bring some friends, if you like,
so they can, know me, too.

134
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,848
How about Bill and Jeremy?

135
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,726
Don't you have any friends who are,
you know, older?

136
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:33,699
Hey, guys.

137
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,955
I just want you both to know
that you're doing great work.

138
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:41,122
Your specs on the robotic
firefighting technology really...

139
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,045
blew my mind.

140
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,674
That's gotta feel good, right?
Boost your morale?

141
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:50,632
Thank you.

142
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:52,295
Thank you...

143
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,286
You're welcome.

144
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,046
And, Phil, I like that outfit.

145
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,019
That was incredible.

146
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,859
- I'm, like, tingly.
- Our specs weren't that great.

147
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,320
I reject her compliment.

148
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,782
- Then can I have your half?
- It doesn't mean anything.

149
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,536
She's only saying nice things because
the company ordered the executives

150
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,816
to boost our morale.

151
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,041
You shouldn't have any trouble
giving up your half.

152
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,214
I see the company
made you a cat person, 

153
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,591
The company can go lick its ass.

154
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm sorry.
I just don't see myself as a cat person.

155
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,553
 Neither did i,

156
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,639
but I realized
that we're cat people.

157
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,450
That's insane.

158
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:41,186
They're saying we're cats.

159
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
I don't mean actual cats.

160
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,939
They're saying we share
the same qualities.

161
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:50,921
Cats are quick, smart and independent,
just like you, me, Debbie and Bruce.

162
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:56,453
You think I'm quick,
smart and independent?

163
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,829
Everybody does.
We've all talked about it.

164
00:08:59,025 --> 00:08:59,973
Really?

165
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,888
I never thought of myself
in cat terms.

166
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,351
But I do like to think
I have those attributes.

167
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,629
Or should I say "cat-tributes"?

168
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,798
Cat-tributes...
Can I use that?

169
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:11,456
No, it's mine.

170
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,977
What's wrong with this picture?

171
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:26,190
Five steaks, one caesar salad,
low-fat dressing on the side.

172
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,939
I like a light lunch.

173
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,137
It keeps me sharp
for the rest of the day.

174
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,680
Look at Mr. Perfect,
Mr. Stays-awake-at-work.

175
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,035
You're so put together.
It's like you stepped out of a magazine.

176
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,813
Didn't you ever get a mustard stain
on your shirt or...

177
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,498
A hooker's vomit on your pants?

178
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:46,254
I did do one of those things
when I was 12, at a baseball game.

179
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:50,298
I won't tell you which one it is,
but it was the game of my life.

180
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,661
Look, fellas, I can have fun.

181
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:56,011
What are you drinking, iced Tea?

182
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,014
In our day, it was okay
to knock back a few at lunch.

183
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:04,937
I tell you what. I can go old-school.
Drinks all around.

184
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,076
And now, you can call me:
"Mr. Has-a-drink-at-lunch

185
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:11,443
But-let's-not-go-overboard
It's-still-a-work-day."

186
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,820
I know. It's long,
but it makes some good points.

187
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,806
Have you met Debbie, Bruce and Rita?
They're also cat people.

188
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,016
Sure, I've seen some of you around,

189
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,751
- but we've never actually met.
- Now we all have something in common.

190
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,966
Being surrounded by pictures of cats
has made me realize how much I want one.

191
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,885
I hate myself for being allergic.

192
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:41,845
Have you guys seen
that Youtube video

193
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,351
that Janet sent around,
with the cat that flushes the toilet?

194
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,395
I didn't get that.

195
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:49,524
It's really cute.
He thinks he's people.

196
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,023
It turned out
it wasn't the school's mascot.

197
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:58,365
It was just some random pig
I'd stolen.

198
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,494
This guy's hilarious.

199
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,328
And what an operator.

200
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,373
He comes back from lunch
with the hostess' phone number.

201
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,418
I am totally gonna make love to her.

202
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,760
You would have loved it
back in the old days, Teddy.

203
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:19,844
There was no such thing
as sexual harassment.

204
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:23,553
There was nothing sweeter than
telling some broad who wouldn't do ya

205
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:27,102
to clean out her desk,
put her crap in a box and go home.

206
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,473
Gee, that sounds great.

207
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:35,110
You be sure to tell everyone
in your age group how much fun you had.

208
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,237
Tomorrow'll be even better.

209
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:39,239
You are part of the group now.

210
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:43,425
- Tomorrow we're taking you to lunch.
- Bring some dollar bills and a lap.

211
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,000
I just made three new friends. Maybe
I was wrong about the cubicle themes.

212
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,624
For the first time since I'm here,

213
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,254
I feel like I'm part of something.

214
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,695
Glad to hear it.

215
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,759
I have to go to a strip club tomorrow
with a bunch of old men.

216
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,179
What theme did the company give you?

217
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,700
<i>Veronica and her hair
were working hard</i>

218
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,836
<i>on the company's campaign
to improve morale.</i>

219
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:16,556
<i>They both put on a good front,
but one of them was feeling frustrated</i>

220
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>and the other was feeling
dry and flaky.</i>

221
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,121
You wanted to see me?

222
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:25,619
We isolated rat r.n.a using t.r.i.
Would you like to see it?

223
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:28,315
Sure.

224
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:39,439
- That is very impressive. Nice work.
- Wait. Let me turn it on.

225
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,504
That is very impressive.

226
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:49,601
Nice work, thanks for calling me down
here to see it. Nice work on that, too.

227
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,201
I could listen to her praise me
all day.

228
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:56,682
It's not real.

229
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,350
Any grad student
can isolate rat r. n. a

230
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,277
And I looked at our average specs
from the other day.

231
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:05,367
I rejected her compliment then,
and I re-reject it now.

232
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,838
Excuse me. Some of us
aren't married to my wife.

233
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,663
I've gotta grab all the compliments.

234
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,872
I'm sorry, but when I hear
an undeserved compliment,

235
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,291
My ears want to throw up.

236
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,627
Your ears are always
throwing up about something.

237
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,379
I can't believe
you guys got me a kitten.

238
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,719
<i>Linda had finally found that sense
of community she'd been missing.</i>

239
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,432
Janet on the fourth floor
also a cat person was giving them away.

240
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,225
We thought you'd want one.

241
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,185
And they thought right,
didn't they, boots?

242
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:34,679
Sandals?

243
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,606
I should get away from footwear.

244
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,820
Stapler. Now I'm just looking
at things on my desk.

245
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:42,667
That's good.

246
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,737
It's great having a strong,
young friend around.

247
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:49,161
How do you know when your need
to be liked has become unhealthy?

248
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,171
Do me. Do me next.

249
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,074
Seriously, how do you know?

250
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,295
Because clearly,
I'm having trouble finding the line.

251
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,090
Hello, space people.

252
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,117
Is this space taken?

253
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,803
Houston, we have a problem.

254
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,514
I guess not.

255
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,225
Janet upstairs is giving away
the cutest kittens.

256
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,895
Have you guys seen them?

257
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,647
- Houston, we have a problem.
- What's that, joe?

258
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,816
It's just, we were talking
about space stuff.

259
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,923
It might be over your head
by 50 miles...

260
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,571
That's where space starts.

261
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,151
I know where space starts.
It's not like you're in a secret club.

262
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:29,772
Shut up.

263
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,605
Why are you sitting over here?

264
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,081
All of us cat people
have our own table.

265
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:37,161
I thought I'd mix it up a little,

266
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:40,045
see what the other groups are up to,
check out the final frontier.

267
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,925
I heard Pluto's not a planet anymore.
How do we feel about that, fellas?

268
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,445
- What?
- I thought we were friends.

269
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,768
You know, cats of a feather.

270
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:58,938
We are friends, but I also want
to be friends with other people.

271
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,358
Did you just say
"cats of a feather"?

272
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:05,134
If you were sitting at our table,
you would have seen the shirts

273
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,488
that bruce made for us.

274
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:10,388
It's just one lunch. I can't believe
you're making such a big deal.

275
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,535
I'm not.

276
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,145
But we gave you a cat.

277
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,790
A cat.

278
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,393
You're disgusting.

279
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,883
I haven't seen you here before.

280
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:30,470
Don't be silly. I'm down here
all the time. What's that smell?

281
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,057
It's my plate.
Yum!

282
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:38,274
The food here's not very good.
I like to say even the salt needs salt.

283
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,234
You're a very funny man.

284
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,023
You think?

285
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:46,018
In fact,
I think you're "Phil-arious."

286
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:50,198
My wife says I wouldn't know comedy
if it ripped my face off.

287
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,780
Good for you for having a wife.

288
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,640
What happened, Linda?

289
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:10,917
It looks like the cats abandoned you
like you abandoned them.

290
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,095
They abandoned you.

291
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,113
I hope they didn't leave you

292
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,115
any little gifts
on the seat of your car.

293
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,727
My car's in the shop.

294
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:21,855
I didn't drive today.

295
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,469
That's right. You better run.
I'm gonna mess you up.

296
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,374
- Join us.
- Guys, what's going on?

297
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,744
I was hoping foreplay.

298
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,923
All right, this party is over.

299
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,509
Don't be that guy,

300
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:53,970
that uptight guy
we thought you were.

301
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,972
You know what?
I am that guy.

302
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:58,552
The guy you want me
to be gets taken advantage of,

303
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:02,354
so I'm this guy, and this guy
wants all of you out of my office.

304
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,108
And why is that sticky?

305
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:23,306
Where's the frakking aspirin?
There it is.

306
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,146
Good job, cabinet.

307
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,342
God. I must stop.

308
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,928
This will kill everything, right?

309
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,153
That's why we weren't allowed
to sell it.

310
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,423
I'm losing my mind.

311
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,895
I just saw Bob Gershon's butt.

312
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,810
I think it touched my desk.

313
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,418
I've been saying
so many nice things to people

314
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,276
I've started making words up.
This morning, I called Phil

315
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,816
"magniflorious."

316
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,236
About Phil.
He's falling in love with you.

317
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,197
And if that doesn't sound "horrifliffic"
I don't know what does.

318
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,534
God.
See, that's why I keep my hair up.

319
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,205
It creates a distance,
an unapproachability.

320
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:01,579
I miss that me.

321
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,370
I don't know who I am anymore.

322
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,269
You know who you are?

323
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:09,862
You are a great boss
who gets things done.

324
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:12,376
- That should be all that matters.
- Thank you.

325
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:15,551
And you shouldn't be wiping wrinkly
butt prints off your desk.

326
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,603
I know. I shouldn't care
what men over 50 think about me,

327
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,557
except my father,
and that ship has sailed.

328
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,599
You're right.

329
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,185
About my father?
Did he say something to you?

330
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,646
I'm talking about here.

331
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,480
You can't win with some
of them anyway.

332
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:30,504
I found cat feces in my car.

333
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,364
Speaking of cat-related vandalism...

334
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,581
What are you doing?

335
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,210
Clearly, I'm losing my mind.

336
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,779
I thought decorating the cubicles
would create

337
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:53,720
this great sense of community.

338
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:56,843
But you can't base a community
on made-up personalities.

339
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,595
That's like high school,

340
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,765
only no one's on drugs
and everyone's trying to get pregnant.

341
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:04,267
The druggie teen slut is right.

342
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,187
I said you were right.

343
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,732
- It's time to end this madness.
- Agreed.

344
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,900
Drones...

345
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,703
Can I have your attention?

346
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,376
Something tells me
I should have known you in high school.

347
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,707
I actually went to an all-girls school
and was totally straight.

348
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,566
But I'm very trampy now.

349
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:27,164
Recently,
we've tried doing things a little...

350
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:32,653
I have never seen you this excited
about schematics before.

351
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:35,452
Now that I've redone them,
I think they're some of my best work.

352
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:38,204
I finally have something worthy
of Veronica's praise.

353
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,392
And since, unlike you,
I've earned this moment,

354
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,322
I'm going to enjoy it.

355
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,554
And while it may have been
a worthy experiment,

356
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,063
it is now over.

357
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:53,107
And so from now on,
there will be no more praise.

358
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:56,449
And I will no longer
be complimenting any of you...

359
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,319
Damn it!

360
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:03,660
Unless it is truly your best work.

361
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:06,805
Damn it!

362
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,457
And the next time some survey asks
how happy you are,

363
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,198
you check "very,"

364
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:14,921
or I'll give you something
to be happy about.

365
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,593
- I'm not sure that makes any...
- The hair is up. That's all they hear.

366
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,481
And so things got back to normal.

367
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,062
I think we need to talk.

368
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,858
- Sweet.
- Look, you are a very nice man...

369
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,277
I like hearing that.

370
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:41,197
That is, I like you as afriend.

371
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,895
Step one... check.

372
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,910
Nothing is ever gonna happen
with us.

373
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,900
I see.

374
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,819
And now I must get out
of the room as quickly as possible.

375
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,452
Wait.

376
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:57,060
Another time, another place,

377
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:00,385
two other people...
It could've been magniflorious.

378
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,719
You mean that?

379
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,910
I do,

380
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,806
especially the part about
two other people.

381
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:14,874
<i>And things got back to normal
for Linda, too,</i>

382
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:18,818
<i>although she did get that sense
of community she was looking for.</i>

383
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:21,296
<i>Unfortunately,
it was centered around blaming her</i>

384
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:23,488
<i>for getting things back to normal.</i>

385
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,525
And as for me,

386
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,839
I kinda like the idea of not caring
what people think of me.

387
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,339
Go to hell, Ted.
Will do.
