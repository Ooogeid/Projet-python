00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,626
<i>Sometimes when you're working on an
important project with a hard deadline,</i>

4
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,290
<i>you put in a lot of late nights.</i>

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,093
Are you sure you don't want me
to have Lucinda come pick you up?

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,652
She wouldn't mind eating all my bars
while you sleep,

7
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:16,182
and then hiding the wrappers
from Mr. Ted.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,517
- I want to stay here with you.
- Good.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,150
Good night.

10
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:28,998
We did it, Ted.

11
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:32,156
{\pos(192,220)}We now have a working prototype
for the Veridian sleep system.

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,024
{\pos(192,220)}All the hard work, late nights
and no rest have paid off.

13
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,334
We've cured sleeplessness

14
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,119
and demonstrated irony.

15
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:41,999
That's great, because the relaxation
convention's only a week away.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,616
I know. It's so exciting.

17
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,642
We heard a commercial for it
this morning.

18
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,099
"Relaxxxacon!

19
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:50,800
"The world's largest gathering
of relaxation technology."

20
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,166
"72 hours of nonstop, in-your-face,
cutting-edge relaxation."

21
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,396
"Sammy Hagar! Alice Cooper!
And the navy's blue angels!"

22
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:03,521
We're a little loopy
due to the exhaustion.

23
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,982
Behold.

24
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:08,758
Inside this box is a transmitter

25
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:11,780
which will induce the human brain
to emit alpha waves,

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,556
gently lulling it
into a restful sleep.

27
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,102
That sounds means it's working.

28
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:23,288
If you can put up
with it for three minutes,

29
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,307
hello, dreamland!

30
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,378
Turn it off!
Just turn it off!

31
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,089
I have a note.

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,685
It's the sound, right?

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,551
- It's too loud, correct?
- You've got a few days to crack this.

34
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,080
Otherwise, we are not
gonna make this year's.

35
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,562
Relaxxxacon!

36
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:42,059
The extra "x" is for more z's.

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,228
That is fun.

38
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,726
- One more week. How you holding up?
- I'm a little tired,

39
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,850
and working these hours
is making everyone unhappy.

40
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:55,364
Bob stole Amy's danish.

41
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:58,625
She got so mad, she stapled
his lip to his cubicle.

42
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,412
He tried to call for help,
but it came out "helf."

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,890
It was actually horrifying.

44
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:07,462
They had to call an ambulance.

45
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,004
This is bitter.

46
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,631
God, you idiot!

47
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,092
Jenkins, I'm so tired,
I thought you were a sink.

48
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,646
I'm so tired, I thought
you were my mouth.

49
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,556
- Morale does seem pretty low.
- It's like that time

50
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,810
they paid our holiday bonuses
in frozen food.

51
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,064
Potpie Christmas. It did not help
that they made them with real reindeer.

52
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,213
We have a morale problem.

53
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,336
You're always coming to me
with a problem.

54
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:36,176
Just once I wish you'd greet me
with a sparkler and cotton candy

55
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,616
and tell me I have
the number one album in America.

56
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,942
You handed out
"Veronica in the key of love",

57
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,655
and no one threw it back at you.
Consider that a victory.

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,826
Listen,
this deadline is coming up fast,

59
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,417
we've gotta do something
to keep them motivated.

60
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:51,004
If there's a morale problem,
the company recommends

61
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,839
you take the hardest-working
employee and fire them.

62
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,842
That'll scare the rest of the peasants
back into the fields.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,921
What if,
instead of scaring employees,

64
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,098
we single out the hardest working ones
and reward them with something fun?

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,935
Less Stephen King,
more Stephen... The Clown.

66
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,231
I couldn't think of a fun Stephen.
Segal. No, that one's no good either.

67
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,208
Fine. The workers pushed the button
and lit up the light.

68
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,152
They can have their monkey chow.

69
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:22,952
Now you've all been working
really hard this week,

70
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,604
but no one harder than Jenkins.

71
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,706
He was here when I left last night,
and was here before me.

72
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:31,043
If I had known this,
I wouldn't have thrown my coffee at him.

73
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,690
You should never
throw your coffee at anyone,

74
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,386
because you never know
if they're going to become a great man.

75
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,472
I threw coffee at a cardinal
on a plane. Now he's the pope.

76
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:42,763
Back then he was just a guy
in a big hat blocking the movie.

77
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,231
All right, guys.

78
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:48,060
<i>For he's a jolly good...</i>

79
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,154
Okay, I was wrong.
It's more than a morale problem.

80
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,071
- We worked a man to death.
- I heard about Jenkins' death.

81
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:03,909
The company feels terrible about it.

82
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,704
People are working too hard.
We need to slow down.

83
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,802
Legal's position is, we don't know
if hard work killed Jenkins.

84
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,702
But he may have had
high cholesterol.

85
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:15,406
And also that idea that his being dead
may have been a preexisting condition,

86
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,696
and that he may not have been alive
when we hired him.

87
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,426
Apparently he was pretty quiet
in his job interview.

88
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,906
We need to get back
to a normal work schedule,

89
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:25,347
even if that means we don't make
the Relaxxxacon deadline.

90
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,272
We can introduce our sleep system
next month at the Snooze-a-Palooza

91
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,587
or in July
at the Texas pillow and gun show.

92
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,954
Look, they're giving everyone
an afternoon off.

93
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,844
And we're throwing the guy
a big memorial,

94
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,443
something nice he would never have
treated himself to.

95
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,945
- So that's it? A half a day off?
- Sorry, Ted.

96
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,836
The company feels that if we ease up
just because someone died,

97
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,159
it will only encourage
other people to die.

98
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,954
If it's one thing this company
understands, it's how human beings work.

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,419
You better not let Ted see you
looting Jenkins' things.

100
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,598
Ted asked me to clean out Jenkins' desk
so we can ship it all to Florida.

101
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,805
I think Jenkins has family there.

102
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,596
Either that or Florida has a shortage of
miniature mouthwash and cartoons.

103
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,738
This cartoon resonates
with my own experience of office life,

104
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,270
but through a comical lens.

105
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,264
God. You're here one minute,
and then... poof.

106
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,634
You've exhaled your last minty fresh
breath and died in your office,

107
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,569
cakeless.

108
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,522
That's why it's important to always
appreciate the moment you're in,

109
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,950
because the future is a cake
which may never come.

110
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,009
Look how profound
this moment just got.

111
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:32,831
Let it wash over you, Linda,
because now it's gone.

112
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,866
Did you appreciate it?
I did,

113
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,391
because I always live
in the present.

114
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,924
This is a good moment, too.

115
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,727
Savor it. I am.

116
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,300
And now it's gone.

117
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:46,428
I wish I could live
completely in the present.

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,056
That's something about me
I've always wanted to work on.

119
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,715
Maybe I'll attack it this summer.

120
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,590
No, I was gonna do some traveling,
maybe go to Europe.

121
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,622
Also, I want to go up in a blimp...

122
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,233
God! My eyes.
What the hell?

123
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,504
I was helping you
to live in this moment.

124
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,748
It hurts!

125
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,321
Exactly. You're in pain,

126
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,586
and so you're completely
in the present.

127
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,660
When you're in there,
you're living your life.

128
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,204
You're not caught up in what
could have been or what might be.

129
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:13,861
That makes sense.

130
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,583
And so the student
becomes the master.

131
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,546
I'm in this moment.

132
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,881
Excellent. Now quick,
look at the Dilbert cartoon.

133
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,092
It's fun now.

134
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,596
Because you're giving it
your complete focus.

135
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,671
Now let's go listen to my CD.

136
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,779
It'll blow your mind.

137
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:36,404
<i>Since the company wouldn't ease up on
the schedule, I'd use the memorial</i>

138
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,930
<i>to encourage everyone
to take better care of themselves.</i>

139
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:42,036
You know what I remember about Jenkins?
He used to be alive.

140
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,695
So pace yourself, know your limits,

141
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,013
and if you feel yourself dying...

142
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:49,116
tell your supervisor.

143
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,525
I can't believe Ted's making me
speak at this thing.

144
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,165
- You knew Jenkins better than anybody.
- I didn't know him.

145
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,540
Nobody did.
All I did was throw coffee at him.

146
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,190
Things were not always smooth
between the two of you,

147
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:01,965
but in the end,
you understood each other.

148
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,783
Chest bump for good luck?

149
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:06,383
Now I'd like to ask Lem Hewitt
to say a few words.

150
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,975
These sugar cookies are great.

151
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,098
I'll have 'em at my memorial.

152
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,558
I love sugar cookies.

153
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,875
When I was a kid, my mom
used to make them.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,970
But instead of sugar,
she'd use Brandy.

155
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:22,441
And instead of dipping them in milk,
she'd dip them in Brandy...

156
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,567
What's going on?

157
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,403
My mind was drifting,
I'm trying to stay in the moment.

158
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,879
Now I know what a beard
of fingers would feel like.

159
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:31,658
It's just as I had imagined.

160
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,439
Gordon Jenkins was a good man.

161
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:35,311
But he was also a complex man.

162
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,414
For example, he liked coffee,

163
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,750
but he didn't like having
coffee thrown at him.

164
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:43,430
In fact, Jenkins hated being
burned by any hot liquid.

165
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:46,061
In that way, he was like many of us,

166
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:47,758
sensitive to heat.

167
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:50,135
What a character.
Goodbye, Jenkins.

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,309
I hope you're throwing
coffee at God right now.

169
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,881
Nice work. Goose bumps.

170
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,772
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

171
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,441
- Are you sure that's right?
- That's fine.

172
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,370
Was a man who loved his work.

173
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,704
He lived for it,

174
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,993
and in all but the
legally culpable sense,

175
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:21,417
he died for it.

176
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,878
And so we must ask ourselves,
how do honor this great man?

177
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,132
By giving up on the project
he held so dear?

178
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,970
I said, by giving up
on the project he held so dear?

179
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,602
By quitting on him
and his dream of creating

180
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:39,226
the most advanced sleep
system in human history?

181
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:41,814
Or by finishing the job

182
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,314
Carl Gordon Jenkins
Gordon Jenkins started

183
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,692
so that his death
will not be in vain?

184
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,696
By working day and night
to meet our deadline

185
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,865
and storm the walls of relaxation.

186
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,215
My friends, we will complete
this project on time,

187
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,455
and we will do it for Jenkins!

188
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,707
- For Jenkins
- I can't hear you.

189
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,251
- For Jenkins!
- Avenge him!

190
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,836
Who do we kill?!

191
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,213
Insomnia, and who do we kill it for?

192
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,767
- Jenkins!
- You're damn right.

193
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:13,244
Now let's go upstairs
and get back to work,

194
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,046
for tonight, we dine in hell!

195
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,073
Sorry, Ted.

196
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:30,110
The company didn't think
sad was the way to go.

197
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:36,129
<i>Veronica's speech inspired people
to work even harder.</i>

198
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,360
<i>The company liked what it saw,
so the next day,</i>

199
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,736
it shifted the Jenkins mobile
into turbo drive.</i>

200
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,805
After day care,

201
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,555
- I'll sleep in your office again?
- Look at you, saying "get to"

202
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,297
to make me feel better.

203
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,211
Honey, I know my being busy is hard,

204
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:51,465
- but it's just for a few more days.
- At least your couch is comfortable.

205
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,640
So we're doing posters now?

206
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,425
The company got us these
to remind us what we're working for.

207
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,455
Plus, they got us these neat little
rubber wristbands for free.

208
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,830
It says, "Work strong for Jenkins."

209
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,569
The company is exploiting Jenkins' death
to make people work harder.

210
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,864
The company said that Jenkins said
that some people would say that.

211
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,784
I just can't believe
it's one of the finders.

212
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,202
The finders?

213
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,725
One of the eight people
who found his body.

214
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,645
Lem!
Wake up!

215
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,407
The cool accountants
are on their way down.

216
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,803
- Damn it. And the lab is such a mess.
- Perry and Todd and beaver?

217
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,596
Why are they coming down here?

218
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,682
Stop questioning me.
Help clean this place up.

219
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,522
- Clean lab, bro.
- Yeah, whatever.

220
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:51,316
So you were friends with Jenkins?

221
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:52,431
Me?

222
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,279
We were pretty tight. Sure.

223
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:56,678
That's sick.

224
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,657
What was he really like?

225
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,215
He had a huge heart.

226
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,252
I remember him saying once,

227
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:07,499
"Lem, you are my best
friend, and if I should die,

228
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:10,392
"at least I'll die knowing
one really cool guy.

229
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:13,297
"You, Lem, the cool guy
I'm referring to."

230
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,423
Nice.

231
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,575
We're gonna step outside
to take a cigarette break.

232
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,454
- Do you want to come?
- I don't smoke,

233
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,931
- but I'd love to watch you guys smoke.
- Me, too.

234
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,601
Then it's settled. We all get
to hang out with you guys.

235
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,819
Oh, sorry, odd lab dude.

236
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,838
The smoking area's kinda small.

237
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:34,192
Well, isn't it all of the outdoors?

238
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,947
For the love of God,
please don't ruin this for me.

239
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,422
Linda, I need your testing report
on the sleep system packaging.

240
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:45,767
Marketing keeps...

241
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,706
I'm going to count to one.

242
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,459
Sorry.
It helps me stay in the moment.

243
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,052
If they don't hold
your attention, look deeper

244
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,880
until you find what's interesting.

245
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,650
Like right now, I'm losing
interest in this moment.

246
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:59,676
And so I'm going to...

247
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,637
Sweep the leg.

248
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,576
That's what this moment needed.

249
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:11,396
The company's exploiting Jenkins
to get people to work harder.

250
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,131
There's posters and bracelets.
There's an inspirational video

251
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:15,486
about him playing.

252
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:19,479
I got them to use one of the songs from
"Veronica in the key of love."

253
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,120
<i>The settlers crossing the prairie.</i>

254
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:30,021
<i>Jonas Salk discovering
the polio vaccine</i>

255
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,821
<i>Gordon Jenkins writing
the table of contents</i>

256
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,879
<i>for the Veridian
sleep system manual.</i>

257
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,340
<i>Great achievements take hard work.</i>

258
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,937
<i>Shouldn't you try to be
more like Gordon Jenkins?</i>

259
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:44,102
<i>Yes, you should.</i>

260
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,102
It was the best elevator video since
the soft-core porn one about recycling.

261
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,005
But if the company keeps
using Jenkins to rev people up,

262
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,856
someone else'll get hurt or dead.

263
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,068
It's just for a few more
days until relaxation,

264
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,252
and then the Jenkins thing will end.

265
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,199
Because knowing how much
this company loves productivity,

266
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,574
14-hour days'll become
the new normal.

267
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,452
- The Jenkins thing will end.
- And so will the 14-hour days.

268
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,580
- The Jenkins thing will end.
- Veronica, the 14-hour days?

269
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,555
Jenkins, goodbye. Adios, Jenkins.

270
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,529
- Jenkins no more.
- You gotta be kidding me.

271
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,734
So they really are gonna
make this permanent?

272
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:20,678
None of us'll see
our families again. And I like Rose.

273
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,727
I wasn't entirely sold
in the first six months,

274
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,177
but I'm way into her.

275
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,377
I'm gonna go tell everyone
in this department

276
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:30,100
- and they are not gonna stand for it.
- Ted, you adorable little flower.

277
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:33,520
They'll quit? If they do,
the company will just replace them.

278
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,676
Then I go upstairs
and convince management

279
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,357
that what they're doing is immoral.

280
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,571
I'm glad I tried that one
out on you before going up there.

281
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,591
Ted, no one knows
how many licks it takes

282
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,635
to get to my moral center,

283
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,745
but I can see how this is important
to you, so here's the deal...

284
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,395
if you want to get the company
off this, you have to show them

285
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,333
that this pace'll cost them money,

286
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,210
'cause the company loves its money.

287
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,422
If they could, they'd go to strip clubs
and throw naked women at money.

288
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,832
So Jenkins hooks this 6-foot trout,

289
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:07,057
and it's freaking out,
flopping around the boat.

290
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:10,031
And Jenkins hated the sight of blood
because of his time in the Mossad.

291
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:12,731
So I had to reach past
those razor-sharp teeth

292
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,696
and pull the hook out for him.

293
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,568
We hugged and wept,

294
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,772
and Jenkins said to me, "Lem,

295
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,945
"you... are my best friend."

296
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,867
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Oh, sure.

297
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,706
That was our fishing story

298
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,794
but it was you who were flopping around,
and I was the one who took it out,

299
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,922
and there was no fish because
it happened at a sporting goods store.

300
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:45,801
- And it is my wife who was in Mossad.
- Phil, the cool accountants like me.

301
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,960
They let me go buy them cigarettes.

302
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,807
And I need more Jenkins stories
than that coffee spilling one.

303
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,309
I feel like Jenkins is replacing me.

304
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:56,471
That's ridiculous.

305
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,480
Let's have lunch later,
just you and me.

306
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,775
It's broasting chicken day
in the cafeteria.

307
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,452
It'll give us another chance
to figure out what broasting is.

308
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:07,686
I do want to get
to the bottom of that.

309
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:08,865
We'll have lunch.

310
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,661
I just hope "broasting" is not a typo,
like that butter crotch pudding.

311
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,875
So I've been trying to live in
the moment, but it's really hard

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,373
because a lot of my moments
aren't that interesting.

313
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,879
So I was wondering...
do you want to have sex right now?

314
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,007
That feels really right,
but I'm in the middle of something.

315
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:29,319
In fact, you can help me.
I need to sabotage the sleep system

316
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,471
and make sure it's not finished
{\in time}for Relaxxxacon.

317
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,493
Cool. That's not sex but it beats
getting knocked to the floor so hard,

318
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:37,477
you want to go back to Wisconsin and
get your master's in cheese sciences.

319
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:38,833
Yes, it does.

320
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,788
I need to show that overworking people
will make them so tired,

321
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:44,276
they'll make mistakes,
and that will cost the company money.

322
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,785
Yeah. This could be a great moment.

323
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,947
We'll go to the basement
and get a fire hose.

324
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,449
Then we get ten pies,
a ramp and a motorcycle...

325
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,703
All I need is your computer. You have
access to the shipping database.

326
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,914
And I need to cancel an order of parts
for the sleep system prototype.

327
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,726
And you want to use my computer
so you don't get in trouble.

328
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:01,918
Nice try, crisp.

329
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,286
Sweep the leg.

330
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,766
You're not gonna get in trouble.

331
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,886
It'll just look like an anonymous worker
making a sleepy mistake.

332
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Fine.

333
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,012
Lem, I talked to the chef, it turns out
that broasting is a combination of,

334
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:23,148
and I'm quoting, "roasting
and get the hell out of my kitchen."

335
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,941
He wouldn't tell me the proportions.

336
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,068
Who's in the urn?

337
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,488
It's him, isn't it?

338
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,486
Jenkins has no family out here,

339
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,243
so the company asked me
to pick up his ashes.

340
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,121
I see.
Well, you two enjoy your lunch.

341
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,041
What was I supposed to do,

342
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,043
leave him in a car?
It's a hot day.

343
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,628
He's already ashes.

344
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,881
I know you don't like him,
but he is my friend now.

345
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,634
So why don't you come
join us for lunch?

346
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,886
I'm sure the three of us
can work this out.

347
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,143
Or...

348
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,473
why don't I do this?!

349
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,572
You two are jerks.

350
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:23,358
It is 8:00 PM and the shipment of parts
for the sleep system never got here.

351
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:26,101
Now we won't make our deadline,
and the company will learn

352
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:28,758
that pushing people too hard
leads to mistakes.

353
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,498
How do I feel about that?

354
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:44,813
The parts shipment {\for the prototype }didn't arrive.
We'll never be ready in time{\ for Relaxxxacon}.

355
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,523
Where's your Jenkins now?

356
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,155
They didn't come?
This is terrible. What are we gonna do,

357
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,236
go home to our families?
Okay.

358
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,942
Can I have everyone's attention,
please?

359
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,616
We are all disappointed
we're not gonna make the deadline.

360
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,451
Now Jenkins' soul is going to hell!

361
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,038
No, Sheila.
That's just something the elevator said.

362
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,250
When we push ourselves too hard,
mistakes get made.

363
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:08,420
- And now there's no possible way...
- I've got the parts!

364
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,552
No way.

365
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:12,757
They didn't come 'coz someone was tired
so the company can't work us so hard.

366
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,844
Last night, I was so sleepy,
I accidentally opened the database,

367
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,847
and I saw
someone had canceled the order.

368
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,106
So I drove all night to Stockton,

369
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,593
brought the order back.
I've been driving for 20 straight hours.

370
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:25,270
I took everything.
Watch how fast I can run.

371
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,315
Now we can go back to work.
For Jenkins!

372
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,109
- For Jenkins!
- No, wait!

373
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,070
The company is using Jenkins
to get you all to work harder.

374
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,360
But the thing is,
it's not gonna be just for this project.

375
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,911
The company wants to make
these crazy hours the new normal.

376
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,913
But we can't work this way forever.

377
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,666
No, we can't.
So I'm going back to my old schedule.

378
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,670
I don't care what they do to me. I'm
taking my daughter and I'm going home.

379
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,327
So we weren't working
this hard for Jenkins?

380
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,091
We were doing it all
for the company?

381
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,802
But Jenkins was still
a great man, right?

382
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,889
You were with him when he helped
that killer whale find its way home.

383
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:03,057
I had not heard that one.

384
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:05,990
Was that an embellishment of the time
I helped that large woman

385
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,772
with the hole in the top of her head
find her way back to her apartment?

386
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,524
Actually, I stole
that story from "Free Willy."

387
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,112
I've been using Jenkins for my own gain,
just like the company.

388
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,366
All those stories I told about Jenkins
were really just things I did with Phil.

389
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:24,487
Phil is the great man
and Phil is my best friend.

390
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,414
Who's Phil?

391
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:34,047
- Where are you going?
- I've had it. I'm going home.

392
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,872
But it's still dark out.

393
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:50,494
I have to pee.

394
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,792
Can it wait?
We're kinda having a moment here.

395
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,017
Nope. Sorry.

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
Hold the door!

397
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:29,074
- I'm going with you.
- You're supporting me on this?

398
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,201
Oh, no. I just have a dinner date.

399
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:40,655
All my stuff's still here. They didn't
spring the trap door on me in the lobby.

400
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,116
So I guess I haven't been fired.

401
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:44,659
Nope. We won.

402
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,925
Apparently after we stormed out
last night,

403
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,247
{\pos(192,220)}the whole department
filed out behind us.

404
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,083
{\pos(192,220)}So the company backed down
on the new hours?

405
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,169
{\pos(192,220)}I... we did it,

406
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,909
{\pos(192,220)}because I/we stood up
for what was right.

407
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,045
{\pos(192,220)}I/we am proud of me/us.

408
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:00,963
{\pos(192,220)}I/me, too, Ted.

409
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,178
{\pos(192,220)}Together, we're like Gandhi.

410
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,323
{\pos(192,220)}I'm skinny, and you're tan.
