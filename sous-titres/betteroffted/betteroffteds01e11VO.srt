<font size="22">CREAM TEAM

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:05,502
Veronica, quick question.

3
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:08,316
What is it with everyone
and their questions this morning?

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,333
"Where'd you learn to drive?
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,505
Why would you say that to my baby?"

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,570
Rose is running
for third grade class president.

7
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,630
I had some of the guys
in the print shop

8
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,507
whip up these campaign posters.

9
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:21,113
What do you think...
Too much, not enough?

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,062
You don't have to go through all this.
Say the word, and the election's hers.

11
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:28,861
We did it for Iceland,
and we can do it for your kid.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,387
Flowers.

13
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:35,449
Look at you, having a girlie moment.

14
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,453
- Crap on a cracker!
- And she's back.

15
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:39,842
They're from my stinking father.

16
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,750
I need status reports on every product
we have in the pipeline.

17
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,513
I should explain.

18
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,555
Veronica and her dad
don't have what you'd call

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,631
a traditional
father-daughter relationship.

20
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:51,264
<i>Veronica's father
is Elijah Palmer...</i>

21
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:54,828
<i>C.E.O. of Digivation industries.
One of our company's main rivals.</i>

22
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,055
Digivation industries
has long been working

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,516
to develop a new,
more powerful battery,

24
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,936
one that could last
up to seven years...

25
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,979
<i>Veronica and her dad
are both extremely competitive</i>

26
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:07,858
<i>and have a history of stealing products
from each other's companies.</i>

27
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,404
And so I am proud
to stand here today

28
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,822
and present to you...

29
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,523
Absolutely nothing.
Thank you all for coming.

30
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,552
<i>It's a little cat-and-mouse game
they play</i>

31
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:26,752
<i>instead of having a normal,
healthy relationship.</i>

32
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,672
Hovershoes. Brilliant.

33
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,216
You better take a look at this.

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,765
And every time one of them
steals an idea from the other,

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,070
the winner sends the loser
a thank-you present.

36
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,806
Did you guys hear?

37
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:59,410
Digivation is coming out with
a new weight loss toothpaste.

38
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,536
Damn it.

39
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,764
Aren't we developing
something like that?

40
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,165
Flowers.

41
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,884
They really steal
product ideas from each other?

42
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,471
That's a whole new kind of crazy.

43
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,379
Well, it's a little strange,
but I'm the last one to judge.

44
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,007
My father and I hardly speak.

45
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:14,616
We are like oil and...

46
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:16,702
What's that thing that's
always disappointing oil?

47
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:17,970
Oh, yeah. It's me.

48
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,804
My dad and I
totally love each other.

49
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,971
I'm sorry. Does your obvious pain
make that an insensitive thing to say?

50
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,993
No, I am totally fine with the fact
that nothing I've ever done or will do

51
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,440
could ever please my father

52
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,745
or make up for the fact
that I didn't become the plumber

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,778
he so desperately wanted me to be.

54
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,321
I talk to my dad every week.

55
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,822
Usually my mom takes the phone,

56
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,368
but that's okay, 'cause I love her, too.
Sometimes grandma picks up the phone...

57
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:42,536
That's fantastic.

58
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,913
There's a whole lot of love
in your family and none in mine.

59
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,324
- Get a "family of the year" award.
- Do they have one of those?

60
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,002
Because we wouldtotally kick ass.

61
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,510
I just talked to Linda about her father.
Man, I am never doing that again.

62
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,054
I have the best dad.

63
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,177
All he ever wanted was for me
to have a better life than him.

64
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,852
- So what's your deal?
- Oh, my dad died when I was 3.

65
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,897
So he may have been a horrible man.

66
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,067
A horrible man who died
saving 30 people from a burning bus.

67
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,319
The newspaper said
his last words were

68
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:18,524
he loved me more than all the stars
in the universe. Now I'm a scientist,

69
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,828
I know that meant his love
was infinite and ever-expanding.

70
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,078
My father once got kicked out of a zoo
for giving a monkey a cigarette.

71
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,581
So what's the latest
on the wrinkle cream?

72
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,184
- It's a disaster.
- A debacle.

73
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,475
- A disastacle.
- The synthetic skin grafts

74
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,288
show no increase
in suppleness or elasticity.

75
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,990
All that's happening is,
they're growing thick strands of hair.

76
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:40,353
It's like my aunt's chin
before she plucks it for church.

77
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:42,532
- This happens every time?
- Yes. We failed you.

78
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,723
- Stop screaming at us.
- Guys, you didn't fail.

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,301
You're growing hair.

80
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,231
This is the... the holy grail
of research and development.

81
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,051
Every R&D department in the country
is looking for this.

82
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:54,024
This discovery
could make us legends.

83
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,292
- I love when Ted's happy.
- Me, too.

84
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,356
I know the song
we should sing when he leaves.

85
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,531
We're making Ted happy,
and we're going to go down in history.

86
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,675
God, my dad is gonna be so proud.

87
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,537
I'll draw up the proposal
and get the paperwork in.

88
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,205
If all goes well, we can
start work on this by next fall.

89
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,625
Next fall?
No, we can't wait that long.

90
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:14,211
- We gotta keep moving.
- But what about protocol?

91
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,874
Forget protocol.
Did Einstein stop to fill out paperwork

92
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,827
before discovering
his theory of relativity?

93
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:22,595
Actually, he was a patent clerk,
so all he did was fill out paperwork.

94
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,055
Guys, keep going.

95
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,186
If this is successful,
we could do to the comb-over

96
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:29,014
what Einstein did to...
Newtonian physics.

97
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,240
See?

98
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:33,814
I know things about stuff.

99
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,565
Honey, so they just introduced you.
You walk to the front of the class.

100
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,689
You're projecting the strength and
leadership of a future class president.

101
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,034
You have smartly peed beforehand
so you're not all squirmy.

102
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,947
Dad, can I just say my speech
while I'm still in the third grade?

103
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,872
Yes, sorry. Go ahead.

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,499
Hi, I'm Rose. Vote for me.

105
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,209
Please.

106
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,427
Thank you. You're welcome.

107
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:01,444
And the crowd goes wild!

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,010
That was great.

109
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,527
The only thing the class president does
is go to student council meetings

110
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:07,806
and feed the gerbil.

111
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:09,641
I don't even know if I want to win.

112
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,393
The gerbil's kind of a jerk.

113
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,011
Of course you want to win, honey.
You're just nervous.

114
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,606
But you are gonna be great.

115
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:18,799
I'm gonna go take a bath,
maybe color a little.

116
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,477
You know, unwind.

117
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,860
I always encourage rose to dream big

118
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,149
because the only thing my father
ever encouraged me to do

119
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,619
was be a plumber like him.

120
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,664
You biked all the way down here

121
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,693
just to tell me you want
to go to space camp?

122
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,765
Come on.
Try living here on earth

123
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,335
with the rest of us, Teddy.

124
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,692
<i>While I was trying to be a good dad,</i>

125
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>Veronica's dad
had gotten under her skin.</i>

126
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,230
<i>So she called the guys
from corporate intelligence</i>

127
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,069
<i>to help her get
some daughterly payback.</i>

128
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,882
Nobody steals my weight loss toothpaste
and gets away with it.

129
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:49,882
I want to bring him to his knees.

130
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,685
No, I want to steal his knees.
Can we do that?

131
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,292
Well, joint-stealing technology
is still years away,

132
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,010
but our inside guy at Digivation

133
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:59,191
did give us a lead on
one of their hottest projects.

134
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,233
Marine mammal communication.

135
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,654
Lets you talk to whales.
The device...

136
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,239
- Doesn't work.
- Dad.

137
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,262
Or rather it does work,
but it's useless.

138
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,403
Whales are shallow twits.
All they do is gossip and spread rumors.

139
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,771
- It's like talking to teenage girls.
- Well, you'd know all about that.

140
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,773
- Gentlemen, please excuse us.
- Yes, off you go, fellas.

141
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,574
There's a large woman on the 4th floor
with one of our listening devices

142
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,244
embedded in her derriere.
See if you can sniff it out.

143
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,703
So... obviously that whale thing
is a winner,

144
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,593
or you wouldn't be telling me
it's a loser.

145
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,346
Unless I'm pretending it's a loser
to make you think it's a winner.

146
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,328
Or I'm pretending to think it's a winner
when I actually know it's a loser

147
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,270
because you said it was a loser
to make me think it's a winner.

148
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,188
The student becomes the master.

149
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,183
Or the student has always
been the master,

150
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,793
but wanted the master to think
the master was the master

151
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,903
when he was actually
just the student.

152
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,271
These conversations are
why your mother left us.

153
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,742
That and the fact that you porked
your way through my sorority.

154
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,023
Look, Ted.

155
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:55,959
We were able to successfully grow hair
on a living organism

156
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,416
which previously had no hair.

157
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,960
Behold...
Three no-longer-bald

158
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,086
potatoes.

159
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,381
We isolated the follicle-
Generating compound

160
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,134
and atomized it into...
an aerosol.

161
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,386
This is incredible.
I want to start testing.

162
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,679
But we are testing.

163
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,739
See?
Testers. Testees. Testing.

164
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:14,975
You said "testes."

165
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,936
- My God. That's hilarious.
- Guys,

166
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,355
focus. I mean human testing.

167
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,524
Ted, we can't test it on humans.

168
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,597
There's a whole protocol
we have to follow.

169
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:27,073
First we have to test it
on a rat, then a bat,

170
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,335
- then for some reason, a hat.
- That started as a typo.

171
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,908
- Then a cat.
- Forget about it.

172
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,452
I'm telling you,
I want you to speed this along.

173
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:36,830
What?

174
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,828
He... said no.

175
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,658
At least I think that's what he said.
There's a... lot of blood

176
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,471
rushing through my ears right now.

177
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,577
We are not mad scientists, ted,

178
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:49,050
regardless of what
our bowling shirts might say.

179
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,929
When I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it.

180
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,437
Apparently...

181
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,726
We're standing our ground.

182
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,526
Fine. Then I'm gonna get you
bowling shirts that say

183
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,816
"boss-disappointing, protocol-loving,
un-legendaryscientists."

184
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:20,124
We're working hard

185
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,794
to make your life better.

186
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,543
But our competitor, Digivation,
wants to ruin your life.

187
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,422
Since Digivation was founded
50 years ago,

188
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:30,384
millions have died.

189
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,011
Millions more have become sad.

190
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,548
What's your problem, Digivation...

191
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,909
Veridian Dynamics.

192
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,000
Good.

193
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,234
Digivation.

194
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,359
Bad.

195
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:43,981
You came here to call a truce?

196
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:46,775
Because I want things to be
different between us now.

197
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,253
You must be sitting
on something huge,

198
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:50,566
something so big,

199
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,115
you can't stand the thought
of me stealing it.

200
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,950
There's something
I need to tell you.

201
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,755
Is that your dad? Why are you
throwing him out of the building?

202
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,584
He says he's dying.

203
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,571
I know it's not my place
to say anything.

204
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:22,186
But my God.
What is wrong with you?

205
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:25,522
You mean why do I allow employees
to talk to me that way?

206
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,816
Your father is dying,
and you throw him out of the building?

207
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,077
Oh, please.
He's not dying.

208
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:32,890
What is this, dutch blend?

209
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,323
I hate dutch blend...

210
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,019
And the dutch, too.
Those people are lunatics,

211
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,620
with their wooden shoes
and their fatty sausages.

212
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,163
What about your father?

213
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,025
I don't know how he feels
about the dutch, Linda.

214
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,269
- You'll have to ask him.
- How do you know he's not dying?

215
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:48,943
Because I know how the man works.

216
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,173
He's after something.
I just don't know what it is yet.

217
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,188
Do you know the dutch
celebrate Christmas

218
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:57,054
by throwing fruit at each other?
I read that once.

219
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:00,033
But what if he really is dying?

220
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,832
What if it's not a lie,

221
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:04,478
like all that stuff
you just said about the dutch?

222
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,690
It can't be true.
People don't just...

223
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,214
Well, people do,
but not my father.

224
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,957
I mean, really, it's just not
in his nature to die.

225
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:17,950
I've to check something.

226
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,040
What are you doing here?
And who is this man?

227
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,574
This is my physician...

228
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,904
- Dr. Something-berg.
- Rosenbaum.

229
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,684
- Rosenberg.
- Rosenbaum.

230
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,519
Stop arguing with me.
That's not why we're here.

231
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,802
I need to confirm that
you're full of crap, not tumors.

232
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:39,077
Well?

233
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:42,432
He's telling the truth.
I'd say he's got about a year left.

234
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,486
What? That's impossible.

235
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,355
Oh, my god.
My daddy's dying.

236
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,374
Oh, there, there.

237
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,506
At least now you'll have something
to talk to your sister about

238
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,613
besides all her stupid babies.

239
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:02,214
Phil and Lem have refused to move
forward on the hair growth formula.

240
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:05,883
So I stole a sample when they ran
downstairs to the ice cream truck.

241
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,166
I'm gonna test it on myself.

242
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,961
I know I'm being a little impatient,
but...

243
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,297
this project
hits very close to home.

244
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,328
You made the chess team.

245
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,759
What, are you too good
for checkers now?

246
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,700
Ooh! Look at me.
I'm valedictorian.

247
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,200
Whoop-dee-damn-do.

248
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,570
Business school?

249
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,939
Who do you think you are,
scrooge mcduck?

250
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:28,922
Tell me something, Teddy,

251
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,967
when are you gonna get
your head outta your butt

252
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:32,509
and do something useful,

253
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,110
like figure out how to make a toupee

254
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,050
that doesn't go awol every time
I crawl under a damn sink?

255
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,552
All my life, I've tried
to make my dad happy,

256
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:44,677
and I've never been able to...

257
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,060
Until now,

258
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,360
because now I'm gonna give
him something better than a toupee.

259
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,389
And, no, I don't mean ten toupees.

260
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,099
My dad's 60th birthday is coming up.

261
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:03,044
I was going to give him this.

262
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,859
But now...

263
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,683
I'm gonna give him this...

264
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,333
Hair.

265
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,289
It worked.

266
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,788
We're almost out of orange juice,

267
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,747
and I don't want to be
class president.

268
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,685
What?
What's going on?

269
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,114
- I opened the refrigerator...
- Rose.

270
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:24,034
I just don't want to spend
all my recesses in meetings.

271
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:27,079
I'd rather play in the sandbox
and make mud pies.

272
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:28,836
Honey, you're just nervous.

273
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,876
Look, I know it's not easy,
but I think you should stick with it.

274
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,379
You're gonna be the best class
president ever. 

275
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,592
- All right.
- All right? Good.

276
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:42,038
Being better than
the last one won't be hard.

277
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,471
He hate pencils and
call our teacher "mommy."

278
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,893
You were right.
My father really is dying.

279
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,437
Congratulations,
cancer whisper. You win.

280
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:55,865
I'm so sorry.

281
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:00,243
It's okay, Linda.
You'll get through this.

282
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:04,554
I know i will.
I'm trying to support you.

283
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,327
So...
How are you feeling?

284
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,127
We're gonna talk
about feelings now.

285
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,570
Sad

286
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:15,309
There. It had to be felt.

287
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,419
Veronica, you need
to spend time with him,

288
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:21,044
do father-daughter things
that don't involve stealing secrets.

289
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,984
Instead, steal his heart, fill it with
love and then give it back.

290
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,347
Not literally.
That would be murder.

291
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,187
Maybe you're right.

292
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:32,388
I should connect with him
before it's too late.

293
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,262
Luckily, I've always done my best work
under deadlines.

294
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:40,551
<i>And so veronica set out</i>

295
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:43,332
<i>to have the relationship
with her father she never had.</i>

296
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,387
<i>At first, it was a little confusing.</i>

297
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,762
<i>So they decided
to do activities together.</i>

298
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,028
I made a list of the advantages
and disadvantages of standing up to

299
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:33,121
'Cause I stood up to him and wanted
to know if there were any advantages.

300
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,717
- There are none.
- That's why I tried to stop you.

301
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,627
Ted is like the angle opposite
the hypotenuse. He's always right.

302
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,146
- You did not try to stop me.
- I tried to try, but nothing came out.

303
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,917
My head was screaming "no!"
But my mouth was chewing gum.

304
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,935
I hope he's not mad at us.

305
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,226
- We've never stood up to Ted before.
- Technically, I still haven't.

306
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:54,309
Guys.

307
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,269
I need to see you .

308
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,252
It's about the hair growth formula.

309
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,257
Is it terrified in here,
or is it just me?

310
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,018
So I snuck some of
the spray into my office

311
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:08,820
and tried it on my arm,
and it worked.

312
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:12,036
Of course it did, because we said
it wasn't ready for human testing,

313
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,443
and you said it was. 

314
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,711
"We." There's a lot of "we"
talk happening here,

315
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,642
and I don't think Ted cares for it.

316
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,230
My desk is having a bad hair day.

317
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,491
That's a little weird, huh?

318
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,282
Incredible.

319
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,243
The papilla are planting themselves

320
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,271
on anything porous.

321
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,814
When you used the aerosol,

322
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,984
the overspray must have hit
these exposed surfaces.

323
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,027
- You know what that means?
- Yes.

324
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,570
The mutant follicles
have turned parasitic

325
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:52,284
and are generating
at an astronomical rate.

326
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,202
And i was right to question Ted.

327
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,537
Yes, we were.

328
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,610
- Just let me have this.
- Yes, you were right to question me.

329
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,906
I was trying so hard
to impress my dad, I lost sight of,

330
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,858
all of the smooth surfaces
on my desk.

331
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,785
Anyway...
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,201
We're cool.

333
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,037
What's that
growing out of your cuff?

334
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:20,103
That would be my new shoulder hair.

335
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,367
High on moral superiority,
Phil and Lem went to work

336
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:30,072
trying to find a solution
to the hair in my office.

337
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,821
While Lem and Phil are looking
for a more permanent solution,

338
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,175
I'm trying to keep my office from
looking like this girl I used to date.

339
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,629
It's a long story, but, yes,
she looked like a desk with hair.

340
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,762
What is going on in here?

341
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,889
Are you shaving
your office furniture?

342
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,726
Well, it's not gonna shave itself.

343
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,835
There was this experiment...

344
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,814
Enough said.
I know how those go.

345
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:07,504
Last week, I had that
genetically altered koala

346
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,057
flying around my office.

347
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,229
While you're here...

348
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,036
So, thank you...
How are things with your father?

349
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,325
Well, we spent
all yesterday together,

350
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,182
but it never felt right.

351
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:24,626
Am I a horrible person?

352
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,461
I don't know anything about fathers.

353
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,323
Chasing a relationship with mine
could turn the world

354
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,965
into a giant fur ball.

355
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,963
What my father and I had
worked for us.

356
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,873
Why am I trying to change it?

357
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,327
Ted, stop torturing your desk.

358
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,728
I got a Russian girl who can get
that thing bikini-ready in 20 minutes.

359
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,321
<i>A few days later,</i>

360
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:51,382
<i>Phil and Lem figured out
a solution to the hair problem.</i>

361
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,750
Mr. Palmer had also been thinking
about his relationship with veronica.

362
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,362
Mr. Palmer, I'm Linda.

363
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:03,524
I'm a friend of your dau...
Not really a friend of your daughter's.

364
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,088
More of a colleague.

365
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:08,331
No. I'm definitely not a colleague.
We're not equals in any way.

366
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:11,776
I guess if you forced me
to define the relationship...

367
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,524
Are you aware that
I have only one year to live?

368
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:15,802
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,983
I just wanted to say
how great I think it is

370
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:21,181
that you and Veronica are
finally connecting after these years

371
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,190
Thank you very much.
That's very sweet.

372
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,229
What are you doing for lunch?

373
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:29,232
I thought you
and Veronica were going out.

374
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,112
Oh, yes, that's right.
Of course. We are going out.

375
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,734
That'll be fun.

376
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,407
We've been having so much... Fun.

377
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:42,196
Every year my parents and I rent an R. V
And go across the country.

378
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,535
You should try it
with veronica sometime.

379
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,993
Last year, we saw
the world's biggest thermometer.

380
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,017
It did not disappoint.

381
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:52,404
Oh, and we visited a town
that has a dog for a mayor.

382
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,000
He's the only mayor in Illinois that,
when you scratch his stomach,

383
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,278
he looks like he's trying
to start a motorcycle.

384
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,804
That's on the brochure. I think
I have it here somewhere.

385
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,815
Such a lot going on in this country.

386
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:05,685
No wonder america's trying
to eat itself to death.

387
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,316
Hi, dad.
Are you ready to go to lunch?

388
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:15,009
- Yes, I thought we'd go...
<i>- Veronica realized what relationship</i>

389
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,863
<i>she wanted with her father...</i>

390
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,141
I just need to go down the hall
a minute. I'll be right back.

391
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,902
<i>But left it up to him to decide what
kind he wanted with her.</i>

392
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:42,931


393
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,993
<i>And so they agreed to spend
their reaming time together</i>

394
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,981
<i>doing what they enjoyed most.</i>

395
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:56,121
Send them back
with a dozen smiley-face cookies.

396
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,423
He just blew millions of dollars
developing a hair product

397
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,547
that's technically a parasite.

398
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:04,836
I realized that rather than
trying to change

399
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,796
something about my dad
that I couldn't,

400
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,910
better to focus on being
a better dad than my old man

401
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:13,962
and accept my kid for who she is
and what she wants.

402
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:18,336
Honey, you don't have to run for
class president if you don't want to.

403
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:19,998
Really?

404
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,564
I can quit...
To play in the mud?

405
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,474
You're the best dad ever.

406
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,097
<i>Sure, I wanted rose
to be class president,</i>

407
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:33,528
<i>but it's not something
she wanted for herself.</i>

408
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:36,442
<i>And come on. We all heard
her campaign speech.</i>

409
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,195
And as for whether my dad
likes my gift or not...

410
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:47,139
I'm really not gonna worry about it.
