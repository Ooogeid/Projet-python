3
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:06,144
I like the people I work with,
but I've always believed it's important

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,978
to keep your personal life separate
from your work life. Otherwise...

5
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:12,492
- You had sex with that girl last night?
- Gee, that's totally your business.

6
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,805
But, I'm trying to keep
my personal life...

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,017
Much more accessible to all of us?
Good, that makes work interesting.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:22,275
- I think work makes work interesting.
- No wonder she wouldn't have sex.

9
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,036
That... That wasn't...

10
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:29,153
I was the one...
We both felt...

11
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,204
You shoulda shown her that flustered
thing. It woulda totally sealed it.

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,388
- No, I wasn't...
- Yeah, that.

13
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:38,914
Good morning, Lem.

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,085
- What's with the red lab coat?
- I don't know.

15
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,758
{\pos(192,185)}When I went to my locker this morning,
instead of a white lab coat,

16
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,026
which is what's been in my locker
every morning for the last 11 years,

17
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:53,401
there was this.

18
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,513
Are all our lab coats red?

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,190
No. Mine is still white.

20
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:02,895
Okay. I am not angry. I just need
to know what's happening.

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,213
I don't know.

22
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:07,358
Well, change doesn't always
have to be bad, right?

23
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:11,278
Remember when I stopped doing that
finger gun thing? Everyone liked that.

24
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:14,981
Oh, my god. It's true.

25
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:17,412
It's even redder than I imagined.

26
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:19,154
And I imagined it quite red.

27
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,247
- What does it mean?
- We don't know.

28
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,665
You're lying!

29
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:24,580
I'm sorry. It's the coat.

30
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:27,140
Its differentness is making
me say things.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,720
That's it.
We need answers.

32
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:32,274
I've spent my entire life
trying to blend in.

33
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,720
When I shaved off my fu manchu,
I thought I was there. Now this?

34
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:37,892
I iss that fu manchu.

35
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,287
Talk about pizzazz.

36
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,936
So the testing results
were inconclusive.

37
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,779
Usually that's what people say
when something tests badly,

38
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,608
and this is a good example of that.

39
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,598
Turns out developing cheese that
never spoils is harder than we thought.

40
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:55,072
Right now, it's more of a
cheddar-colored fabric that does spoil.

41
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,493
So we need you to talk to Chet
and get him to push the deadline.

42
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,572
Are you purring?

43
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:09,554
Or growling?

44
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,999
Oh, man. Are you gonna start
growling now when you're mad?

45
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:15,249
Because that's gonna be hard
to adjust to.

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,644
- What? What is so damn important?
- You fell asleep.

47
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:29,106
Well, maybe you two are boring.
Did you ever think of that?

48
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,016
<i>Veronica has
a very high-powered job.</i>

49
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:36,145
<i>To blow off steam, she recently started
a new, very exciting relationship</i>

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,949
<i>with an extremely passionate man
with huge appetites</i>

51
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>named Mordor.</i>

52
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:45,277
<i>He's also a world-class magician.</i>

53
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,005
<i>Unfortunately, this new relationship</i>

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,719
<i>has made Veronica
a little distracted at work.</i>

55
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,643
Occupied.

56
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,435
You're spreading cream cheese
on your iPhone?

57
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:09,814
Then where's my bagel?

58
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:14,343
The relationship is very intense.

59
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:17,467
This weekend, Mordor and I
are going scuba diving.

60
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,616
Last weekend, we raced cars
in the desert and ate a rattlesnake...

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,079
And a goat that wandered into our camp
and then a light salad.

62
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,858
But mostly, we have sex...
Hours and hours of it.

63
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,327
Last weekend, I helped my daughter
build a house of legos.

64
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:36,632
I know I've been a little
distracted lately, but I'll be fine.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,152
I'm just living an exciting
and full life...

66
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,020
Burning the candle at both ends,

67
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:43,968
the way my great-grandfather,
a misunderstood candle maker,

68
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,058
insisted candles should be burned.

69
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:52,702
Whenever I have sex, I have to be alert
the next day so I don't make mistakes.

70
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,296
I have to be alert during sex
so I don't make mistakes.

71
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,766
{\Basically, }I always have to be alert.

72
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:00,072
A woman that make mistakes during sex
can make mistakes during sex?

73
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,464
I'm on a very tight deadline
with this, Ted.

74
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,952
I need Veronica to focus.
You know her boyfriend.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,788
You should tell him to dial it down
so Veronica can do her job.

76
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,960
Let's see.

77
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,768
Would a guy welcome another guy telling
him to have less sex with his girl?

78
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,713
Yeah. That a normal thing
guys tell each other to do.

79
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:20,257
You think it's okay for a relationship
to be completely on the man's terms?

80
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:24,555
- God, you'd be hard to go out with.
- I am fantastic to go out with.

81
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,597
I'm thoughtful as a man can be

82
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:29,196
while still pillaging like
a viking in the bedroom.

83
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,979
But I am not getting involved
in Veronica's personal life.

84
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,925
So my boss gets to have
all the sex-fun of a relationship

85
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,359
while all the stress of being
exhausted trickles down to me?

86
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,237
Man, capitalism blows.

87
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:48,704
We have a problem.

88
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,998
- What's with the red lab coat?
- Exactly.

89
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,292
- The company wants me to wear it.
- Why?

90
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:54,466
Exactly.

91
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:57,329
I called the laundry people, it was
assigned to me but they don't know why.

92
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,215
The laundry people...
Useless.

93
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,467
Well, they do do laundry.

94
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,304
You love the laundry people.
You take their side in everything.

95
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:07,973
First of all,
I do love the laundry people.

96
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,803
Secondly, i'll look into the coat.

97
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,103
In the meantime,
maybe it's not a bad thing.

98
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,855
Maybe the company is singling you out
because you did something good.

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,480
Maybe it's an honor.

100
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:23,134
I did finish the super-fast spy
pigeon project ahead of schedule.

101
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,742
I worked on this project.
I'm the one that made it wireless.

102
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,715
Before me, it could only spy
on people right next to it.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,183
- Why didn't I get a red lab coat?
- I did more work than you.

104
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:34,917
I was late one day
because my wife was choking.

105
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,616
It's not fair! I'm penalized
because my wife eats breakfast fast.

106
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,048
She's hungry in the morning.

107
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,342
- He's here.
- Oh, thank god.

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,402
- Who?
- I don't care. It gets me out of this.

109
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,179
Mordor. Veronica's boyfriend.

110
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,683
He says he's surprising her
and taking her to lunch and sex.

111
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,560
The man is relentless
and very candid.

112
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:57,193
Can you imagine how great
it would be to just take Veronica

113
00:05:57,318 --> 00:06:00,734
out in the middle of the day
and have lunch with her?

114
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,862
You should try to aim higher
with your fantasies.

115
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,805
Veronica is supposed to meet with Chet
this afternoon, get us that extension.

116
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,411
What if she comes back
exhausted and purring?

117
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,048
You're right. All right.
I'll go talk to Mordor.

118
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,083
The man lives a life of excess.

119
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,587
I could sell him on the adventure of
having less sex with his hot girlfriend.

120
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:22,798
I may phrase it differently.

121
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,890
I need to talk to you about something.
That's a little awkward.

122
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,560
- You have a crush on me.
- What? No. What?

123
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,313
Men often do, Ted. I find it's best
to just get it out there.

124
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,898
No, no.
This is about Veronica.

125
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,305
See, she has
a very high-pressure job.

126
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,153
And she does it with 100% focus.

127
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,947
Oh, she's the same in bed
or when dismembering a goat.

128
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,846
Right. So you and the other
animals have seen it.

129
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,495
The thing is, lately,
she hasn't been getting enough sleep...

130
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:56,498
Because she's with you...

131
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,085
Doing things, things that are fun,

132
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,548
but, you know, tire a gal out.

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,577
Are you suggesting that sometimes

134
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:09,443
when I'm with Veronica, I should

135
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,764
- Just let her go to sleep?
- Exactly.

136
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,724
Then have sex with her?

137
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:16,234
I start again.

138
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:19,180
It would be good if you had
less sex with veronica.

139
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,397
The end.

140
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:35,253
Hey.

141
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,271
What did you say to Mordor?

142
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,042
I didn't tell him to have sex
with her while she's sleeping.

143
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:41,876
Why? What did he do?

144
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,411
I walked in to the supply closet,
he was there with Ashley

145
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,406
and they were not
looking for supplies

146
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,229
unless she uses her ya-ha
to store office supplies

147
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,715
and he uses his yang-doodle
to look for things.

148
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,939
- That's what mom calls it.
- All I said was

149
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,987
he should dial it down a little bit.

150
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:59,234
He take that as
a green light to fool around,

151
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,072
he was going here
like he wanted Sparks to come out.

152
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:05,400
Maybe it was a mistake to get involved
in Veronica's personal life.

153
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,644
Oh, don't be that guy
who points fingers.

154
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,157
No one likes a pointer.

155
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,665
Even in the dog world,
they're seen as insufferable.

156
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,344
- Veronica has to know what's going on.
- Oh, no. She doesn't need to know.

157
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,976
No one needs to know.

158
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,339
In fact, you should forget.
And I will, too.

159
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,208
Forget what? Don't even remember.

160
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,461
It's happening in the office.
She's gonna find out.

161
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,910
- Not from office gossip.
- Me?

162
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,675
I didn't want to get involved
in this in the first place.

163
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:33,637
Still bringing that up! Got a stick up
your boodle-doodle about that.

164
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,231
We need to talk.

165
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:46,775
What?

166
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,904
I was having the best dream
about Mordor.

167
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,750
He makes me so happy.

168
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,236
I feel free and untethered,

169
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:58,732
like a spy pigeon without a wire.

170
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,247
So what's up?

171
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:05,658
The red lab coat.

172
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,367
- The guys 're wondering what it means.
- You can't tell them,

173
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,323
but it has no meaning whatsoever.

174
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,289
- It was given out randomly.
- Why?

175
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:16,177
The company commissioned a study
which showed that any change

176
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,182
in the work environment
increases productivity.

177
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:21,018
- Any change, it doesn't matter what.
- That's crazy.

178
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,021
Giving one person a different lab coat
can't make everybody work harder.

179
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,902
- I am going to win that coat tomorrow.
- No, you're not,

180
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:30,611
I'm working faster
and more efficiently than ever.

181
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,739
So the painted stripe, that appeared
in the hallway last week?

182
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,529
You mean two days
before quarterly reports were due,

183
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,285
all of which were turned in early?

184
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,746
And the drinking fountain
that stopped working for no reason?

185
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,165
That was broken, Ted.

186
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,851
You people are paranoid.

187
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:46,451
No wonder the company has to
secretly manipulate you.

188
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,754
So... Is there anything else?

189
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:50,839
Nope.

190
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,384
Mordor is having an affair
with somebody in the office.

191
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,851
Someone walked in on them
and I thought I should tell you. Sorry.

192
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,311
- But why?
- Why would he do this?

193
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:07,940
He's getting enough from me.

194
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,235
Well, who knows why people
do what they do, you know?

195
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,684
The important thing
is not to blame anyone

196
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,555
or look for answers, really.

197
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:17,866
Some things shouldn't be probed.

198
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,536
The's an unfortunate
choice of words.

199
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:26,275
I rambled on like that for ten minutes,
somehow using the words

200
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,627
"thrust," "prod," "rigid"
and "impale."

201
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,725
All comforting terms.

202
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:33,196
It's good she knows about Mordor.

203
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:35,717
If it were me, I'd want to know.
Is she okay?

204
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,280
I think so.

205
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,325
They haven't been
together that long.

206
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,889
I'm guessing they'll be okay.

207
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,309
Hey, scuba girl. You ready to go?

208
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,478
You shot me!

209
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

210
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,606
So?

211
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,320
Who's Ashley?

212
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:58,594
I was packing up the spear-gun,
and it just went off.

213
00:10:58,904 --> 00:10:59,825
An accident.

214
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,982
Of course it was an accident.

215
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,933
Although, the man
was cheating on me,

216
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:06,151
and my subconscious
is very protective,

217
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,208
and sometimes, kind of a douche.

218
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,636
- I'm so angry, Ted.
- You have every right to be.

219
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,339
- I'm angry at you.
- You have no right to be.

220
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,717
Why did you tell me
mordor was cheating ome?

221
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,913
I thought you'd want to know.

222
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:21,815
- Linda would want to know.
- Of course I'd want to know,

223
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,152
but not when there's a spear-gun
sitting 3 feet away

224
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:26,181
from me and my douchey subconscious.

225
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,855
What were you thinking?

226
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,803
- Ms. Palmer?
- Yes.

227
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:32,012
He's out of surgery, and he'll fine.

228
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,610
However, we could not save
the spear.

229
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,334
Old joke.

230
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,199
I use it with all the family
of loved ones who survive.

231
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,618
Don't anymore.

232
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,808
Now I have to break up with him,

233
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,088
which is gonna be that much harder
since I just shot him.

234
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,963
Look what you made me do.

235
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:55,765
Sorry I'm late.

236
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,475
I'm trying to get my wife
to eat slower in the morning.

237
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,656
It's a project.

238
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,889
- What happened to your red lab coat?
- Wasn't in my locker this morning.

239
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:07,142
I don't get it.
You worked so hard yesterday.

240
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,145
But then, so did I.

241
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,328
Oh. Now I'm sad again.

242
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,650
Morning, ladies.

243
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,278
Notice anything redder
about me?

244
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:23,325
I am literally shaking
with jealousy. Get out!

245
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,161
I don't want the coat to see me
like this. No, wait.

246
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,966
Let me touch it.
No.

247
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,165
No. Wait.

248
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:33,676
Your call.

249
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,256
I've been thinking about
how I behaved last night,

250
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,640
I've realized, it wasn't your fault
that Mordor somehow got himself shot.

251
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,431
And so I'd like to apologize.

252
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,622
That's okay.

253
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,395
I'm just glad you're rid of him.

254
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,728
That guy was
a self-absorbed dill-hole.

255
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:55,649
"Ooh, I'm Mordor. I think
all men are in love with me."

256
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,360
- I mean, seriously, what a doofus.
- We made up.

257
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
Oh, good,

258
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,950
'cause now I can stop pretending
I don't like him.

259
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,318
He had an affair, and I shot him.

260
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,508
So we decided to call in.

261
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,573
Plus, I found out why he did it.

262
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:13,577
Apparently somebody suggested

263
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:16,721
- that he ease up on our relationship.
- I didn't mean...

264
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:17,671
It was you?

265
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,650
- What was me?
- My god, Ted.

266
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,571
You don't tell a man like Mordor
to be less passionate.

267
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,695
It's like telling Gandhi
to be less...

268
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,965
Whatever he was.

269
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,100
Thin.

270
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,469
Your job wasn't done.

271
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,252
You were falling asleep
at work with your eyes open.

272
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,890
What if they dried out?

273
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,442
They would've lost their luster.
I was worried.

274
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:42,362
I don't need you or anyone else
interfering in my life.

275
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,449
You're responsible for
my boyfriend screwing around.

276
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,139
You're the one who shot him.

277
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,618
In my mind.

278
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,250
And then, you call him a dill-hole

279
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:52,672
right to his face.

280
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,512
- No.
- In my mind.

281
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:58,070
I think you and I need
a little distance from each other.

282
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,501
That's a good idea.

283
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:01,131
I'll go to my office.

284
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,299
Actually,

285
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,831
I was thinking
a little more distance.

286
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,558
<i>And so Veronica sent me down
to the ridiculously tiny office.</i>

287
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,857
This is not as bad as I imagined.

288
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:49,012
Your chair and desk look gigantic
it's cool.

289
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,307
Plus, it would be impossible
to lose anything in here.

290
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,100
It's all great.

291
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:56,812
So what's up, fellas?
'cause I'm busy getting into my chair.

292
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
We're...

293
00:14:58,257 --> 00:14:59,731
unhappy about something.

294
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,399
Is it the coat?

295
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,947
I worked my ass off yesterday
to get that thing.

296
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:06,196
I can't tell you exactly
what's going on.

297
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm in trouble
as it is with Veronica.

298
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,461
But the coat may not be something
you want to work extra hard to get.

299
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,098
It's so beautiful.

300
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:18,045
Only because you think
it means something, which it may not.

301
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,382
- I know what's going on.
- We're confused.

302
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,209
That's exactly what's happening.

303
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:29,194
I can't believe
you trashed Veronica's boyfriend.

304
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,014
You never trash the boyfriend.
What if they get back together?

305
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,571
I don't care anymore.

306
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:35,696
I'm out.

307
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,520
I am done getting in the middle
of Veronica's relationship.

308
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,001
Because believe it or not,
there's an office smaller,

309
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:42,942
and you have to share it
with someone.

310
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,618
You should be out,
you know nothing about relationships.

311
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,753
I don't know anything
about relationships?

312
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:50,011
It's because
of your relationship geniusness

313
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,866
that I'm stuck
in Polly Pocket's house.

314
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,495
- We should go.
- We want to go.

315
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,446
Thanks to me? I never told you
to tell her that her boyfriend sucks.

316
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:59,892
I wouldn't have kept talking about
her sucky boyfriend

317
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,914
- if you hadn't kept bringing him up.
- I had to bring it up,

318
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,006
because you think relationships
are all about what the guy wants.

319
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,788
And by the way, genius,

320
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,383
Polly Pockets doesn't live in a house,
but in a clamshell!

321
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,382
- I know where she lives.
- Really?

322
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,640
Because I think you know less about
Polly Pockets than relationships.

323
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:18,894
That's better.

324
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,732
So if the coat's not a reward something good},
then that must mean...

325
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,733
It's a punishment
for doing something bad.

326
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,364
It's like a scarlet letter.

327
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,737
Only it's worse,
because it covers the body in shame.

328
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,500
So why'd the company give it to me?

329
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,151
You did break the dieoxolater
defibulation splung manifold last week,

330
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:37,039
and that sucka is expensive.

331
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:40,457
If I hadn't tried to protect my eyes,
I might have been able to save it.

332
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,303
Stupid reflexes.

333
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:46,365
<i>The next morning, I checked in
to see if I could come back.</i>

334
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,220
Good morning, sunshine.

335
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,758
Not yet.

336
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,612
<i>And in the lab...</i>

337
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,976
It was in my locker this morning.

338
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,045
I worked so hard yesterday

339
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,118
to avoid this exact thing.

340
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,682
All we can do is buckle down

341
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,857
and push ourselves even harder.

342
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,412
I hope Veronica forgives me soon,

343
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,617
because I really like doing this...

344
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,037
Which I totally took
for granted before.

345
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,521
What the hell?

346
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:26,169
Ted! I thought
you were working out of the basement.

347
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,136
I'm getting papers.
What are you doing?

348
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,371
This is...

349
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:30,757
Tiffany.

350
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,834
Thank you.
See,

351
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:34,427
I figured it out.

352
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,458
I hurt Veronica by fooling around,

353
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,140
but then she shooted me with a speargun,
that reset the relationship.

354
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:40,898
So I can fool around again,

355
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:44,419
as long as I'm willing to let Veronica
hurt me again, which I am,

356
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:47,315
'cause I like promiscuous sex
far more than I dislike pain.

357
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,238
You know, I didn't want to get involved
in Veronica's personal life,

358
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,406
but now I'm glad I did,
because you don't deserve her.

359
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:58,743
She is smart, and beautiful,
and confident... Wildly fun in bed...

360
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,872
I've been there. She is
the whole package. You're just a jerk.

361
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,750
And, yes, a mammoth dill-hole.

362
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,196
All right, Ted.

363
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,455
Let's go.

364
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,698
You started this whole thing,
and you insult me in front of Tiffany.

365
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,926
- Let's get this over with.
- I won't fight you, you loon.

366
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,945
Loon?

367
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,104
Could a loon do this?

368
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,979
I think a loon would do that.

369
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,981
It's called quad-dela-ron-sha.

370
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,150
It's an ancient peruvian martial art
involving forceful, repeated slapping.

371
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,794
I'm not gonna fight you.

372
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,758
Wait.
Yes, I'll fight you.

373
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,304
What the hell?

374
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:46,374
It's like you have
a hundred fingers.

375
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:49,963
Go get help!

376
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,154
Quad-dela-ron-sha...

377
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,136
It's impossible to defend against.

378
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,180
It's why Peru was never conquered.

379
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,015
Didn't the spanish conquer Peru?

380
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,946
Yes, but then they left quickly.

381
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,793
In fact, quad-dela-ron-sha means:

382
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:07,896
"Leave,
or we'll start with the slapping."

383
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,857
Did Mordor tell you this?
'cause it's not on Google.

384
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,868
Maybe that was also a lie.

385
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,653
I'm through with him.

386
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:18,990
{\Listen, }I'm sorry about everything.

387
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:21,756
You stood up for me.

388
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:23,753
No one's ever done that before.

389
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:27,821
Thank you.

390
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,201
<i>Maybe it's impossible
to keep your personal life</i>

391
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>completely separate from work,</i>

392
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,109
<i>especially when you care about
the people you work with...</i>

393
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,780
<i>And they care about you.</i>

394
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:41,930
Is he all right?

395
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:43,431
He's great.

396
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,506
I can't believe he fought
to defend your honor. That is so...

397
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,686
- Hot?
- Actually, It kind of is.

398
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:52,943
And I told him he didn't know
anything about relationships.

399
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,618
He may not
but he'd sure be good in one.

400
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,013
Again?

401
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:09,895
What have I done?

402
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:13,325
<i>{And since I do care about
the people I work with,</i>

403
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,228
<i>I decided to end their suffering.</i>

404
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,632
<i>Since any change helps productivity,</i>

405
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,322
<i>why not make it a positive change</i>

406
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,347
<i>and do something
people can feel good about?</i>

407
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,750
What does it mean?

408
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:33,507
Maybe we've been asking
too many questions.

409
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,860
Maybe this is the company's equivalent
of sending a dead fish.
