00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:07,540
Veridian Dynamics is one of the most
successful companies in the world.

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,593
To make it here, you have to
be very competitive.

5
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,715
<i>Some compete to see who
has the biggest rocket.</i>

6
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,790
<i>Others compete to see who
can be the fastest.</i>

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,400
But no one's more competitive
than me and Veronica.

8
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:26,285
- Race you to the elevator?
- Feelin' lucky?

9
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,409
But it's that drive to win that keeps us
at the top of our game.

10
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,008
I win!

11
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,330
This is the most fun anyone has
ever had with hypodermic needles.

12
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:46,300
It's not over yet.
It's still wobbling.

13
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,070
And it can't come out for at least a minute.

14
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:49,790
Same rules as for losing your virginity.

15
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:52,180
Would you two say that
you were overly concerned

16
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:55,765
with the outrageous prices
of store-bought wrapping paper?

17
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:59,670
Yes, we're so concerned,
we need to be alone right now.

18
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:02,690
My daughter is selling wrapping paper
to raise money for her school.

19
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:05,230
Whoever sells the most
wins a trip to Disneyland.

20
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,943
Second place gets to cry while
Rose and I go to Disneyland.

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,030
- Uh, Phil will take ten rolls.
- What?

22
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:15,344
You heard him. I'd leave now
before he changes his mind.

23
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,198
And, Lem, I’ll also put you down for ten.

24
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,933
One for each time I told you
not to play the needle game.

25
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,790
- Ted knows everything we do.
- He's like a god,

26
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:30,750
only it hurts more when he judges us.

27
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,969
Hey, do you guys have the specs
for the solar-powered ovens?

28
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:44,535
I hate coming down here.

29
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,735
Sorry.

30
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't worry. We only play the clean needle game
with clean needles.

31
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:52,935
Here's a band-aid.

32
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:56,997
And there's your lady shoulder.

33
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,120
Just bring the specs to my desk.
I'll be the one hoping

34
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,292
I never hear the term
"lady shoulder" ever again.

35
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:08,615
Wait.

36
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:14,145
I thought we used the last of the band-aids when
you wanted to see what I’d look like with a moustache.

37
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,610
These aren't band-aids.

38
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:20,895
This is that experimental energy patch.
We just drugged Linda.

39
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,095
I owe you an apology, Phil.

40
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,571
When we set out to make energy patch

41
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,400
look exactly like a band-aid,
I said it couldn't be done.

42
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,585
I was wrong.

43
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,670
- We should tell her.
- Or...

44
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,250
we don't tell her so she doesn't
get mad at us again.

45
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,640
I like where this is going.

46
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,270
- We're going. That's it. It went.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,620
She's just gonna have a little...

48
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,541
extra energy. Why trouble her

49
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,900
with something that might
force her to yell at us again?

50
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,310
We're doing her a favor.
That's what's happening here.

51
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:48,314
- So we're even.
- Even?

52
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,284
She owes us.

53
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,151
As you all know, we've been working on

54
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:57,240
Veridian's new solar-powered ovens.

55
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,860
We've had a great amount of success with it so far.

56
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,185
If you guys will take a look at the chart.

57
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,311
We're working on a contract
for solar-powered ovens,

58
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:09,860
which the military plans to air-drop into
remote villages as a goodwill gesture.

59
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,980
It'll be the only thing the military drops
that doesn't kill people.

60
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,700
- The problem is--
- It kills people.

61
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:19,050
Yeah, the plastic we're using
leaches toxins into food.

62
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:22,610
However, the toxins are only released
when the ovens are exposed to sunlight.

63
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:25,260
Which is the only time solar ovens work.

64
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:29,140
Some days, it seems like everything
we do leaches toxins.

65
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,870
Well, luckily, it can be fixed.

66
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,521
Of course it can. We can do anything,

67
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:36,279
because this is the greatest scientific team
that's ever been assembled.

68
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,066
Let's do it!

69
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:45,535
Where is she going?

70
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:46,645
To do it?

71
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,290
Anyway, the solar ovens can be fixed

72
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,080
by using a more expensive material.

73
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:56,990
Now the, uh, plastic in our bomb casings
is completely harmless.

74
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,332
Well, it's nice to know people can safely eat

75
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,890
off our unexploded bombs.

76
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,062
- Thank you, everyone.
- Hang on.

77
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,610
We have another problem.

78
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,995
- Is this about the wrapping paper?
- No,

79
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,474
this is about a little girl's dream...

80
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,650
to sell the most wrapping paper.

81
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:16,854
A dream that is now being challenged
by some insanely completive girl named Cynthia.

82
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,789
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
you’re the insanely competitive one?

83
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,933
Let me rephrase that. I'd like
five more rolls, please.

84
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,464
Ted, since the military doesn't usually pay more
for something that kills fewer people,

85
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:34,252
I need you to butter up General McMillan over dinner and
get some extra money out of them.

86
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,219
Oh, man. Can't we just hope
they don't look at the invoice?

87
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:39,133
Come on. The General respects you, Ted.

88
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:42,570
Your experience, your charm,
the whole package. Oh,

89
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,115
and your package.

90
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,296
<b>Six months ago</b>

91
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,137
I always enjoy doing business with you, Ted.

92
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,743
Look, I like the general, and I like gay people--

93
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,328
- Done.
- Wait.

94
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,871
I just don't think it's right to flirt
for the sake of a deal.

95
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:13,156
Besides, he's so grabby. I mean,
whatever happened to romance?

96
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:16,904
What if I were to help you sell
your daughter's precious toilet paper?

97
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,212
It's wrapping paper.

98
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,462
It's not my fault I don't listen when you talk.

99
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,695
But fine, whatever.
I can sell anything, Ted.

100
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,033
I once sold a guy on having dinner
with a grabby general

101
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,855
to help his daughter win a contest.

102
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,073
Really, who?

103
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:32,073
- Because I haven't agreed to that yet.
- You will. You're that competitive.

104
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,937
Fine. It's a deal.

105
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:38,588
If Rose wins, I will have dinner
with the general.

106
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:42,332
But if he tries that "Lady and the Tramp"
Spaghetti thing again, I’m outta there.

107
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,525
- We need our band-aid back.
- What? That's gross. Why do you want it back?

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,592
- Because it's ours.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:56,627 --> 00:06:00,414
- We were just loaning it to you.
- Okay, you can have it back...

110
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,073
But you gotta catch me first.

111
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,749
Got it!

112
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:26,168
So I sold... 50 rolls.

113
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:29,294
Veronica sold... 20 rolls.

114
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,514
And you sold... six.

115
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,603
I only know, like, three grown-ups.

116
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,944
You know, you're kind of a freak
about competition, dad.

117
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,074
Competition's important, honey.
It motivates people to do their very best.

118
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:46,205
Besides, you won't be calling me
a freak when I’m wearing

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,513
my Pluto hat spinning in a teacup.

120
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:53,916
Wait a minute. This Cynthia character
has sold 15 more rolls than us.

121
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,772
- Who is this girl?
- She's new. You can click on her name

122
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,479
- to find out more about her.
- Let's do that.

123
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,824
If you want to crush your competition, which I--

124
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,795
we-- do, you want to get
to know everything about them.

125
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,783
How they think, what their interests are...

126
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:12,068
What kind of wheelchair they're confined to.

127
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,805
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

128
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,398
<i>Competition.</i>

129
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,069
<i>Whether it's animals</i>

130
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,376
<i>or this old woman and baby,
fighting to the death...</i>

131
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:28,009
<i>Competition makes us stronger.</i>

132
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:30,703
<i>In business, that means better products.</i>

133
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,964
<i>Pills that look like candy,</i>

134
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:35,009
<i>hands that can shoot lightning</i>

135
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:38,329
<i>and a new generation

<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

137
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,446
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Competition.</i>

138
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,806
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Competition. It makes everything better.</i>

139
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,465
We have a problem.

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,847
Cynthia, our competition
in the wrapping paper contest,

141
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:57,359
- is in a wheelchair.
- Ooh. Yeah, that is a problem.

142
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:01,617
It gives her a huge competitive advantage.
We're gonna have to step it up.

143
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,855
Wait.

144
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,546
You don't think competing all-out against
a girl who's disabled is wrong?

145
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:12,186
Wrong? How should I know what's wrong?
I'm not some Greek philosopher.

146
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:14,800
- What does Rose think?
- Ah, she's no help.

147
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,647
I taught her everyone should
be treated equally.

148
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,276
Well, then treat everyone equally.

149
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:21,586
No, you're not supposed to really do that.
You're just supposed to teach it.

150
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:25,248
Ted, you're a competitor. You want to win.
You just need to hear it's okay.

151
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:26,447
No, I don't.

152
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:27,896
But it is, right?

153
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:31,394
Yes, we should treat this Cynthia
equally and beat the--

154
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:32,672
Does she wear pants?

155
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:33,718
I think so.

156
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,765
Then let's beat them off her.

157
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,652
Wait. You just want Rose to win so that
I’ll go have dinner with General McMillan.

158
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,873
God, it's like you're obsessed with the guy.

159
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,855
Ted, you've got to focus. This is about
selling solar ovens, not your love life.

160
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:53,244
Linda's crying.

161
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:56,075
Well, we got the patch off her, so we're good.

162
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,762
Still, she's crying, and we like her, so...

163
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,127
We should see what's wrong.

164
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,877
Hey, Linda.

165
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,284
What's wrong?

166
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:11,420
The Jewish people have had
such a tumultuous history.

167
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:14,208
And yet they were still able to give us this?

168
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,277
The everything bagel--

169
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,528
It's all you'd ever want in one bagel.

170
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:21,248
I love it...

171
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:24,254
And the chosen people who created it.

172
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,532
Oh, I have been so emotional lately.

173
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,510
- Well, maybe it's just--
- Why don't you shut up

174
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,267
and stop trying to analyze me?

175
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:40,155
Do you think wildly erratic emotions
could be a residual effect of the energy patch?

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,462
Hard to tell.

177
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,294
This is the problem when the company
will only pay for testing on drunk frat guys.

178
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:48,696
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

179
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:52,085
We could just stand here without a plan.

180
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,351
I like where this is going.

181
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,896
I can give you 6 rolls for $5 a roll.

182
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,000
Whoa. That's crazy. Why, that's well below
the current wholesale price.

183
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,867
Too late. She promised.
I'm getting my checkbook.

184
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:09,391
- We work well together. Like Batman and--
- I'm Batman.

185
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,477
- It was my idea...
- I'm Batman!

186
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,780
And Robin.

187
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:17,162
Hi, guys. Hi, best-looking woman
in the company, possibly the universe.

188
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,539
Hello, person who clearly wants
something from me.

189
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:21,439
I do want something from you.

190
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:23,848
I want to know how you got
to be so freakin' awesome.

191
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:27,050
Look at you-- You got it all going on.

192
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,783
You're an incredibly powerful woman,
you are so pretty.

193
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,698
And your calves? Oh.

194
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,410
They're like granite wrapped in silk.

195
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:37,961
Is everything okay, Linda?

196
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:42,147
You just said a whole bunch of stuff,
any one of which would be disturbing on its own.

197
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,771
Disturbing?

198
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,009
Well, maybe you wouldn't find me disturbing
if I was more like Veronica.

199
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:49,215
Look at me. I'm more like Veronica.

200
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,547
I'm tilting my head curiously. I once left
the ladies room without washing my hands.

201
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:54,797
That's right. I saw you.

202
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:57,442
Clearly she's lost her mind.
I wouldn't believe a word she said

203
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:59,293
past that calf thing.

204
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:01,832
Okay, there's something we hoped
we'd never have to tell you.

205
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,842
You know how when you
accidentally dose someone, like

206
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,306
with an experimental energy patch,

207
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,128
and you hope they'll sit quietly at their desks,

208
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:10,007
but instead they wander around drawing
unnecessary attention to themselves?

209
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,180
We've done something eerily similar to that.

210
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:16,299
What? You boneheads dosed me?
I could kill you!

211
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,438
But then I would miss you so much.

212
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:24,033
Based on the dose she received, we're confident
the effects should wear off within the next 24 hours.

213
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,554
Thank you for your attention and forgiveness.

214
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,603
Stop. Turn back.

215
00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:32,501
Dosing an employee is a serious offense.

216
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm Veronica. I'm so serious,
and I have pee-pee on my hands.

217
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:37,673
I wash my hands, you drugged
up fruitcake.

218
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,113
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

219
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,921
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

220
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:45,543
First, we're gonna cut you a lot of slack and hope
you don't say something that gets you fired.

221
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:47,844
Second, Phil and Lem, you're not gonna
let Linda out of your sight

222
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,058
until she's completely back to normal.

223
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:53,562
Look at me. I'm Linda.
I'm making fun of everyone.

224
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,796
Hey.

225
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,783
Oh, good.
You're still awake.

226
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:02,395
Crazy day, but...

227
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,386
Veronica and I sold so much
wrapping paper,

228
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:06,993
not only are you going to Disneyland,

229
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:10,049
but Mickey's gonna be wearing your ears
on his head.

230
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:12,811
Oh, wait. That's a horrifying image.

231
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:16,500
Everyone at school hates me because
I'm beating the disabled girl.

232
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,824
But everybody's equal.
We don't see disabled people.

233
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,417
Well, we see them, we just don't care.

234
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:25,676
Well, we care, we just don't treat
them differently.

235
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,931
Well, they do have their own parking.

236
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,969
Cynthia's had a really hard life, and
everyone else is letting her win.

237
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,297
If I win, everyone's gonna be
so mad at me,

238
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:36,518
I won't be able to go to school anymore.

239
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:39,227
Can we not win, daddy?

240
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:40,678
Please?

241
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,583
I know it's hard for you.

242
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,489
No, it's okay.

243
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:46,207
We'll let Cynthia win.

244
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,535
Come on.

245
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,888
Mickey will wear her ears.

246
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:53,145
Thank you, daddy.

247
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,988
Could I sleep with the light
on tonight?

248
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:57,597
- It was the ear thing, wasn't it?
- Little bit.

249
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,039
These cookies are inedible.

250
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,632
I made cookies!

251
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,592
You made cookies an hour ago.

252
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:11,927
Eat them!

253
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,024
This is so much fun, having a sleepover.

254
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,424
Well, Ted wanted us to keep an eye on you, and
when we tried to take you to my house,

255
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,671
you bit me, so here we are.

256
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:26,325
- There's a penny in this cookie.
- Just eat it. Eat it.

257
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Don't get her mad again.

258
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:33,694
There's that baby again.
It cries every night.

259
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:36,398
- Babies do that.
- Not tonight they don't.

260
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,858
This ends now.

261
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,989
Linda, you can't hurt a baby.

262
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,416
Well, you can hurt them.
They're not indestructible.

263
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,496
I meant it's morally indefensible.

264
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,947
- Well, what if the baby killed a man?
- You and your moral puzzles.

265
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,512
I just love 'em.

266
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,773
Answer the door, baby. I know you're
in there. I can hear you crying.

267
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,653
Linda, what's going on?

268
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,959
- Why are you yelling at Stella?
- Stay out of this, Kathy.

269
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:04,162
This is between me and the baby...

270
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:07,109
who is just the cutest thing in the world.

271
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:10,638
Oh, my god. Look at you. Hi, Stella.

272
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,855
Can I hold her? Please.

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,596
I don't think that's a good idea.

274
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:18,681
So you're saying under no circumstances
would you harm the baby Hitler?

275
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,195
Hey, fellas. Look what I got...

276
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,569
a baby.

277
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,954
I'm naming her Ted.

278
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:29,385
This is exactly the type of thing the other
Ted wanted us to prevent.

279
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,160
Linda? Linda?

280
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:34,778
<i>The next morning, I told veronica that
we had to let Cynthia</i>

281
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,542
<i>win the wrapping paper contest.</i>

282
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:39,154
<i>She took it better than expected.</i>

283
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,284
You're soft and weak, Ted,

284
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,420
like a geisha.

285
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,237
Rose is being teased at school.

286
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:46,799
She's far more important to me than
a wrapping paper contest.

287
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,066
If she wants me to stop selling,
I'm stopping.

288
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,004
Fine, quit. I don't give a crap.

289
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,839
So when are you having dinner
with the general?

290
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,108
I'm not.

291
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:57,292
Because technically,
I only had to do that

292
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,298
if Rose won the trip to Disneyland.

293
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,987
If she's not gonna have a magical experience,
neither is the general.

294
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:07,656
Well, if Rose has to win for you to have that
dinner, then I'm gonna make sure rose wins.

295
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,128
- Then I'm gonna make sure she loses.
- Then it is on.

296
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,643
It'll be like two great heavyweights going
toe-to-toe, and I'm Ali

297
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,631
and Frazier and Foreman.

298
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:22,783
Sure, I could've just agreed to have dinner
with the general to end this thing,

299
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:24,605
but I know I can beat Veronica.

300
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,821
At the company picnic, I beat her
in the 3-legged race.

301
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:32,002
Although, we both lost to something Lem and
Phil created in the lab.

302
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:34,489
I don't get it. Why do you need to buy back
all the wrapping paper?

303
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,115
Because it's dangerous, Mindy.

304
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,671
It's a choking hazard, it's made of lead
and prolonged exposure

305
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,939
could cause violent incontinence.

306
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:45,780
It could stain your hands, stunt your growth
and cause testicular desiccation.

307
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,697
Hoof-and-mouth, dry mouth, trench mouth,

308
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:51,732
and if you hold it up to the light,
you can see Santa's penis.

309
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,233
- Ted.
- What? What's coming?

310
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,268
Relax. I'm okay now.
The effects wore off.

311
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:02,038
Unfortunately, it was several hours after
I stole a baby.

312
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:04,233
- You stole a baby?
- Only for a few seconds.

313
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:07,348
Turns out, just because you write your name
on something doesn't mean you get to keep it.

314
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,257
Yeah, I think babies have to be notarized.

315
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,338
Wait. Weren't Lem and Phil supposed
to be watching you?

316
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,778
Yeah, there's a lot of things those guys
don't do well:

317
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:19,227
Watch me, not dose me, stop me before
I write my name on a baby.

318
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:22,058
I'm so pissed at them.
I want payback.

319
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,695
Oh, I'm Linda.
I want payback.

320
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,001
That's my payback.

321
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,015
I got the wrapping paper back from half
the people I sold it to.

322
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,700
The other half were willing to risk their
lives to see Santa's junk.

323
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,472
That's Rose.

324
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,020
Congratulations, loser.

325
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,594
What? What do you mean,
you're way ahead?

326
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,126
Lonny, prepare to cash in your pension,

327
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:49,311
because I have an exciting new
investment opportunity.

328
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,341
They're called derivatives,
and you can't lose.

329
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:55,214
Multiple buyers owe a balance of payments
on their gift wrap,

330
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,401
and so you buy shares of pooled debt,

331
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,043
generating long-term dividends
with minimal risk.

332
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,928
That's how I bought my house.
I'm in.

333
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,156
Damn, she's good.

334
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,172
Veronica has been busy all afternoon.

335
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:11,756
She wasn't just gonna hand me my ass,

336
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:13,700
she was gonna hand it to me gift wrapped.

337
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,700
Analysts project that wrapping paper sales
are going to improve,

338
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,740
so if you buy futures now
with the option to sell later,

339
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,890
you can anticipate a
robust return.

340
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,300
Veronica, what are you doing?

341
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,540
Sorry, Ted.

342
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:27,820
I've put Rose so far ahead,
there's no way anyone can catch her.

343
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:31,830
Although, there's a 3% chance
she could end up in jail.

344
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,608
Fine. You win.

345
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:35,670
I like when that happens,

346
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,077
and it happens a lot.

347
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,950
<i>Rose was gonna be upset
Cynthia didn't win.</i>

348
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:46,380
<i>I wasn't thrilled, either, because
it meant I had to have a lovely dinner</i>

349
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,520
<i>with the General to convince him
to pay more for the solar ovens.</i>

350
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:52,638
A body like a young Mark Spitz.

351
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,654
Well, thank you, General.
I can't hear that enough.

352
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:59,975
Although, five times is getting pretty close.

353
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:01,739
So...

354
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,345
let's talk business.

355
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,510
I think we can go an additional 10 cents per unit.

356
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,564
Really?

357
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:09,743
That-- that's terrific.

358
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,745
You're a handsome man, Ted.

359
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:14,810
I hope that's not inappropriate for me to say.

360
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,195
It's just a fact.

361
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:18,470
Everybody's so damn touchy nowadays,

362
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,626
I- I never know what the rules are.

363
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,480
Time was, all we had to do was kill people.

364
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:26,215
Now we have to leave them with parting gifts.

365
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:27,875
Parting gifts.

366
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,075
Are you propositioning me?

367
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,467
What?

368
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:33,700
No.

369
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:37,510
It's just... These solar ovens,
they're not meant as handouts.

370
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:39,160
They're meant as gifts, right?

371
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:42,757
And if you want a gift to be appreciated,
it should be presented as a gift.

372
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,545
That's interesting.

373
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:48,082
Of course, coming from that mouth,
everything's interesting.

374
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:52,830
I am a competitive guy.

375
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,210
I make no apologies for that.

376
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,260
If I see a way to win, I'm gonna take it.

377
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:01,021
<i>And so I sold $5 million of
wrapping paper to the military,</i>

378
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,206
<i>and I did it in Cynthia's name.</i>

379
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,290
<i>She won the trip to Disneyland,</i>

380
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,030
<i>Rose could keep going to school,</i>

381
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,535
<i>and I beat Veronica.</i>

382
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:11,530
No, you didn't. You still had
to go to dinner with the General.

383
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,150
I sold more wrapping paper than you.

384
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,600
That's not what we were competing over.

385
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,310
It was one of the things we were competing over.

386
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,190
You're so competitive, it's sick.

387
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,580
Not as sick as you.

388
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:21,047
That's right. I win.

389
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:22,561
Again.

390
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:31,610
Hey, do you think that patch could've
had any other side effects?

391
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:34,210
Because I-- I've been really itchy lately.

392
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,460
Well, itchiness is a side effect of many drugs.

393
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,500
Sure beats crazy, though, doesn't it?

394
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:42,040
I- I guess. It's just, my back is so scratchy.

395
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:45,108
Maybe I should see a doctor
or a lawyer or something.

396
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,320
As scientists with very little money,

397
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,160
we suggest you don't see a lawyer.

398
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:54,655
- We could take a look.
- Would you?

399
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:04,870
Feathers?

400
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,750
She's growing feathers.

401
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,630
- Oh, my god. What do we do?
- Calm down. Just stay calm.

402
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,202
- Feathers.
- What?

403
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,212
Did he just say "feathers"?

404
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:14,597
You'll be fine.

405
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:18,010
- Chicken lady! Chicken lady!
- No, I can't be a chicken lady.

406
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,050
I have so much I want to do in my life.

407
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,560
I want to get married and have children

408
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,990
and glue feathers to my back
to mess with idiot scientists

409
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,680
who are careless with experimental drugs.

410
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:29,820
You can still do all those things!

411
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,263
Oh, wait.

412
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,315
Well, now we're even.

413
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,730
And next time you dose me...

414
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,615
you better finish the job.

415
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,580
Hi, Veronica.

416
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,593
Hi, crazy pants.

417
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,270
Listen, about what I said the other day...

418
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:50,860
You called me powerful and
complimented my calves.

419
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,220
That's all I remember.

420
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,180
Oh, good. So you're not mad?

421
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:55,940
You're obsessed with me, Linda.

422
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,759
I like that about you.

423
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,747
No, I'm not.

424
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,218
Everyone in this place is nuts.
