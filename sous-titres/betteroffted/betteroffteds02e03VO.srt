1
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,581
The potential for a long-lasting
light bulb is enormous.

2
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:12,083
In a recent study,
people's desire to see things

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,973
ranked third, right after hitting things
and trying to have sex with things.

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:18,893
- And if people could...
- Hey! That's my doughnut!

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,478
Shut up. Ted's talking.

6
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,357
By leveling the current,
we have increased bulb life by 38%.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,318
This is the greatest leap
in bulb technology since...

8
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:30,154
Interesting fact...
The original light bulb shape

9
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,699
was patterned off Edison's neighbor,
whose head was hideously enormous.

10
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,193
This bulb{\ lasts so long, it } will be giving off light
well after you're dead.

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,926
Gentlemen, when you fight like that,
manhood weeps.

12
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:48,165
Nice work. {\, Ted. }You've made
a super long-lasting light bulb.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,384
{\And Since }That's the name of this project,
your instincts are spot-on.

14
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,409
Thank you, everybody.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,639
The company will love this.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,432
{\And }I can't get enough of{\the company's} its love.

17
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:00,735
{\Maybe }You and the company
should spend a weekend

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,295
in wine country{\together}, share
a couple of bottles one evening,

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,398
maybe convince it
not to wear panties to dinner.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,028
You should jump on that,{\Ted,}
before the crazy outweighs the hot.

21
00:01:11,993 --> 00:01:15,825
{\So There's}A famous{\ theoretical } physicist, {\named}Stella Clifton,
is giving a lecture tonight.

22
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,119
She's on the company's radar,
{\and }I'd like for you

23
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,265
to go talk to her
about {\... coming to }working here.

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,958
I'd emphasize the salary she'd make
and downplay {\the way}how we treat people.

25
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,972
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

26
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,213
Hiring {\stella clifton}her would be a huge mistake.

27
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,133
She's arrogant {\super critical}and hangs
her wet bras on everything.

28
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,011
{\I mean, }That's the buzz
in the physics chat rooms.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,684
Stella Clifton is Lem's mom.

30
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:44,562
He doesn't want {\people}us to know
{\because }he's {\always} felt overshadowed by her.

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,313
{\So }You're saying we have an in?

32
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,212
{\I'm saying, }Can't we just let this one go?

33
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:50,470
Wouldn't be the first time
we didn't hire a {\... brilliant}scientist

34
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:52,270
'cos someone {\at the company}here would be upset.

35
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:55,990
- Remember Bob Hitler?
- I forgot the scientist named Hitler.

36
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,962
{\Okay,}Fine. We won't go after Lem's mom.

37
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,892
But this would be easier
to sell upstairs

38
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:03,289
if someone named Clifton had
bombed the hell out of London.

39
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,635
- Good morning, Phil.
- You're late.

40
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:13,638
Were you up watching
that documentary on moss?

41
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:16,093
Can you believe how much
that stuff likes shade?

42
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,511
It just goes nuts.

43
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,306
No, I was up because my mom
was having sex with some guy.

44
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,295
{\Either that, }Or they were using her bed to hammer

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,394
a very stubborn nail into the wall.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,321
It's not right
the way she treats you.

47
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,285
She's so inconsiderate.

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,287
She's like Rhodesian wet moss.

49
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:34,032
That stuff doesn't give a damn
who it hurts.

50
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:37,123
Good morning!
I had sex last night.

51
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,408
That's right.
Dirty, sloppy sex.

52
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,673
Truly, gentlemen,
my hips were a blur.

53
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:43,412
I went to
the Stella Clifton lecture,

54
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,201
afterwards we started to chat.{\ and hit it off. }
So we went to a bar...

55
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:48,667
Tell me you met another woman there
and went home with her.

56
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,340
I did meet another woman.

57
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,776
She wasn't interested, I went home
with Stella and porked her all night.

58
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,729
Oh, god! Oh, god!

59
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,596
Yeah, she sounded just like that.

60
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,410
- I had a great idea.
- You should have come{\ in here}

61
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:05,935
holding a bulb{\ over your head} so I could tell.

62
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,089
Yesterday I was in my cubicle,
and a fly got caught in my lamp,

63
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,544
- and it started to cook.
- That's not really an idea.

64
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,906
That's more of an unpleasant anecdote
or a cautionary tale for flies.

65
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:17,574
No, the bulb kept giving off
this putrid smell,

66
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,879
so I sprayed perfume on it.
Today when I turned my lamp on,

67
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,828
my whole cubicle smelled pretty.
And so I thought...

68
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,748
We should develop a line
of scented light bulbs.

69
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,761
And react positively.

70
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,231
You hate it.

71
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,014
All I ever do
is test other people's ideas.

72
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,886
I was so excited to finally
come up with one of my own.

73
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,222
But you're right.
It's stupid.

74
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,564
I should die like a light bulb fly.

75
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:48,662
No, it's not stupid. It's just,
I have spent years developing

76
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:51,772
this bulb, I don't want to distract
the company with a different one.

77
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,629
Not to oversell it,
but mine will save the world,

78
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:57,653
Veridian will change its name
to Ted's awesome light bulb company.

79
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,664
Perfect.
Now I can tell my joke.

80
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:08,762
How many product testers does
it take to change a light bulb?

81
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,367
Ted hated my idea.

82
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,742
- No.
- Seven.

83
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,878
The end needs work.

84
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,048
I told Ted about scented light bulb,
he didn't think we should do it.

85
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:20,843
I think a scented light bulb
is a good idea.

86
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,888
- You think it's worth pursuing?
- No, I don't.

87
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,640
- I'm kidding. I like it.
- You do?

88
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,269
- Seriously.
- What are we doing now?

89
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,182
I'm showing you that you care
too much what people think.

90
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,024
Successful people don't do that.

91
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,699
You've gotta be confident.
You've got a good idea,

92
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:40,696
- You shouldn't let anyone stop you.
- Really? It's a good idea?

93
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,655
I don't.

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,611
Well, I do.

95
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,829
That's why it takes seven
testers to change a light bulb.

96
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:56,429
So I took Linda's idea
for scented light bulbs

97
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,422
upstairs to Chet, and he loved it.

98
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,901
Really?

99
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,213
- You went over my head on this?
- No. I just went out your door

100
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,945
- and ran into Veronica.
- Then she went over your head.

101
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,559
The company sees this as a new way
to market light bulbs to women.

102
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,811
Since you thought of the idea
and you're a woman,

103
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,835
even though your shoes
argue otherwise,

104
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,691
the company wants you
to co-run the project with Ted.

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,818
That's fantastic.

106
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,825
Are you okay with this?
Please be okay with this.

107
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,894
It would be great
if we could work together

108
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,575
on a project that I came up with.

109
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,913
Of course.
I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,084
- It is going to be...
- And your light bulb project is dead.

111
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:36,632
Fantastic.

112
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,304
- Mommy?
- Hello, sweetheart.

113
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,139
How was your day
at the crap factory?

114
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:52,059
You know, sometimes I feel like
you judge what I do.

115
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,822
I'm not judging you.
I weighed the empirical evidence

116
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,022
and came to an objective conclusion.

117
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,774
You're wasting your talent.

118
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,361
It's like Jackson Pollock
painting cars for $99.95.

119
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:05,051
Listen...

120
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,241
I wanted to talk
to you about Dr. Bhamba.

121
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,559
My new lover?

122
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,746
It's just, you two dating
is making it awkward for me at work.

123
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:16,583
Heaven forbid I've slowed production
of the latest worthless gadget.

124
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,295
What will people do without a helmet
that feeds them cheeseburgers

125
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,589
or a remote control
for their underpants?

126
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,757
We're not making
a cheeseburger helmet.

127
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,522
They pulled the plug

128
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,762
after it fed
a test subject to death.

129
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,256
I'm sorry, but I'm not
giving up my Bhamba.

130
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,725
He's a very special man.

131
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:37,479
This robe is so short, if I were a bell,
you could almost see my clapper.

132
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,274
I'm never calling you daddy.

133
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,483
Never, never!

134
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,135
I am happy for Linda.

135
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,218
Yay, Linda.

136
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,554
But the long-lasting bulb
is important to me.

137
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,531
Taking my feelings
completely out of it,

138
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:56,056
it is way better than
Linda's dumb, smelly bulb.

139
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,876
Ted, I see what's going on here.

140
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,534
You're worried that after years
of the company adoring you,

141
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,174
a new Linda has come along, they may
not have enough love for both of you.

142
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,565
I am not worried about that.

143
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,345
- That's what's happening?
- I know what you're going through.

144
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,097
When my little sister
came along, I was very jealous.

145
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,895
That feeling never went away.

146
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,692
Even I put testosterone
in her orange juice

147
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:21,231
she became hairy and unlovable,
got kicked off her team for doping.

148
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,235
Oh, my god!

149
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,117
I was not a perfect child,

150
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:27,112
my parents only had so much love,

151
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,387
I got it, and monkey girl didn't.

152
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:32,262
Anyway, don't be like that.

153
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,993
Maybe Bhamba's
not talking about your mom.

154
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:46,423
Maybe he's talking about the time
he won that Hula-Hoop competition.

155
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,759
And that's how I won
the hula-hoop competition...

156
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:52,570
And developed the pelvic stamina
to satisfy the sexual desires

157
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,765
of the famous Dr. Stella Clifton.

158
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,660
I can't believe your mom
is doing this to you.

159
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,630
She's not going to stop
seeing Bhamba?

160
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,926
Nope. I spent my whole life
trying not to be

161
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,775
just the son of Stella Clifton,

162
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,272
and now that's all anyone's going
to be talking about.

163
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:10,436
Hey, it's Stella Clifton's son!
Welcome to Veridian.

164
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:12,661
We expect great things from you.

165
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,202
I've been working here for 11 years.

166
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,946
I doubt that.
Great to have you on board.

167
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,920
Everybody's here.

168
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,043
Everybody's here.

169
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,260
You're co-leading,
but that doesn't mean repeating.

170
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,156
Maybe you're repeating what I say
before I get a chance to say it.

171
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,889
Why don't you take the meeting?

172
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,724
All right, I will.
Ted, bring us up to speed.

173
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,279
First of all, let's talk
about a time line.

174
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:42,312
Time line.

175
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,894
Some of us who have
never run a project before

176
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,652
may not realize it can take years to go
from an idea to a workable prototype.

177
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,005
- Am I right, fellas?
- Absolutely.

178
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,593
In this case, the concept
was so elegantly simple

179
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,749
that we banged one out this morning.

180
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:01,373
Interesting. So then I would be
safe to say...

181
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,295
Yours smells like pumpkin pie.
Mine could slow climate change.

182
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,012
When the ice caps melt,

183
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:11,175
we'll need that to cover up
the stench of the dead polar bears.

184
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,522
How long would it take to develop
new technology

185
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,429
so that he can go screw himself?

186
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,676
- We're not prepared to...
- Don't talk.

187
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,185
This isn't about us.

188
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,564
Look... I think
it's gonna be impossible

189
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,191
for us to co-lead these meetings.

190
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,194
Can't take a little heat,
like your precious polar bears?

191
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,571
How did I get on the crazy side
of climate change?

192
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,239
There she is.

193
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,418
Linda, you remember my boss Chet?

194
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,537
You better watch out for this one.
She could be the new Ted,

195
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
a super sweet smelling Ted.

196
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
That's just my bulbs, sir.

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,879
Very funny. You tiptoed right up
to the line but didn't cross it.

198
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,852
Yeah. She's a sharp one.

199
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:52,413
Watch your back, stud.

200
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,969
Once again, sir,
right up to the line.

201
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,639
This project is going to be great.

202
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,349
I hope so, sir.

203
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,726
What do you mean, you hope so?

204
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,270
Nothing. I just hope
everything goes well.

205
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:08,232
Why wouldn't it?
Is there a problem, Veronica?

206
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,858
Not at all. It's a home run.

207
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,778
Linda was just doing a funny character
she's been working on.

208
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,115
It's a product tester
whose lack of confidence

209
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,834
traps her in a sad cubicle
where she dies old and alone

210
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,660
without ever owning a decent purse.

211
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,420
As long as she never does it again,
I don't see the harm.

212
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,558
There's a meeting on your project
tomorrow with the department heads.

213
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:34,508
If you want to be in the game, you'll
have to show a lot more confidence.

214
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,843
I love that one.
I hate that one,

215
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:38,905
and bring me chicken for lunch.

216
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,349
- What were those?
- I have no idea,

217
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,365
but did you see how confident I was?

218
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,270
So confident, I'm getting chicken.

219
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,147
Now you try it.

220
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:52,693
- What do I tell him to do?
- Doesn't matter. Make sure he does it.

221
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,282
Lose the tie, hippie.

222
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,325
What?
What's wrong with my tie?

223
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,912
Are you questioning me?
Oh, that's rich. I said lose it!

224
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,999
And bring me a chicken.

225
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:11,752
Very nicely done.

226
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:15,716
Today, we feast on chicken,
although you may be getting a live one.

227
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,475
Why are you looking up
my mother's Facebook page?

228
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,090
I'm going to find her, seduce her,

229
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:30,605
and make sensitive
yet vigorous love to her.

230
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,682
Well, that's the one thing we haven't
tried to get her out of the coma.

231
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,142
Maybe I could save you
three very weird minutes.

232
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:40,324
Things between your mother and I
have hit a rough patch.

233
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,505
What do I do with that world's greatest
step-dad coffee mug I got for you?

234
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,282
Guess I have to take it back
to the sarcasm store.

235
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,379
It's just, Stella is so intelligent,

236
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,375
I'm starting to feel
like an idiot around her.

237
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,807
I know what you mean.
She's always reminding me

238
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,091
that while she's unlocking
the secrets of the universe,

239
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,716
I'm trying to design a toaster
that can handle a pizza bagel.

240
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,177
That would be a boon
to both Jews and Italians.

241
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,870
You're a very good scientist, Lem.

242
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:05,108
You shouldn't feel
inferior to your mother.

243
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,350
Neither should you.

244
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,522
Your breakthroughs in weaponry
have made warfare more horrifying.

245
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,606
Well, I don't know about that.

246
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,188
It takes a village
to kill a village.

247
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,366
If only we could show your mother
we're intellectually worthy of her.

248
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,181
I'm out of ideas.

249
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:26,342
I helped put a satellite into orbit when
I was 11 but it wasn't "geosynchronous,"

250
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:29,242
so she wouldn't even look up
when it went over our house.

251
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,176
We're both smart.

252
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,272
Maybe if we work together,
we could do something to impress her...

253
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:38,423
Like a toaster that tracks down enemies
and burns them evenly on both sides.

254
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,261
- No, not that.
- Or something she would appreciate...

255
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,514
Something theoretical,
with no practical application whatever.

256
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,316
Just to be clear, it has to be science.
Not just a great dance move.

257
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,680
Come on. One great idea.

258
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:01,480
Light bulbs that... Taste good.

259
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,716
No, that sucks! I suck.

260
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:05,894
No wonder the company's gone off me.

261
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,959
So "suck" is okay to say now?

262
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,247
'cause I have some thoughts
about my lunch.

263
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,478
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm just a little frustrated.

264
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,757
I'm trying to figure out something
the company would really appreciate.

265
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,953
Why don't you just ask the company
what it wants?

266
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,759
I always like it on my birthday
when you ask me what I want.

267
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,177
The company doesn't know what it...

268
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,101
That's it. That's what they want.
I'll get them Stella Clifton.

269
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,895
Thank you, honey.

270
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,283
If you think about it, it's not hard
to figure out what people want,

271
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:40,525
especially if they tell you
over and over again.

272
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,530
We're not getting a motorcycle
with a sidecar. It's just not practical.

273
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:44,781
We'll see.

274
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:53,676
What's 4 plus 8?

275
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:55,935
I don't know. A triangle?

276
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,143
I'm very tired.

277
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,368
What is all this?

278
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,550
Trying to earn my mother's respect by
solving Clifton's unfinished equation,

279
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:08,505
which, as the name implies,
she's been unable to finish.

280
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,977
Lem, you shouldn't have
to prove anything to your mom.

281
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,536
You're great,

282
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,773
and if she can't see that,
then she is an insensitive idiot

283
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,525
who happens to be hot and sexy.

284
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,608
I am still a man.

285
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,475
- Ready for the meeting?
- We have to cancel.

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,624
Ted's disappeared,
and I just found out,

287
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,752
if you leave the scented bulbs on for
three days, it smells like rotting meat.

288
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,290
Linda, listen to yourself.
Those are just facts,

289
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,133
and facts are just opinions,
and opinions can be wrong.

290
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,886
The only thing that is
never wrong is confidence.

291
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,707
- But...
- No buts. I brought this upstairs,

292
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,132
and your failure will be my failure.

293
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,018
You can do this.
I know you can.

294
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,870
Now get in there and run that meeting
like a shark driving an assault vehicle

295
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:01,410
through a herd of seals
wearing chum pants.

296
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:02,943
I'll do it.

297
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,990
And so with aromas ranging from
Zucchini bread to fresh laundry,

298
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,492
the scented light bulb
has zero downside.

299
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:14,162
I heard that after a couple of days,
the bulb stinks like rotting meat.

300
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,753
Then you, sir, are the stupidest man
who's ever lived.

301
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:24,077
- What?
- What?

302
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,275
I'm an executive who says, "what?"

303
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,395
What are you, 2? You're the one
who smells like rotting meat.

304
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,225
Finish him.

305
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,431
Oh, my god.
You're jealous of the light bulb.

306
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,580
That's what this is about.
You hate light and smell.

307
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,354
What in the name of God
did your parents do to you?

308
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:44,234
Saunders, take your weird,
emotional issues and get out.

309
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,416
- Sorry.
- No weakness.

310
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,785
Anyone else hear any stupid rumors
about my light bulb? Come on, bring it.

311
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,600
<i>So I took Stella Clifton to dinner to
convince her to come work for Veridian.</i>

312
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:06,006
<i>And I brought Phil along in case the
conversation got all science-y on me.</i>

313
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,848
If you join the Veridian team,

314
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:10,677
you would have access to
unmatched scientific resources,

315
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,523
from hydro-percolation
non gravitational calibrators

316
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,166
to executives who only know
the name of one cool thing

317
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,018
but will stay out of your way.

318
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,020
I've always felt that
when science is seduced by commerce,

319
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:23,615
scientists become
intellectual prostitutes...

320
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,067
Mind sluts, brain whores.

321
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,111
We don't have to pay you.

322
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,933
So, Phil,
you've been a little quiet.

323
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,909
Why don't you tell Dr. Clifton
what you like about working at Veridian?

324
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:39,289
You're a bitch.

325
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,876
And there's a gym,
which has a little juice bar.

326
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,877
Who needs to exercise at a gym when
you've got your son's ego to beat up on?

327
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,760
Phillip Myman,
if I am a little hard on Lem,

328
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,970
it's because I'm helping him by pointing
out potential areas for improvement.

329
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,557
When Ted asked me to come tonight,
I agreed for one reason...

330
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,615
To tell you that your son
is a great guy

331
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,729
and a brilliant scientist,

332
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,096
and if you don't want him to go through
life feeling like crap about himself,

333
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,485
you should tell him you're proud of him
once in a while.

334
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,988
This is my fault. I should not have
let Phil have his own grown-up drink.

335
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,365
And you.

336
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:16,616
You're so desperate to score points
with the company,

337
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,432
you're trying to hire
this hot, sexy woman

338
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:22,381
even though you know
it would destroy Lem.

339
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,272
Yes, I think you're sexy.

340
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,719
Yes, I don't have
a lot of grown-up drinks,

341
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,589
and, yes, I wish I had a third yes.

342
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,300
And, yes, I don't.

343
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,310
Ted. What a surprise.
You missed a good meeting today.

344
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:49,109
I lied and then crushed the spirit
of the only honest man in the room.

345
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,846
Listen... I want to help you
with your light bulb,

346
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,075
and mean really help you this time,
not get all pissy and competitive.

347
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,953
Why? Linda wonders suspiciously.

348
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,540
'cause I realized tonight that
chasing the company's approval

349
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,472
has turned me into a childish,
approval-chasing butt-head.

350
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,083
Those were Phil's words
when I drove him home.

351
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,171
He also accused me
of being blurry and spinny.

352
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,759
Well, I haven't behaved perfectly
either, Linda says contritely.

353
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:19,055
- Why are you talking like that?
- It's easier for me to say I'm sorry.

354
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,224
Even though I have mostly
contempt for the company,

355
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,736
it still felt nice when they
patted me on the head.

356
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,011
And that made me act all gloaty,

357
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,107
Linda explained explanatorily.

358
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,704
Well, it's okay,

359
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:32,944
Ted said, using his mouth.

360
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,490
I'm glad we don't talk like this
all the time, he added.

361
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:48,206
That can't be a 7,
or the sky would be green.

362
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,657
Mom. What brings you to the place
where, as you say,

363
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,839
"science bends over
and grabs its ankles"?

364
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,707
I just wanted to see
what my son was up to.

365
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,303
Why are you wasting your time
working on my stuff?

366
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:02,098
Why don't you show me
what you're working on?

367
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,477
- You're gonna think it's stupid.
- I won't.

368
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:13,401
Popcorn that pops
from the heat in your mouth.

369
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,587
It's pretty cool, actually.

370
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:29,000
I think I put too much in.

371
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:34,252
- Can I try one?
- Are you sure?

372
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:36,264
It's fresh from the crap factory.

373
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,223
I like it.

374
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:44,974
Really?

375
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,478
I'm sorry I never
looked up at your satellite.

376
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,232
It's okay. It's coming
around again in 2015.

377
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:55,276
It's a date.
You bring the popcorn.

378
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,946
Crocodiles!

379
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,281
Oh! I was having a dream.

380
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:03,440
The only thing I remember was
a curious lack of crocodiles,

381
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,865
and so I began to call out for them.

382
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:12,182
Look at the boards.

383
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:15,004
See how smart I am?
I taped three of them together.

384
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,465
Who cares if you're smart?
You're great in the sack.

385
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,115
Really?

386
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,838
<i>Eventually, working together,</i>

387
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:26,681
<i>Linda and I found a solution
to her stinking bulb problem.</i>

388
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:28,853
I just wanted to say
thanks for mentoring me,

389
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,210
but I can't keep faking
the crazy-confident thing.

390
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,379
It's making me more crazy
than confident.

391
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:36,809
That's fine, Linda. You are weak
and so will never be a threat to me.

392
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,706
That's perhaps
your greatest quality.

393
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:41,449
And I realized that whether
it's a giant, multinational company

394
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,607
or your own mother, you should
never chase someone else's approval.

395
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:47,597
Hey, Ted, I heard you pitched in
on the light bulb. Nice work.

396
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:49,873
Really? You think so?

397
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:51,708
God, that felt good.
