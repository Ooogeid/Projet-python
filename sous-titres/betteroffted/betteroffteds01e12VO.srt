00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>The environment...</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,433
<i>Everyone likes it,
and so we do, too.</i>

4
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:14,513
<i>That's why we're committed
to saving.</i>

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,076
<i>Veridian dynamics is turning
every one of our buildings</i>

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,435
<i>100% green.</i>

7
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:22,104
<i>It's ridiculously expensive</i>

8
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,923
<i>and spending money makes us sad.</i>

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,875
<i>But we're doing it
because we love nature,</i>

10
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,529
<i>even when it's being mean</i>

11
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,479
<i>or just acting stupid...</i>

12
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,537


13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,330
<i>I'm an honest guy, and yet,
I'm about to lie to 2,000 people.</i>

14
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:47,169
We're in it now. Ted.
Go big or go home.

15
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,317
I can go home?

16
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,690
That stage is your home. Go.

17
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,265
<i>So how did I get here?</i>

18
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,335
<i>Because I like a girl,</i>

19
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,768
<i>specifically this girl.</i>

20
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,488
<i>And like so many stories
about a girl,</i>

21
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>this one starts with gunplay.</i>

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,158
OK, fellas.
What are we looking at here?

23
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,962
This is the new unbreakable dinnerware
we've been developing.

24
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,026
It's made from our new polymer, yo.

25
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,332
When you talk like that,
it just makes you whiter.

26
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,502
- How much does this weigh?
- 8 pounds, 4 ounces.

27
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,258
- 8 pounds?
- 4 ounces.

28
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,871
I know I asked for an unbreakable dish,
but it doesn't have to take a bullet.

29
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,113
What kind of dinner parties
do you go to?

30
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:35,895
Show me a lighter version.

31
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:42,810
- We've disappointed him.
- No one would want to be us now,

32
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,054
and since we are us,
it's very difficult.

33
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:46,694
Agreed.

34
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:52,586
- Where are we on the...
- unbreakable dinnerware?

35
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:54,609
- It's not really...
- Well, then just...

36
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,614
- I don't think we've to go that far.
- Good,

37
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,445
- but make sure...
- I will.

38
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:01,761
We have worked together so long,
we have a shorthand,

39
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:03,525
an understanding, a trust.

40
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:08,832
I saw this Veridian commercial that
said they're greening their buildings.

41
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:11,255
Sure. The company does
a lot of good things, like...

42
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,489
- Greening their buildings?
- There's one.

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,216
They also have stopped
their logging operations.

44
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,026
Because they ran out of trees.

45
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:20,899
What do you want?

46
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,785
I was hoping maybe I could work
with the group doing our building.

47
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,255
I was reading this stuff about
roof gardens. They're amazing.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,648
They can cut air conditioning costs
by 30%.

49
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:33,637
Plus, our roof would look 70% prettier,
so that's 100% right there.

50
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,200
Please?

51
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,511
Well, the math seems sound.

52
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:42,203
- Let me clear it with Veronica.
- Really? Excellent. Thank you.

53
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,673
Sorry.
That was just platonic...

54
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,086
- Oh, yeah, I got that.
- 'cause I've a boyfriend...

55
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,733
- 'Cause you weren't interested in me.
- It wasn't you.

56
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,382
Why bringing this up?
Just go get me my garden.

57
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,398
There is no program
to green the building.

58
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,121
They made a commercial about it.

59
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:04,090
I didn't say there wasn't a commercial


60
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,976
I said there is no program.

61
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,771
So it's all a lie?

62
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,558
They prefer to look at it as a dream.

63
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,155
But one they're not working towards.

64
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,695
Are you working toward
all of your dreams, Ted?

65
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,116
Then stop pointing fingers.

66
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,109
How am I gonna tell Linda the one
Veridian project she believes in

67
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,393
is all a big lie?

68
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,085
She sometimes has a problem
with what we do here.

69
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,557
If we make this, it could kill
all the world's fish.

70
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,470
But, boy, does it whiten teeth.

71
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,765
- All the world's fish or just...
- Why are we even talking about this?

72
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,206
There she is.
I'm just gonna tell her the truth.

73
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,776
Well?

74
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,812
You're in.

75
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,898
- Or completely lie to her.
- Really? That's fantastic.

76
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,984
It's a dream come true.

77
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:00,158
I didn't see anything.

78
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:05,471
The rest of the team is working
on other really good green projects,

79
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,986
so you're gonna do
the roof garden by yourself.

80
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,541
- Wow. That's a lot of work.
- So don't do it.

81
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,871
- I want to do it.
- All right.

82
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,894
But you can't tell anybody .

83
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,548
The company has classified this
as confidential.

84
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,634
But it's a good thing. Why does
it need to be confidential?

85
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,986
Because, uh, if only bad things
were confidential,

86
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,309
When there's something "confidential,"
people would know it was bad

87
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,644
- That's weird.
- I know. So don't do it.

88
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:32,356
I want to do it.

89
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,231
Good. Welcome to the team...

90
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,490
Which is only you.

91
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,073
So I lied. But you saw that face.
Who wouldn't lie to that face?

92
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,191
Look at all this stuff.

93
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,395
All right, guys.
Let's get it on the roof.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,248
<i>Plus, I figure if she's successful,</i>

95
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:57,528
I can sell it as a prototype
for all Veridian buildings.

96
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,360
Welcome to the big city, fellas.

97
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:03,189
So what's the deal?
Are you guys fighting or having sex?

98
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:05,988
I know.
One always follows the other.

99
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,994
To fund the project,
I had to move some money around.

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,416
I've never done
anything like that before,

101
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,459
but people do it all the time, right?

102
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:18,898
At a company this big, no one
ever notices where the money is.

103
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:22,488
Ted, I've noticed some money's missing,
and I need to know where it is.

104
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:29,059
Do you know where the money is?
Because the company loves its money.

105
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,989
The money, it's not missing.

106
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:35,190
- Good. Then where is it?
- Well, it's...

107
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:40,108
It's been moved to...

108
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,842
The Jabberwocky project.

109
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,220
Jabberwocky?

110
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,389
You know about Jabberwocky?

111
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,475
You're higher up the chain
than I am.

112
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,729
It's going to revolutionize
the way we do business.

113
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,493
- Don't tell me you don't know about...
- Of course I know about Jabberwocky.

114
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,729
It's gonna revolutionize
the way we do business.

115
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,875
You obviously know
more about it than I do.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,130
And I always will.
Keep me posted.

117
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,793
There's no Jabberwocky project.

118
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,658
I don't normally lie to Veronica.
In fact, I never do.

119
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,625
But I had to cover the lie
I told Linda.

120
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:19,160
Jabberwocky?
What the...

121
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,271
Veronica didn't question me

122
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,944
'Cause the worst thing that can happen
is to be out of the loop.

123
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,691
<i>If you're out of the loop,
you're out of a job.</i>

124
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,815
You wanted to see me, Chet?

125
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,407
There's some money missing
from your department.

126
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,776
It's not missing.

127
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,030
It's been moved to the
Jabberwocky project. 

128
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,904
Yes. That's right.

129
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,016
I see.

130
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,266
You do know about Jabberwocky,

131
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,125
don't you?

132
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,826
Of course I do. I just
didn't know that you knew.

133
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,793
How could I not know?
It's in my department.

134
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,355
Isn't it?

135
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:58,484
Exactly.

136
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,636
So we both know what it is.

137
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,484
Yes. We do.

138
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,436
Don't we?

139
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,405
Yes, we do.

140
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:19,057
Ted, we now have a plate
that weighs less than 5 ounces.

141
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,607
And it's still unbreakable.

142
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,859
- Watch.
- You can't fire a gun in here.

143
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,906
Alan ruined that for everybody.

144
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,447
But check this out.

145
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,077
Yqou were right.

146
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,770
That polymer could burst
into flames on high impact.

147
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:38,306
You owe me a smoothie.

148
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,474
I'm going to leave this here.

149
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,471
Sorry about that, Kathy.

150
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:49,351
But better than that time
Alan shot at you, right?

151
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,987
I'm gonna have to pull the plug
on this thing.

152
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,013
Wait.

153
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,559
What if we could come up
with a use for a burning plate?

154
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,180
A plate you could also
cook your food on.

155
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,069
- A plate that is also a stove.
- Aplove.

156
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,319
Yeah, I don't think so.
Everyone goes through a slump.

157
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,105
Did you hear that? Now he
thinks we're in a slump.

158
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,518
Oh, god. My mom's gonna be so upset.

159
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,541
She hates when we disappoint Ted.

160
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,676
- You don't have to tell her everything.
- You don't know her.

161
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,427
She gets things out of you.

162
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,953
It's revolutionize the way
we do business.

163
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,669
I gotta get on this Jabberwocky thing.

164
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,765
My wife is pregnant again. I need a
winner. 

165
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,430
I'll put in a good word for you.

166
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,207
- You're on Jabberwocky?
- Cleared half my schedule for it.

167
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,966
It's a freakin' game-changer.

168
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,002
Just once in my career,
I'd like to change a game.

169
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,414
Oh, man, this lie is spreading
like mayonnaise at a baptist picnic.

170
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,485
This is crazy. I haven't gotten
anything done all day.

171
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,070
Everyone just keeps pestering me
to get on Jabberwocky.

172
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,532
- I was talking to Brett and...
- I'm going through a tunnel.

173
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,867
I'll call you back. 

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,452
Listen, Veronica,
I need to tell you something.

175
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,609
Hey, guys. Isn't this a great day?
I am so happy.

176
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:05,169
I need to tell you
that she is so happy.

177
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,839
- Can I borrow him for a second?
- She needs to borrow me for a second.

178
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,558
I wish I had the power
to make everyone go away.

179
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh, wait. I do.

180
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,663
Here, taste this tea.

181
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,180
- Why?
- Just taste it.

182
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,817
- How do you like it?
- I don't know. It tastes like tea.

183
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,184
- It's made from urine.
- God.

184
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,866
Don't worry. It's safe.

185
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:39,105
It's safe, but it's
also made from urine.

186
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,319
You need to work on your flirting.

187
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:44,211
Larry in engineering gave me
this water purification system,

188
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:47,453
and I've been talking to people about
things we can do to green the building.

189
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,121
You're supposed to be working
on the confidential. 

190
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,298
- Don't take on any more than that.
- Why not?

191
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:55,207
Why not? Why not?
You remember Alan?

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,723
Remember how much he tried to take on?
Think about it.

193
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:06,252
- Why aren't we on Jabberwocky?
- We need to be on it. 

194
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:10,246
Oh, I thought we decided
to go with aggressive.

195
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,904
All right, I give up.
I gotta tell you the truth.

196
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,367
- There's no Jabberwocky.
- Don't give me that crap!

197
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,944
Too aggressive. Felt it
as soon as it came out.

198
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,213
I'm telling you, it doesn't exist.
I made it up.

199
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,238
Come on.

200
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,574
When my mom hears you didn't put
us on it, she's gonna change the locks.

201
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,547
Guys, there's no such thing as...
Wait, your mom knows about it?

202
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,627
He tells her everything,
Ted. It's a sickness.

203
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,388
He's cutting us out.
Because we failed him.

204
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,467
- We need to make him believe in us.
- Agreed.

205
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:45,742
- It's nice to see you calm.
- I hated what I was turning into.

206
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,956
Jabberwocky was getting out of control.
I had to kill it, 

207
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,881
<i>the best way to kill a rumor is
with another rumor.</i>

208
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:58,639
Keep this to yourself,
I hear it's not a game-changer at all.

209
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:01,062
I hear it's a game-staying-the-samer.

210
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,551
Total career-killer.
People can't leave it fast enough.

211
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,195
Don't go anywhere near it.

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,239
I'm telling you this
'cause I like you...

213
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,569
<i>Unfortunately, Jabberwocky
had gotten too big.</i>

214
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,678
<i>It's like trying to kill
a bear with a chopstick.</i>

215
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,550
<i>I'm not saying it can't be done,
it's just super-duper hard.</i>

216
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,717
And so we're looking for a way to make
Ted feel good about us again

217
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,165
Any ideas?

218
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,700
I don't know.
Buy him a candle.

219
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:28,220
That's not gonna fly.
Ted hates things that light on fire.

220
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,492
- Ted likes Linda.
- You wanna give him Linda?

221
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:33,025
I wasn't thinking that, but...

222
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,069
I will be given to no man!

223
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:40,365
I saw that in a movie once.

224
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:42,079
Nothing.

225
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,571
What if we just help her with
whatever project she's working on?

226
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,868
Yeah, Ted might
appreciate us doing that.

227
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,568
Say, Linda, what are you working on?

228
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,409
Oh, you're talking to me again.

229
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, I'm not supposed to tell anyone,
but I could use some help.

230
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:01,490
I'm building a roof garden,
and I need

231
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:04,001
a super energy-efficient way
to light it at night.

232
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,689
- Have you considered a plove?
- No, forget the plove.

233
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,739
What about bioluminescence?

234
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,819
Fireflies have been using it
for 200 million years.

235
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:15,002
Fireflies... the flaming plates
of the insect world.

236
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,095
Thank you.

237
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,879
You don't have to thank me
every time I say "hello,"

238
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,750
but it's nice to hear.

239
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:33,210
OK. Do it.

240
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:37,622
No, I mean, i love this project.
I'm not supposed to say anything,

241
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:41,218
- but I really appreciate it.
- So you're working on it, too.

242
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,832
- Day and night.
- I see.

243
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,581
Then tell me, Linda, how's it going?

244
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,545
Specifically.
Tell me anything.

245
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,421
Even the littlest thing
would be great to hear.

246
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,232
Well, the worms are thriving,
and I got Ted to drink urine.

247
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,742
Hi, ted. Just trying
to get to know you better.

248
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,828
By going through my files?

249
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,100
You're such a closed book.

250
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,688
I don't know what Jabberwocky is.

251
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:16,986
It's the most exciting project,

252
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:20,298
and all I know is that
it involves worms and urine.

253
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,997
There is no Jabberwocky.

254
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,349
- What?
- I made the whole thing up.

255
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:31,768
You lied to me?

256
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:33,354
I know. It was wrong.

257
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,274
I needed to move some money around
so Linda could build her roof garden.

258
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,594
A roof garden?
Oh, for god sakes, Ted.

259
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,195
Why don't you do her already?

260
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,305
Do you know what trouble we're in now?
This is all they're talking about.

261
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:50,265
In a couple of hours,
we're presenting it to the division.

262
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,660
What?
Why'd you agree to that?

263
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,441
Really, is that your strategy,

264
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:57,421
let's make this Veronica's fault?
You're the only person I told.

265
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,434
Wow. It is your strategy.
That is so thin.

266
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,060
All right, let's not panic.

267
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:06,091
Why don't we tell them that Jabberwocky
is Linda's project?

268
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:09,648
'Cause they don't care about greening
the building. It's not gonna happen. 

269
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,298
- How am I gonna tell that to Linda?
- Why don't you start like this?

270
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,396
"Hey, Linda, can I borrow some money?
'cause I just lost my job."

271
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:19,171
You're right.
Why are we even talking about Linda?

272
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:21,247
We have to focus on this presentation.

273
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,362
We need to come up with a product
that no one has ever seen before.

274
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:27,813
And it better be good. They've already
signed a contract with James earl Jones

275
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,069
to be the voice of...
Jabberwocky.

276
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,345
<i>So here we go again.</i>

277
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,603
<i>Because of a girl,
I'm about to lie to 2,000 people.</i>

278
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,777
We're in it now, Ted.
Go big or go home.

279
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:45,988
I can go home?

280
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:48,225
That stage is your home. Go.

281
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:01,547
Business is changing...
Changing at the speed of information.

282
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:03,606
Whoever adapts first...

283
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,085
Wins.

284
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,082
In order to compete, we innovate.

285
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,698
In order to innovate, we redefine.

286
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,410
And how do we redefine?

287
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,253
With a new definition.
<i>Jabberwocky.</i>

288
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,345
This is going great.

289
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,508
Imagine if we'd come up with a product.

290
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,206
Products are for people
who don't have presentations.

291
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:34,305
Imagine a new way to do business
that's faster than a cheetah...

292
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,570
More powerful than...

293
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:38,771
Another cheetah.

294
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,504
I only had an hour to pull
stuff off the Internet.

295
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:46,783
A way of doing business
more magnificent than...

296
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,337
A fish.

297
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,323
Or a whale.

298
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,091
<i>Sure, there were a few hiccups...</i>

299
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,309
<i>But not having a product
wasn't slowing us down at all.</i>

300
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,711
So what is it?

301
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:22,522
What is it exactly that's gonna
revolutionize the way we do business?

302
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,200
<i>Simple. It's...</i>

303
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:27,624
<i>Jabberwocky!</i>

304
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:36,399
The game is changing right now.

305
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:38,038
Coming in 2012.

306
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,556
So do you understand
what Jabberwocky is?

307
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:50,117
Of course I do, you idiot.
Don't you?

308
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,786
Yeah. I was just seeing
if you needed me to explain it to you.

309
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,078
I love being applauded. 

310
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,749
If I had a tape of that,
I'd fall asleep to it every night.

311
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:03,906
It was a great evening, although
I'm still angry about the flash pop.

312
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,660
That would've looked so cool!

313
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:08,137
Ted, don't ever lie to me again.

314
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:10,948
I'm sorry. I won't.

315
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,536
Too many people get hurt.

316
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,410
The next thing you know, you're buying
James earl Jones an muffin basket.

317
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,536
And you're not
a very good liar, anyway.

318
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,121
But that's OK.
Neither am I.

319
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,984
Now that's how it's done.

320
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,431
<i>There are a lot of bad things
about lying.</i>

321
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,540
<i>But the worst thing</i>

322
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,574
<i>is when you have to tell the truth.</i>

323
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,522
So this project never existed?

324
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,025
Then this whole thing was pointless?

325
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,462
No, it wasn't.

326
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,646
Look around.
Look how beautiful this is.

327
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:55,615
You did this.

328
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,108
You made a difference
right on this rooftop.

329
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,333
I hope you're not upset.

330
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,375
You stole from the company for me.

331
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,836
How could a girl be mad
at someone that does that?

332
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,422
You're like my thief
in shining armor.

333
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,507
If we're gonna hug,
you're starting it.

334
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,758
Good evening,.

335
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,815
- I was past the greeting.
- Don't. 

336
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,651
We were working with Linda
on this project,

337
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,788
and we are about
to light up this rooftop

338
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,947
without using a single watt
of electricity.

339
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,241
- Impossible, you say?
- I didn't say anything.

340
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:39,481
It's not!

341
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,913
Behold the power of biolunescence.

342
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:51,301
Guys...
It's so pretty.

343
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,358
We took the plants' d. N. a.,

344
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,932
 spliced in the
bioluminescent properties of fireflies.

345
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,320
We call them... Fireflowers.

346
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,222
Nice work, fellas.
I'm impressed.

347
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:03,127
- Really?
- Yeah. In fact,

348
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,727
The company might be interested
in something like this.

349
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,790
- We're back.
- And we're proud.

350
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:13,609
What was that?

351
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,639
A fire-squirrel.

352
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:26,206
<i>A week later, we found another benefit
of Linda's roof garden,</i>

353
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,994
<i>although the fire-squirrel
turned out to be a mistake...</i>

354
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,372
<i>Driven mad by not being able to sleep
due to its constant glowing.</i>

355
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:37,392
<i>As for the Jabberwocky project,</i>

356
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,424
<i>we never did have to figure out
what the hell it was.</i>

357
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:47,084
<i>Because after our presentation,
the company was so excited,</i>

358
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,441
<i>they fast-tracked it
and shipped it to japan.</i>

359
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,337
<i>Jabberwocky.</i>

360
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:56,611
<i>What they shipped, I'm still
trying to figure out...</i>

361
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:59,008
<i>And so are the japanese.</i>

362
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,450
 

363
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,769
 

364
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,786
 

365
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,975


366
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,790
 

367
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:15,183
 {\ I understand it,
I just think it would be better}

368
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,690
