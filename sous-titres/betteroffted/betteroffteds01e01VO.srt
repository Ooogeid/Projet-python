{\pos(192,220)}I have the best job in the world.

20
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:57,942
We want to make a metal that's as hard
as steel but can bounce like rubber...

21
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,393
- and is edible.
- We can do that.

22
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:04,540
I'm the head of a research
and development department

23
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:08,138
for one of the largest companies
in America, Veridian Dynamics.

24
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,778
Veronica's my boss.

25
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,562
We need a mouse that can withstand
temperatures up to 195 degrees.

26
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:16,242
We can do that.

27
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,036
A computer mouse or a live mouse?

28
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:21,872
I'll get back to you.

29
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,700
Every day, there's something new,
waiting to be discovered.

30
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,224
- Computer mouse.
- Easier.

31
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,612
We do everything -

32
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,795
industrial products, biomedical,

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,902
cryogenics, defense technology.

34
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,073
We want to weaponize a pumpkin.

35
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:39,519
{\pos(192,220)}Then so do I.

36
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:41,461
{\pos(192,220)}Because?

37
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:45,207
{\pos(192,220)}A country with who we do business
grows a great deal of pumpkins

38
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:47,595
{\pos(192,220)}and would welcome additional uses
for them...

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,025
{\pos(192,220)}As well as cheaper ways
to kill their enemies.

40
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,921
{\pos(192,220)}Well, finally the pumpkin gets to do
something besides Halloween.

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,187
Pie.

42
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,366
Halloween and pie.

43
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:05,222
I've been at Veridian 3 years.
Last year, I got a promotion,

44
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,043
and now I run a team of some
of the smartest people in the world.

45
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:11,888
There we go.

46
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,029
Okay, people.

47
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:18,231
We need to turn this simple,
festive gourd

48
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,519
into a killer.

49
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:22,958
I've asked Dr. Bhamba to take a look
at how nature does it because nature

50
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,006
is a fantastic killer of things.

51
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,267
Dr. Bhamba.

52
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:28,842
Thank you.

53
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,056
Nature attacks and annihilates
the pumpkin with powdery mildew disease,

54
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,694
which can be mutated and designed
to attack human cell structure,

55
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,552
causing enemy soldiers to grow
a magnificent, soft downy coating

56
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:41,685
and die...

57
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:44,789
- As mold.
- Oh, my god.

58
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,475
- Spores in uniforms.
- I think we get the picture.

59
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,693
Cindy, Lester, Jerry,
you're with Dr. Bhamba on this.

60
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,960
The rest of you, you're welcome.

61
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:56,396
Ted,

62
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,512
the drones working on the spy drone
came up with this cheap fabric.

63
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,317
Find another use for it.

64
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,017
Well, it's good texture,

65
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,392
coloration.
Maybe a breakfast meat.

66
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,479
Are you serious?
We want to be in that business.

67
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:09,859
No.

68
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:11,732
You have to lighten up.

69
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:13,735
Maybe I'm too funny.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,162
Maybe I was joking about
not getting your joke.

71
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,069
<i>This is Lem.</i>

72
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,300
<i>He's a genius.</i>

73
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:27,671
<i>Seriously.</i>

74
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:33,738
<i>For 10 years, Lem has been
research partners with...</i>

75
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:35,222
<i>Phil,</i>

76
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,730
<i>who's also a genius.</i>

77
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:42,502
I'm so angry about the toilet paper.
Why couldn't they leave it next to us?

78
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,180
That proximity was so elegant.

79
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:47,327
They think if it's harder to reach,
that we'll use less of it.

80
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,552
They've destroyed going
to the bathroom for me.

81
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,850
It used to be just a weird human
function. Now it's actively stressful.

82
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,334
Just take the roll
off of the dispenser

83
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,570
and bring it with you
before you sit.

84
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,558
- That's what I do.
- What? That's not normal.

85
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,095
It becomes normal...

86
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,662
if you keep doing it.

87
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,517
Everything does.

88
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,699
You can put up with their crap
if you want to. That's who you are.

89
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,865
But I'm not like that.
I'm a fighter.

90
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,764
I fight stuff like this.

91
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,638
- No, you don't.
- Shut up, Phil.

92
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:18,101
I would if I thought I could win.

93
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,696
No, remember
there was that thing last week

94
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:24,763
that you thought you could win
and you still didn't fight? Remember?

95
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:28,058
- With the sandwich?
- Yeah, I should've fought that.

96
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:30,336
- I thought so.
- Hey, fellas.

97
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,439
See if you can make this fabric
into a line of office chairs.

98
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:35,141
It's very strong and,

99
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:38,235
- well, dark.
- Do I fight injustice enough?

100
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,694
Is this about the sandwich?

101
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,574
Because I think you knew
you wouldn't have won that.

102
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,117
Your mom's tough.

103
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:47,786
She once killed a bat
with a "People" magazine.

104
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,376
That is tough, but...
one thing she's not?

105
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,385
Someone who can create
something out of nothing,

106
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,128
like you can.

107
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,922
So make me an office chair.

108
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:03,819
- He's a better man than you.
- Agreed.

109
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,619
<i>The next step
for any product is testing.</i>

110
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,759
<i>Testing is one of the things
Linda does for us.</i>

111
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:16,109
People are squirming.
The fabric's not comfortable.

112
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,792
Squirming? Or...

113
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:21,893
are they just enjoying it so much, they
want their whole body to rub against it?

114
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:26,843
I know you're an R&D legend
with magical R&D powers.

115
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,807
But the chair? Just... no.

116
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,720
Never give up. That's what
I always tell my daughter.

117
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:36,396
She tells me to stop telling her,
but I tell her I can't,

118
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,416
because that would be giving up.

119
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,295
Look at these numbers.

120
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,206
You scared me.

121
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:48,129
- What's with the creamer?
- Nothing.

122
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,037
They're mine. What's up?

123
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,560
Productivity increase
when people use the chairs.

124
00:05:58,512 --> 00:05:59,568
I like creamer.

125
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,988
I've only worked here 6 months. Is there
a rule about that I should know?

126
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,779
When people can't get comfortable,

127
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,707
they don't daydream or get distracted,
so they're more productive.

128
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,205
And more filled with hate.

129
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,617
<i>And the scratchier the fabric...</i>

130
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:26,315
<i>The more uncomfortable people are</i>

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,321
<i>and the harder they work.</i>

132
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,121
Get it off me!

133
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,103
- Get it off me! Get it off!
- <i>Up to a point,</i>

134
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,482
<i>then they go mad.</i>

135
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,956
Is it wrong to invent
a deadly pumpkin

136
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:01,947
or an irritating chair
that makes people work harder?

137
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,375
The thing is, work's not about
right and wrong.

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,725
It's about success...
or failure.

139
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,441
Your department's using
too much creamer.

140
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:11,578
Does it matter?

141
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,861
It's not "Katrina",
but it is a problem.

142
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:16,248
Ted, there's been a spill... oh, hi,

143
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,392
- Veronica. It's nothing.
- Hi, Phil.

144
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,272
Actually,
you're the reason I'm here.

145
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,942
- Really?
- Yes. You can go now.

146
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,862
- But...
- I'm here to talk about you, not to you.

147
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:28,197
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,909
We want to freeze Phil.

149
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,713
- Excuse me?
- Phil.

150
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,869
The company wants
to cryonically freeze him,

151
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:39,917
just for a year, to see
if it's possible. We think it is.

152
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,771
- You think it's possible?
- Yes, Mr. Negative, we do.

153
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,861
We have developed a chemical
which allows us to

154
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:50,159
rapidly freeze live animal tissue
without it exploding.

155
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,155
And, fingers crossed,

156
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,056
we're ready for human testing.

157
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,872
Your presentation sucks.
And why Phil?

158
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,622
For PR reasons,
they wanted an employee.

159
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,187
In the unlikely event
something goes wrong, well,

160
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,652
there are people here we would,
you know,

161
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:06,944
miss more.

162
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:10,619
You be sure to tell him that
when you try to get him to do it.

163
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,619
- I see where this is going.
- Your guys will do anything for you.

164
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,296
They've got...

165
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,196
what's that thing again?
Underlings have it.

166
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:21,378
Loyalty.

167
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,837
This is huge for us.
You need to make it happen.

168
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,087
Well, I'll try.

169
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,101
But Phil hates the cold
and he freaks out in small spaces,

170
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,053
so this assignment
is not ideal for him.

171
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,680
Well, they originally suggested Lem,
but...

172
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:38,183
freeze the black guy?
They're not stupid.

173
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,041
If I'm gonna ask Phil to do something
potentially dangerous,

174
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,216
I need to make sure
that it's potentially safe.

175
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,252
So I've asked Linda
to check out the data.

176
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,175
No, the zebra and the toaster
are friends...

177
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,900
I have to go.

178
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:56,771
No, that makes the toaster too mean.
He's not a sociopath.

179
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,829
He just doesn't want
to make toast anymore.

180
00:08:59,193 --> 00:08:59,993
Hi.

181
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,915
Is that a new shirt?

182
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:04,960
That's cool. Let's pretend that
that phone call wasn't odd.

183
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,247
I'm trying to write a children's book,
and my illustrator doesn't get...

184
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,422
most of it.

185
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,571
Well, what's, uh, not to get?

186
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:14,789
A toaster that doesn't want
to make toast.

187
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:16,597
And, of course, there's a zebra.

188
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,679
You do the same thing every day.
You please everyone around you.

189
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,026
At some point you say:

190
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:26,231
"Making toast is fine, it's opened
some doors, but I need more."

191
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,355
"So I'm running away.
I don't know how. I'm

192
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,945
plugged into a wall,
I don't have legs, but I'm doing it."

193
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,305
You totally get the toaster,

194
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,867
and his complicated love/hate
relationship with the outlet.

195
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,744
Who has all the power.

196
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,384
- That's lame.
- You laughed.

197
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,097
Yeah.

198
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,901
You want to know about Phil?
It's probably okay...

199
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:54,084
If he can get past minus 20 degrees
without his eyes bursting.

200
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,086
That would be
the first sign of trouble.

201
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:02,570
This is a great company, isn't it?
Freezing its employees.

202
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,937
Employee. They're only freezing one.

203
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:06,563
For now.

204
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:10,996
Do you know that they send us the phone
bills for our non-work-related calls?

205
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,591
They don't charge us for 'em.
They just want us to know that

206
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:16,742
they know we're making 'em.
Can a company be bitchy?

207
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,572
- Is that why you steal creamer?
- Yes.

208
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:23,121
It's an act of rebellion.

209
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:26,324
I also scratched the words
"place scrotum here"

210
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,209
on the lunch room table, but then,

211
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:30,254
you know, that just
became the thing to do.

212
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:39,476
- You have the best cubicle.
- Yeah, and we have been in all of them.

213
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,767
Except Cindy's.

214
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:42,586
No way.

215
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,033
I've been in there, twice.

216
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,104
She got so mad the first time.

217
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,514
I'm definitely going in there sometime,
twice also... as well.

218
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,458
We heard rumors
something's gonna be done to Phil?

219
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,114
I just so want it
to be something good.

220
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:01,702
Why do they want to freeze me?
I didn't do anything.

221
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:04,788
Phil, it's not a punishment.
It's an honor.

222
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,641
You've been chosen to be a pioneer,

223
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,264
to go someplace
no one's ever gone before...

224
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:11,863
and come back.

225
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:15,474
I don't know.

226
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,641
I can talk to my wife about it?
Will I keep getting paid?

227
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,079
- She's going to want to know that.
- Of course.

228
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:25,055
I assume.
I mean, technically, it is work.

229
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,730
I'll check.

230
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,131
You shouldn't freeze Phil.

231
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,566
<i>This is my daughter Rose.
She knows everything.</i>

232
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,028
Honey, it's exciting. It's gonna be
a huge breakthrough in science.

233
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,697
- I like Phil.
- Maybe even more when he's frozen.

234
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,491
I like him the temperature he is.

235
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,079
Phil came to my birthday.

236
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,318
It's wrong to freeze someone
who comes to your daughter's birthday.

237
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,809
- Did you do your math homework?
- Yes.

238
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,253
- 6 times 8?
- Yes, that was one of them.

239
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,530
Would you do it? Would you do something
like this and leave me?

240
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:03,451
When Rose was four,
her mom left us to go save the world.

241
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,142
That's been hard for Rose. Frankly,
not so great for the world, either.

242
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,009
I would never leave you, ever.

243
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,661
I know. We've discussed this.
You're a great dad.

244
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:20,181
But it's wrong to ask Phil
to do something you wouldn't do.

245
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:22,556
You're right.

246
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,702
You're always right because stupidly,
I taught you right and wrong.

247
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,617
Tell 'em you don't want to do it.
They can't force employees

248
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,766
to participate in human experiments.

249
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:33,335
- They lost that court case.
- But I want to do it.

250
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,870
What? Phil, that's crazy.

251
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,100
Thank you.
See? I'm not the only one.

252
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:43,257
- It is only for a year, Lem.
- I'll just stand perfectly still

253
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,764
so I don't accidentally go
on living my life without you.

254
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,641
- Moron.
- Look,

255
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,195
I might've sold you a little too hard
yesterday, and that was...

256
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:53,592
wrong.

257
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:57,103
No, you were right.
This is my chance to be a pioneer.

258
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:59,781
My wife thought it would be exciting,
too, which surprised me,

259
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:03,525
because she's normally a deeply
and relentlessly negative person.

260
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,064
Mrs. Moron.

261
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,161
At least I have a Mrs. Moron.
Who's in your life, Lem?

262
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,580
Why are you being so mean?

263
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,458
<i>And so...</i>
<i>They froze Phil.</i>

264
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,884
What I do now...

265
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,120
I do for science.

266
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,922
And so,
I do not ask for your concern.

267
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,159
All I ask is for your respect.

268
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,879
Respect as a scientist,

269
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:30,100
respect as a friend...

270
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,461
Respect as a man.
Oh, god! I think this is it!

271
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,452
I've never seen a man explode
from the inside.

272
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:48,817
A rabbit, an eel, a goat,
a monkey and a reindeer,

273
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,176
but that's all.

274
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm out.

275
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,148
This is normal.

276
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,381
Every company does stuff like this.

277
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,591
Right?

278
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,970
Does Phil look like he's in pain?

279
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,791
Bummer to have to stay
like that for a year.

280
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,595
I don't think you're crazy
for stealing creamer.

281
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:25,864
Watch closely. Minus 20
is when the eyes might burst.

282
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,786
He's been like this for three days, now.
They promised him

283
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,324
he could stay in the lab
with his friends, so that's good.

284
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:05,888
Right, buddy?

285
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,127
Creepy.

286
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,503
- They're moving him tomorrow.
- What? Where?

287
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:14,621
I think the basement.
Although, there's been talk of India.

288
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,051
Hello. No, I can talk.

289
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,188
Phil thawed out? How?

290
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,898
It's very technical.

291
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,340
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

292
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,860
It's just...

293
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:03,131
something's not quite right.

294
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:06,540
Next, we looked at Methyl Thiazole-4,
which we assumed would...

295
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:14,810
So this thing with Phil,
making that stupid face and yelling...

296
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,349
they think it's distracting.

297
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,311
I guess in hindsight they shouldn't
have vitrified his brains.

298
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,838
I'm not gonna play the blame game
with you. The point is,

299
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,200
- they need you to let him go.
- What?

300
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,187
Have you...

301
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,658
been avoiding me...

302
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:42,715
since...

303
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,012
you know, you held my hand?

304
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:46,657
No.

305
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:50,977
And I didn't hold your hand. I...

306
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,895
held on to your hand
after you held my hand.

307
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:56,237
Okay.

308
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,726
That's how we're playing it?
We're gonna play it stupid?

309
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,318
Okay. I don't know how it happened.

310
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:04,562
I do.

311
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,651
I was standing there like this,

312
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,277
and you took my hand like this,
and that's...

313
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,030
how it happened.

314
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,279
- Linda.
- Ted...

315
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:19,412
I used up my office affair.

316
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,598
- What now?
- You only get one, otherwise

317
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,794
you're that guy that sleeps around.
And about a year ago, I used mine.

318
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,357
{\pos(192,220)}That was an excellent presentation.

319
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,389
Everything you said was just so

320
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:32,258
concise and exactly...

321
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,303
I think you and I should have sex.

322
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,765
If you want.

323
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,782
Look at me.

324
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:43,455
I'm so nervous,
I'm shaking like a leaf.

325
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,339
- No, no, you're not.
- No.

326
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:50,308
Is that a problem? I don't get nervous.
I try. It just doesn't come out.

327
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:52,382
I guess that makes me...

328
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,184
vulnerable.

329
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,325
No, you're not vulnerable.

330
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,522
No.

331
00:17:59,094 --> 00:17:59,813
So...

332
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,950
where does that put us?

333
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,508
Ted, it's okay.

334
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,993
Really. I don't care.
I work for you. It would be...

335
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:24,686
Besides, only an idiot would have
an affair with their boss.

336
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,215
Pretty girl.

337
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:38,857
Although, she makes a lot
of non-work-related calls,

338
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,855
which I think
makes her less attractive.

339
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:46,207
Listen, about firing Phil, I don't think
we should rush into anything.

340
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,339
You're right.

341
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:52,028
Wait until the end of business, Friday.
It'll be easier for payroll.

342
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:59,258
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

343
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,389
Now, they want you to fire Phil.

344
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,636
That's what I'm supposed to do.

345
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,645
Do grown-ups even care
about right and wrong?

346
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:11,847
Did you brush your teeth?

347
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:14,731
Don't change the subject.

348
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,663
- Hello, Linda.
- Hi.

349
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:27,264
Did I surprise you?

350
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:30,168
I didn't mean to surprise you.
I'm just a friendly person.

351
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,171
I didn't think you knew my name.

352
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,375
Of course I know your name.

353
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,482
I know a lot about you.

354
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,988
Linda...

355
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:40,369
Katherine...

356
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:41,481
Zword...

357
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,913
ning... ling.

358
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:45,853
Zwordling.

359
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,670
Fine. You know your name
better than I do.

360
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,861
Ted, I can't have you sleeping
with Linda.

361
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:54,733
- What?
- It could embarrass me,

362
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:57,570
- plus I may not be done with you yet.
- Hey, guys.

363
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:02,492
Hi, Phil. I hear
you're blinking again. Good for you.

364
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,079
- Why is he still here?
- Because, I'm not firing him.

365
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:09,624
- But they want you to fire him.
- I don't care. It's just wrong.

366
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,759
So then you're saying no to them?

367
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,795
That's an interesting career choice.

368
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,004
Phil doesn't deserve to be fired.

369
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:19,133
He's incredibly smart.
He's hardworking. He let us freeze him!

370
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,657
He's the last guy that deserves
to be fired, and i'm standing by him.

371
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,141
Dude. You're not helping me.

372
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,951
Okay, I'll talk to them.

373
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,443
But what you're doing
is gonna hurt their feelings,

374
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,233
and when their feelings get hurt,
they hurt the ones they love.

375
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,238
- And they love you, Ted.
- Then maybe I should talk to them.

376
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:43,240
They don't want to talk to you
when you're like this.
