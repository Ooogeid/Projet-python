<font size="22">CREAM TEAM

2
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:10,368
Trust...
At a successful company like this,

3
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:12,677
that's the glue that holds
everything together.

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,426
At Veridian Dynamics,

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,696
we even hold special events
to build that trust.

6
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,099
Don't let me go!

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,658
I will not let you go!
Come on!

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,939
It's like the virtual climbing wall
at MIT.

9
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,316
It wasn't there when I was there!

10
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,110
It's virtual. Technically,
it was never there.

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,404
Now don't look down.

12
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,615
I'm falling! I'm falling!

13
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:34,821
I've got you!

14
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:36,708
<i>Once you've that trust,</i>

15
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,861
<i>you know someone
will always have your back.</i>

16
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,733
You realize if this project
goes forward,

17
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:43,593
all the aborigines in Australia
will lose their sense of smell.

18
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,628
Which is why I'm going to kill it.

19
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,130
That's too high a price
to pay for fabric softener.

20
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:50,908
If those aborigines were here,
they'd smell a good man.

21
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,028
- Ready?
- Hair?

22
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,387
- Good. Teeth?
- Clear. Tie?

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,348
Stain.

24
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:56,847
Gotcha.

25
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:00,860
<i>But the most important thing
is the trust</i>

26
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:02,712
<i>the public has in our products.</i>

27
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:05,856
<i>That's why many of our products
never get past the testing phase...</i>

28
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:10,038
<i>Like our soldier-tracking
gps underwear.</i>

29
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:10,885
Hot.

30
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:12,685
Hot.

31
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:15,123
<i>But sometimes, in spite
of our best efforts,</i>

32
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:16,927
<i>a bad product does get through...</i>

33
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:20,145
<i>And for any corporation,
the worst-case scenario is...</i>

34
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,722
The company's being sued
for something we made.

35
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:27,039
Is it that number the accounting
guys invented for tax purposes?

36
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,819
Then on a scale of one
to zurplex, how bad is it?

37
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:30,788
It's bad.

38
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:33,509
Remember that perfume your team
developed about a year ago?

39
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:35,643
In 3 out of 5,000 women,

40
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,495
it reacts with their body chemistry

41
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,724
and attracts hornets who want
to mate with them.

42
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,292
And when the hornets realize
they've been deceived, do they

43
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,379
laugh it off?

44
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,975
If by "laugh" you mean
sting over and over again

45
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,210
in endless waves of fury, then yes,
they've a wonderful sense of humor.

46
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:51,736
- Has the company offered to settle?
- Generously

47
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,536
enough to buy each woman a new face
of equal or greater value

48
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,056
than her original.

49
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,339
But their lawyers
are gonna try to screw us

50
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,796
by claiming we knew
the perfume had this problem

51
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,942
- but put it on the market anyway.
- What?

52
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,040
- That's ridiculous.
- Exactly.

53
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,096
We're all gonna have
to give depositions

54
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,211
and say we didn't know
this could happen.

55
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,629
But we didn't know it.

56
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,301
That sounds very truthful.

57
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,467
- Because we didn't know.
- That one wasn't as good.

58
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,011
- But we didn't.
- There you go. That's the one.

59
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,264
I'd leave my name out of it.

60
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,611
<i>With the public's trust at stake,
we all gave depositions.</i>

61
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,563
<i>Veronica had done it before
and so knew just what to say...</i>

62
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,108
<i>Or how little to say. </i>

63
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,527
Were you involved
in the development of this product?

64
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,811
How would you summarize
the company's reaction

65
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,071
when they found out
that the women who used this product

66
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,494
were savagely attacked
by insects?

67
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,122
Will you elaborate on that

68
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,336
Can you describe your job?

69
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,424
How would you describe it?

70
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:57,945
Cleverly.

71
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,940
<i>My deposition also went well,
although it took an odd turn.</i>

72
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,817
Tell me, Mr. Crisp,

73
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,147
would you give this perfume
to your wife?

74
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,778
I don't have a wife.

75
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,319
- Girlfriend?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

76
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:19,532
Boyfriend?

77
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,033
No boyfriend.

78
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,187
So there's nobody significant
at all in your life...

79
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,812
That you would give the perfume to?

80
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:30,835
Nope, just me and my daughter.

81
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,180
<i>And Phil? Well, Phil doesn't
do well under pressure.</i>

82
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:40,553
Mr. Myman,

83
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,596
it says here you went to M. I.T
Right?

84
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,054
I'm a liar...
A damned, dirty liar.

85
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:56,152
- Excuse me?
- When I took this job, I lied.

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,668
I didn't attend M. I.T

87
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:00,393
I graduated from
the university of aruba.

88
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:03,492
I wanted to be a big fish
in a little pond.

89
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,560
I played rugby,

90
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:07,843
and I am proud of my years

91
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:11,417
as a syphilitic conquistador.
That was the team name.

92
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,826
They wanted something
the locals found frightening.

93
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,864
Lem was nervous, too...
So nervous he whipped up

94
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,187
something in the lab
to keep himself calm.

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,600
He may have over whipped.

96
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:26,739
Hello, cats and kittens.
I'm here to testify.

97
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:31,312
This is nice.

98
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,815
The air feels like jell-o.

99
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,862
But eventually, all the depositions
ended up in the same place.

100
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,115
Were you aware that this product
was potentially dangerous?

101
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,827
Absolutely not.

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,483
Negatory, catwoman.

103
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,331
Now what exactly...

104
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,146
Wait a minute.
Did you just say yes?

105
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,902
And did you notify
anyone within the company

106
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:03,260
- about the situation?
- I sent an e-mail to the C.E.O.

107
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,722
And I sent another one to...

108
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,140
yes?

109
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,310
Ms. Zwordling,
who else knew about this?

110
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:16,215
Our Ted?

111
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,745
<i>Mistakes...
We all make them.</i>

112
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:33,979
<i>But sometimes mistakes
lead to great discoveries.</i>

113
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:37,753
<i>Mistakes are how
we learn and grow...</i>

114
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,287
<i>So we can do amazing things.</i>

115
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,990
<i>When you think about it,
shouldn't you be thanking us</i>

116
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:45,511
for making mistakes?

117
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:48,843
<i></i>

118
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,145
<i></i>

119
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:57,564
You told the lawyers that
the perfume attracts hornets?

120
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:00,167
I was under oath.
I had to tell the truth,

121
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,320
which I probably would've done anyway.
It's kind of a bad habit I have.

122
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,656
But it wasn't the truth.
You didn't send it.

123
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,491
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

124
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,243
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

125
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,511
- Oh, yes, I did.
- I didn't get any e-mail,

126
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:15,264
you could have at least warned me
that that's what you were gonna say

127
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,564
The lawyers told us not to discuss
our testimony,

128
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,095
and I did send it to you, Ted.
I remember. It was my first week here.

129
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:23,048
It was my first project.

130
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,179
Hello. Linda, right?

131
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,889
Yes, Mr. Crisp.
Linda zwordling.

132
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,433
Please call me Ted. Oh,

133
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,851
and you call me Linda.

134
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,865
Oh, you already did.
Then keep calling me Linda.

135
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,689
And you keep calling me Ted,

136
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,943
and together, we'll call each other
by our names.

137
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,680
It's just crazy enough to work.

138
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,905
Oh, god. That's not my laugh. I
don't know where that came from.

139
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:50,310
I'm just so excited to be here
and working for this company

140
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,204
that does all these great things.

141
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:56,399
You know, my cousin uses the wheelchair
you guys invented...

142
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,292
It was my idea to give them brakes.

143
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,836
You should have seen those
suckers barreling downstairs.

144
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,301
You're joking... With me...
On my first day.

145
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,844
I love this place.

146
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:09,365
Before I forget,
we've been getting unusual results

147
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,683
on this perfume product
I've been testing.

148
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,988
- Can I speak to you?
- Sure. Have you met Linda?

149
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,602
Yes. With the laugh.

150
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,550
Don't worry.
I'm working on a new one.

151
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,023
That's not it.

152
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:22,858
Well, keep us posted.

153
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,494
If there's something I should know
about the results,

154
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,757
Send me an e-mail.

155
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,116
E- got it.

156
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:31,260
You know what I'm doing?
I'm trying too hard.

157
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,189
A few minutes later,
I sent you the e-mail.

158
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,690
Well, I believe that
you believe you sent it,

159
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:39,380
but I know where I was, and I didn't
get anything.

160
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:40,973
How can you be so sure?

161
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,608
It was memorable because
it was my first week,

162
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,296
and I was just
field-testing my laugh.

163
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,008
For you, it was just another day.

164
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:51,013
Well, I remember because,

165
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,412
Well, I just do.

166
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,434
If there's something I should know
about the results, Send me an e-mail.

167
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,699
E- got it.

168
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,980
You know what I'm doing?
I'm trying too hard.

169
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:04,817
I like that hairstyle.

170
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,402
It's very powerful.

171
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,779
Would you mind if I wore
my hair like that?

172
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,489
Of course not.

173
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:12,707
Good.
Then you can't anymore.

174
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,444
The laughing girl whose hair
I'm taking likes you.

175
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,329
So you wanted to talk to me?

176
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,775
Right after our teleconference,
France called.

177
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,529
They're in. God, you're
on your game this afternoon.

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,463
You think?
'cause I wasn't really feeling it.

179
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,736
Ted, that was
an excellent presentation.

180
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:37,766
Everything you said was just so concise
and exactly...

181
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,894
I think you and I should have sex...

182
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,350
If you want.

183
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:59,982
How could you know where you were
at that exact moment six months ago?

184
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,583
What were you doing
that was so memorable?

185
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:06,253
Well, I was,
just lying down.

186
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,798
You were lying down? That's how
you remember it so vividly?

187
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:11,636
Yes, because,

188
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,553
well, the blood
had rushed to my brain.

189
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,307
- Why are you being so weird?
- I'm not being weird. It's you.

190
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,901
You did get my e-mail,
and you're lying.

191
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:23,896
That's what's happening. This what Ted
looks like when he lies.

192
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,856
You think I'm lying?


193
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,212
I think you'd do anything to protect
this company and its precious C.E.O.

194
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:31,634
- You're gay for this place.
- I am not lying,

195
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,569
The company did anything wrong.

196
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,949
If that makes me gay, then I'm gay.

197
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,411
Oh, settle down.

198
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,573
Linda's claim that she had
warned me and the c. E. o.

199
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:54,809
About the faulty perfume made
things pretty frosty between us.

200
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,409
Hello, person who thinks
I'm incompetent.

201
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,393
Hello, person who thinks I'm lying.

202
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:02,971
I'm incompetent and a liar.
I don't get a hello?

203
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:05,503
<i>And Linda's statement didn't
just affect the two of us.</i>

204
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>It sent shock waves
through the whole company.</i>

205
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,348
<i>Our legal department was
working around the clock</i>

206
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:13,272
<i>looking for a defense strategy...</i>

207
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>And our executives
were working equally hard</i>

208
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,662
<i>to find a scapegoat.</i>

209
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:26,066
<i>But it wasn't just Linda's deposition
that was causing fallout.</i>

210
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,335
You went to the university of Aruba?

211
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,679
Where knowledge is king
and clothing is optional.

212
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:35,169
You lied to me. You said
you went to M.I.T. Like I did.

213
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,585
We even did the school
beaver dance together. 

214
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,174
Now it just seems stupid.

215
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:49,565
What else have you been lying
to me about? How can I trust you?

216
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,484
I bet you weren't even rescued
in Montana by Harrison Ford. 

217
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,444
That is true. I swear.

218
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:58,037
I woke up next to a campfire
with Indiana Jones making me bacon.

219
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,540
Look, I'm sorry.

220
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,796
I should have been honest ,
but I had just started working here,

221
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:12,770
and I was afraid I'd get fired
if anyone found out I lied.

222
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,067
I know it was wrong,
but it was so long ago.

223
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,145
Too bad your first day of work
had to be during'60s week.

224
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,421
- So you went to M.I.T. Me, too.
- Really?

225
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,857
I should have figured
I'd run into another M.I.T. 

226
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:35,652
Grad out here in the world of science.

227
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,175
Now that we both went there, let's
promise never to talk about it again

228
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,644
Are you kidding?
That's all we're gonna talk about!

229
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,267
M. i. T. Was the best,
The academic clubs,

230
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,549
the dorms, the guys, the girl...

231
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,001
You lied, Phil.

232
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,572
And you know what we do
with liars at MIT.?

233
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:56,808
No, you don't.

234
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:08,672
The company needs to protect its image,
and we have a offer for you.

235
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,299
<i>Phil and Lem's trust had been shattered,
but the company hadn't given up</i>

236
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,438
<i>on trying to restore
the public's trust.</i>

237
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,818
They want me to be the scapegoat?

238
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:20,515
We can't let the CEO. Take the blame,
and you're the one who blabbed.

239
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,991
But I'm the only one
who did the right thing.

240
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:24,975
You know what we call that?

241
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,994
Irony.

242
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:28,884
Now here's how it's going to work...

243
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:32,528
You say you knew the product was
faulty, but you didn't tell anyone,

244
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:36,587
and you made up that e-mail's story
because you've a drug problem.

245
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:40,467
I don't have a drug problem.
I haven't taken drugs since...

246
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,271
Well, you don't need to know
the last time I got high.

247
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,682
The point is,
I don't have a drug problem.

248
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,351
But you don't need one.
That's the beauty of this plan.

249
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,213
Linda, why can't you
ever trust the company?

250
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,648
They know what they're doing.
They've done it before.

251
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,400
It is all my fault.

252
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,475
I knew there was a problem
with the pasta sauce,

253
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,293
but I did not notify
my superiors because, well,

254
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,407
I'm a drug addict.

255
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,283
My goodness,
how I love the drugs.

256
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,245
I would take them in my house.
I would take them with a mouse.

257
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,811
With a mouse, people.

258
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,806
Now that's rock bottom.

259
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,705
This way the company is protected,

260
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,879
and if you agree to this, you'll be
handsomely rewarded. 

261
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,603
-  No.
- You'll be sent to the most

262
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:21,999
- beautiful rehab facility .
- Didn't do it.

263
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:24,614
You'll get to meet
movie stars, rock stars

264
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,222
and people famous just for going
in and out of rehab. 

265
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,188
- Didn't do it.
- When you get back,

266
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:32,602
your job will be waiting for you
because you've a disease

267
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,794
A disease that makes you
look weak and dirty

268
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,447
and us compassionate and forgiving.

269
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,277
It's a win-win.

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,157
- How is that a win for me?
- Shut up, junkie.

271
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:48,036
<i>It wasn't surprising that the company
wanted Linda to be a scapegoat.</i>

272
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,601
<i>- The surprising thing was...</i>
- You accepted their offer?

273
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:54,393
- You're gonna say it's your fault?
- Yes, I'm gonna take the fall

274
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,751
and land in a giant pile of money.

275
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:00,172
You're not a drug addict.
You can't afford to be a drug addict.

276
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:04,420
- Well, that's all about to change.
- Linda, why are you doing this?

277
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,430
Look at this place, Ted.
They freeze an employee.

278
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,097
They weaponize pumpkins.

279
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,225
They took an innocent panda
and turned it into an assassin.

280
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,363
When you work here you try to find
one person you can trust,

281
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,736
one person who sees things the way
you do and knows right from wrong.

282
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,603
I thought I'd found him,

283
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,473
but he sold his soul to the company,
so why shouldn't I?

284
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,112
I swear to god,
I didn't get the e-mail.

285
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,946
The company scheduled
a press conference.

286
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:47,893
Would you be comfortable saying you
caught her trying to sell the copier?

287
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,466
She says she's OK with it.

288
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,443
No, I am not gonna say that.

289
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:54,809
Why must you always fight me?

290
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:56,520
What are you doing? 

291
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,773
I'm looking for a record
of Linda's e-mail.

292
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,948
- She said she sent it may 5th.
- May 5th, may 35th...

293
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:03,948
What's the difference?
Let it go.

294
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:06,029
Let her take the deal
and make some money.

295
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,434
Don't you see what's happening?
We are taking the only person here

296
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,185
who has never compromised her ideals

297
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,203
and turning her into an
ideal compromiser,

298
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:16,348
and I don't mean an ideal compromiser,

299
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,833
one who all the other compromisers
look up to. 

300
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,961
I understand context, Ted.

301
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,541
She was our conscience.

302
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,990
- So now what are we gonna do?
- Gosh, you're right.

303
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:32,197
How will we ever make the fortune
500 list of the most moral companies?

304
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,601
Oh, wait.
They don't have that.

305
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,681
- Morning, Lem.
- Phillip.

306
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,409
I've been thinking about our past

307
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,545
and how

308
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,329
I chummed the waters of our friendship
with fish guts of dishonesty.

309
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,283
And I've been thinking about
how the shark of my loyalty

310
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:02,210
gorged on the deceitful entrails
of your bloody lies.

311
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,880
So we both saw that
shark special last night.

312
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,840
- Great, no?
- I was struck

313
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,319
by their capacity for forgiveness...

314
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:13,263
Their cold, black eyes,
so full of compassion.

315
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,331
<i>What you are watching
is two scientists</i>

316
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,941
<i>in their natural habitat
awkwardly circling each other</i>

317
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,582
<i>as they attempt to repair
their battered friendship.</i>

318
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:25,394
<i>This ritual allows Phil and Lem
to confront and resolve their problems</i>

319
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:28,803
while staying within the safe confines
of marine biology.

320
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:32,385
 And that is why the otter will
always be the jester of the sea.

321
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:33,650
Agreed.

322
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,646
I forgive you.
Thanks, Lem.

323
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:39,377
I just... 

324
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:43,949
wish I could forgive myself for lying
to my friend for the past ten years.

325
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,758
Here.

326
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,653
Maybe these will help.

327
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,619
Look through my glasses.

328
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,146
Look through my lying glasses.

329
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,802
These aren't prescription.

330
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,188
These are just clear glass.

331
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:07,108
When I first started working here,
I thought they'd make me look smarter.

332
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,464
For the last ten years,
I've been lying to you, too.

333
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,616
I always assumed
you had poor eyesight.

334
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,514
Because you wear glasses.

335
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,121
I had a feeling that's
what people were thinking.

336
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,955
Just glad I don't have
to wear these anymore.

337
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,834
I still look smart
without 'em?

338
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,856
Okay, before you sign,
let me go over the conditions

339
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,191
with you once more. 

340
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:10,250
We've been through it three times.
I'm a scapegoat, not an actual goat.

341
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,049
Linda, wait!

342
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,051
I have to show you something.

343
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,095
Go ahead, angel junk.

344
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,099
That's the street name we're giving
you in the press release.

345
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,443
Look. This explains everything.

346
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,881
I know how babies are made,

347
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:40,493
and I am so not in the mood
for porn right now.

348
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,082
- Wait. Let me zoom in.
- Yeah, that's gonna help.

349
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,044
Is that you and Veronica?

350
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:53,255
Gross! Why are you showing me this?
What the hell is wrong with you?

351
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,524
Just look at the date.
It's may 5th.

352
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:59,563
This is right after we talked about
the perfume. This is what I was doing.

353
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:02,370
I didn't want to tell you before
because I didn't think it was

354
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:04,117
relevant, but keep watching. 

355
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:06,807
<i>You have new mail.</i>

356
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:08,590
<i>Did you say something?</i>

357
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,572
<i>No, the orientation's over.
You're on your own now.</i>

358
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,406
Look at the computer.

359
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,205
There's your e-mail arriving.

360
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:26,081
Veronica deleted it.
She kicked the keyboard

361
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:30,058
- while she was having her second...
- All right. I get it. You're a stud.

362
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,048
So this is why you
didn't see my e-mail.

363
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,956
You were telling the truth.

364
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,085
We both were.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

365
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,932
- Yeah, what was with that?
- You're the one that called me a liar.

366
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:49,305
I'm sure you've lied to someone about
something, I'm just gonna call it even.

367
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,596
<i>You should have a license
for that thing.</i>

368
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:56,879
That's it for me.

369
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:03,099
You taped us having sex.

370
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,458
- You're kinkier than I thought.
- You have no idea.

371
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,691
But I didn't tape us.

372
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:12,114
I confiscated this a few months ago
from Dewey the security guard.

373
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:14,671
He had dozens of employee
sex tapes like that.

374
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,283
Dewey? Damn.

375
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:19,167
That's the first Dewey
I thought was normal.

376
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,177
The quest continues.

377
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:25,921
Anyway, when you mentioned Linda
sent the e-mail on may 5th,

378
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:28,682
there was something about
that date that rang a bell.

379
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,289
And then I rembered that
that was the date on our tape,

380
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,106
since I've watched it several times.

381
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:34,964
You've watched it several times?

382
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,025
If you don't study your performance,
how do you expect to keep your edge?

383
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:42,068
Well, I don't really look
at it as a competition,

384
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,690
but whatever gets you there.

385
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,953
It was nice you did this for Linda. 

386
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,816
Her heart wasn't really in being
the scapegoat.

387
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,375
It just made more sense
to give it to someone

388
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,669
who's gonna take the ball
and run with it.

389
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,114
I, angel junk, am responsible
for the hornets,

390
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,541
the perfume, you name it.

391
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,020
It was the drugs again.
What can I say? I am weak.

392
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:08,040
I would do them on a train.
I would do them in the rain...

393
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:11,144
In the rain, people.
Now that's messed up.
