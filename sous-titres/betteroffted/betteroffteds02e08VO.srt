1
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:07,424
Communication... It's important
to any successful relationship.

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,793
It's true between people
and between a company and its employees.

3
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:11,818
Debbie.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,220
Relax.

5
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:14,517
Breathe.

6
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:15,657
Turn.

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,394
I wanted to communicate to you an idea
about the meals-ready-to-eat project.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,647
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.
- What's your fault?

9
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:25,733
- I'm not prepared to have a meeting.
- We're not having a meeting.

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm not prepared. I wish I was.

11
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:30,388
Because when I'm not prepared,
I get nervous

12
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,365
and repeat-y.
Repeat-y.

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,201
Why don't I just jot my idea down
and send it to you?

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:38,178
That would be fantastic.
Fantastic.

15
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,550
She gets all nervous around me.

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,990
Luckily, talking to Debbie isn't
the only way we communicate around here.

17
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:47,715
There's also the memo.

18
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>Memo 314... </i>

19
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:53,418
<i>employees must not use</i>
<i>offensive or insulting language</i>

20
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:54,893
<i>in the workplace.</i>

21
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,558
"Employees must <i>now</i> use offensive
or insulting language in the workplace"?

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,645
This has to be a mistake. Why would
they want us to swear at each other?

23
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,581
Maybe they're trying to make the people
at work seem more like a <i>real</i> family,

24
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,279
butt-munch.

25
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:10,695
This is gonna be good.

26
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,990
Like everything the company does to us,
it's gotta be about saving money.

27
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,689
Maybe when someone's called
a "lazy sack of crap," they work harder

28
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:19,996
so they can just be
a "sack of crap."

29
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,074
This will be a problem.
People here follows memos.

30
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,751
Especially since that memo came out
saying we have to follow memos.

31
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,546
<i>This</i> one is gonna cause
potty-mouth chaos.

32
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,507
Ted's gearing up for a burst of
middle-management leadership.

33
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,900
Out goes the chest,
up goes the chin...

34
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,345
I am going to go get this fixed.

35
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,513
And away.

36
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:43,036
This whole memo thing is bringing up
this strange sensation.

37
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,354
It's like my feelings are itchy.

38
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,358
Sounds like something human
is trying to fight its way out of you.

39
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,352
Yes, I think it's an emotion...

40
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,612
Like joy or spicy food.

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,645
Technically, spicy food isn't a...

42
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,577
So what is it about the memo
that brings all this up?

43
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,958
It reminds me of another memo five years
ago, when I was promoted to this job.

44
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,628
I was up against Walter...

45
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,548
Who had the same last name as I do,
although we pronounce it differently.

46
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,217
There's another way
to pronounce "Palmer"?

47
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,585
In his family, the "p" is silent.

48
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,380
I think they're dutch.

49
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,475
Sounds like their stupid handiwork,
with their cheeses

50
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,478
and their giant propeller buildings.

51
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,937
So Walter... "Almer"?

52
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,555
I know.
Those people are unbelievable.

53
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:32,526
Anyway, they announced
the promotion in a memo,

54
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:36,280
Congratulating V. Palmer, only then,
it went on to wish <i>him</i> well.

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,372
I put through the paperwork,
but I've never known whether that job

56
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:41,911
was really meant for me or Walter.

57
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,205
Maybe that itchy feeling you have
is guilt.

58
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,183
Guilt is a powerful emotion.

59
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:48,242
Every Thanksgiving,
it makes me take three planes

60
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,294
just so I can visit
my racist aunt Cookie.

61
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:51,962
So this is guilt?

62
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,950
I always used to counteract
this feeling with other emotions,

63
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,799
like sugar or drunk.

64
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,111
You should talk Walter.
Maybe find some way to help him.

65
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:03,224
Guilt is a terrible thing
to carry around.

66
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,559
Well, I do <i>hate</i> this feeling.

67
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,396
- I hate it like I hate...
- Don't tell me. The dutch?

68
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,652
I don't hate the dutch.
I love the dutch.

69
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:15,111
That's why I hold them
to a higher standard.

70
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,962
I don't know where this came from,
but it's a mistake,

71
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,326
so I was hoping
HR could put out a correction.

72
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,703
- We'll look into the matter.
- Really?

73
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:28,249
The company doesn't
make mistakes like this, Mr. Crisp.

74
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,627
What about that memo
announcing "casual fribsday"?

75
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,740
The company said
that wasn't a mistake.

76
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,412
They explained that the ancient
Mayans prophesied fribsday...

77
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:41,556
The first ever eighth day of the week
which will occur in 2024.

78
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,534
And the company believes
should be celebrated casually.

79
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,141
I'll wear a denim pantsuit.

80
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,396
And when they urged
all employees to "carpoop"?

81
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,935
That was not mandatory.
Thank god.

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,747
But we found out what people will do
to park slightly closer to the building.

83
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,363
So you're not gonna
help me with this?

84
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,107
Sorry. I like the memo.

85
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,701
All day long, I have to listen
to people like you complain.

86
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,161
Now I can finally tell 'em
what I think,

87
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,372
you white-toothed Ken doll.

88
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,792
Having white teeth and looking like
a handsome doll is not exactly...

89
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:12,961
Turd-hat.

90
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,694
<i>They weren't going to retract the memo
about being to be rude and abusive,</i>

91
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:22,080
<i>and that meant things were going to get
very confusing for Phil and Lem</i>

92
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,722
<i>who unfortunately
never read their memos.</i>

93
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,212
And so this new line
of meals-ready-to-eat

94
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,493
gives the soldier in the field
a portable meal

95
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:33,055
with the home-cooked flavor of something
mom used to chemically dehydrate

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,565
and vacuum pack.

97
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,784
I was wondering
if there's enough protein content,

98
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,390
you boob.

99
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,238
Excuse me?

100
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,699
- I was wondering about the protein.
- But then you said...

101
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,409
- You boob.
- There it is.

102
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,942
I suppose we could add
more protein to the thing we call

103
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,331
"beige block three,"
or "stroganoff."

104
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,667
It's got plenty of protein,
you big-eyed stick insect.

105
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,711
- The problem is the vegetables.
- Okay,

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,970
let's just try to keep it
under control here.

107
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:01,135
Don't listen to these bucktoothed
hillbillies. Taste is the real problem.

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,261
It's a battlefield, not a four-star
restaurant, back-alley crab muffin.

109
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,050
I gotta ask... What's going on?

110
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:10,100
Because this meeting is a lot saucier
than the one yesterday.

111
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,336
Looks like somebody didn't
get the memo.

112
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:16,982
He asks a simple question and you give
him sarcasm for the eighties?

113
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,569
It's an actual memo.

114
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,198
They want us to insult each other...
Sir?

115
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,951
That wasn't a good one.

116
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,119
But in my meetings,
that won't happen.

117
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,623
- But the memo said we had to.
- We're not doing it in here, Pudberger.

118
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,584
What?
That's his last name.

119
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,080
<i>So Veronica went down
to the basement...</i>

120
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,985
<i>Hoping she'd feel better
if she talked to Walter Palmer.</i>

121
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,396
Hello, Walter.

122
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,027
I don't believe it. Veronica Palmer.

123
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm sorry, Palmer. I never could
get used to the way you pronounce it.

124
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,485
Here, I brought you a cake
and a jar of herring.

125
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,316
Maybe you can wait until I leave
before you smear the cake with it.

126
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:00,977
I'm not dutch.

127
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,904
And the dutch don't smear herring
on half the things you say they do.

128
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:06,801
But thanks for the cake.
Is it my birthday?

129
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:09,076
I sort of lose track
of time down here.

130
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,531
No, I just want to say
I've always felt bad

131
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,789
that we had to compete
for the same job.

132
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,918
Please.
I'm the one who feels bad.

133
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,336
I've hated how I acted in the bull pen
after losing that promotion.

134
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,997
It was not a good impression of you,

135
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:24,049
and I'm sorry
I stretched out your shoes.

136
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,927
Don't worry. They were
the cheap footwear of my former life.

137
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,233
Can I buy you something
to cheer this place up?

138
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,143
Maybe a lava lamp
or a freezer of steaks.

139
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:38,523
I'm the one who feels guilty
about the way I handled your promotion.

140
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,734
Let me make it up to you...
Take you out for a drink or something.

141
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,651
Ew.

142
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,280
Are very thoughtful, but I can't.

143
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,595
OI get it. You're still mad at me.

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,044
I'm such a jerk.

145
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,872
And I deserve to carry this guilt around
back and forth in this tiny basement.

146
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,416
I'll have a drink with you.

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,545
Any chance you have a bottle
so we can just knock it out right now?

148
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,877
That meeting was chaos.
I hate all the name-calling.

149
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:10,782
And it's not because my mama is fat
and does sit around the house.

150
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,890
I kind of like it.
It makes people freer...

151
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,180
Like they can say
whatever's on their mind.

152
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,936
Even Debbie spoke up today,
and she never talks in meetings.

153
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,439
We're not doing it in here,
Pudberger.

154
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,858
That's his last name.

155
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,152
- Let's just try to regroup.
- Wait!

156
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,695
You pretty-boy suit rack.

157
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,241
What this MRE needs
is Ethiopian stew.

158
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,369
It's hearty, nutritious and simple,

159
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,662
like all of you bastards.

160
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,829
She's never opened her mouth before,

161
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,000
- and it was a good suggestion.
- It was a good idea.

162
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,795
But Mark called her a Tory-loving
royalist, and it all fell apart again.

163
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,785
You don't like this because
you always have to be in control.

164
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,238
- You're a control freak.
- I don't always have to be in control.

165
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,220
Although,
it is my exact job description.

166
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,815
You're tall, you're handsome,
you got the power tie, the power suit.

167
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,429
People think you're intimidating,
and you like that because it means

168
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,752
- you get everything you want.
- First of all,

169
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,457
my appearance is not my fault.

170
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,608
God made me this way, and then
he told me where to shop for suits.

171
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,610
Ted, a little chaos
can be a good thing.

172
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,905
My grandpa met my grandma
when a Tornado blew her into his barn.

173
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,783
He pulled the rake out of her chest
and proposed on the spot.

174
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,772
We really should have
been reading these memos.

175
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,645
Damn! We didn't have to work
on Thanksgiving?

176
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,506
And look! Like I suspected, we were
supposed to be wearing lead aprons

177
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:27,236
when we were working
on that genital x-Ray project.

178
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:28,315
Here it is.

179
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,348
"Employees must now use
offensive or insulting language

180
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,873
"in the workplace."

181
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,471
I can play this game.

182
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,505
I wrote that humorous column
in my college newspaper...

183
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,406
"Lem's snappy answers
to theoretical physics questions."

184
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,029
You've been Lem-basted.

185
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,168
I'm terrible at insults.

186
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:48,028
As a child,
I was beaten up constantly.

187
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,172
The best comeback
I ever came up with was,

188
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,698
"You're right.
I'll work on that."

189
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:57,059
I can help you,
you sad jar of hobo urine.

190
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,622
I've been Lem-basted.

191
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,338
Who is that relaxed
and approachable guy?

192
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,133
Is that Ted?
Why, yes, it is.

193
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,802
You look like you're on your way
to mix cocktails.

194
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,750
I was thinking about what you said.

195
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,390
About how I might seem a little
controlling and intimidating.

196
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,986
So I tell you to take a look
at the way you approach life,

197
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:24,032
and you put different clothes on?
What a dill weed.

198
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,023
And that's not
a company-mandated insult.

199
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,024
That one came from the heart.

200
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,278
Come on. The clothes are symbolic...
the first step in saying

201
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,197
that I'm willing to make a change.

202
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,586
Actually, I was hoping
the clothes would cover it.

203
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,702
I had the worst night last night.

204
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:41,413
Didn't you get the memo?
Casual fribsday is not until 2024.

205
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,024
I'm trying to be less intimidating.
Apparently, my...

206
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,585
That's the fastest
I've ever lost interest in something.

207
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:50,505
I went out with Walter Palmer
last night because of you.

208
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,090
Me? What did I do?

209
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,664
You started questioning memos,

210
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:56,345
which brought up this guilt,
so I agreed to have drinks with the guy.

211
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:59,776
He told me, after he lost the promotion,
his wife left.

212
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,380
I felt even more guilty,
so I let him take me out to dinner,

213
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,311
where I learned
he also lost his house.

214
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,150
Then I find out
he's living in his parents' basement,

215
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:10,029
which is so damp, his dog got arthritis,
fell down the stairs

216
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,271
and now has to be carried around
like a suitcase.

217
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,189
- So I let him kiss me.
- Oh, my God!

218
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,777
But then I still felt guilty,
so I let him feel me up.

219
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,146
Yeah. I'm thinking
I might need new breasts.

220
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,203
These are covered in sadness.

221
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:24,122
This is like the most
depressing "penthouse" letter ever.

222
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,789
I kept waiting for the guilt to lift,
but it never did.

223
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:28,428
What am I gonna do?

224
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,507
Maybe I'll buy him a boat.
Guys like boats, right?

225
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,551
I had a great time last night.

226
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,288
I was wondering if maybe
I could take you to dinner later

227
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,604
for a little Walter and Veronica,
version 2.0.

228
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,976
How would you like a boat?

229
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,852
Something you could just get in
and go...

230
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,427
Really shove off...

231
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,023
Just get out of here.

232
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,068
I couldn't take a gift like that
from you. I'd feel too guilty.

233
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,809
Yeah, guilt. What a horrible thing.

234
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,454
See you at 8:00.

235
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,036
And this time, please don't say,
"thank you for kissing with me."

236
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:09,058
Can you press "10" for me,
you rat-face Nazi?

237
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:15,132
Your breasts should be on display
at the swiss museum of miniatures.

238
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:18,299
You said 10, right?

239
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,942
Before we start,
I realize some people may think

240
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,682
I'm controlling and a intimidating.

241
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:26,143
But I want you to know,
all ideas are welcome.

242
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:29,438
Really.
I want to hear from everyone.

243
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:34,526
Could you repeat that in English?
I don't speak wuss-ass.

244
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,486
We're not doing that in here.

245
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,114
I'm so very sorry.
You won't hear another word out of me.

246
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,284
So not being controlling
lasted for about one second?

247
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,212
Sorry.

248
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,537
The naggity-nag-nag bitchy-bitch
is right.

249
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,815
Anything anyone wants to say
is fine by me.

250
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,310
You heard the corporate chimp.

251
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,513
Start making suggestions
for meals-ready-to-eat

252
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,503
before his head
goes back up his butt.

253
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,548
I like fresh tomatoes,
right off the vine.

254
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,706
Mark, use your head.
How are we gonna get fresh...

255
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,345
Open forum, chim chim.
Just let the ideas flow.

256
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:05,182
I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm writing it down.

257
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,852
Sometimes when I'm lonely,
I like to watch myself eat.

258
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,564
- Why don't we put a mirror?
- You like to watch yourself eat?

259
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm writing it down.

260
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,569
I like to have some wine
with dinner.

261
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,820
They're soldiers!

262
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:21,678
Writing it down.

263
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,666
- I need your help, slut.
- What's the problem, tight-ass?

264
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,293
Easy, Linda.
It's a memo, not a magic shield.

265
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,922
I need to make a man
run screaming from my life.

266
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,124
I'm happy you came to me for advice,

267
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,302
but sad
this is my area of expertise.

268
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,907
I went out again with Walter.

269
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,650
Now if I blow him off, he'll think
that I hurt him five years ago,

270
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,559
then looked him up, got him to fall in
love with me so I could hurt him again.

271
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,946
Plus, I backed over his foot
when I was leaving,

272
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,882
which,
according to our relationship math,

273
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,024
means tonight's the night.

274
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,069
In my experience,
scaring a man away is pretty easy.

275
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:02,844
Basically, you're gonna want to put
three words into heavy rotation:

276
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,033
future, babies, commitment.

277
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,910
Back off! I need my space.

278
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:10,622
Those words are powerful.

279
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,909
What are you ciphering there,
Jethro?

280
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,326
I've really enjoyed repeating
the put-downs you've been feeding me,

281
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:25,178
but I want to do it on my own.

282
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,014
Give a man an insult,
he can hurt people for a day.

283
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,018
Teach a man to insult,
he can hurt people who tease him

284
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,020
because he never learned to fish.

285
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:36,518
Anyway, I've devised a formula.

286
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,172
Look at that.

287
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,768
You had a problem in your life
and who stepped up to help you? Math.

288
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,530
She has always been there for you.

289
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:47,325
If she ever took physical form,
I'd leave my wife and marry her.

290
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,286
Stand in line, my friend.

291
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,990
It's really quite simple.

292
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,639
You take a person's
most marked physical feature,

293
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,566
compare it to genitalia...
Male, female or animal...

294
00:13:56,691 --> 00:14:00,547
And end with the suffix
"-bag," "-wipe" or "-muncher."

295
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,187
You could also add
an optional reference to excretion

296
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:06,094
from any of the glorious openings
offered by the human body.

297
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,347
Should we take her for a spin?

298
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,865
Excuse me, Roger?

299
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,228
Your head looks like lizard butt flap,
you snot wipe.

300
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,738
It looks like
somebody can't get enough of me.

301
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,164
You're right. I can't.

302
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,546
In fact, we need to talk about us

303
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:32,078
and the future of our babies
and how they'll be committed.

304
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,624
That's a lot to take in. Okay.

305
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,085
I need this relationship to have
a future because I need babies.

306
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,229
That's right...
Big, screaming babies

307
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:44,549
shooting out of my uterus,
just stacking up like cordwood.

308
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,438
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

309
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,326
That's all I ever think about...

310
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,514
The future, babies and commitment.

311
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,729
Slow down!
This is happening a little fast.

312
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:01,775
Okay! I'll do it!

313
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,445
- Babies, babies, babies, babies...
- Yes!

314
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,070
As many as you want!

315
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,550
My parents always say
that since my wife left,

316
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,318
I've been too cautious
about relationships, but damn it!

317
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,162
This is the one. I know it is.

318
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
Let's light this candle

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,253
and blast off into a calm, settled,
monogamous relationship.

320
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,670
Look at me.

321
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,255
I'm so happy, I can't feel my legs.

322
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,861
So I took everyone's ideas
for the meals-ready-to-eat project,

323
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:32,236
and here it is.

324
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,545
The specs called for a soldier to carry
three of these in his backpack.

325
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,170
Now we have to design
a 14-foot soldier.

326
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,157
Good news, Ted.

327
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,400
I cured Walter
of his fear of commitment.

328
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:47,246
He wants to get portraits painted
of the two of us with his suitcase dog,

329
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,864
all wearing turtlenecks.

330
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:52,346
I've got a box lunch
the size of a handball court.

331
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:55,287
Now I gotta go find Phil and Lem
and straighten out this MRE disaster.

332
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,905
Don't "boo-hoo" me.

333
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,624
Did that MRE touch your boobies?

334
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,627
Then shut the hell up.

335
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,169
<i>What I didn't know was
Phil and Lem weren't in the lab.</i>

336
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:10,247
<i>They were having
an entirely different adventure.</i>

337
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,469
<i>Test-driving
their new insult-generating formula.</i>

338
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,519
Your eyes look like
two beady rabbit pellets

339
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:16,439
on the face
of a monkey-licking pus-bomb.

340
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:19,019
- You've just been Phil-abusted.
- Nice!

341
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:22,436
That's it.

342
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,873
Sill up your canker-blossomed hole,
you ale-soused apple-John.

343
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,729
That was the elizabethan model.

344
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,354
Ye have been served.

345
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,914
Nice man-boobs,
for a panty-snatching steroid muncher.

346
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:44,357
What's the matter?
Didn't you get the memo?

347
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,468
He didn't.
He delivers the water.

348
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,964
He doesn't work here.

349
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,605
Thank God, that finally broke.

350
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,609
I may go home early today

351
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,238
and never come back.

352
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,979
You can't go home.
I need you guys.

353
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,785
And that's it... the insulting
language stuff has got to end,

354
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,360
you douche-nozzles.

355
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,315
Sorry. That was one for the road.

356
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,666
We just got Ted-ucated.

357
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,828
Look, Janet, it's crazy out there.

358
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,848
Two of my guys
just got beaten with water.

359
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,251
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do, Mr. Crisp.

360
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,600
I don't like
that memo anymore either.

361
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,877
Way too many people
are having fun with my name.

362
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,535
I'm surprised it took this memo
to get that train out of the station.

363
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,280
I've had several complaints,

364
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,976
but the company is not going to admit
it made a mistake.

365
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,894
What if it didn't have to admit it?

366
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,218
What if it could just say
that it's making a new policy,

367
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:49,109
based on a groundswell
of employee opinion?

368
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,331
Look at that pretty little head
of yours, working up ideas.

369
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:53,405
I'm a fan.

370
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,073
I like you, too.

371
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,451
So we gonna do this?

372
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,370
What are we talking about, exactly?

373
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,579
End this policy.

374
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,914
That.

375
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,669
If we call it a groundswell,
I think the company would go for it.

376
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:10,170
That way,
it gets to pat itself on the back

377
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,465
for listening
and being a great communicationer.

378
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:13,883
"Communicator."

379
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,802
That's not what it says
in the handbook.

380
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,733
I just got this memo. We don't get
to swear at each other anymore.

381
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,584
It was due to a "groundsmell."

382
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,802
The good news is,
this company does not squander

383
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,651
its best and brightest typing memos.

384
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,798
So is this all going in the MRE?

385
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,533
It now stands for
"meal really enormous."

386
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:41,411
This is what happens
when you take everyone's suggestions.

387
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,996
Why did you do that?

388
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,883
Because someone I care about
thought I was controlling.

389
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,251
You care that much
what I think about you?

390
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,754
You are talking about me?

391
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:57,677
So is any of this stuff usable?

392
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,010
Debbie's ethiopian stew
is pretty good.

393
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:02,412
And when it hardens,

394
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,726
it forms an unbreakable arch support
in your foot.

395
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:06,932
Well, see? There you go.

396
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,638
All you needed was one good idea.

397
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,301
And you got that
because you listened to everyone,

398
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,398
which you did
because you listened to me.

399
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,820
In case you missed it,
the lesson here is listen to me.

400
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,252
What's this I'm hearing
about ethiopian stew shoes?

401
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,118
It's all they're talking about
upstairs.

402
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,586
Speaking of exciting developments...

403
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,133
When I was in HR,

404
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:28,500
I dug up this old memo
about your promotion.

405
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,668
All the executives
had to sign off on it.

406
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:32,014
Really?

407
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,496
"I know we agreed not to let women
into upper management,

408
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,884
but Veronica Palmer is man-smart.

409
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,840
And, hello, as she breaks
through the glass ceiling,

410
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,848
we can all look up her skirt."

411
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,866
That promotion was mine.

412
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,803
I didn't ruin Walter's life.

413
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,339
What is wrong
with those old farts upstairs?

414
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:54,818
Seriously, they wrote that in 2005.

415
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:58,154
I am off to scrape Walter
off my shoe.

416
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:02,312
- You may want to be more gentle...
- I have a hickey on my belly.

417
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,726
<i>And so,</i>

418
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:11,084
<i>Veronica went down to the basement
and broke up with Walter.</i>

419
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:16,175
<i>But then she made it up to him
by giving him a new aboveground office.</i>

420
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,859
Thank you.

421
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:26,516
<i>Phil and Lem
retired their insult formula</i>

422
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,934
<i>and made amends with the water guy.</i>

423
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:34,387
And I realized communication
isn't just about talking.

424
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,062
It's about listening.

425
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,737
I just wanted to say
I appreciated your work on the MRE,

426
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,574
and when it comes to any other thoughts
you may have, I'm listening.

427
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:44,362
I think we should go out, Ted.

428
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,578
You can do whatever you want to me.

429
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:53,024
And just because I listen doesn't mean
I have to take every suggestion.
