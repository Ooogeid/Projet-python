00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:06,961
Life always present choices.

4
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:09,884
Where you can take the high-road
or the low-road.

5
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,097
<i>This is Pete Gilroy.</i>

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,722
<i>He runs others researches
in development department.</i>

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,515
<i>Pete is a low-road guy.</i>

8
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,550
Is this anyone's hoagie?

9
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:20,227
Anyone? No.

10
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:21,932
I asked.

11
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,817
I, on the other hand, try
to stay on the high road.

12
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,290
Two? But only paid for one.

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,576
That's it.

14
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,119
Oh, almost...

15
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,567
there.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,082
Ted on his back,
straining with effort?

17
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:44,502
There's a picture
I can call back later.

18
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:47,922
That's gonna hurt for a while.

19
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,950
Strengthening your hand
for that big date with yourself?

20
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,886
Nope, just practicing for later
when I squeeze your mom's boobs.

21
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,367
I'm not proud of that.

22
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,074
I actually had a lovely conversation
with Pete's mom at the Christmas party.

23
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,397
The mat and the vest
are both magnetized.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,160
When a child puts on the vest
and steps on the mat,

25
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,615
the magnets repel each other,
making the child almost weightless,

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,405
like an astronaut
bouncing on the moon.

27
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,825
Now every child can have
hours of repulsive fun.

28
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:18,725
Pete Gilroy's team
is working on a similar system,

29
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,705
and the company will only go forward
with one.

30
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:24,253
So we need to make damn sure
that it is

31
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:25,668
"the floater."

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,594
That's not such a good name.

33
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,359
What about "the astro-nut"?

34
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,163
You know, because it's crazy.

35
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:37,054
Has waving your hands
ever sold me on anything?

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,538
Remember
"corpse-eating battlefield robot"?

37
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,938
What we have here is...

38
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,811
"The dream glider."

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,921
- That's fantastic.
- That's fantastic.

40
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,532
This technology also has
a exciting military potential.

41
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:00,218
Imagine soldiers hovering
above a magnetized battlefield.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,246
The Chinese won't know what hit 'em.

43
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,750
Come on.
We all know that war is coming.

44
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,542
Can't we develop one thing that doesn't
end up being used to kill people?

45
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,882
Even our fat-free cinnamon roll
led to that new sticky bomb.

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,471
You're so moral and perfect
all the time.

47
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:18,804
Do singing birds and mice dress you
and brush your hair in the morning?

48
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:26,103
Although my dad does call me "princess,"
and there's a dwarf in my building.

49
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,569
We need your help.

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,739
- We were working really hard.
- And we had this pinata.

51
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:39,283
Pinata? That doesn't sound
like really hard work.

52
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,577
It was stuffed with science.

53
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:44,545
And...

54
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:46,147
Pinata!

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,715
And now the thermostat's broken,

56
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,760
and we were wondering if you would
tell the company so they'll fix it.

57
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,346
We're worried if we report it,
the company will retaliate,

58
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,182
like when I broke the flywheel
and they canceled my gym membership.

59
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,560
I mean, you remember
how ripped I was gettin'.

60
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:09,730
Guys, you broke the thermostat.
Just take the high road and report it.

61
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:13,648
And they canceled your gym membership
'cause no matter what class you were in,

62
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,223
you did jazzercise.

63
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,024
But I don't want
to take the high road.

64
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,149
It's high.

65
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:21,646
I agree.

66
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:24,384
We could fall off.

67
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,505
I can't stand that Veronica
makes fun of me in meetings.

68
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,087
If the boss doesn't respect me,
other people won't,

69
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,166
including the little Linda
in my head.

70
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,687
And even on a good day,
that bitch never shuts up.

71
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,822
Veronica just has trouble
relating to you.

72
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:43,431
She thinks you always
want to do the right thing.

73
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,787
I don't alway do the right thing.

74
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,020
Hey, daddy. Hi, Linda.

75
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,688
Hey, sweetie. Want to go smoke
a cigarette in the bathroom?

76
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,905
See? I can be bad.

77
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:57,111
Don't ever smoke. Every time you smoke
a cigarette, Santa Claus kills an elf.

78
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,573
What, helping or hurting?
Because I can throw Jesus into the mix.

79
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,576
I think we're good.
Honey, you ready to go down to the hive?

80
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,885
The hive? I thought you didn't like
Veridian's after-school care

81
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,916
because they use the kids for free
janitorial work around the building.

82
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,155
The hive has changed. A lot of
the executives' kids go there now.

83
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,006
So they teach music and Chinese,
the weaknesses of the Chinese...

84
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,460
Chet just call.

85
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:22,345
Oh, hi, Rose. You look fabulous.
Have you lost weight?

86
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,847
I have been playing
a lot of dodgeball.

87
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,766
Well, it's working for you.

88
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,754
I'm trying to teach Rose
that it's not all about looks.

89
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,897
- She's also very smart.
- Smart enough to stay skinny.

90
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,859
Anyway, Chet wants us to come up
and pitch him the dream glider.

91
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,235
Dream glider?

92
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,439
I know. It's fantastic.

93
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:43,032
Of course,
lady pope over here thinks it's immoral.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,619
I'm no lady pope. I once slept
with my cousin's husband.

95
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:51,666
They were breaking up,
and I was really drunk.

96
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:53,750
And don't ever do that either,

97
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,712
or the tooth fairy will put
other people's teeth in your mouth.

98
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,258
I'll meet you in Chet's office
after I drop off Rose.

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,929
Come on, sweetie.

100
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:04,602
Let's go try to forget
all the stuff that Linda said.

101
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:10,498
Allowing a child of 80 pounds or less
to hover, roll,

102
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:14,044
spin or flip without ever
leaving their home planet.

103
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,371
We'll see what testing says,
but I'm flipping for this.

104
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,096
That's funny, because you just used
one of the words Ted just said.

105
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,594
No, that's great, guys. It's a really
good job. I do have one question.

106
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,331
Are little boys gonna want
to look like they have a set of boobies?

107
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,011
Chet, my eyes are up here.

108
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,876
Let's see if I can get the...
the tassels going in...

109
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,050
in different directions.
There we go.

110
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,654
Anyway, I think it's a home run.

111
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,477
Pete, why don't you show Chet
what our team has come up with?

112
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,171
It may not sexualize children,

113
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:53,194
but we think that every kid's
gonna want to wear one of these.

114
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,814
Lower center of gravity.

115
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,190
Allows the kid to be even safer
and jump even higher.

116
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,601
Sure, they're doing whatever they can
to get out of that diaper.

117
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>Pete and I have a long history
of trying to undermine each other.</i>

118
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,653
Solar painting. It absorbs the sun's
energy, cutting heating costs...

119
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,547
Fantastic.
I have one question.

120
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,249
Can you make the color
look even more like barf?

121
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,085
Maybe add some bits of chewed-up
hot dog to complete the effect.

122
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,495
It's a purification straw.

123
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,953
Any water you drink through it,
no matter how polluted,

124
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:28,904
- becomes safe for consumption.
- That's a great idea.

125
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,734
"No dessert, kids, until you
finish drinking your sewage."

126
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:38,746
<i>Occasionally, Veronica tried
to get her licks in, too.</i>

127
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,344
<i>Unfortunately, she took big swings
but rarely connected.</i>

128
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,861
Pete, with your diaper,

129
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,489
kids won't have to stop
playing to go to the bathroom.

130
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,854
Do those come in disposable

131
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,458
or do you have
to wash 'em out each time?

132
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,579
Wait. I can do this.

133
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:01,963
Is it true that in space,

134
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,965
no one can hear you poop?

135
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:09,470
Oh, come on. That was hilarious.

136
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,052
I hate Pete.
We need to crush that wanker,

137
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:14,647
- teach him not to mess with us anymore.
- I'm sick of this war.

138
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,356
It just hurts both our teams.

139
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:20,189
We need to change tactics, get along
with Pete... Take the high road.

140
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:24,387
I don't take the high road, Ted.
The high road leads to pansy town.

141
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,168
Or maybe it leads
to a more effective way

142
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,469
of handling an adversary... ville.

143
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,034
You take your road. I'll take mine.

144
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:33,953
Look at that thing.

145
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:37,630
Somewhere, a naked sumo wrestler
is looking for his pants.

146
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,958
Damn it! That's fantastic.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,049
<i>Veridian Dynamics</i>

148
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:50,094
<i>Doing the right thing...
It's important.</i>

149
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,388
<i>What does it mean in business?</i>

150
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,327
<i>We have no idea.</i>

151
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,629
<i>We know what wrong is.</i>

152
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,761
<i>Actually, no, we don't,</i>

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>because we're a successful company,</i>

154
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,483
<i>not some boring ethics professor...</i>

155
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,647
<i>Veridian Dynamics</i>

156
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,605
<i>Right and Wrong. It means something.</i>

157
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,601
<i>We just don't know what.</i>

158
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,145
For guys who spend as much time
thinking about boobs as we do,

159
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,390
you'd think
we would have caught this one.

160
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,088
- Man, it is hot in here.
- Yes, it's very unpleasant.

161
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,841
So you've decided
not to report the thermostat?

162
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,639
You guys have more brains
than a zombie Thanksgiving,

163
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,387
and your genius plan
is to do nothing?

164
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:37,101
We're not doing nothing.
Doing nothing is passive.

165
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,810
We're waiting,
from the action verb "to wait..."

166
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:44,056
For someone who finds this heat
so intolerable, they have to report it.

167
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,776
Can I get you some hot tea
or Mexican chilies?

168
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,686
For God sake, Ted, help us!

169
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:51,572
I'm sorry, but you made this bed.
Now you gotta sweat in it.

170
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,223
So I need you to look at Pete's version
of the dream glider.

171
00:08:56,978 --> 00:09:00,414
See if you can redesign it so it doesn't
look like a toilet strapped to your ass.

172
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,918
- Why would we want to help Pete?
- Or you? Making us suffer like this.

173
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,588
It's a goodwill gesture.
I'm trying to make peace with Pete,

174
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:08,714
you know,

175
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,717
warm things up between us,
get things cooking.

176
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,013
Light a fire under our friendship.
Sweaty, sweaty, sweaty, sweaty.

177
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,816
Oh, I get it.

178
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,870
Because zombies would eat
brains for Thanksgiving.

179
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,603
That's outrageous.

180
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,530
You make no sound when you walk.

181
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:36,298
Then I am ready to leave the monastery
and avenge my parents.

182
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:37,868
I'm kidding.

183
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:41,414
I just buy expensive shoes
made from very soft animals.

184
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,586
I know you're too much of a she-Gandhi
to ever do anything wrong,

185
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,419
but I need a person who will

186
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:50,761
and thought maybe
you could suggest someone

187
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,216
- who's not as...
- Me!

188
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,468
Yes, exactly. Not as you.

189
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,779
No, I mean, I suggest me.

190
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm not some scout girl.

191
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,770
You are eager
and desperate for my approval.

192
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,312
And that's two of the three qualities
I look for in a partner.

193
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,460
I need someone who knows
about testing and is willing to cheat

194
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,360
to make sure
Pete's magnet pants test badly.

195
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,815
Then you need me.

196
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,325
As testing coordinator,
I totally know how to manipulate it.

197
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,389
I mean, the testing process
is so flawed anyway.

198
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,705
Really, the whole thing
is a bunch of garbage.

199
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,724
- I gotta go.
- Okay, bye, daddy.

200
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,590
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

201
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:35,078
What are you doing here?

202
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,803
I come every afternoon
for the juice boxes and story time.

203
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,473
I have a daughter.

204
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,770
Your daughter's into those pioneer
girl dolls that come with the books.

205
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:49,492
- Your daughter collect those?
- Only, like, all of 'em.

206
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,484
We just got Ida Mae.

207
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,279
- Ida Mae kills me.
- I know. The girl has rickets,

208
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,490
and she wants to teach
her brother to square-dance?

209
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:59,997
I'll die if she doesn't
survive the typhus epidemic.

210
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,314
She's a fighter.

211
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,621
So, Pete, actually,
I was on my way to see you.

212
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:07,187
I had my guys make some adjustments
on your magnet pants

213
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:09,543
so they look less like
something you'd drop a deuce in.

214
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,930
Yes, I get it. They're diapery.

215
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:14,507
What's your game?

216
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:18,606
We've been attacking each other's
projects for years. It's time we stop.

217
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,680
Let our ideas live
or die on their own merits.

218
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,390
You're trying to glom on to my project
because you heard it's testing first.

219
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:25,800
You're testing first?

220
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,396
Look at the big, saucer eyes.

221
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:31,387
Like you didn't know.
You're not testing for another week.

222
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:34,151
By the time they test your boob vest,
it'll be dead.

223
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,320
It's not a boob vest.
You're a boob vest.

224
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,700
That's not what I'm doing, anyway.
I'm reaching out to you, dipwad.

225
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,993
Screw you.

226
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,077
Fine.

227
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,189
I was trying to be a grown-up,
except for the dipwad thing.

228
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,540
But I can see you're not interested.

229
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,585
So the gloves are off.

230
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,762
By the way,

231
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,382
Ida Mae survives
the typhus epidemic...

232
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,741
But then gets trampled to death
by a Buffalo.

233
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,930
You are a special kind of monster.

234
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,598
Pete's project is testing today.

235
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,293
I want to burn his diaper
and salt the earth beneath it

236
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,566
so no new product
will ever grow there.

237
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,616
Test groups are easy to manipulate.

238
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,029
People always agree
with the strongest voice in the room.

239
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,647
All we have to do is
get one charismac person

240
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:23,242
and make sure that person
is relentlessly negative,

241
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,697
and then we'll be puttin'
on a pair of brand-new happy hats.

242
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,543
What is it like in there?

243
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,963
Actually,
today is a pretty good day.

244
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,842
So Pete's product
is gonna be tested by children.

245
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,261
Then we have to find
a charismatic child.

246
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:52,438
We'd like to check out Rose, please.

247
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,633
It's ready to go.

248
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:08,704
Now all we have to do is get Patricia
to touch it, and it becomes her problem.

249
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,879
I called her. She's on her way.

250
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,150
Have you ever noticed
how much of men's lives are spent

251
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,534
trying to trick women
into touching something?

252
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,881
Hey, guys. You wanted to see me?

253
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,550
If you think it's so damn hot in here,
turn down the thermostat.

254
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,055
I mean, hi, Patricia.

255
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,307
You know, it is awfully hot in here.

256
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,072
We like it hot.
Keeps out the... penguins.

257
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:33,423
There's a bunch of 'em back there

258
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,356
that have been trying to get in.

259
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,925
There's no air in this room.
It's making you guys weird.

260
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,621
What did you do,
break the thermostat? Yes.

261
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,123
I barely touched it.

262
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,042
- Is that how you're gonna play it?
- But I didn't even...

263
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,920
We're past that now.
Now we're on to how you're gonna fix it.

264
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,257
I can't tell the company. They'll
poison my food to make me infertile.

265
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,292
They don't do things like that
or cancel gym memberships.

266
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,722
I guess I'll just have to pay
to get it fixed myself.

267
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:11,967
Really? You're going to fix it
with your own money?

268
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:18,041
Maybe you'll learn a valuable lesson
and be more careful next time.

269
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:26,328
And so I joined Lem and Phil
on the low road.

270
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:29,203
And since testing first
is a huge advantage,

271
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,311
I need to make sure
that my project goes before Pete's.

272
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:34,999
William.

273
00:14:35,383 --> 00:14:36,783
Look what I found.

274
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,170
It is a signed first edition.

275
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,631
Harry E. Wilson's
"Ethics in testing"?

276
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,924
And it's yours

277
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,811
if you do me one favor.

278
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,929
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to get my hands on that book.

279
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,504
You're going to be in a room
filled with weak, malleable children,

280
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,311
and a man will bring in a toy.

281
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,940
When he does, you're gonna say
very bad things about it.

282
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,067
- Why?
- We're telling you to,

283
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,195
and you should always do
what adults tell you to do,

284
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,947
especially when they give you candy.

285
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,319
It's just a fun game we're playing,

286
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:10,270
like dress-up,
only instead of clothes,

287
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,870
we're dressing up the things
that are coming out of your mouth.

288
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,844
I want you to start by calling
the toy a creative misfire,

289
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:19,543
an ill-conceived design paradigm
that's irrelevant to your demographic.

290
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,047
- Is she talking to me?
- She's trying to.

291
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,676
She's a kid. She has to say things
that a kid would say,

292
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,144
like, "that's not phat. It's whack."

293
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,765
Do the kids still talk like that?
It was very hip when I was 8.

294
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,685
Let's put a pin in the lingo,
flavor flav.

295
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,872
If anyone says something positive,

296
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,274
you dismiss it
with a derisive laugh.

297
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:42,817
A what?

298
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,862
No, no. It's more like...

299
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,573
- Like that.
- It's more like a...

300
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,006
No, it's an actual laugh. It...

301
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,469
It's more of a gesture.

302
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,835
It's a scoff. It's a, "huh."

303
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,922
She's so sweet.

304
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,878
Our little killing machine.

305
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:09,503
She's gonna destroy
Pete's moon diaper.

306
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,744
You're phat, Linda.

307
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,506
Why would you say that to me?

308
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:17,810
I mean "phat" with a p-h.

309
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,187
I'm reaching out to you
with your own lingo.

310
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:24,201
I couldn't have done this
without you.

311
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:26,803
Ain't no thang.

312
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:30,225
<i>Hi, kids. My name's William,</i>

313
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:34,327
and I'm here to show you
an exciting new Veridian product.

314
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,843
She nailed the laugh.

315
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,705
She's very useful.

316
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:44,042
Oh, God. That's our dream glider!

317
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:45,755
Mother...

318
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,633
Good news. I switched the testing.

319
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,843
What's Rose doing in there?

320
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,766
So any first impressions?

321
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,641
I'd never play with that.

322
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,517
<i>I think it's stupid.</i>

323
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,084
It looks dangerous,
like it could kill a Jonas Brother.

324
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,004
So any other thoughts?

325
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:13,761
I got an estimate.

326
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,536
Fixing the particle-based environmental
control thermostat costs $2,000.

327
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,205
That's a lot.

328
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,041
But you did really break it.

329
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,534
I can't afford that,
so I called my ex-boyfriend Rolf.

330
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,129
He works in AC.

331
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,966
He'll fix it for free
if I have sex with him.

332
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,887
Sex is good, right?

333
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,089
Not the way Rolf does it.

334
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:43,562
We're sorry.

335
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,048
Why? You guys didn't do anything.

336
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:49,423
We broke the thermostat
and made you think it was you.

337
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,237
So in that sense, we did.

338
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,199
- Why? I thought we were friends.
- We are.

339
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,953
- Maybe not good friends.
- Good friends would never do this.

340
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,873
- We're not even good people.
- We're really not.

341
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,959
You jerks get
your own thermostat fixed.

342
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:09,380
Plus, each of you give me $500
or I'll tell the company you broke it.

343
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,632
We're not giving you any money.
No way.

344
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,970
Then... Fight each other.

345
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,972
- What?
- That's crazy.

346
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,308
That's the deal.
Either you pay me the money,

347
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,517
or you fight.

348
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,519
And now it's $700.

349
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:27,993
That's insane, okay? We're friends.
There's no way Phil and I...

350
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,073
I can't believe that you involved
my daughter, and you got her to lie.

351
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,741
She was a star, Ted.

352
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,916
And you're not so pure.
You're the one who switched the testing.

353
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,415
What were you thinking?
And pulling little Rose into it?

354
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:46,887
That was us.

355
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,601
Switching the testing...
how dare you?

356
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,632
Testing is a sacred
covenant between our company

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,129
and the American consumer.

358
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:55,923
You defiled that trust.

359
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:59,472
Stop, both of you.
You must stop talking.

360
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,216
I think we're winning.

361
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,102
Yhe project is now dead
because we all took the low road.

362
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,672
I was right. We should always
stay on the high road.

363
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,979
Lesson learned. The end.

364
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,964
- And you two are worse than me.
- Actually, I think the lesson here is,

365
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,991
when we're on the low road,
we really have to coordinate better.

366
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,994
Now hear me out. Ted, I need you
to set up another round of testing.

367
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,664
You mentioned
you have access to a dwarf.

368
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,292
- We dress him as a kid...
- First of all, he's 74 years old.

369
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,344
And at the risk of
you not respecting me,

370
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,181
I'm gonna have to say, I'm done.

371
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,174
I'm starting to feel
like a Bond villain.

372
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,411
Here's what's gonna happen.

373
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:40,888
First, you'll tell all those children
that what you did was wrong.

374
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:43,521
Most importantly, I need your word

375
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,852
that the dwarf will live out the rest
of his life without our involvement.

376
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,923
I can't promise that.

377
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,859
You never know
when we might need an elderly dwarf.

378
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,173
Listen, I just looked over the specs
that you gave me with my guys,

379
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,706
and there's some really good stuff here.
So thanks.

380
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,533
You're welcome.

381
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:13,713
So maybe next time we can try
not to undermine each other so much.

382
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:16,549
- That's what I'm thinking.
- Really?

383
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,720
- Maybe we can even be friends.
- I'd like that.

384
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,860
Great. I just remembered...

385
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,934
You tried to rig the testing
with your daughter.

386
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,435
So we can't be friends,
'cause you're a douche.

387
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,669
Maybe I don't want
to be your friend either.

388
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:33,107
You hear that? Even a douche
doesn't want to be your friend!

389
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:36,944
I'm not proud of that.

390
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,870
And then we went back to his place.

391
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:40,968
I mean, he was my cousin's husband,

392
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:43,990
and I knew it was wrong,
but they were splitting up.

393
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,120
And you know how it is
when you're ovulating.

394
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,332
I think we've heard enough
about not doing bad things.

395
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,517
See?
We're out of here in five minutes.

396
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:55,123
Told you that would work.
