00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:48,548
{\pos(192,220)}When you run a R&D department for one
of the largest companies in America,

18
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,217
{\pos(192,240)}every day brings exciting new problems
waiting to be solved.

19
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,596
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Why?

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,431
{\pos(192,240)}I was just seeing what small talk
might look like.

21
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,382
- Usually you...
- Please stop.

22
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,139
I feel like I pissed away my day.

23
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:03,311
We have a problem.

24
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:06,212
{\pos(192,240)}The food division just told me
that the "extra fun mac and cheese"

25
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:08,270
{\pos(192,240)}I'm supposed to be presenting to
the shareholders

26
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,469
{\pos(192,220)}causes blindness if eaten more
than twice a week.

27
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:13,072
{\pos(192,220)}Plus, no matter how long it's cooked,
it never gets hot.

28
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,240
Maybe it's not mac and cheese.

29
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,368
It has to be.
They've already designed the box.

30
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:21,116
{\pos(192,220)}Anyway, I need a new food product
I can unveil next week.

31
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,166
{\pos(192,220)}Something splashy, sexy.
The opposite of small talk.

32
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,508
{\pos(192,220)}Well, I'll see what we have.

33
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,338
Your hair looks nice like that.

34
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:31,924
{\pos(192,220)}It's small talk.

35
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,932
{\pos(192,220)}I liked it that time.

36
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:43,853
<i>This is Linda.</i>

37
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:46,768
<i>She's great.</i>

38
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:52,068
{\pos(192,220)}<i>But sometimes she gets
frustrated working here...</i>

39
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,112
<i>Which is understandable.</i>

40
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,115
So we looked at what
we have in the pipeline,

41
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:59,455
and the only food product that's close
to ready is Lem and Phil's project...

42
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,077
beef grown without cows.

43
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,440
Beef without cows?

44
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:03,581
I'm listening.

45
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,668
{\pos(192,220)}We take bovine cells and, surrounding
them in a bed of rich nutrients,

46
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,122
{\pos(192,220)}grow them into fully developed
cow tissue, or "beef."

47
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,644
{\pos(192,220)}- Cowless meat grown in a lab.
- I just said that.

48
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,192
{\pos(192,220)}- I'm explaining it.
- You're repeating it.

49
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,799
{\pos(192,220)}Lem, I'm...

50
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:24,040
That's something
Phil's been doing a lot of lately.

51
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:27,812
The company's legal department has
searched for why it's been happening.

52
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,441
<i>One idea is Phil may have
been traumatized</i>

53
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,021
<i>by burning his finger
on a chicken potpie.</i>

54
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,653
<i>Another theory
is that it's an old football injury.</i>

55
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,246
<i>I think it's because the company tried
to cryonically freeze him for a year...</i>

56
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,505
<i>And then accidentally
thawed him out a few days later.</i>

57
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,355
Did I do it again?

58
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,685
It seems like
it may be getting louder.

59
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,517
- How did I get wet?
- No one knows.

60
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:19,018
Perhaps you urinated.

61
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,334
In my face?

62
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,463
Sorry, I'm late.

63
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:27,372
The new bathroom towel dispenser
is an incredible jerk.

64
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,875
We're talking about growing meat
in the lab without cows.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,864
That's creepy.

66
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:35,256
Right?

67
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,051
I see. We're doing that.

68
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,396
We are, and we have five days
to make it happen.

69
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,515
Clean yourself up.

70
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,524
At least meat grown in a test tube
doesn't feel pain.

71
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,249
- Please tell me it doesn't feel pain.
- We don't think so.

72
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:01,674
Although interestingly,
it does respond to music.

73
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,765
<i>Lately there's been a little tension
in Phil and Lem's relationship.</i>

74
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,037
Once again, your attempt
to feed the meat blob

75
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:14,507
is being hindered
by your ridiculous use of mittens.

76
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:18,007
- Sometimes my hands get cold.
- Because you froze yourself.

77
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,176
Could we not talk about that
for one day?

78
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,183
Fine. I'll feed the meat blob.

79
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,641
Blobby. Like bobby,
only with an "L".

80
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,768
Don't name it,
or you won't want to eat it.

81
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,838
Remember Chester the carrot?

82
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,900
I miss him.

83
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,499
You're stealing more creamer?

84
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:49,622
It took me 20 minutes to dry my hands,
so I am owed 20 minutes of creamer.

85
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,165
- And how much is that?
- It's an infinite amount.

86
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,132
I know it doesn't make sense,

87
00:04:57,257 --> 00:05:00,882
but this small act of rebellion
keeps me sane, calm.

88
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,302
There's no creamer down the hall...

89
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,350
You want me to be calm, don't you?

90
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,061
I do.

91
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,729
I really do. When does that start?

92
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:22,563
- We should stop smiling at each other.
- I know.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,151
I wish you didn't have your stupid
one-office-affair rule

94
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:29,036
and that you hadn't used
your one office affair so stupidly.

95
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:37,479
And I wish you hadn't called me stupid
twice in one sentence, but here we are.

96
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,089
It's just... Veronica.

97
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,234
It doesn't matter who it was with...

98
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,297
I have to get back to work.

99
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,863
I don't see the appeal,
but whatever.

100
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:51,474
Why is there never any creamer?

101
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,321
Ants. No, ghosts.

102
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,796
No. I don't know.

103
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,019
I have a problem.

104
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,076
Legal is worried that Phil might
think his annoying outbursts

105
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,684
are connected
to our allegedly freezing him.

106
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:06,813
We didn't "allegedly" freeze him.
We froze him, like a human leftover.

107
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:10,800
Legal says we don't know what that
chamber was that he entered willingly.

108
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,790
The latest theory is that he may have
been trying to perform a magic trick.

109
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:18,127
That magic trick
where the company freezes him.

110
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:21,835
They are not comfortable
with him working on new projects

111
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,782
until we know he's not gonna sue us

112
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,301
for whatever did
or probably did not happen.

113
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,388
But without Phil, this meat project
isn't gonna happen.

114
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,282
But I need the meat project.

115
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,350
- You need Phil.
- But we can't use him.

116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,811
- Then no meat project.
- But I need the meat project.

117
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,096
- Then you need Phil.
- But I can't use him.

118
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,277
You prefer this to small talk?

119
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,112
Why does it have to be Phil?

120
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,139
Can't we just give this
to another team of lab drones?

121
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,201
Phil and Lem are
the best scientists we have.

122
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,548
- Phil, would you take a look at this?
- <i>It's true.</i>

123
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,503
<i>Together, there's nothing
they can't do.</i>

124
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:58,228
<i>They pioneered
retinal scan technology...</i>

125
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,632
Nice.

126
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:09,523
<i>Developed the next generation
of pepper spray.</i>

127
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,855
<i>They're even the best dancers
at the Christmas party.</i>

128
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,027
They're the best, but we can't use them
because we can't use Phil.

129
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,535
- And don't say I can't have the meat.
- Okay, how about this...

130
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,677
Instead of putting Phil
out to pasture,

131
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,286
why don't we try to make him feel good
about what he did?

132
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:37,211
Because...

133
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:38,867
Help me.

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,812
Phil did something
that no one else ever has.

135
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,204
That took courage.

136
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,002
If we help him realize
he's a hero, which he is,

137
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,308
he might look at the experience
more fondly.

138
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,969
Plus, he's a good guy.
It's the right thing to do.

139
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,931
- I'm still not...
- Then he won't sue the company.

140
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,521
Fine. We'll honor Phil.

141
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,814
But he owes me.

142
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,557
<i>The next day, we honored Phil</i>

143
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:12,147
<i>because it was the right thing to do</i>
<i>and because a happy scientist</i>

144
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,035
<i>is a non-suing,
cowless-meat-making scientist.</i>

145
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:18,378
And so for bravely pushing back
the boundaries of science,

146
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,688
on behalf of Veridian Dynamics,
I thank you, Phil,

147
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:25,714
and present you with our first ever
"Trailblazer of the year" award.

148
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,442
I've never been in the executive
dining room before. It's nice.

149
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,267
Now you can have lunch
here anytime you want.

150
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,587
- Thank you.
- For the next week.

151
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,265
Cryonics.

152
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:49,527
The first syllable is "cry",
so how great can it be? Am I right?

153
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,990
Anyway, I thought,
if I can advance science...

154
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,793
What a treat.

155
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,711
Do you hear that noise
coming from our hero?

156
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:11,571
That is the sound of courage,
ladies and gentlemen.

157
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,662
It's like an eagle screech.

158
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,694
And I can't hear it enough.

159
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,734
And neither can any of you.

160
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,529
What was the executive
dining room like?

161
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:33,780
Please. I never get tired
of hearing that story.

162
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:37,367
So there are tables, right,
with legs to hold 'em up?

163
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,535
Do the eagle scream.

164
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,870
I can't just do it, Lonny.
It has to ease out of me.

165
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,420
Like a bowel movement,
only louder and from his mouth.

166
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,458
Okay, you know what?
I am a "Trailblazer", Lem.

167
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,343
My picture is on the front page
of the company newsletter.

168
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,656
I am the "Below zero hero".

169
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,599
Julie in employee services
asked for my autograph.

170
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,741
That's right. Julie,
with those breasts in front.

171
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:07,355
It's a new Phil, Lem.
You had better get used to it.

172
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,317
That was super aggressive.

173
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,913
We've got four days, Ted.
Where are we on the lab meat?

174
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,984
Great. I'm on my way to Jerome
to have it taste-tested right now.

175
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:26,803
Isn't he still in the hospital
from the "extra fun mac and cheese"?

176
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,380
He got his eyesight back.

177
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,651
They just had scrape some of
the "extra fun" off of his optic nerve.

178
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,374
What the hell keeps happening
with the creamer?

179
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:42,100
- You have to stop stealing creamer.
- No. Is Blobby inside?

180
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,327
And we're not calling it Blobby.

181
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,361
You know, 'cause of Chester?
The carrot.

182
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:51,567
- They're going to catch you.
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.

183
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,904
- How you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

184
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,522
Though I still can't see green.

185
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:01,594
- What do we have today?
- You tell us.

186
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:07,921
If they catch you, they're gonna
fire you. And if they fire you, well...

187
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,585
You won't be here anymore.

188
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,607
I know,

189
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,670
but if I stop, I feel like
I'll be giving up a piece of my soul.

190
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,335
Besides, when this company
eliminates cows,

191
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,484
those creamers are gonna
be worth a fortune.

192
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,806
It tastes familiar.

193
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,099
Beef?

194
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,145
Chicken?
We'll take chicken.

195
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,189
What does it taste like?

196
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:33,567
Despair?

197
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,280
Is it possible it just needs salt?

198
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,564
"Despair". That's gonna be a challenge
to write the jingle.

199
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,107
We just have to redouble our efforts
and fix the problem.

200
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,486
That's what we do here.

201
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:51,503
If anyone can crack it,
it's Phil and Lem.

202
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,578
Hi, guys.

203
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:56,089
I don't think I can work
with Phil anymore, so...

204
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,269
We may have created
a monster in the lab.

205
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,856
It's not a monster. It's a cyborg
that can kill without remorse.

206
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,859
I was talking about Phil.
What... What are you talking about?

207
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,862
I was also talking about Phil.

208
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:21,823
It's classified.

209
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,725
But it's gonna be
a fantastic new tool

210
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,162
if we can get it to tell the difference
between soldiers and children.

211
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,004
We have a Phil problem,
and that means we have a meat problem.

212
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,710
I can't have a Phil
or a meat problem.

213
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,731
It's bad enough I have
a cyborg problem.

214
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,548
Stupid thing just kills whatever's
in front of it.

215
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:42,221
Anyway, I think all the attention
might have gone to Phil's head.

216
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,929
Now they aren't working together.

217
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,660
That's it. I'm taking care
of this myself.

218
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,210
Don't... hurt him.

219
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,798
I'm not gonna hurt him.

220
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:53,563
He has an inflated ego,
and that's something I can work with.

221
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:56,525
I'm gonna save the company
from a lawsuit, get Phil back to work

222
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,450
and grow me some lab meat.

223
00:12:58,836 --> 00:12:59,886
And then...

224
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,489
I'm gonna be
"Trailblazer of the year".

225
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,743
You know that's not a real award?

226
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:08,032
I want it.

227
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,672
Excuse me, fellas.
I need to borrow our hero.

228
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,851
Hi, hero.

229
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,563
I like the way you say my name.

230
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,775
I like the way I say it, too.

231
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,360
I could listen to you
say your name all day.

232
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,216
So could I. Veronica...

233
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:48,075
- Wait, I can do it better.
- That last one was really good.

234
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:51,278
Thank you, "Below Zero Hero".

235
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,292
Your hair looks great like that.

236
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,253
- You think? My wife hates it.
- She's a pig.

237
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:02,215
I'm sorry. I guess I just
don't like you talking about her.

238
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,053
That's okay. She doesn't like me
talking about her either...

239
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,790
Or even to her.

240
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,966
Hero, can I ask a favor?

241
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,587
Can I... get your autograph?

242
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,478
Of course...

243
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,416
Right here.

244
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,309
And initial here, here and here.

245
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,244
And date it here.

246
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,158
Look, you just signed a waiver
saying that you won't sue the company.

247
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:40,817
Of all the pieces of paper I could've
randomly picked for you to autograph...

248
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,538
That is so funny.

249
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,761
Hero time's over.
Find Lem and get back to work.

250
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,095
But, Veronica...

251
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,014
Please stop saying my name.

252
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,337
Have you seen Phil or a blood trail
that could lead to Phil?

253
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:01,462
He's not here.
And I'm stuck.

254
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,569
Maybe the meat blob's not taking in
enough nutrients.

255
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,071
I could try give it a mouth.

256
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,606
I'm gonna say no to the meat blob
getting a mouth.

257
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:11,228
Mostly because I don't want to hear
what it has to say.

258
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:12,830
Joke's on me.

259
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,712
I'm not a hero.

260
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:17,415
It was all just a big show
to keep me from suing the company.

261
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:18,968
Not for me it wasn't.

262
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:23,326
I always thought what you did
was incredibly brave,

263
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,715
and I just wanted the company
to acknowledge that.

264
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,119
Thanks.

265
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,139
I guess I was
exceptionally fearless.

266
00:15:33,404 --> 00:15:35,307
Speaking of a meat blob
with a mouth...

267
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,019
You have been on me
since I thawed out,

268
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,646
and I am sick of it.

269
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,831
All right, guys.

270
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,375
This project is far too important to
sacrifice because you can't get along,

271
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,611
so let's just dissolve
the partnership.

272
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:51,322
Report down to the third floor.

273
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,451
You team up with Richie
and Fuzzel on this.

274
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:54,680
Fine.

275
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,454
Richie and Fuzzel?

276
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:00,074
Their knowledge
of microfabrication technology

277
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,960
for vascularized tissue engineering

278
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:06,089
vis-a-vis bovine muscle protein...
it's so last year.

279
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,921
At least they don't scream
"Car" every 20 minutes.

280
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,720
It is not "Car," you idiot.

281
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,425
Why would I be yelling for a car?
It is just a sound

282
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,765
that I currently have
trouble not making.

283
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:17,976
Good-bye, Phil.

284
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,020
Fine. Go, go.

285
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,720
So he just goes?

286
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:27,777
Ten years of being lab partners,
and he just leaves?

287
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:31,948
You know, when you agreed to be frozen,
you left him just as suddenly.

288
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:34,868
- What?
- Maybe Lem felt

289
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,870
as abandoned as you feel right now.

290
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:40,665
You're right.

291
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:45,053
How can I know so much
about the bonds of chemicals

292
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,593
yet so little
about the bonds of friendship?

293
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,016
I have to stop him.

294
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:57,682
You could've died.

295
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,352
- I'm sorry.
- Who would've been my lab partner?

296
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,346
- Richie and Fuzzel?
- Those guys?

297
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,034
They don't know anything about
microfabrication technology

298
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,736
- for vascularized...
- Guys, you're together.

299
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,504
And you have 72 hours
to make that thing taste

300
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:14,366
like something a drunk teenager
would tip over.

301
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,031
Cow.

302
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,122
I'm talking about a cow.

303
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,972
<i>I had wanted Phil to be
recognized as a hero.</i>

304
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,445
<i>But what is a hero anyway?</i>

305
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,780
<i>Working together again,
the guys discovered their problem.</i>

306
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:38,455
<i>Real cows move around all day,
and so, build muscle and fat,</i>

307
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,623
<i>and that makes them delicious.</i>

308
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:44,437
<i>So Phil and Lem decided the meat blob
also needed exercise.</i>

309
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,245
<i>Deep tissue massage didn't help,</i>

310
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,439
<i>so other approaches were tried...</i>

311
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,370
<i>And rejected.</i>

312
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:13,362
<i>But one thing about heroes:</i>

313
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,151
<i>they never give up.</i>

314
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:51,816
<i>Sure, there may be obstacles,</i>

315
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,132
<i>people who don't share your vision.</i>

316
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:57,522
<i>But the important thing is
to stay focused.</i>

317
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:13,894
<i>What is a hero?</i>

318
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,426
<i>Maybe it's just someone who comes
through when others need them to...</i>

319
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,277
<i>So that everyone can be a hero.</i>

320
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:32,606
The meat cost $10,000 a pound, so...
it's still a few years from production.

321
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,602
Still Phil, the meat...

322
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,725
For a guy who likes to solve problems,
it's been a pretty good week.

323
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,329
- And now I am problemless.
- What are you doing?

324
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,554
I'm helping you.
I'm stealing creamers.

325
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,649
You're not. You're replacing them.
You can't do this.

326
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:51,940
This ruins everything, and it wasn't
that great of a plan to begin with.

327
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,661
I was just solving a problem.

328
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,532
I cannot not solve problems.

329
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,780
But now I'd be stealing from you,
and that's not gonna help me.

330
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:00,740
So now what?

331
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,566
Now that you've ruined this,

332
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,697
how am I gonna relieve my stress?

333
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,244
Can you think of another way?

334
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,047
I would love to help you
with that, Linda...

00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,550
{\pos(192,180)}But I used up my office affair.

336
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,908
{\pos(192,180)}It's not like voting, Ted.

337
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,096
{\pos(192,180)}You can punch more than one ballot.

338
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,813
{\pos(192,200)}I don't want to be a guy
who votes around.

339
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:31,032
{\pos(192,200)}You've taken the creamer from me,
so now what do I do,

00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:32,607
{\pos(192,200)}Mr. Problem Solver?
