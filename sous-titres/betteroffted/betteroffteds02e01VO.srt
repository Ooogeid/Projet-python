1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,105
At Veridian Dynamics,
scientific research is second to none.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,479
Unfortunately, sometimes research is
conducted on the people who work here.

3
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:14,388
What's all this?

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,058
The company posted a list
of single employees they think

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,518
should date each other based
on genetic compatibility.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,636
Yep, that sounds about right.

7
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:24,555
"Wheee... Love is in the air."

8
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:29,528
Genetic engineering is romantic. That's
why it's so often used as a prom theme.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,532
It is for single people only.
Again, the marrieds don't get to date.

10
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:37,203
We just have to go home
to our cold, not-empty beds.

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,282
Just because they used the word
"wheee" doesn't mean it's a good thing.

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,124
Remember
"Wheee! It's pension rollbacks"?

13
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:45,461
Actually that was fun...
Until they rolled back our pensions.

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,094
The company wants genetically
compatible employees to pair up?

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,099
Are you trying to breed somebody
tall enough to change that light bulb?

16
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,268
Why do you always think there's some
dark motive behind everything we does?

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,380
Did a corporation once touch you
in a place that made you uncomfortable?

18
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,233
When they rolled back my pension,
I felt it between the cheeks.

19
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,277
OK. This whole thing is
about money. Happy now, Mr. Cynical?

20
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:15,408
Technically, Mr. Cynical can't be happy.
It's his power and his curse.

21
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,713
The company has
thousands of employees,

22
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,912
and every year, hundreds
get married and have babies.

23
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:23,458
If Veridiancan ensure the breeding
couple is genetically compatible,

24
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,918
we will save a huge amount of money
on health care for their offspring.

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,339
So to save money, the company's
getting involved in people's sex lives?

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,175
They may regret it, like when they tried
to feed us with those nutrition pellets.

27
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:36,846
Unlike eating those pellets,
this is not a mandate.

28
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,399
Anything that starts with the word
"wheee" is just a fun suggestion...

29
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:43,068
Like the constitution
and "wheee" the people.

30
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:47,857
This sucks.

31
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,819
Having my name on that board
is like announcing to the floor,

32
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,408
"Ooh, look at Linda. What a loser.
She's so single and a lonely."

33
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,275
Alone. Not lonely. I'm fine.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,867
The whole thing is crazy.

35
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,328
Who does the company think it is,
telling us who to boff? This is America.

36
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,437
We fought the British over our right
to boff. They wanted us to shag.

37
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:06,876
- I won't even look at that stupid list.
- Good. Me neither.

38
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:10,004
- They don't think we're compatible.
- I saw that.

39
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,716
But if I don't do it,
everyone else will hook up,

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,842
and then I'll look a lonely again.
I'm fine.

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,470
Well, I'm not doing it.
So we both won't do it.

42
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,054
Good. It's a deal.

43
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,185
They can take our loneliness when
they pry it from our cold sad hands.

44
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,735
Is that the super-fast-growing
moss for the NASA project?

45
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,530
Yes. I left the lid off the containment
vessel, and it spread everywhere.

46
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:38,380
We'd better make it less aggressive.

47
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,951
It's supposed to feed astronauts,
not feed on astronauts.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,137
Veronica called me
so I can listen to her yell at me

49
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,540
about violating
containment procedures.

50
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,794
The company sent me an e-mail
about the genetic matchmaking.

51
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,274
They didn't forget
the married people after all.

52
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,257
"Congratulations, Dr. Myman.

53
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,696
"Based on your DNA,
the company is offering you a free..."

54
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,968
Double clicking...

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,096
"vasectomy"?

56
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,516
Why doesn't the company want
me to reproduce?

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,187
Sorry, Phil, I can't think about your
reproductive system right now.

58
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,617
I have to see Veronica,
and my own reproductive system

59
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:12,066
has retreated like a turtle's head
up into my abdomen.

60
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,144
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

61
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,074
I want to talk to you
about your sperm.

62
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:24,245
I'm sorry. It got out of its containment
vessel, and it's extremely aggressive.

63
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,614
- Wait. Did you say my...
- Sperm, yes.

64
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,998
I want to freeze yours.

65
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,420
You and I are the two most genetically
compatible people in the entire company.

66
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,444
And while right now I'm neither
interested in raising a child

67
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,938
nor in playing landlord for nine
months to a parasitic organism,

68
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,679
I just want to keep my options open.

69
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,768
- You want to have my baby?
- Using your DNA would be my plan "e,"

70
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,180
behind fall in love and breed,
clone, take one of my sister's kids

71
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,816
or rip out the whole works
and sail around the world.

72
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,292
You'd look good on the deck
of the right ship... tanned,

73
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,069
wind in your hair, no ovaries.

74
00:03:57,473 --> 00:04:01,031
You have outstanding genes, Lem,
too good for a gal to pass up.

75
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,536
Your mother is a world-class scientist.
Your father, the first male supermodel.

76
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:08,760
- I did my research.
- Boy, this is a lot to take in.

77
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,833
- Excellent. Then it's settled.
- What?

78
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:14,736
There's a man waiting for you with a cup
on the eighth floor to take your sample.

79
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,630
Just make sure it's the right man.

80
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,889
I sound like a stand-up comic,

81
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,558
but don't you hate to find out
an open yogurt in the fridge?

82
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,562
Yes, and what is the deal with airline
food? Why don't they serve it anymore?

83
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,022
Hi, I'm Danielle.

84
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,493
The company feels very strongly
that we should,

85
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,651
"wheee..." have unprotected sex.

86
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,029
You're that Danielle.
You're on my compatibility list.

87
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,866
Apparently we would make
very cheap, durable children.

88
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,360
It's ridiculous.

89
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,994
Just because your DNA matches mine
doesn't mean you're gonna

90
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,580
like pink's chili dogs or that
your favorite movie is <i>Caddyshack.</i>

91
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,541
I swear I'm not hitting on you,
but it is my favorite movie,

92
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,515
and if pink's chili dogs were
on the list, I would date them.

93
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,296
But the list is stupid, right?

94
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,592
- Oh, absolutely.
- So we should not do what it says.

95
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,096
Yeah, although my cousin is stupid,
and he once had a good suggestion.

96
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,517
Excuse me. Are you Linda?

97
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,647
OK, I'm Greg. You're number
one on my compatibility list.

98
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,697
Damn it.

99
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,609
- What?
- You're good-looking.

100
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:22,450
It bums me out, too.
Thanks a lot, God.

101
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,032
No, I'm not dating
off that stupid list.

102
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,867
A friend and I made a deal not to.

103
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,631
We can't let the company
breed us like golden retrievers

104
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,247
or we'll all end up
with weak hips and kennel cough.

105
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,584
I didn't want to do it either,
but then I saw you,

106
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,212
and next thing I knew, I'm standing
here wanting to get to know you.

107
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,451
Crap. You're charming, too.

108
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,133
Just get out.

109
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:48,960
- Ted, we need your help.
- Guys...

110
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,308
Veronica wants my sperm.

111
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,645
The company wants to turn my testicles
into twin hermits with no exit.

112
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,316
This is out of my area of expertise,
so I will just see you later tonight.

113
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,028
That's nice work, fellas.

114
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,848
That's why it wasn't called
"Romeo and Juliet and Lem and Phil."

115
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,410
- So what is going on?
- Me first.

116
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:11,207
Veronica and I are a perfect genetic
match, so she wants to bank my DNA.

117
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:13,788
But I want no child.
I'm a dangerous bad boy.

118
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,874
- You're not.
- It's not your turn yet.

119
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,711
Plus, I don't want Veronica
to be the mother of my children.

120
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,532
I might like my children,

121
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:23,360
and she's the least maternal person
I have ever known.

122
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,496
So Lem needs you to tell to Veronica
to back off because he is a coward.

123
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:29,571
- Now me.
- Phil wants you to find out

124
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,600
why the company wants no more Phils
in the world. And he's also a coward.

125
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,004
I tried to get my medical records,
but they're confidential

126
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,148
and can only be released to insurance
companies, pharmaceutical reps,

127
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,950
suppliers of medical equipment
and for some reason, the R.N.C.

128
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,496
OK, guys, relax.
I will take care of it.

129
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,323
I will talk to Veronica
and get you your medical records.

130
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,235
And then tonight, I will rescue a young,
beautiful lady from a tedless existence.

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,741
Now back to work.

132
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,027
This is why we draw pictures
of him as a superhero.

133
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,402
He must never know about aqua-Ted.

134
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,175
I did it. I stuck to our pact,
and I stood on principle.

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,346
It was really hard, but I turned down
this really good-looking charming guy...

136
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,264
Why are you backing away from me?

137
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,814
What did you do?

138
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,644
You son of a bitch!

139
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,902
Get out of my way.
Excuse me. Move, please.

140
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,693
Hi, Greg.
Does tonight work for you?

141
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,579
I've just gotta...

142
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,940
Ted tells me
you don't want me to have your baby,

143
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:46,425
and I shouldn't talk to you about it
because it will make you uncomfortable.

144
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,889
- Is that true?
- No, you never make me uncomfortable.

145
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:51,264
Why would he say that?

146
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,972
"I'm dying to do it"
is what he should have said.

147
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:57,570
Good. Then get up to
the eighth floor by 5:00 tomorrow.

148
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,562
As long as I'm here,
what about the edible moss project?

149
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,775
Well, we hit a little setback,
and now I'm peeing.

150
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,020
Please. I'm not interested in all
the little details of your life.

151
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,448
The NASA guys are coming tomorrow. Just
make sure I have something to show them.

152
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,501
Then I came to Veridian
four years ago.

153
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:19,300
I like the people, but sometimes
the company makes me feel so small...

154
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:20,833
and unimportant.

155
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,225
Oh, man.
I can totally relate to that.

156
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,445
I used to steal creamer
out of the coffee room.

157
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,729
I didn't even use it. I just wanted
to stand for myself and say

158
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:31,657
"Hey, I'm here.
You don't control everything I do."

159
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,138
That is awesome.
I totally get that.

160
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:37,516
- I've my own little way of acting out.
- Really? What is it?

161
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:42,062
- No, you're gonna think it's strange.
- Oh, come on. I told you my thing.

162
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,569
All right.
Twice a week after work,

163
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,611
I put on a totally realistic bear
costume and hang out in the park.

164
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,322
You what now?

165
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,285
Yeah, it makes me feel powerful, mighty.
I don't scare anyone.

166
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,942
I sit in the bushes,
root around for berries.

167
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,959
Once I pushed on a camper...
You know, just bear kind of stuff.

168
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,081
I think that's great.

169
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,577
<i>My date with Danielle was fantastic...
Really fantastic. Right up until...</i>

170
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,724
I love you.

171
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,231
I just blurted it out.

172
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,630
Good god. You told a woman
you loved her on the first date?

173
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,464
- That is so needy.
- I know.

174
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,169
In the blink of an eye,
I went from sexy to psychopath.

175
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:32,590
I hadn't been with a woman in a while.
I used to say it to my wife.

176
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:36,491
You should always limit what you say
during sex to moaning and helpful tips.

177
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,204
So did she say "I love you" back, or
were you the only crazy one in the bed?

178
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,788
No, it was just me.

179
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,185
But I covered for it, although
I don't know if I made it better.

180
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,355
I love you... Tah.

181
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,167
You love Utah?

182
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,144
Very much.

183
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,285
Why would you say you love Utah
at this particular moment?

184
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,239
It's just...

185
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,652
It's a very spiritual place for me.

186
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:08,845
I go there in my head
sometimes during special moments...

187
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,444
sex,

188
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:13,144
birth of my child.
I've even yelled it at ball games.

189
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,526
Why Utah?

190
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,347
Because...

191
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,244
I'm from there.

192
00:10:19,962 --> 00:10:20,962
You are?

193
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,926
Most of my family is from Utah.

194
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:28,296
- Salt Lake City. Where are you from?
- Not Salt Lake City.

195
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:30,587
I'm from...

196
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,242
I don't remember the name.

197
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:37,365
You don't remember the name?

198
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,810
Not the English name.

199
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,224
What other name is there?

200
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:46,374
The Indian name.

201
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,686
<i>Hahoweechayah.</i>

202
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,497
I blanked. I couldn't think
of the name of a city in Utah.

203
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,917
- She used up the good one.
- Provo, Park City, Moab,

204
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,344
- Castleville, Cedar City...
- it's easy to play "jeopardy!"

205
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,206
When you're at home
with your clothes on.

206
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,875
Ogden, Fruit Heights, Goshen,
Mayfield, Lewiston...

207
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,290
- I get it. You know Utah.
- You mean the beehive state?

208
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:16,128
Anyway, once I started lying,
there was no going back.

209
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,814
I had made up this whole story
about my childhood

210
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,151
growing up on an Indian reservation.

211
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,821
Your grandfather sounds
like such a proud man...

212
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,792
Trying to keep your culture alive.

213
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,368
What's your word for grandfather?

214
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,985
If you put the accent on
the first syllable, that means "goat,"

215
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,302
which is why we no longer eat goat.

216
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,746
What am I doing?

217
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,415
The thing is, I want
to keep seeing Danielle.

218
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:51,752
What's not to like? She's gullible and
slept with you on the first date.

219
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,463
If her mom's not fat,
I'd say throw a ring on it.

220
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,577
I'm gonna tell her the truth,
but first,

221
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:59,801
I need to spend time with her,
just being me.

222
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:03,857
When I come clean, this will all be
that funny story about our first date.

223
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:07,476
Yes, Ted, maybe yours will be the one
Indian story that ends Haily.

224
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:11,468
I still haven't seen any edible moss,
and NASA's coming this afternoon.

225
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:14,232
Go light a fire under your nerds.
I don't know where they are,

226
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,567
but I'm sure you're
an excellent tracker.

227
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:27,390
- How did your date go with Danielle?
- Good. Really well.

228
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:31,033
Just really well? My date with Greg
went really well, so...

229
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,793
You want to maybe grab lunch later?

230
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,759
Yeah, that sounds great. Wait.
How do you say "lunch" in your language?

231
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,127
That doesn't have 
to be our thing, no?

232
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,459
Come on. It's such
a beautiful language.

233
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:47,712
It's...

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
OK then.

235
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,364
- You have your own language?
- It's not mine.

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,146
- I share it with my people.
- And you have a people.

237
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,482
She thinks I'm an Indian.

238
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,705
Goodness.

239
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:17,104
I had a really,
really good time last night.

240
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,308
Me, too. I told you so.

241
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,360
This is Ted.
He likes to pretend he's an Indian.

242
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,986
You ever pretend to stalk
totally realistic-looking large animals?

243
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:30,810
That's funny.
You're adorable.

244
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,520
Then why don't we go out again?

245
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:40,991
Maybe we can go to the park.

246
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,704
I'm having a bad day. Are you done with
the edible moss project.

247
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,498
Sorry, Ted. I am actively
disappointing you.

248
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,617
I'm researching my family tree
to find out why veridian

249
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:58,670
doesn't want any more Mymans
in the world.

250
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,091
I tried to get your medical records,
and the company won't release 'em.

251
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,642
I've my answer anyway.

252
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,603
Turns out the entire myman
family line is worthless.

253
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,352
We have been hated throughout history.

254
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,893
The English hunted Mymans for sport.

255
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,730
The Frenchs us as building materials.
The Russians had an expression...

256
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,896
- "as useless as a stack of Mymans."
- Hat about this medieval sect?

257
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,195
"The screaming Mymans",
that sound promising.

258
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,625
They weren't warriors.

259
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,480
The crusaders launched my ancestors
over castle walls as ammunition.

260
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:32,422
Good, you're here.
I need you to tell Veronica that

261
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,498
I don't want to give her ingredients.

262
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,106
- I already did.
- But then I untold her. I'm so weak.

263
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,378
How can I ever look
my sperm in the eye?

264
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:43,048
At least you didn't lie to your
sperm about being an Indian.

265
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:44,790
No.

266
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:48,214
But once when I was a teenager,
I did abandon it at a bus stop.

267
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,642
We've problem.

268
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,553
I can't wait until they invent
their own replacements.

269
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,105
Phil is freaking out. He needs
to see his medical records.

270
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,900
Yeah, I noticed he was
acting a little odd earlier.

271
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,244
Did you know that "turd"
comes from the Gaelic word for Myman?

272
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:14,984
I love this song.

273
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,768
And you gotta back off Lem.

274
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:21,836
And this baby thing?

275
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:25,006
I don't know. My stupid sister
just popped out another one.

276
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:28,206
And i held it,
and it smelled really good.

277
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:31,344
It was soft and squishy,
and for the briefest second,

278
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,057
i didn't want to give it back.

279
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,142
Part of that was 'cause I don't like
my sister having things I don't have.

280
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:38,308
But part of it was something else.

281
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,780
Well, if that's what you want,
it'll happen for you someday.

282
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:47,237
But right now, if you want Lem's moss,
you gotta back off his sauce.

283
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,026
You ready for lunch?
We could go to pink's, grab chili dogs.

284
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:57,249
- This tie is ready for retirement.
- And I hate this dress. Let's do it.

285
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,668
Do you know if that'a fresh pot of Awkayhow?

286
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,022
Hi, I'm Linda. Ted's an Indian.
That's his word for coffee.

287
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:06,752
He taught me his language.

288
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:12,967
I just asked him what he's doing
is weekend. He says, in his language...

289
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:28,653
Tennis again? I'm sorry,
I interrupted you. Please finish

290
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,468
No, they look totally real to me.

291
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,952
Were you two just talking about my...

292
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,815
See, the thing is, in my language,

293
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,008
the word for tennis ball
is the same as...

294
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,386
Screw it.
I'm not an Indian.

295
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:56,529
- I lied about the whole thing.
- What?

296
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,768
You lied?
Why would you do that?

297
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,936
Because...

298
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:03,683
I accidentally said
"i love you" on our first date

299
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,383
I didn't want you to think I was needy.
It just slipped out.

300
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,099
But if you think about it,

301
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,499
it's about the sweetest thing
a guy can say.

302
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,323
I mean, isn't that
why we're all here... love?

303
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,576
Wait, wait, stop.
The headline here is you lied.

304
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,409
Plus, now I feel like an idiot

305
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,969
for believing anyone's word for horse
could be...

306
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,727
"climpe-clompety."

307
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,375
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,905
I love you!
What is wrong with me?

309
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm Philip Myman.

310
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,261
I'm here for my free vasectomy.

311
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,646
I believe I'm also entitled
to a complimentary windbreaker.

312
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,240
We're out of windbreakers.
Would you like a spos bottle?

313
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,154
I got the sports bottle when
they rolled back my pension.

314
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:53,363
This is crazy.

315
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,360
Just because Veronica tells you
to get your ass up here

316
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:58,334
doesn't mean you have
to go through with this.

317
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,663
She can't have your things,
and she can't take my stuff.

318
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,099
She would make a horrible mom,
and when she gets here,

319
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,419
I'm going to tell her...
I'm ready.

320
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,796
- I talked to Ted. You're off the hook.
- He's a liar.

321
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,883
Let's just get this surgery
over with.

322
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,259
Maybe you'll take me out
buy me a smoothie.

323
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,905
We're not here for surgery.

324
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,304
I need to see Phil Myman's
medical records.

325
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:20,890
You have them out.
Give them to me.

326
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,309
I'm sorry, these records are
strictly confidential.

327
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,562
This is my scientist,

328
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,813
and you are making him very unhappy.

329
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,952
And I can't have him unhappy.
So you give me that file,

330
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,245
'cause if I've to come
back there and get it myself,

331
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,868
then you're gonna be unhappy.
Do you understand?

332
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,964
- I can't.
- I was hoping you'd say that,

333
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:43,288
because I haven't gone
balls-out crazy in a long time,

334
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,832
It's my favorite kind of crazy.

335
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:49,502
Look how fierce and protective she is.

336
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,103
This must be how a baby lion feels

337
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,163
when its mom yells at a receptionist
to get its medical records.

338
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:59,053
So now it looks like
we have ourselves a race.

339
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,972
Can you lock that door
before I can get through it?

340
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,588
You feeling lucky?
Receptionist?

341
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,109
Run! I'm bluff.

342
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,448
<i>Seeing Veronica being
so protective of Phil</i>

343
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,015
<i>made Lem realize
she did have maternal instincts,</i>

344
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,329
<i>and that would make her
a great mom.</i>

345
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,666
Here's a cup of my sperm.
You've earned it.

346
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,418
You remember the guys from NASA?

347
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,584
<i>And after looking
at his medical records,</i>

348
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,628
<i>Phil was relieved to find out
the real reason</i>

349
00:19:43,753 --> 00:19:45,508
<i>the company didn't want him
to reproduce.</i>

350
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,977
My sperm count is off the charts!

351
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,057
I'm so prolific, the amount of
kids I could have would cost them

352
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,919
- a fortune in health care.
- The Mymans weren't useless.

353
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,942
They were plentiful.
Your people are like,

354
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,196
the edible space moss
of the human race.

355
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,553
And I realized, I haven't been
with a lot of women since my wife,

356
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,339
so maybe I am a little needy,

357
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,432
and I need to get out more...
a lot more,

358
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,321
and learn about Utah, just in case.

359
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,013
That means I'm sorry I messed things up
for you with Danielle,

360
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:18,538
I was pissed you dated someone from
that list when we had a deal.

361
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:21,073
But ruining your love life
was a douchey thing to do.

362
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,429
A simple word for a complex idea.

363
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:25,551
That's OK.

364
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,476
I'm the one who lied to Danielle.

365
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,811
At least you got something
with that Greg.

366
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:35,455
About that. Last night animal control
shot him with a tranquilizer.

367
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,484
 What?

368
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,862
Yeah, he was kind of
dressed as a bear

369
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,823
and pushing on a van with
some teenagers in it.

370
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,032
Who would have guessed
it would be a bad idea

371
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:47,412
to let a giant corporation's
financial agenda dictate who we date?

372
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,623
I guess you and Danielle
sure learned that lesson the hard way.
