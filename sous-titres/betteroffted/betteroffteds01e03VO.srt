3
00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:10,153
<i>This is my daughter Rose.</i>

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:16,065
Her mom ran off to Africa a few years ago
to go save the world.

5
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,422
Here's what I do whenever
I get mad about that.

6
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,881
I love you.

7
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:23,038
I love you too, daddy.

8
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:27,123
I'm a dad and I have a job and I really like
keeping those things separate, but

9
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:28,767
today I can't.

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,451
It'll just be for a day or two until I can line up
some after-school child care.

11
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:34,967
- Our nanny's been off sick.
- Again.

12
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,050
We think she may be pulling a fast one.

13
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:40,540
You think she's pulling a fast one.
I think she's just sick.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,324
Anyway,

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,046
I'd take Rose with me, but I'm working
on a project that's not exactly kid-friendly.

16
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:49,824
It's no problem. At Veridian
Dynamics, we love children.

17
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:51,854
Rose, do you like to paint?

18
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:54,419
- Yes.
- Then you are a lucky girl,

19
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,404
because this morning, we're going to be painting
white lines in the parking structure.

20
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,978
Uh, the kids paint the parking lot?

21
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,352
Not the whole parking lot, just the lines.

22
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:06,799
- But still, that seems a little-
- Innovative?

23
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,863
It is. At Veridian Dynamics,

24
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:12,489
we're molding the children of today
into the workers of tomorrow.

25
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:15,283
Oh, sweetheart, it's not break time yet.
Back to your bench.

26
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:24,769
You're gonna stay with me today.

27
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:26,510
But who's gonna paint the parking lot?

28
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,245
Sometimes it's better not to think about things.

29
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:34,425
Ted,

30
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,307
as you know, we've been having a problem
with false contamination alarms

31
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:39,492
going off downstairs in the lab.

32
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,457
Until we get to the bottom of it,

33
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,681
well, the company was wondering, well,

34
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:47,961
since everyone putting on their
hazmat suits is so time-consuming,

35
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:50,652
maybe we could just not have
them do that anymore.

36
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:53,786
You want people to not put on their
hazmat suits when they hear an alarm?

37
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,571
If it's a false alarm.

38
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,171
And how would we know that?

39
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,056
Because they're practically all false alarms.

40
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,957
You're not gonna do this.
I can tell.

41
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,475
No.

42
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:09,592
Uh, by the way, I’m just curious. Did you even
notice I have my daughter with me today?

43
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,590
I look at people's eyes when I talk to them,
Ted, not at their waists.

44
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,304
Hello, sweetheart.

45
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,449
Hello.

46
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,490
We're having a child-care problem.

47
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,582
Oh. Have you checked out Veridian daycare?

48
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:24,394
Apparently, several of the janitorial staff
came up through there. They rave about it.

49
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:27,395
Uh, yeah, I’m just a little
overprotective, you know,

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,499
since, uh...

51
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,739
her mom left.

52
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:33,849
Oh. Sad.

53
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,365
Well, you're always welcome
here, daughter of Ted.

54
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,101
- Rose.
- I know her name.

55
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:41,444
- Rose's name.
- You know, sweetheart, sometimes, your father--

56
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,729
- Ted!
- I know everyone's name.

57
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,571
Once we determined the
type of delivery system,

58
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:53,576
we examined the drop radius
to target point ratio...

59
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,988
This is why I was worried
about having Rose with me.

60
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:59,393
Right now we're talking about
a deadly new weapons system, but

61
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,286
in a kid-friendly way.

62
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:04,521
Next, we looked at what would
happen if we dropped the...

63
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:07,768
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

64
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:10,862
from an airplane at 30,000 feet.

65
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:13,575
You dropped a bunny from an airplane?

66
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,010
Of course not.
Why would we do that?

67
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,101
It's not a real bunny, sweetheart.
It's just a word we're using.

68
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:21,159
Go on.

69
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,053
At that altitude, the bunny would...

70
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:27,510
- Cuddle.
- Cuddle everyone within a 2-mile radius.

71
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,861
Within four miles, people would be...

72
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:35,257
snuggled so badly, they would
have to be hospitalized

73
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,058
with severe burns.

74
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:40,550
And that's why bunnies
make bad pets. The end.

75
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,837
Thank you, everyone.

76
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:46,351
For those of you not sure of what's happening,
we'll have this meeting again tomorrow.

77
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,529
- Don't take those down to the lab.
- Why?

78
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,864
Because you'll leave them in
your pocket like you always do.

79
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,218
Now, see, that's more than you took.

80
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:04,183
I don't even want to know how long you've
been carrying those extra ones around.

81
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,959
So Lem's your boss now?

82
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:08,448
What? What? No, Lem's not my boss.

83
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,728
- We're equals.
- Why would you think that?

84
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:14,263
I guess because of the way he was
telling you what to say and do.

85
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:19,252
Well, you're wrong, because
we're equals. Total equals.

86
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:20,755
So good-bye.

87
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,341
<i>I was so busy trying to protect
Rose from work,</i>

88
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,718
<i>I didn't think protect work from Rose.</i>

89
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:37,203
- Can you hand me a clean dropper, please?
- You got it...

90
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,611
Boss.

91
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,300
I knew you wouldn't be
able to let that go.

92
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,450
Not again. It's happening,
like, twice a day now.

93
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:50,036
- Okay, look, obviously Rose was seeing something, Lem.
- Well, I don't know what,

94
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,967
- because I'm not bossy.
- Maybe sometimes you are.

95
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,611
And maybe it would be helpful
if you could just admit that.

96
00:04:56,646 --> 00:05:00,119
Okay, fine, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bossy.

97
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:02,448
- Happy now?
- So even you see it.

98
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:06,233
God. How did I let this
go all these years?

99
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,005
Isn't that cool?

100
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,721
We're not supposed to throw
things at our computers.

101
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:19,335
See? They even sent a memo about it.
That's what gave me the idea.

102
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,153
What is this stuff, anyway?

103
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,157
Something we invented
for a line of diet foods.

104
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:27,491
- Yuck. People are gonna eat this?
- Well...

105
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,308
Not knowingly.

106
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:30,576
Hey, beautiful.

107
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,865
Beautifuls.

108
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,291
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, daddy.

109
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,925
And I'm just never calling you that again.

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,978
So thank you for keeping
an eye on her. I had, uh,

111
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,758
that thing, you know.

112
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,353
Gas?

113
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:48,639
- I know what the kids today like.
- Well, seriously, Linda, thank you.

114
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,931
Seriously, I had a great time.

115
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,389
Here, daddy. I drew this for you.

116
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:56,846
Oh, thank you. It's, uh,

117
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,378
it's beautiful, honey. Me, you
and Linda all holding hands.

118
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:01,748
Kids...

119
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,629
God's little awkward-moment machines.

120
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:09,369
- Um, so you're-you're leaving?
- Uh, I'm meeting my ex-boyfriend for coffee.

121
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,127
I didn't know you had an ex-boyfriend.

122
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,132
I have tons of ex-boyfriends, Ted.

123
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,325
Well, not tons, but many.
A few. Just the right amount.

124
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,188
Anyway, Don's just returned from Paris,

125
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:24,023
and he wants to get back together, so...

126
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,538
Whoa. Um, do you?

127
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,264
I'm not sure yet.

128
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,131
Do you have a problem with that?

129
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,318
No.

130
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:35,620
Yes, you do.

131
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:37,397
Oh, come on, at least have a problem with it.

132
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,907
Okay, maybe.

133
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,948
You don't have a right
to have a problem with it.

134
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,597
You're the one that
blew me off, remember?

135
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:44,900
"Oh, I'm Ted. I used up my
office affair with Veronica,

136
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,990
so I can never have another one again".
And, yes, that is what you sound like.

137
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:51,926
- I run the department. I can't afford--
- No, it's fine. I totally get it.

138
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:55,473
I gotta go. I gotta go meet Don at the
"who cares what people think" cafe.

139
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,740
Where if someone sees something
that they want, they just have it,

140
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,829
and it's the best thing
they've ever had,

141
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,505
because that meal's been
practicing yoga for seven years.

142
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,153
In case you missed it,
by "that meal", I mean me.

143
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:09,538
I'm bad at metaphors,
but I'm great at sex.

144
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,525
Bye, sweetie.

145
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,840
Bye, Linda.

146
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,522
Oh, Ted, Phil and Lem are having
trouble with the prototype.

147
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:20,190
Get down to the lab and
see what's going on.

148
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,635
Oh, I can't go now.
I have to watch Rose.

149
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,152
I can wash Rose.

150
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,158
I said "watch" her,
not "wash" her.

151
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,115
Hmm. Even easier.

152
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:31,522
The fact that you thought I was
gonna go wash Rose right now

153
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:34,120
makes me think you may not know
that much about children.

154
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,122
I know they need to be cleaned.

155
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,058
Ted, have I ever failed at anything?

156
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,086
No. But you will if you don't go
down to the lab.

157
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:48,935
Honey, I'm sorry, I can't take you.
There's a lot of dangerous stuff down there.

158
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,796
It's okay. Veronica looks friendly enough.

159
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,140
Thank you. I am friendly enough.

160
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,593
Come on, sweetie.

161
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,478
You have the most beautiful skin.

162
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,613
I wish there was a way I could
peel it off your face

163
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,048
and attach it to mine.

164
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:06,402
Oh, and then you would grow
new skin and like it just as much.

165
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,121
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

166
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:11,056
<i>We're a family, </i>

167
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,533
<i>just like yours.</i>

168
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,089
<i>But we don't waste our time
throwing leaves around.</i>

169
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:18,924
<i>We put our family to work.</i>

170
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:20,854
<i>We mean real work,</i>

171
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,798
<i>not just eating mush.</i>

172
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>Our Veridian Dynamic family works
for every member of your family,</i>

173
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,420
<i>even the dead ones.</i>

174
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,068
<i>And we're working to bring them back</i>

175
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:35,264
<i>and copy them, in case you lose them again.</i>

176
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,308
<i>We love our family,</i>

177
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,354
<i>which is why we work nights,
weekends and major holidays,</i>

178
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:45,782
<i>because that's when families
should be together...</i>

179
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,035
Veridian Dynamics.

180
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,087
Veridian Dynamics.
Family.

181
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:50,122
Veridian Dynamics.
Family. Yay.

182
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,997
I'm bored.

183
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:57,561
Not me.

184
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:01,750
Okay, do you want me
to tell you that joke again?

185
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,306
About the monkey?

186
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,616
I didn't really get it.

187
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,377
Well, you have to know
what stock options are.

188
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,974
I know, but even when you explained it,
it still wasn't funny.

189
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,259
Yes, it was.

190
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:17,124
Here.

191
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,105
Go over there and study this book.

192
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,050
"The Art Of War"?

193
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,643
I don't want to read this.

194
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,953
Trust me, your enemies are reading it.

195
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,612
- Veronica?
- Mr. Campbell.

196
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,605
Turns out two idiots set off
the contamination alarm.

197
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,317
They are from your department.

198
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:40,740
What kind of a shop are you running-- ah.

199
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,009
Sorry. There's a child here.

200
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,959
I'm sorry if I was a little
excited just then.

201
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:51,344
This is Rose. She's very young.

202
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:53,282
And hates yelling.

203
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,387
Oh, well, I certainly wasn't
yelling at you, Rose.

204
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,891
There was yelling.
That's all she knows.

205
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:02,976
Rose, darling, come over here so
I can see that you're all right.

206
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,400
Don't be afraid, dear.

207
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:10,802
Go ahead.

208
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:14,241
I'm done. Just take care of it, please.

209
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:18,609
I have a granddaughter your age.

210
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:25,511
You are very effective at getting
people to control their emotions.

211
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,219
That is a huge asset.

212
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,931
Thank you?

213
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,296
Yes...

214
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,481
"Thank you" is correct.

215
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:37,588
Hey, guys, Veronica said
there's a problem.

216
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,973
Yes, a child, your child,

217
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:43,361
thought I was Phil's boss, and
nothing's been the same since.

218
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:46,011
For such a tiny person, she sure
wreaks a lot of havoc.

219
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,631
Yeah, well, don't worry. We've worked
it out. As everyone knows,

220
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,490
Lem is inherently bossy.

221
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:55,107
But we've made an adjustment and are
now taking turns being in charge,

222
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:58,995
so to continue, I've worked out
a series of equations...

223
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,930
Which are totally useless.

224
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:06,861
- Let me guess. Now Lem's boss.
- For ten unbearable minutes.

225
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,877
Through trial and error, we figured out
that's the longest amount of time

226
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:11,351
either of us could be boss

227
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:13,890
before Phil turns into a
complete jackass.

228
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:18,235
Keep talking, buddy. In nine minutes,
there's going to be a new sheriff in town.

229
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,020
Okay, I think I see the problem here.

230
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:27,035
And the problem's solved.
So show me the prototype.

231
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:32,890
You and Hal were setting off those
contamination alarms just for fun?

232
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,877
I'm sorry, Jerry, but we're gonna
have to let you go.

233
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,556
I know what I did was wrong.
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:39,128
- I don't know why...
- Please, there's a child here.

235
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,663
- So pull yourself together.
- Oh, right.

236
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,693
- What is she doing here, anyway?
- That's not relevant.

237
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:48,028
The point is, she's a child,
and she's here.

238
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:53,031
- Sorry.
- It's okay. I cry, too, sometimes.

239
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,145
Thank you for your composure.

240
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,880
You may go now.
And send in your partner.

241
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:06,489
I don't know how many firings you've
been involved in, but that went great.

242
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:10,020
- This was my first.
- You'd never know it.

243
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:13,401
I bet the next one would go even
smoother if you did it.

244
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:15,286
You want me to fire someone?

245
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,232
You're hesitating.

246
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:21,078
Don't ever hesitate, sweetheart.
You're either in, or you're out.

247
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:25,448
Well, my dad is always telling me not
to be afraid to try new things.

248
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,488
Then you have his blessing.

249
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,935
You two seem to be playing
well together now.

250
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,181
Finish this. I'm gonna go back
upstairs to Rose.

251
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:37,292
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. You're back early.

252
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:40,144
- Everything alright with the ex?
- He adores me, Ted.

253
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:43,396
That's the only way you should interpret
how long I've been out.

254
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,046
- Oh, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

255
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,092
Hey, Lem.

256
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,083
I got a question for you. You've had
a few office affairs, right?

257
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:56,792
Oh, yeah, I've been all up and
through this place.

258
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,509
Two. He's had two.

259
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,070
And they nearly killed him.

260
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,766
Hide me! Hide me!

261
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,268
It's part of a fun thing I'm doing.

262
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,017
Wait! No, no, no! Why do you
have to be this way?

263
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:16,378
Look, look, I told you, I told you,
it's only you, okay? It's only you!

264
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,260
Hey, Baby, I was looking for you.

265
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,428
You should read the minutes
from that meeting.

266
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:33,144
So you'd advise against
multiple office affairs.

267
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,631
Who said that?

268
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,377
It's not that I don't trust you.

269
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,695
Okay, it's that I don't trust you.

270
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,747
We're not children, Ted.

271
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,436
Okay. You have ten minutes and
forty seconds left.

272
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,074
Good. Viva, Lem.

273
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:52,998
- I've really got to get back upstairs to Rose.
- I'll be quick.

274
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,103
I just wanted to say sorry I gave you
a hard time earlier

275
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:59,193
about my boyfriend and
how incredibly...

276
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:00,614
bendable I am.

277
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,009
That's okay. It's not like that's the only thing
I've been thinking about since then.

278
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:07,173
Oh, god. I've never been down here
for one of these.

279
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,958
I'm sure it's just a false alarm.

280
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,793
We're not liquid, so that's a good sign.

281
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:15,696
Still, it'd be nice to get to one of those.

282
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,492
Where's the other HAZMAT suit?

283
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,301
I don't know, but it is now...

284
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:34,532
Your problem. So, boss,
what do we do?

285
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:36,465
There it is.

286
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:40,385
Don't worry. It's safe.

287
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,820
Now what?

288
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:46,325
You take it.

289
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,047
- But... but what if it's not a drill?
- Don't argue with me, Lem.

290
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,999
I am your boss, and
I order you to take it.

291
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,237
But you're the best boss
I've ever had.

292
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,426
Likewise.

293
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,112
What if we took too
long to put these on?

294
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,212
You were the one blocking the closet.

295
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,611
I'm not blaming anyone. I'm just saying,
what if there really were a contamination?

296
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,546
We could both be dead
in a half an hour.

297
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,640
What if this is the last thing I ever do,

298
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:14,598
the last conversation I ever have,

299
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:17,453
the last horrible outfit I ever wear?

300
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:20,758
I'm sure it's just a false alarm, Linda.

301
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:23,493
The last eyes I ever look into.

302
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,975
I can't think of nicer eyes to look into.

303
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,819
- Oh, Ted.
- Linda.

304
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:54,110
The hell with it. It's probably
a false alarm, anyway.

305
00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:00,610
Well, now I'm feeling all self-conscious, like,
like I'm being pressured to take off my helmet.

306
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:05,064
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, you know,
why take the chance?

307
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,349
Hey, guys.

308
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,444
- How many people have to die today?
- We're in lockdown!

309
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,629
Relax. It's another false alarm.

310
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:14,911
Jerry and I have been setting them off.

311
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:18,453
I just wanted more break time, and
he went along with it because he's weak.

312
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,478
You know, Hal, I can't just let that go.

313
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,263
Neither could your daughter.
She fired me.

314
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,575
My daughter fired you?

315
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,769
Rose, about the height tall,
hates broccoli?

316
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,815
That's the one.

317
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,575
I have to get upstairs.

318
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:36,226
- I'm sorry you got fired, Hal.
- Nah, it's cool.

319
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,961
She did a great job.

320
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,472
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, Ted.

321
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,207
Who was in charge when this happened?

322
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,345
No one. We decided to be a team again.

323
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,286
We thought of this together.

324
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,207
Now the trick is to get it super tight.

325
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,092
You see? Power hair.

326
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,755
- Feels weird.
- That'll stop after a few years.

327
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,040
Come on, sweetie. Time to go.

328
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,336
But we're having fun.

329
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,061
Veronica's teaching me what it's like
to be a woman in a man's world.

330
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:23,510
She has a gift, Ted.

331
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,980
You should've seen how
cleanly she fired Hal.

332
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,017
Yes, I heard.
Say good-bye, Rose.

333
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,901
Good-bye, Veronica.
I had a good time.

334
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:35,035
Me, too, sweetie.
I'll miss you.

335
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,082
You are a very useful little girl.

336
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,665
Do you have a card or something
you could leave me?

337
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:55,130
Rose coming to work with me yesterday
made me realize two things.

338
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,865
One, a multinational corporation is
no place for a child.

339
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:08,495
- Thank you.
- I'm learning a life skill.

340
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,622
I also realized my one-office-affair rule

341
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,932
is a rule I can no longer live by.

342
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:21,900
I like Linda.

343
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,220
Rose likes Linda.

344
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:26,480
We went about as far as two people
could go in HAZMAT suits.

345
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm ready to take the gloves off...

346
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,677
And the helmet...

347
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,589
And the plastic pants.

348
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,265
But that's crazy.

349
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:37,635
I'm not calling you crazy, Miriam.
I'm saying it's crazy.

350
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,630
Miriam in payroll is counting my time during
the contamination alert

351
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:46,061
as break time because, technically,
I wasn't working.

352
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:47,590
Miriam.

353
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,794
Miriam... Miriam!

354
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,095
I hate Miriam.

355
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,485
I gotta go find her.
Do you know where she is?

356
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,629
India.

357
00:18:56,575 --> 00:19:00,380
See, this is exactly the kind of thing
that makes me want to...

358
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,120
You ever just want to run away?

359
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:04,450
Oh, sure, yeah, everyone feels
like that sometimes.

360
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:07,055
No, I mean, really, take off.

361
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,466
Here, look at this.

362
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:13,670
My mom owns this cabin in Oregon.
Sometimes when things get crazy,

363
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,762
like I come close to death in the lab or
I talk to Miriam in payroll,

364
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,981
I think maybe I should just
take off and go live there.

365
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:21,820
It's so beautiful.

366
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:25,290
There's this lake, and it's freezing, but it's,
like, in a good way...

367
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:29,180
<i>As Linda went on about leaving,
I realized something else.</i>

368
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:33,226
<i>Yes, she was beautiful and funny and
extremely bendable.</i>

369
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:38,076
<i>But as a single dad, I had to think
about my daughter first.</i>

370
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,409
<i>Rose already had her mom
abandon her.</i>

371
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:45,599
<i>I couldn't bring someone else into her life
who might abandon her again.</i>

372
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,880
And this is Gabby.
He lives in a cave nearby.

373
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:51,010
He makes his own pasta, which is
incredibly hard to do in a cave.

374
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,296
Linda...

375
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:55,886
- Listen, about yesterday.
- Yeah.

376
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,802
How about that?

377
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,002
It... it can't happen.

378
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,264
- What?
- It's...

379
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,827
It's just not something I can do now.

380
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:07,660
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

381
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:08,730
Good.

382
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,439
It clarifies things.

383
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:13,330
Don's been wanting to know where
he stands, and he's a great guy.

384
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:16,330
And by "great", I mean he doesn't
make out with me through Plexiglas

385
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,230
and then back off when I'm standing
right in front of him.

386
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,267
- I know. I just...
- Just... go.

387
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:29,730
Sometimes it's hard to juggle being
a dad with work and relationships.

388
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,890
But at the end of the day,
I got to be a dad,

389
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,412
even if sometimes...

390
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:36,545
it really hurts.

391
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,991
Well, they're all very cute, but do you
have one with curls?

392
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,610
You know, the kind you just
can't say no to?

393
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,367
Sorry, it's just what you see.

394
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,021
But we do get new ones in every day.

395
