1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,125
Cream Team

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,595
Since I spend
most of my day at work,

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,219
it's natural
relationships start to form.

4
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:10,823
But some of them
can be tricky to navigate.

5
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:14,851
Gosh, Ted. It's like
you were poured into that suit.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,855
And part of me is still hardening.
That's not what you must say.

7
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:23,068
Thank you, Erica. I value and respect
you as a gender-neutral colleague.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,392
I may have overcorrected,

9
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:29,689
but it's important I always keep
things professional at the office,

10
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,259
with one exception.

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,079
Sweetie. Wanna wrestle?

12
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,665
I'm taking you down, old man.

13
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,013
<i>Since Rose started coming
to Veridian's after-care,</i>

14
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,795
<i>my coffee breaks include
much more roughhousing.</i>

15
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,297
Muss up his hair.
It's the source of all his power.

16
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,926
- Not the hair!
- Now smash him with a phone.

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,222
Why will nobody in this building
ever smash anyone with a phone?

18
00:00:52,495 --> 00:00:54,863
- What do you need, Veronica?
- We have a problem.

19
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,267
It's about sexual...

20
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,022
Sexual

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,649
h-a-r-ass-ment.

22
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,944
I appreciate you not letting
my daughter hear the "har" part of that,

23
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:10,109
- Why don't we talk about this later?
- And I'm 8. I know how to spell.

24
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:13,735
Never show your hand, sweetie.
Always let the enemy underestimate you.

25
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,621
Then when their guard's down,
smash 'em with a phone.

26
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:24,557
We're having a problem with some of
those people who live in the cubicles.

27
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:27,534
No, they don't live in the...
I'm not gonna explain this to you again.

28
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,214
One of the drones accused
another drone of sexual harassment.

29
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:32,178
Again?

30
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:34,455
- That's the third time{\ that's happened to us} this year.
- I know.

31
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,391
Legal won't tell me
who the sleaze-hound is.

32
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:38,867
But upstairs
is very unhappy with me.

33
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:42,063
Our whole department looks like a guy
at a bus station wearing a raincoat.

34
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,488
We are not sleazy.

35
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,152
It is more like a hard-working
squirrel stuffing his nuts in... wait.

36
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:50,530
We're more like a hard-working beaver...
I won't land this metaphor.

37
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:55,014
Let me just go talk to the people in
the cubicles, find out what's going on.

38
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,135
And get them to stop
coming on to each other.

39
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:59,581
It might be as simple as improving
the lighting out there.

40
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,795
I just heard they're forcing
Chumley into retirement.

41
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,130
That's crazy.

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,051
He's the best chemical spill technician
we've ever had. Is he gone yet?

43
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:14,137
Let's trigger the floor sensors
and see if he comes.

44
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,850
You could've used water.

45
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,984
As opposed to that beaker
of bald eagle stem cells

46
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,689
I've been painstakingly
gathering for the last two years.

47
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,400
Sorry.
You should label thing

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,370
Chumley's so great.

49
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,741
He's the only one in the office
who's always smiling.

50
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,745
When he looks at you with those{\ .blue} lights,
{\it's like }you're the only one in the world.

51
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,747
- What's gonna happen to him?
- Don't worry.

52
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,624
Ted told me Veridian has a place

53
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,960
where retired robots get to run
and play with other robots.

54
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,314
It's called the technology farm.

55
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,713
God, that sounds great.

56
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,605
Like the place my mom sent my dog
after he crapped in her purse.

57
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:55,053
I got an alert from the floor sensors.
There's a spill.

58
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:58,348
- Who are you?
- I'm Carlos. New spill technician.

59
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,850
I'm cheaper
and require less maintenance

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,770
than your...
little sucky robot.

61
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:06,274
My god.

62
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,619
What kind of a sick world
are we living in,

63
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,179
where machines can be so easily
cast aside for people?

64
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:20,666
If you had to guess who in here
was being accused of sexual harassment,

65
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,889
- who would you say?
- If I had to guess,

66
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,006
I would say Keith,
because he's kinda creepy.

67
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,044
But since I know it's me, I will
say me because I want to win this game.

68
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,255
You?
You sexually harassed somebody?

69
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,465
It was a stupid misunderstanding.

70
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,928
Sheila, is everything all right?

71
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,723
No, it's not. My cat died.

72
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,811
- See your noodle baum?{\pas sûr de la VO}
- That's Debbie's cat. She's an idiot.

73
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:47,188
My cat was named Meow

74
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:50,593
is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of their country.

75
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,363
I just called him Meow.

76
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:54,304
But Meow he's dead.

77
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,447
He loved puns.

78
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,868
I'm so sorry, Sheila.
You look like you could use a hug.

79
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,784
That's okay. I'm not really a physically
affectionate kind of person.

80
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,624
Don't be such a tough guy.
Everyone needs a hug sometime.

81
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,236
See?
Doesn't this feel good?

82
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,018
We call this a midwestern handshake.

83
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:20,072
That doesn't sound so sexual. It was
just a hug that drifted boobwardly.

84
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,100
Apparently, later I got, as Sheila's
complaint says, "more molest-y."

85
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:33,270
- Linda, what are you doing?
- I've been thinking about you all day.

86
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,102
Ooh, man. You're tense.

87
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,575
- Linda, I...
- Relax, Sheila.

88
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,613
Don't fight it.

89
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,277
- "Don't fight it"?
- Hindsight is 20/20, isn't it,

90
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,289
Mr. "Never accidentally
fondled anyone"?

91
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:49,792
These words have never been used where
someone isn't being sexually harassed.

92
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,526
What am I gonna do? I could
lose my job over this.

93
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,740
I'll go talk to Sheila and straighten it
out. {\In the meantime, }Try to act like a gentleman.

94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,928
Just remember, every woman here
is someone's wife or daughter.

95
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:06,267
I realize it was a little awkward, but
Linda was just trying to comfort you.

96
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:10,438
- It wasn't comforting to me.
- But it was just a misunderstanding.

97
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,327
You haven't worked here that long,
and you don't know Linda.

98
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,569
If you did, you'd know how clumsy
and accidentally predatory she can be.

99
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:20,143
You two should really
get to know each other,

100
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,945
get better acquainted.

101
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:24,535
You want Linda and me
to get better acquainted?

102
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:27,438
Sure. Maybe go out sometime
after work, have some fun.

103
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:30,041
I could come, too, if you want.
All three of us could do it.

104
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:32,210
I don't think
that would be a good idea.

105
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,954
Come on. Don't fight it.

106
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,505
Wait.

107
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,680
"Don't fight it"?

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,428
You'd be surprised how easily
that phrase just slides right outta you.

109
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:45,181
Sheila claims you propositioned her
for a threesome.

110
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,604
I work full-time
and I have an 8-year-old daughter.

111
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,311
I don't even have the energy
for a one-some. This is crazy.

112
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,647
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- No.

113
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,445
Now I know it's against your nature
to sit idly by while Gotham is in peril,

114
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,695
but you have to sit this one out.
I'll take care of it.

115
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,157
As a very stupid man
once said, "don't fight it."

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,503
{\pos(192,220)}They took our robot vacuum{\ to transportation},
but they forgot his extra battery pack.

117
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,039
{\pos(192,220)}We want to get it to him
before he leaves for the farm.

118
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,426
Right the farm.
Here, I'll make sure he gets it.

119
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,915
- We'll give it to him.
- So if you could tell us where it is,

120
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:29,291
because the guys in transportation
said there is no farm. Jerks.

121
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,590
- There is a farm, right?
- Right?

122
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,856
- There's a farm. Tell us there's one.
- There's a farm. There's a farm.

123
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,152
Where did they take him,
you son of a bitch?

124
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,988
I mean...
My immediate superior!

125
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:45,345
Guys, I'm sorry. I was trying
to protect you from this, but...

126
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:48,142
The truth is,
when robots are no longer needed,

127
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:51,604
they're sent down to the subbasement
to be broken down and used for parts.

128
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,188
I think I'm going to be sick.

129
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,672
I feel like my heart has been
kicked in the testicles.

130
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,133
I'd like to talk to the lawyer in charge
of employee sexual harassment.

131
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,218
Mr. Thomas, he's not here.

132
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:11,113
- Will he be back soon?
- That depends on his willingness

133
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:13,974
to accept the things
he cannot change... wait.

134
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,874
His willingness to change
what he accepts...

135
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,031
The wisdom... I don't know.

136
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:21,231
He's a drunk. He's in rehab.
Again.

137
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,817
It's nice
how you honor his struggle.

138
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,607
He does this five times a year,

139
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:28,072
The company can't fire him
'cause he has a disease.

140
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,259
He also has a disease?
Poor drunk.

141
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,741
No, that's his disease.
He's an alcoholic.

142
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,162
As long as he's in treatment,
they can't touch him.

143
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:39,291
<i>The next day, Veronica made
a startling announcement.</i>

144
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:40,797
Great news.

145
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,878
You both have a disease.

146
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,876
- You would be a terrible doctor.
- I convinced the company...

147
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,417
To classify sexual harassment
as a disease.

148
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:52,055
That way, anyone accused of it can't
be fired or punished in any way.

149
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,690
I don't want a sex disease,
especially one

150
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,556
That's assigned to me
by my supervisor.

151
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,144
Nonsense.
The company loved the idea.

152
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,749
Now it can't be sued because
the harasser isn't responsible

153
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,157
For his or Linda's actions.

154
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,212
Plus, several of the executives
have their own grope-y,

155
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,696
Squeezy, unzippy problems,
and now their jobs are safe, too.

156
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,521
This is ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.

157
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,749
I have no disease.

158
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:16,636
Ted, I'm a hero upstairs.
Don't ruin this for me.

159
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,748
All you two have to do
is go to harassment seminars.

160
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,308
We have to go
to harassment seminars?

161
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:24,571
I have a daughter.
I speak evasive mumble.

162
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:27,356
Just until you learn how
to control your perverse impulses.

163
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,618
I'm not going to a harassment seminar.
I am gonna fight these charges.

164
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,529
Yeah, me, too. I don't like
other ladies' breasts.

165
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,564
Some days, I don't even like
my own breasts.

166
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,016
- Mostly, they're awesome.
- You'll get no argument from me.

167
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,057
And you two don't think
you need a seminar.

168
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:43,981
Look, if you fight this
and lose, you could be fired.

169
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,710
I don't want to lose my job.
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,009
Go back to Wisconsin,
work in the cheese mines?

171
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:53,740
After I made that big speech, threw down
my cheese shovel and stormed out?

172
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,104
All you have to do, is complete
the stupid seminar,

173
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,487
The whole thing 'll be
expunged from your records.

174
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,362
And you'll get a keepsake-quality
seminar diploma...

175
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,499
Also my idea.

176
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,318
I was on fire up there.

177
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,218
Look.

178
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,513
All these innocent machines
hacked to pieces.

179
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,585
It's like
"the Texas chainsaw massacre"

180
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,643
If somebody massacred the chainsaws.

181
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,010
Chumley.

182
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:26,523
Oh! Look at him.

183
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:29,342
They've ripped the D.C. Solenoids
from his relay module

184
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,819
As if he were an animal.

185
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:32,927
We can put him back together.

186
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,391
I fixed my marriage
with mechanical attachments.

187
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:37,117
I can fix this.

188
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,315
I'm Denise,

189
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,238
your sexual harassment educator,
and you are the deviants.

190
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,546
So let's meet each other, shall we?
Ted, why are you here?

191
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,773
Because Sheila's cat died,
this one got grabby,

192
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,675
And some of the nonsense
splattered on me.

193
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,396
Bottom line... I am not a harasser.

194
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,993
- Neither am I.
- Yeah, I don't belong here either.

195
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:00,974
Although I would be open
to some private tutoring.

196
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,208
I'm innocent, too. I just tripped
and grabbed some chick's boobs

197
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,811
to keep from falling.
Plus, she wanted it.

198
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,884
Is there any way I can complete
this course over the internet?

199
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,700
You all think you're innocent.
That's part of the disease.

200
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,280
- I don't have a disease.
- That's another part of the disease.

201
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:19,171
Ted's really not a harasser.
If anything, he's too repressed.

202
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:20,662
You are.

203
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,962
Okay, well, that makes
perfect sense.

204
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,626
You sexually harass women,
because your emotions are so bottled up.

205
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,473
They explode inappropriately.

206
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,477
Okay, how do I convince you
that I am ready to graduate from

207
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,758
this league of extraordinarily
perverted gentlemen?

208
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,303
You'll have to prove you can
express your emotions, more honestly.

209
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,000
Use, "I" statements,

210
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,141
like "I feel sad" or "I feel angry."

211
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,702
Well, if that gets me out off here,
then I feel like I can do that.

212
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,814
That doesn't sound
emotionally honest to me.

213
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,523
It really doesn't.

214
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:51,992
Fine.

215
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,986
I am going to be
so emotionally honest,

216
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,779
I could have my own
daytime talk show.

217
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,815
"Ted!" With an exclamation point.

218
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,900
No band, no cooking segments.
Just me and the topic wheel.

219
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,078
And, yes, I have
thought about this before.

220
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,453
And, yes,
I am taking this seriously.

221
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:12,222
<i>While Linda and I were suffering
through sexual harassment class,</i>

222
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:16,332
<i>Veronica was discovering her new policy
was having an unexpected effect.</i>

223
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:19,146
<i>Once people realized,
they couldn't be fired for harassment,</i>

224
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,834
<i>They started to take chances
and flirt more.</i>

225
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,392
I'm a genius. My bosses are happy,
the cubicle smurfs are happy,

226
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,289
And the sexual tension between
the janitors has finally been resolved.

227
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,735
No, not everyone's happy.

228
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,130
I have to get all open
and girlie with my coworkers,

229
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:35,500
because some crystal-work-shipping
feelings-hound, thinks I'm repressed.

230
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,530
- Pshew. Pshew. Pshew. Pshew.
- What are you doing?

231
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:42,326
That's the sound of me deflecting your
whiny bitching with my happiness shield.

232
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:49,817
Hey. It's the girl from my seminar.
I've been thinking about you.

233
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,434
- Well, don't.
- Fine. Let's keep it professional.

234
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,185
50 bucks if you show me your boobs.

235
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,663
- $10 if you just say the word "boobs."
- Really? $10 just to say...

236
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:02,054
Hey, wait a minute. That's gross.
Our goofball teacher was right.

237
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:05,664
What you're doing right now
isn't about sex. It's about power.

238
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:08,810
How about if I did that to you?
I'll give you $10 to say boobs.

239
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:11,142
- Boobs.
- Okay, that wasn't good.

240
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,319
How about this? Your junk
has been neglected for so long,

241
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:17,000
That if someone called social
services, they'd take it away.

242
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,988
- They would not.
- Hey! I hurt your feelings?

243
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:25,331
So what else we got here?
Let's keep working the junk.

244
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:29,107
That looks like one package I'd be
disappointed to open Christmas morning.

245
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,601
That's right.
Because it's undesirable.

246
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:34,419
It's the saddest, loneliest inch
in the whole world.

247
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,172
It is not! You're mean.
I'm gonna report you.

248
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,381
Go ahead.
I can say whatever I want.

249
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:40,634
I have a disease.

250
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,226
Mama's gonna have fun with this.

251
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,528
- That's the last piece.
- This must be how Dr. Frankenstein felt

252
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,797
And that creepy scientist
on the fourth floor

253
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:58,662
who tried to build a wife out of
mannequin parts and chicken skin.

254
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,400
That was awkward at the party

255
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,794
when we had to pretend
she didn't smell like chicken.

256
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,614
Let's test him.

257
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:18,178
He is back and suckier than ever!

258
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,799
What's he doing here?

259
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,126
This is my floor now.
Don't you get it?

260
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,228
It's not about machines anymore.

261
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:27,803
Now it's about guys

262
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,333
with mops.

263
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,054
Don't worry.

264
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,327
He's jealous
because your smile is permanent,

265
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,458
and his only comes when he's happy.

266
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,908
He peed coffee in my face
from his mouth!

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,985
Anyway, Steve, I just want you to know
that you keeping things so clean,

268
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,003
makes me feel like I'm cared for.

269
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,833
Thanks, Ted.
I really appreciate that.

270
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,300
But...
you know I'm with Willy now.

271
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,567
That's right.
I heard.

272
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,536
So anyway, speaking of gay,

273
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,849
would you mind signing this form
saying I was emotionally expressive?

274
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,643
<i>While I was wiping down the office
with my emotions,</i>

275
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:17,379
<i>Veronica was realizing
her genius idea had one fatal flaw.</i>

276
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:18,865
<i>It was stupid.</i>

277
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:37,042
Thanks, guys, I feel appreciative
And I'm happy that...

278
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,419
You say you wouldn't talking like that
if we signed.

279
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,047
- So what do you need?
- We found and reassembled Chumley,

280
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,875
- but something's different.
- He came back wrong.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,203
We need to have access
to the robots lab,

282
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:50,222
so we can replace his diflossoroid
dual-cacheing processor...

283
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,423
or insides.

284
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,060
Guys, it's a shop-vac.
You gotta let it go.

285
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,756
He's more than that.
He's got lights where his eyes would be,

286
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:01,118
- and a smile where we drew it.
- If your friend Ryan Seacrest was sick,

287
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,818
- You wouldn't turn your back on him.
- We're not friends.

288
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:05,672
Really?

289
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,989
We always thought
you guys were friends.

290
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,534
But I always kinda picture
you playing volleyball.

291
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,059
Another loss.

292
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,057
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:22,379
- I feel sorry that I walked into you.
- It was my fault.

294
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,986
Mr. Stewart took a bunch of us girls
to lunch.

295
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,313
I had four glasses of wine
and a chocolate souffle,

296
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,761
which was yummy.
You're yummy.

297
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,543
My underwear
is in my purse right now.

298
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,301
I feel happy
that you think I'm yummy.

299
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,919
But also sad
that if I do anything about it,

300
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:41,896
I'll have to spend the rest of my life
in harassment seminars.

301
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,818
Isn't it funny how the word "harassment"
has "her ass" in it?

302
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,113
Do you know what else
could have her ass in it? You.

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,993
I can't quite picture that,
but I feel like I must leave.

304
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:00,208
Everyone's taking advantage
of the new policy.

305
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,043
It's like mating season out there...

306
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:05,930
All hands and tongues
and sweat and grinding.

307
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,049
- It's kinda hot, actually.
- I know.

308
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:10,268
A beautiful woman
just called me yummy.

309
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:12,804
- I like being called yummy.
- You are yummy.

310
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,643
So are you.

311
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,586
And since I have to be
emotionally honest,

312
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,305
I want to take off my underwear
and put it in your purse.

313
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,460
I don't know what that means,
you sick, sexy bastard,

314
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,585
but it's flipping my switches.

315
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:27,694
What are we doing?

316
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,831
We're like everyone else around here,
acting like horny idiots.

317
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:34,159
God, my policy is a disaster.
I'm a terrible executive.

318
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,412
No, you are not.
You're one of the best executives ever.

319
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:40,165
You're as good as Steve Jobs
or Lee Iacocca or...

320
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,615
Field Marshal Rommel?

321
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,338
He was a brilliant tactician
who looked magnificent in jodhpurs.

322
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,431
- I'm picturing you in jodhpurs.
- So am I,

323
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,717
And I'll bet
he didn't wear a thong underneath his.

324
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,788
I'd really like to see that thong.

325
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,446
What a happy coincidence.
It's in the mood for receiving guests.

326
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:08,485
Hi, Daddy. It's my snack break.
Hi, Veronica.

327
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,865
You guys are acting weird.

328
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:18,057
In ten years, honey, you'll look back
on this moment and think, oh!

329
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:26,586
Sheila, I can't find my budget report.
Do you know where...

330
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:29,923
There's a spider.

331
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:32,634
- It's coming right down on you.
- Where?

332
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,853
Hold still.

333
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,366
I'll get it.

334
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,569
What are you doing?

335
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:41,637
What the hell?

336
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,020
I can't help it.
I have a disease.

337
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,423
Quit it.

338
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,503
You must be, like,
90% body fat, but me likey.

339
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,184
That isn't harassment.

340
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,738
Harassment is supposed to be sexy.

341
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,829
You're not even doing it right.

342
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,412
Thanks, Linda.

343
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,050
Recently, I've been very fortunate
to spend time with some major perverts.

344
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:09,254
And it's made me realize,
I should've respected your boundaries.

345
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,063
That's okay.

346
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,924
I may have overreacted.

347
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,092
Did you hear that?

348
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,162
Somewhere a butt is being smacked
against its will...

349
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:19,901
A feel is being copped,

350
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:23,020
A well-endowed woman is being asked
if she gives fries with that shake,

351
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,687
and so...
that is where I am needed.

352
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,105
<i>Impressed by Linda's heroism,</i>

353
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,608
<i>Sheila decided
to drop the charges against us.</i>

354
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,899
I don't care what Ted says.
We have to do whatever it takes

355
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,031
- to get Chumley well.
- I agree.

356
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,696
It's attacking my foot!
Kill it! Stab it in the brain!

357
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:49,502
Don't ask me to choose
between you two!

358
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,787
Ultimately, I would've chosen you.

359
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,478
And I'm not saying that
because you're the one who survived.

360
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,680
And I choose to believe that.

361
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,695
Boy, bringing things back from the dead
never goes smoothly.

362
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,280
Thank you, Carlos.

363
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,551
I'm just a man with a mop.

364
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,493
That's what we do.

365
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,070
<i>Phil and Lem finally realized
they'd also been having</i>

366
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:30,470
<i>an inappropriate relationship
with a coworker.</i>

367
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,370
<i>As for the other
inappropriate relationships,</i>

368
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,289
Well, thanks to Rose
walking in on us,

369
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:38,002
<i>Veronica and I figured out
a way to end those, too.</i>

370
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,960
<i>Here it comes,
the parade of children.</i>

371
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:44,941
<i>Nothing kills sex drive faster
than having kids around.</i>

372
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:51,158
After-care agreed to march them through
at random times for exercise.

373
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:54,058
Children, they have so many uses.

374
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,137
They're like adorable
swiss army knives.

375
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,562
Although they can't open wine
worth a damn.

376
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,074
Listen, about what happened
in my office...

377
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,210
Forget it, Ted.
There was too much sex in the air.

378
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,995
But we're like Rommel and Patton.

379
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,423
We respect and are even attracted
to each other,

380
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,167
but if we ever got together,
it would be a bloodbath.

381
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:14,545
Although feel free
to look at my ass as I walk away.

382
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,670
It's having a spectacular day.

383
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,414
She's having a great ass day.

384
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,430
That's what the parade's about.

385
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,899
That's for staring at her butt.

386
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,227
There's a new sheriff in town.

387
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,644
Maybe sometimes I do keep
my emotions bottled up inside.

388
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,973
Maybe that's okay,
especially at work.

389
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,904
What's important is,
I let them out when it counts.

390
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,264
Bring it, old man!

391
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,368
