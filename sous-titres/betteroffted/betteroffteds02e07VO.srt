00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:09,050
Okay, the bacteria
are going for the bait.

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,238
Insert the nano-grenade.

6
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:14,430
Did it explode?

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,724
Oh, my god.
There's flagella everywhere.

8
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:19,936
What have we done?

9
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,527
I took the back stairs.

10
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,395
Are there spiders in my hair? I am five
seconds away from a total freak out.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,899
Relax. If you had been bitten
by one of the back-stair spiders,

12
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:34,325
you'd be flopping on the floor,
deep in the throes of spider madness.

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,669
Your hair is so perfect.

14
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:38,629
Man, I want to be you.

15
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:39,954
What? Nothing.

16
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:42,875
And all clear.

17
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:47,003
So did you go the back way to avoid
Ryan, the chatty security guard?

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,514
No. I'm trying to create
a spider sanctuary in my hair,

19
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:52,051
maybe get some of that sweet
government money to fund my head.

20
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:55,445
Sarcasm... the first sign
of spider madness.

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,656
Yes, I am trying to avoid Ryan.

22
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,768
Every time I walk by the guy, he sucks
me into a 15-minute conversation.

23
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:04,044
You do that eight times a day,
it adds up to...

24
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:06,315
Well, time I could be working
on my math skills.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,173
<i>Ryan was a very friendly guy,
which was exactly the problem.</i>

26
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,489
Hey, Teddy. Notice anything
different about me?

27
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,200
I got a haircut.
Want to see a penis?

28
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,661
What?
What the hell's wrong with you?

29
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,463
I see what you thought there.
No, no, you know my wife's pregnant.

30
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:25,045
Take a look
at this ultrasound picture of my son.

31
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:30,464
<i>Sitting at his desk all day, Ryan had
a lot of time to think about things,</i>

32
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,875
- <i>really stupid things.</i>
- Ted. You went to college.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,886
Who you think would win in a fight
between Santa Claus and a shark?

34
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:37,471
Shark.

35
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,481
Wrong.
Hey, while I got you here,

36
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:42,049
how are we ever gonna solve
this middle east thing?

37
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:49,358
He once sucked me 20-minute
about the colonization of Mars.

38
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,142
- Spoiler alert, he's for it.
- I don't want to insult the guy.

39
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,882
If only there were
a nice way to say,

40
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,452
"you're killing me,
you energy-sucking time-gobbler."

41
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,284
You're avoiding
a difficult situation.

42
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:02,314
For the first time, I feel like you
and I may be part of the same species.

43
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,132
Anyway... Veronica wants us
upstairs to talk about a project.

44
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,709
Shall we slip out the back?

45
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,339
We're not going past the spiders.

46
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,631
- Unless we both sit on your shoulders.
- And then run.

47
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,984
- And then we go out the front.
- Fine. We'll go past Ryan.

48
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,915
But no matter what, we keep walking.

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,017
If one of us gets caught,
the others don't come back.

50
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,935
Unless it's me.
Come back for me.

51
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:35,374
- It's my three favorite people.
- Don't engage. Keep going. Keep going.

52
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:39,492
- So my mom's back in the hospital.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Ryan. Damn it.

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,812
Leave him.
Yeah.

54
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,986
They just cannot find
the head of that parasite.

55
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,372
Parasite?
Damn it.

56
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,072
<i>A half-hour later,
we were finally upstairs.</i>

57
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:56,092
<i>I didn't tell Phil and Lem they were
gonna be working alone with Veronica</i>

58
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,057
<i>because they find her
a little intimidating.</i>

59
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:00,638
- Have a good meeting.
- What? Where are you going?

60
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not on this one.
I have quarterly budget reports.

61
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,443
- You guys will be fine.
- But... no, stop. Ted?

62
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:11,163
This is the first time the guys are
working with Veronica without me.

63
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,150
It might take
a little getting used to.

64
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,235
She's staring at us...

65
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,639
With her eyes.

66
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:27,072
Oh, you guys.
You're making me feel bad.

67
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on. Get away from the door.
Get away from the door.

68
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,046
What's up, Veronica?

69
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,841
Okay, first of all,
you know you're holding hands?

70
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:43,931
Will that be all?

71
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,377
The company finally realized

72
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,712
the P.A. system in this building
needs to be fixed.

73
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:53,274
It makes everything sound like
that janitor trapped inside the wall.

74
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,360
"Let me out.
I'm not a ghost."

75
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,113
We do have a lot of fun here.

76
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,779
<i>The P.A. has been
causing problems for years.</i>

77
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,164


78
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,858
That's weird.
The bird passed out.

79
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,789
Wake up, you stupid bird.

80
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,419
<i>Luckily the effects were temporary.</i>

81
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:29,245
<i>After a week of vomiting, everyone,
even the bird, was back at work.</i>

82
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,673
<i>But from then on,
no one took any chances.</i>

83
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:35,107
<i>Every time they heard the P.A.,
they ran for the emergency exits.</i>

84
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:37,225


85
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,824
It's the P.A.!

86
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,437
Run or we'll all die!

87
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,556
The constant evacuations
are costing the company money.

88
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,258
Plus, nobody knew it was fajita day,

89
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:52,583
and that hurt a lot of feelings
in the cafeteria.

90
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,723
That explains all those
sad people in sombreros,

91
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:59,004
which is traditionally
the happiest hat in the world.

92
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,531
- Next to the fez.
- I think it goes like this...

93
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:03,844
Sombrero, fez, ten-gallon...

94
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,014
I would like to unsubscribe
from whatever you're doing right now.

95
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:09,771
You two need to design
a new P.A. System,

96
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,072
one that can actually
transmit human voice.

97
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:16,065
It must be wireless so executives can
broadcast from anywhere in the building.

98
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,159
I suppose we could use
the 20 terahertz oscillator.

99
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,779
- But doesn't that burn through flesh?
- Not always.

100
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,281
How about we use
the 10 terahertz oscillator?

101
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,117
10? Yeah. Why don't we just
hop on a winged unicorn

102
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:28,744
and fly off to magic land?

103
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,080
Bunsen, beaker, focus.

104
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,865
This thing you do, with the science
and the yammering and the unicorns?

105
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,210
That doesn't work for me.

106
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,546
- That's part of our process to...
- Sorry,

107
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,214
from now on
when you present ideas to me,

108
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,426
only one of you is allowed to talk.

109
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,887
But that's not how we work.

110
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,472
Exactly. That's now how we work.

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,848
- Not.
- Now.

112
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,809
- Not.
- Now.

113
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:58,402
We should go.

114
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:06,602
So I'm thinking about asking
security to reassign Ryan.

115
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,382
Does that make me a bad person?

116
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:12,148
Before you answer that, I sponsored
a prisoner for Amnesty International

117
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,998
and rescued a dog from the freeway.

118
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,750
His name was Sparky.
I don't know his name, no tag on him.

119
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,879
I don't see what your problem is.
Ryan wants to get to know people.

120
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,548
And as my mom says,

121
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,301
"getting to know people
is the best way to get to know them."

122
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,287
Is this the same woman who says,
"you eat what you eat"?

123
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,432
Look, there's Mr. Krebs.

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,329
He walks by
two or three times a day.

125
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,853
He's dull as toast
but always wants to talk.

126
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:39,055
Look how I deal with it,
or as my mom would say,

127
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,358
"watch what you watch
and see what you see."

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,638
- Hi, Linda. How are you today?
- I'm great, Mr. Krebs.

129
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:49,158
Did you ever figure out
what's making that noise in your car?

130
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,222
Oh, no. For me,
new cars are like women.

131
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:54,079
They start making noise, I don't know
what the heck I'm supposed to do.

132
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,124
But there both fun to take out
for a spin once in a while, right?

133
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:58,853
Look out.

134
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,978
Nice to talk to you, Mr. Krebs.

135
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:05,112
See? You should just accept
people for who they are, Ted,

136
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:06,383
and embrace them.

137
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:09,368
I can't stand who Phil and Lem are,
so I'm changing them.

138
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:10,986
I can't believe you two.

139
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,021
Ted's annoyed by Ryan. You don't
like how Phil and Lem act.

140
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,185
You both have to be more tolerant.

141
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:21,095
Which would really help me
because I'm sure I crossed a line.

142
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,733
Maybe Linda's right.

143
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,382
Maybe she did just cross a line.

144
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,529
And she's also right
about your Ryan problem.

145
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:31,033
Don't be a wuss, if someone's
bothering you, change them.

146
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,584
I didn't say that.

147
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,711
Linda's version
you heard in your head is right.

148
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,786
I shouldn't be avoiding this.

149
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,139
Good job, Linda.
We brought him around.

150
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:42,044
We are better when we work together.

151
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,918
- That's not what I.
- I heard, but it bothered me,

152
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:47,343
so I changed it like you suggested.

153
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,128
Friendship. It's so important.

154
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,228
But it's different at work.

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,605
Time spent with friends at work

156
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,108
robs your employer of productivity,

157
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,652
and robbing people is wrong.

158
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,797
Veridian Dynamics.
Friendship.

159
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,912
It's the same as stealing.

160
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,458
Hey, it's Ted. You know
a thing or two about feet.

161
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,211
How thick should
a toenail be? Specifically...

162
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,879
We're not doing that.

163
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:28,375
Listen, Ryan, I need to
talk to you about something.

164
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,289
Anything you want, Teddy.
I love our conversations.

165
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,071
Sitting down here gets so boring.

166
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,097
Chatting with you
is the best part of my day.

167
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,475
All right.
Show me your damn feet.

168
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,769
No. Wait, wait. Look...

169
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:43,647
I need you to dial down
how much you talk to me.

170
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,232
I like you Ryan.

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,512
This is a place of business,
not a hair salon.

172
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,071
Really? You think I talk too much?

173
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,044
I don't know about generally,
but to me?

174
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,409
- Oh, my god, yes.
- That's kinda hard to hear.

175
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:59,371
- Hi, honey. You ready to go to lunch?
- I guess so.

176
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:01,935
Ted, this is my wife Sarah.

177
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,897
Oh, my god, The Ted?

178
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:07,254
Ryan's told me so much about you.
You've been such a great friend.

179
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,532
All the talks you've had
about his mom and my pregnancy.

180
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:13,093
Did you show him your toe?
Does he knows what that thing is?

181
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,948
Ted's an important man.
He doesn't have time for my toe.

182
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,598
I'm not, that important.

183
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,514
I'm getting a phone call.

184
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,641
My phone's vibrating.
It's on vibrate.

185
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:27,316
That is a big problem
that requires my immediate attention.

186
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:28,567
I'll be right up.

187
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,659
Yeah, my phone's broken.

188
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,452
It rings even though
it's on vibrate...

189
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,869
And I'm on the phone with you.

190
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,643
It was nice to meet you.

191
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:48,452
I'm not gonna sit through
another dog and pony show,

192
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:51,131
so which one of you is
going to speak, dog or pony?

193
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,592
- Phil and I were hoping...
- Pony it is. Go.

194
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,785
Right. So...
The p. a. System...

195
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,732
Put your hands down.

196
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:03,018
We're installing new speakers
on every floor.

197
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,502
Now for an executive
to access the system

198
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:08,267
from anywhere in the building,
they'll wear two control pins.

199
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:10,275
One for the mic.
And one for the volume.

200
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,281
Attached like so,

201
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,367
the pins create the perfect
acoustic triangulation.

202
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:17,881
You twist this one
to activate the system

203
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:20,306
and this one to control the volume.

204
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,571
And what if those two little knobs

205
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,249
were attached to a woman?

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,127
Do you see how
that could be a problem?

207
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,137
- You should've said that.
- All right.

208
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,908
You face the wall.
You tell me this can be fixed.

209
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,477
Not a problem.

210
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,642
But we'll need more aluminum.

211
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,981
Titanium.

212
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,639
That's it. We're done.

213
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,779
And next time you present,
only one of you is allowed in my office.

214
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,781
Now face each other.

215
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,520
Why?

216
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,407
This is not a good look for us.

217
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,757
Maybe it'll look less weird
if I carry you.

218
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:14,946
Nope.

219
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,111
Did you hear
the latest office gossip?

220
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:23,506
Ryan the security guard quit his job
'cause you're a giant douche-mobile.

221
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,559
That's right,
you're a douche on wheels

222
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,850
or perhaps a decorative sculpture
hanging above a baby douche's crib.

223
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:30,314
The gossip didn't specify.

224
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,734
- Wait, Ryan quit his job?
- He stormed out of here yesterday.

225
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,629
He stopped
to tell everyone he passed

226
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,963
what was going on, so his storming
took most of the day.

227
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:41,116
- He was the last one out of here.
- Oh, god. I feel awful.

228
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,882
I didn't mean to hurt the guy.
I just wanted to change him a little.

229
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:47,519
Maybe I can change things back.

230
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,946
- I gotta go find him.
- If you want to get there fast.

231
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,909
Yes, I'll take the douche-mobile.

232
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,918
Why do I have to be the one to present
this stupid P.A. system to Veronica?

233
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:01,178
Because I did the talking last time,
it's your turn in the saddle, cowboy.

234
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,970
Get on that horse and...

235
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,972
I don't know any more cowboy things.

236
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:05,825
Wait.

237
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,802
Beans.

238
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,005
I've never presented to
Veronica by myself.

239
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,230
I know. Together we're a thing
of beauty, like a swan.

240
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,490
But on my own,
I'll be like half a swan.

241
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,319
All I'll do is make a big mess
and die.

242
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,006
Gentlemen.

243
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,531
Man we don't know.

244
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,070
Whoever you are, you're not
supposed to be here.

245
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:25,827
We have top-secret stuff
that no one's supposed to see.

246
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,329
- Okay, we'll show you one thing.
- Each.

247
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,668
No, I'm not here to look at anything.
I'm taking a round to avoid someone.

248
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,379
Is it Ryan? He's gone.

249
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,068
Moseyed on out off here.
Another cowboy thing.

250
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:39,486
I've more than I thought.

251
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:41,241
Peg leg.
No, that's not one.

252
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,505
No, no, no, it's some needy blonde

253
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,267
who talks my ear off every time
I walk by her cubicle.

254
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:49,352
She's obsessed with my car
and my wife. Who cares?

255
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,645
They're both small,
boring and japanese.

256
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,721
You know what might
brighten your day?

257
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:56,889
A peek at the smallest squirrel
science can make.

258
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:59,403
But we're going to have to ask
you to wear a face mask.

259
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,071
He's crazy easy to inhale.

260
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,044
Oh, Ted.
What are you doing here?

261
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,706
Did my husband's talking
bother you all the way across town?

262
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:15,168
Okay, that's fair.
Actually I came to apologize,

263
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,805
get him to come back to work,
maybe have a look at that toe.

264
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,591
I don't know the problem, I bought
everything that had a foot on the label.

265
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,717
Is that Ted?

266
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,996
Let him in, 'cause I got me things
I want to say.

267
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,559
Hey, Ryan.

268
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:32,144
Shut up.
You talk too much, Ted.

269
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,563
How does that feel?
Because I don't care.

270
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:37,637
You're in my house now, and I
can talk about whatever I want,

271
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:39,484
like my heart and how you broke it.

272
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,045
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

273
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,872
Why else would I come here
and bring you this bag.

274
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:50,412
Nothing in this bag
is gonna help that.

275
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:54,159
Look, I know what I said
yesterday was insensitive.

276
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,543
I really want you
to come back to work.

277
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,378
You can talk as much as you want

278
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,599
or 20% less 30%... it's up to you.

279
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,174
40%, 50%, whatever.

280
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:05,767
It means a lot
that you would come here.

281
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:06,887
I'll come back.

282
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,882
And I know
sometimes I talk too much.

283
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,142
I'm sorry.
But don't give up on me, friend.

284
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,144
I am not giving up on you.

285
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,938
- My water just broke.
- I should get out of your way.

286
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,548
Oh, God. It's happening.

287
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:20,317
I drank too much to drive.

288
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,319
Can you take us and film the birth

289
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,112
and help us name him
and cut the cord?

290
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,657
Yes. Maybe. Benjamin.
And a big no the cord.

291
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,981
You can present to Veronica.

292
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,105
You're brave. You're strong.

293
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,683
Who opened that jelly jar this morning?
Who kicked that jar's ass?

294
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:39,822
You did,

295
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,135
you rugged son of a bitch.

296
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,802
You're freakin' everyone out.
How you doing in there?

297
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,137
I'm okay. Well, not great.
Pretty bad.

298
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,904
I just lied to myself
about opening a jelly jar,

299
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,670
- which is worrisome.
- You're gonna be fine.

300
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:58,377
I used to be afraid of Veronica, too,
because she's scary and dangerous,

301
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:01,983
and rumor has it, she once walled up
a janitor in her office, but you're...

302
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,154
Why is Mr. Krebs taking the stairs?
He's got a bad leg.

303
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,194
He said he's trying to avoid
some needy blonde in the cubical area.

304
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,493
So back to me
and how I'm going to be fine.

305
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,828
Wait, was Krebs talking about me?

306
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,803
I'm not needy.
He's the one who's needy.

307
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,312
Where are you going?
I'm not fine yet.

308
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,214
You made me worse,
and I was already so bad.

309
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:27,384
- Are you avoiding me?
- Clearly that's impossible.

310
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,971
I can't believe you called me needy.
You're the one who's needy.

311
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,515
You're the one who stops me to talk
every time I pass your desk.

312
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,852
I don't make small talk with you.
You make small talk with me

313
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,312
- because it brightens your damn day.
- No, it doesn't.

314
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,731
- Yes, it does.
- It's my day. I think I know.

315
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,985
Look, Buddy. I'm not the Ryan
in this relationship. You're the Ryan.

316
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,276
You talk my ear off,
but I put up with it

317
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,990
because I accept who you are...
the Ryan.

318
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:52,325
You know what?
I just won't be friendly anymore.

319
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,035
Fine. Whatever keeps you quiet.

320
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,664
No, I will be friendly because that's
who I am, and I love that about me.

321
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,875
- I don't care.
- I just won't be friendly to you.

322
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,585
- Good!
- You're mean.

323
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,205
- You're tedious.
- You're rude.

324
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,713
- You're bland.
- You're old.

325
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,006
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

326
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,468
No. What? Ew! No.
What's happening?

327
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,763
You're not feeling this heat
that's finally happening between us?

328
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,076
Barf.

329
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,637
You're a horrible man.

330
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:20,145
And I'm a friendly person
who never wants to talk to you again.

331
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:25,817
Stop by my desk. I made some
of those butter cookies your wife likes.

332
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,112
<i>Unfortunately
me and my new best friend Ryan</i>

333
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,479
- <i>never made it to the hospital.</i>
- That's it.

334
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,995
Push, Sarah.
Just keep going. There you go.

335
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,981
I don't even let my daughter
eat in this car.

336
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:45,002
We have combined the P.A. microphone
and the volume knob

337
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,108
into one convenient nipple.

338
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,576
I'm sorry. Nipple.

339
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,003
I'm sorry. Nipple.

340
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,009
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,020
You're just a shivering chihuahua.

342
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,805
Actually, this is going better
than I had expected.

343
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,100
I can't get this pin on.
God, this is frustrating.

344
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,020
Maybe we should have some juice.
That always calms me down.

345
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,105
- Here, you do it.
- Me?

346
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,858
No, the microphone attaching elf
who lives in my drawer.

347
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,695
Talking about drawer elves
isn't going to make this any less scary.

348
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,003
I'm sorry. My hands are very sweaty.

349
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,705
And I've never been
this close to your neck before,

350
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,292
which is the perfect flesh pedestal
for your head.

351
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,587
God, I'd kill a man
for some juice right now.

352
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,476
And I'd like to unhinge my jaw
and swallow you like a mouse,

353
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,592
but we both have to work
with what we have.

354
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:33,843
Hurry up.

355
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:37,305
- Careful. Don't stick me with it.
- I've almost got it.

356
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:40,136
<i>I'm bleeding. Get out! </i>

357
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,818
<i>Get out now!</i>

358
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,958
I guess it works.

359
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,999
It's a huge improvement
over the old system,

360
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:10,672
which made everybody panic
and run out of the building.

361
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,465
You're so critical.

362
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,095
No wonder I'm afraid
to be alone with you.

363
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,790
I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing,
like, "you're so critical.

364
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,766
"No wonder I'm afraid
to be alone with you."

365
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,644
Wait. Am I dreaming?

366
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,187
No, Phil, you're not.

367
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:27,939
Crap.

368
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,461
<i>I am Veronica,</i>

369
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,588
<i>queen of Veridian.</i>

370
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,550
<i>The gorilla habitat will
be closing in 15 minutes.</i>

371
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,021
<i>I need a price check on peas.</i>

372
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,055
<i>And now it's time for all the young
people to come to the dance floor.</i>

373
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:09,064
Hello, crazy lady talking to an empty
building. Where is everybody?

374
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,358
If corporate calls,
I'm going with "it's Saturday."

375
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,121
I've had an eventful day.

376
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:17,164
Turns out, I should not have tried
to change Ryan, but I did.

377
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,866
Now my car looks like
someone made wine in the backseat.

378
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:22,256
And trying to change Phil and Lem

379
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,763
was even more irritating
than just leaving them alone.

380
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,974
I scared everyone out of the building
and I got stabbed in the neck.

381
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,800
Although
I did get to watch Phil run.

382
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:34,129
He was like an ostrich in a lab coat
trying to catch a bus.

383
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,336
And I saw the beautiful
miracle of birth...

384
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:39,052
And the less-beautiful
expulsion of afterbirth.

385
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,464
Maybe my kindergarten teacher was right.
Maybe I am too controlling.

386
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:45,683
Probably. But I am certainly
not gonna try to change you.

387
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,519
Thank you.

388
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,939
It's lonely always knowing
what's best.

389
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,023
I know, right?

390
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,110
We've got each other.

391
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,765
And that reminds me of apecial song
from a simpler time.

392
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,103
<i>Not doing it.</i>

393
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:11,854
<i>Not doing it.</i>
