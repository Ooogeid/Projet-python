2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,920
- Do you miss London?
- God, yes.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,231
I don't know what I did
to go under your skin

4
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:09,383
I have been watching my life.

5
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,887
Scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:23,551
- I'm very sorry I started this.
- I don't know what you want.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,651
- You've been flirting for months.
- So what?

8
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,355
So I can't stop thinking about you.

11
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,863
Butter.

12
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,530
And the apples are good now,
but not from the market.

13
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,561
I can go to Rodney farms on Sunday.

14
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:15,838
It's near church.

15
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,728
Can't we go to Rodney farms?

16
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:18,872
We'll see.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,746
Why don't we go to church?

18
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:24,153
- We go to church.
- On christmas.

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,373
Carla goes every sunday.

20
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:29,422
We don't need to go every week.

21
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,572
Anything else?

22
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:36,461
- It's early. Do you want a drink?
- Yes.

23
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:41,135
- How was school today?
- Good.

24
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,189
How come you never ask me?

25
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,438
I do.

26
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,775
It's just your answer is always longer,
so I thought I'd start with Sally.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,219
When's Halloween?

28
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,535
Before Thanksgiving.

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,396
Francine and Carlton
have invited us,

30
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:58,560
but I think if we're going to be
selling daddy's house,

31
00:01:58,859 --> 00:01:59,882
I don't know,

32
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,121
it might be nice to have it there
one last time.

33
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:08,269
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

34
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,113
No.

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,930
You're working too much.

36
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,508
Betts, I don't have a choice.

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,894
No, that's not what I mean.
I just...

38
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,596
I see how hard you're working.

39
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:27,902
Hello.

40
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:30,963
Inside.

41
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:39,396
- Were you grading papers?
- Why?

42
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,704
I don't know if you're hungry,
but I made date nut bread.

43
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,503
Actually, I made three...

44
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,758
A bake sale.

45
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,346
Oh, your service called.

46
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,521
Mr. Hilton was looking for you,

47
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,934
but he's probably
in the air right now.

48
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:03,981
Thanks, Miss Farrell.

49
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:06,456
That's good to know.

50
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,018
I thought so.

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,327
I want you to spend the whole night.

52
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,850
You couldn't possibly
be asleep already.

53
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:49,862
This eight-year-old,

54
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,077
Charlie,

55
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,566
looked up at me during art today
and said,

56
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,903
"how do I know if what I see as blue

57
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,644
is the same as it is to you?"

58
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,262
And what did you say?

59
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:08,024
The truth.

60
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,020
I don't know.

61
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:12,389
I never have,

62
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,505
but I love that he made me think
about that again.

63
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,131
What would you have said?

64
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,127
I would have told Charlie

65
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,147
that my job is about

66
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,187
boiling down communication
to its essentials,

67
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,861
and that I know

68
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:36,938
that there is a blue

69
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,224
that at least 45% of the population

70
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,947
sees as the same.

71
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,084
Maybe half tho people think
they're looking at yellow.

72
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,481
Maybe,

73
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,934
but the truth is
people may see things differently,

74
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,672
but they don't really want to.

75
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:59,644
Do you feel bad about what you do?

76
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,526
Nobody feels as good
about what they do as you do.

77
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,178
That's sweet.

78
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,469
I wish I could've
known you at eight.

79
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,057
I bet you were serious.

80
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,396
I would've liked you.

81
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,220
Long curly hair...

82
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,628
No one has it anymore.

83
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:48,031
- Why don't you take her?
- Because I said no.

84
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:50,352
You'd rather not go than go with me?

85
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:52,254
What do you think
Mr. Draper would say

86
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,187
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper
40th with his secretary?

87
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,147
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

88
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,827
- Coffee?
- Morning, Don.

89
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,648
Morning, fellas. Yes.

90
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,076
- Aqua Net, 9:00.
- Get Peggy.

91
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,042
Don, if you could stand over there.

92
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,367
It's Paul Kinsey theater.

93
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:14,058
This was my thought:

94
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,917
Aqua Net is about hold,
but it is also about beauty.

95
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:20,965
So we're driving...

96
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,465
Two couples.
I call it "double date."

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,279
The woman in the back's
scarf blows off

98
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,304
and her hair starts blowing.

99
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:31,163
- Her hairdo falls apart.
- Oh no!

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,547
And then the woman in front
takes off her scarf and hands it back

101
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,768
- to the woman in the back.
- Take mine.

102
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:38,981
And he says, "are you sure, Marcia?"

103
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,721
Marcia's hair is perfect.

104
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,988
And then her date gives her
a knowing smile of admiration

105
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:48,073
on her confident smile.

106
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:51,275
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style."

107
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,863
Too much story.
Every time I hear "and then,"

108
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,450
there's another chance for the ladies
at home to misunderstand.

109
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,245
What if it's just the two couples,

110
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,726
the wind is blowing,

111
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,962
the woman in the back has
to put on her kerchief

112
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,970
and she just looks longingly
at Miss perfect in front?

113
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:13,293
- Okay.
- "Arrive in style" still works.

114
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:16,354
And at the end
you can see the can with the

115
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,422
kerchief...
Like a see-through one over it

116
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,065
and the wind blows it off
to reveal the Aqua Net.

117
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:23,025
A kerchief in a can?

118
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,523
Don't use that, but very nice.

119
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,147
Well, great then.

120
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,319
What do you have for Western Union?

121
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,787
We don't meet until next week.

122
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,332
Hilton takes precedence, I need you two
to be ready at a moment's notice.

123
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,667
It has to be TV to compete
with the phone company.

124
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,661
I love getting telegrams,
but I never send them.

125
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,007
How is that supposed to help?

126
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:50,916
I've got it.

127
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:56,475
My goodness.
This is where everyone is.

128
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,629
Allison my dear, do you mind?

129
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,861
All the paperwork is
through on your contract.

130
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,486
It is my pleasure to deliver
your signing bonus personally.

131
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,281
You see, I don't just fire people.

132
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,573
So we finally have
an answer to the question

133
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,626
"what makes Don Draper smile?"

134
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:22,201
- $5,000 seems to be the number.
- I wonder why it took two months.

135
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:26,964
Will your amigo Connie Hilton be
attending the anniversary party friday?

136
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:30,126
- In his dressiest Stetson.
- Splendid.

137
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:31,954
You will be speaking last.

138
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,138
It's prime time. Please prepare.

139
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,057
I'm sorry to interrupt.

140
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,185
Mr. Pryce, your wife's here and has
requested your attention immediately.

141
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,300
- Where?
- Your office.

142
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,441
- What's going on?
- I'll find out.

143
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,363
No, it's okay.

144
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,879
<i>Mr. Kinsey to see you.</i>

145
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,243
What was that?

146
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,366
Thank you, Olive. What?

147
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:01,373
I don't need you to put your
little swirl on top of my idea.

148
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:05,097
- No one's keeping score.
- I am. And every time we work together,

149
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,633
it looks like you carried the load
cos you're spontaneous,

150
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,632
you're a girl, you're his favorite
and you use Aqua Net.

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,968
- Are you nuts? He hates me.
- That's rich.

152
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:16,404
Wearing a dress isn't going to help you
with Western Union.

153
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,485
You do your work. I'll do mine.

154
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,893
Let the chips fall where they may.

155
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,938
Mrs. Pryce, your water.

156
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,567
Thank you ever so much, John.

157
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:31,105
Will there be anything else?

158
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,369
Oh, he's such a toad.

159
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,262
He is. He is.
Darling, please sit down.

160
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,626
No. I'm not going to let you force me
to do anything anymore.

161
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,509
Am I to entertain
your ballad of dissatisfaction

162
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:51,798
or has something actually happened?
Because I am at work, dear.

163
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,850
I'm so sorry.

164
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:02,708
I went to pick up my gown.

165
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,507
The queue for the taxi was 10 long
with those fat ladies in their furs.

166
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:10,077
Finally I think I'm en route,
but I see the park.

167
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,818
I insist it's the wrong direction

168
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,404
and he's obviously running up my fare,
which he was.

169
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,031
I'm so sorry, darling.

170
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,563
I had to stop here because
I'd already taken a $2.25 tour of Harlem

171
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,453
and that was all the money I had.

172
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,081
Oh, well, we'll get
you home right away.

173
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,721
Do you have enough cash
to get me to London?

174
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:28,654
Because this is not my home.

175
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,224
- These things take time.
- Not for you.

176
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,963
If a superior demands
that you be happy,

177
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,094
you say "yes, sir.
Right away, sir."

178
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,518
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?

179
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,000
You like it here...

180
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:46,144
The smells, the noise
and the criminals at every level.

181
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,771
I have made the best of this.

182
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:51,376
My salary is good.
The company is flourishing.

183
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,451
My wife has a beautiful gown.

184
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,017
May I see it?

185
00:10:58,045 --> 00:10:59,412
It's not London.

186
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,661
- It's not even england.
- Well, that's true.

187
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:07,671
I've been here 10 months and no one's
ever asked me where I went to school.

188
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:11,964
I want to scream.

189
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,672
Don't.

190
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,748
Roll over.

191
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,354
- Just a minute!
- Why did you answer?

192
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>I had to see you.</i>

193
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:44,828
<i>I called you from the bus station
in New Haven before I started hitching.</i>

194
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:47,614
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

195
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,939
<i>Can you give me a minute?</i>

196
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:56,882
It's my brother.

197
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,009
Get rid of him for 15 minutes.
I'll run out.

198
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,421
No, it's okay, Don. Come outside.

199
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:05,891
No. So there's a man in here.
He doesn't need to know it's me.

200
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:09,603
I want you to meet him.

201
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:12,647
I don't want to ruin this.

202
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,688
It's okay.

203
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,228
I promise.

204
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,546
Danny, I'd like you
to meet my friend Don.

205
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,184
Sorry to interrupt.

206
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,885
- Danny, be polite.
- I really am sorry.

207
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:44,596
What happened there?

208
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,098
Is it bad under there?

209
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,328
- Are you hungry?
- No.

210
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:51,144
Well, I should be going.

211
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:58,276
Listen, I know what it looks like,
but I'm not a junkie.

212
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:04,366
Although apparently I'm too dangerous
to push a cart in a public library.

213
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,582
He has fits.

214
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,164
I'm sorry. I interrupted you.

215
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,410
It's a nice night. I'll see you
in the morning, Suzy.

216
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,176
- I wish you the best.
- You don't even know me.

217
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:32,355
- I'll call you.
- Tomorrow.

218
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,242
He could've stayed inside your room.

219
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,634
I wanted you two to meet.

220
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,561
You're my baby brother.

221
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,169
Well, he knows how to leave a room.
Reminds me of mom.

222
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,671
He's just very private.

223
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,716
He's arrogant.
His plans were interrupted.

224
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,322
You don't know him.

225
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,563
I'm going to get you another job,

226
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,392
someplace safe.

227
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,087
Safe.

228
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,161
Other people are the problem.

229
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,276
Name such a place.

230
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:21,248
People are ignorant.

231
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,045
They're scared of things
they don't understand.

232
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,331
I'm really hungry.

233
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,971
1923. We were giddy.

234
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,341
We didn't know the soup
was gonna hit the fan,

235
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:46,608
but we made it through.

236
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,324
All these guys are dead...

237
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,106
Except you, of course...

238
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,829
And Doug Thompson,
but I wish he were.

239
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:58,208
He left me a whole roll
of bolls laxatives.

240
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,857
I thought they were candies.

241
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,484
I want him to show up and keel over.

242
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,153
Damn it. I don't want
to go to another funeral.

243
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,404
Well, I'm not really gonna kill him.
I just would like to, that's all.

244
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:09,783
40th anniversary.

245
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,922
40 would be an insignificant year

246
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,885
were it not the average lifespan
of a man in this business.

247
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:20,036
I don't think it's a bad idea to have
a chance to outdrink your clientele.

248
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,337
Who am I kidding?
I don't want to go either.

249
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:28,885
Have to watch Don Draper accept
an award for his humanity?

250
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,162
- Don is important.
- You know, I found that guy

251
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,504
working in a fur company...

252
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:35,970
Night school.

253
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,144
And that girl Betty.

254
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:42,655
I remember Mona say they looked like
they were on top of our wedding cake.

255
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:45,433
Screw him.

256
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:48,654
Have the party without me.
I can't do it.

257
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,138
I won't.

258
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,401
Okay. Okay.

259
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,456
It's just a party. If you don't want
to go, you don't have to go.

260
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,918
It's not like it's our company
anymore anyway.

261
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,422
Oh my God. Remember her?

262
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,692
- Can I?
- If you do it right.

263
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,554
Hello, Draper residence.

264
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,988
Hello?

265
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,575
There's nobody there.
They hanged up.

266
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,590
Hang it up.

267
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:42,208
Why'd they hang up?

268
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,628
Probably a wrong number.
People do it all the time.

269
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,130
But I could hear somebody
and they heard me.

270
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:51,432
My goodness, Sally Draper. Try
not to take everything so personally.

271
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,654
Jeez Louise.

272
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,862
The phone is cheap.

273
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,749
It's everyday
and you can't trust it.

274
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,127
The telegraph is

275
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,098
honest and solid and

276
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:31,359
clear. It's old, but it's good...

277
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,469
Traditional.

278
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,173
Sorry about that, olive.

279
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:54,498
Peggy.

280
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:58,388
Peggy!

281
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,691
- Did you see a girl come through here?
- No, sir.

282
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:16,237
- I'm Paul, by the way.
- I'm Achilles.

283
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,416
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.

284
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,295
- Are you okay?
- Are you Greek?

285
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,019
I'm an American citizen.

286
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:27,523
No, of course.

287
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,157
It's just that's a mighty big name.

288
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,373
- How did that happen?
- Well, it...

289
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,834
It's been in my family
for generations.

290
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,752
When we have a party
and someone says "Achilles,"

291
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,554
all the men turn their heads.

292
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,538
- In fact, one christmas...
- Hush.

293
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,742
- I've got it.
- You've got what?

294
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,362
Achilles, I have thought
of something very very good.

295
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,699
- I'm glad to hear it.
- It's truly great news.

296
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:03,868
Yeah, your whole face changed.

297
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,036
Did it?

298
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:09,305
Well, I think I shall sleep
very soundly tonight.

299
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,042
I wish you the same.

300
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:48,371
Is that taken?

301
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,465
I'll only stay for a stop.

302
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,990
I tried to catch you
on the platform.

303
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,030
What are you doing here?

304
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,000
I need to talk to you.

305
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:12,896
Did you call my house last night?

306
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:16,463
No, I didn't.

307
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:22,129
- This was a mistake.
- Sit down.

308
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:25,418
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,698
You said you'd call me.

310
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,941
Your brother is there.

311
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,460
I don't care about your marriage,
your work or any of that,

312
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,345
as long as I know you're with me.

313
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,026
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,134
I got him a job

315
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,821
at the V.A. hospital in Bedford.

316
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,374
He'll be pushing a broom,
but it has nice grounds.

317
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,968
You can come back tonight.

318
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,923
He'll be gone.

319
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,699
- Are you sure?
- Stop it.

320
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:27,068
<i>Scarborough!</i>

321
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,666
<i>Briarcliff Manor!</i>

322
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>Scarborough!</i> <i>Briarcliff Manor!</i>

323
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,974
It was nice meeting you.

324
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,000
Mr. Kinsey.

325
00:23:07,257 --> 00:23:08,257
Paul!

326
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,931
Sorry to wake you. It's 9:00 A.M.

327
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,266
Good morning, Lois.

328
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:17,782
Good morning.

329
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,649
I need you to type something for me.

330
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:37,047
- Were you in here before?
- No.

331
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:40,329
- So you haven't touched anything?
- No.

332
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,545
You do that sometimes.

333
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,888
- What was it?
- Does it look like I know?

334
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:53,890
I wrote it down.

335
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,832
I know I wrote it down.

336
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,135
Did you find it?

337
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,024
It's always the last place you look.

338
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:08,529
My mother always said to retrace
your steps if you lost something.

339
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,281
Good god. Would you shut up?

340
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,097
"In conclusion,

341
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:17,698
with the help of Sterling Cooper,

342
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,111
its ingenuity and influence,

343
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,244
America is teaching business
to the world."

344
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,405
Very rousing, sir.

345
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,553
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?

346
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:40,581
Mr. Pryce's office.

347
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,689
Just a moment, please.

348
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,833
London calling. Mr. Ford.

349
00:24:50,064 --> 00:24:51,072
Harold.

350
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:54,158
Just calling for a status report
on our little party.

351
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,510
All is well, although as of late,

352
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,488
Bert Cooper will be in absentia.

353
00:24:58,613 --> 00:24:59,842
<i>Well, that won't do.</i>

354
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:03,292
We're flying across the pond.
We expect all the flowers in the vase.

355
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,216
- What does that mean?
<i>- Look, Lane,</i>

356
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,772
we've had interest in the company
for some months

357
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:11,467
and this party is essential
to attracting a second suitor.

358
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,219
For what purpose?

359
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:17,042
Did we reach you at a bad time?
You seem foggy.

360
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,937
- Saint John here.
- Oh, hello.

361
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,815
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.

362
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:28,176
But why?

363
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:32,113
We've reduced the staff
and increased the revenue by 22%.

364
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:35,074
I think you've answered
your own question.

365
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:38,502
We need this party
to encourage interest.

366
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:41,784
- Do your best, lad.
- Yes, of course.

367
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,477
- Are you quite all right, sir?
- Yes. That'll be all.

368
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,763
Henry Francis, please.

369
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,311
It's Betty Draper.

370
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,290
How are you? What a nice surprise.

371
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,673
I was wondering
if you called my home last night.

372
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:32,710
No. No, I didn't.

373
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:36,413
Oh, well, we had a hang up.
I thought it might be you.

374
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:39,321
Really?

375
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,203
I'm terribly embarrassed.

376
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,623
Do you want me to call you?

377
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:48,348
- No.
<i>- But you thought it was me.</i>

378
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,219
What are you laughing at?

379
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,840
I didn't call you
and I'm not going to,

380
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,028
but if you're going
to call me, call me.

381
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,776
<i>Don't make up excuses.</i>

382
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm not playing a game here.

383
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,289
Goodbye.

384
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,178
Goodbye, Betty.

385
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,467
Do you mind?
This is rather serious.

386
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,665
Go ahead.

387
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:25,592
It has come to my attention that

388
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,772
you're not attending
the Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.

389
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,609
I wouldn't have told Roger
if I planned on it remaing a secret.

390
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,553
In Great Britain

391
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:43,619
we have a good deal of testimonials

392
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,789
and the senior members are
all equally unenthused.

393
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,251
It marks the passage of time.

394
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,339
It's painful, I imagine.

395
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,841
I didn't get to where I am
by dwelling on the past.

396
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:01,175
So think of the future, hmm?

397
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,889
All of our clients,
all of our staff,

398
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:07,059
the press, newspapers
and trade publications...

399
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:10,378
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.

400
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,650
You really pour the honey on,
then you lick it off.

401
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:20,323
Well, if you care about
Sterling Cooper at all,

402
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,756
remember that

403
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:25,078
your absence will make
everyone think you are ill.

404
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,524
Who told you I was vain?

405
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:38,052
Please.

406
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:40,965
It's obvious.

407
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,604
<i>I want to show Mommy.</i>

408
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,044
<i>Mommy!</i>

409
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,284
- Maybe she's not here.
- Carla.

410
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:14,682
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine.

411
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:18,026
I want you to take
the children to the park.

412
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,142
Don't come home... Just...

413
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,824
Just... dinner time
would be perfect.

414
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,590
Take them to the library.

415
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,208
Hello.

416
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:41,918
I'm glad to see you.

417
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,243
Sorry again.

418
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:47,510
We were gonna leave after school and

419
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,854
I am still here, obviously.

420
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:54,117
You want to wait here for me?
He has to report tomorrow.

421
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,416
Let me do it. Let me drive him.

422
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,709
- Where are you going again?
- Bedford, Mass.

423
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:04,129
- It's a long drive, Don.
- And you'll have to come back alone.

424
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,758
Let me do this for you.

425
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:12,680
I don't want to say goodbye up there.
It's gonna come out ungrateful.

426
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:24,626
There's $375 in there, okay?

427
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,780
How many times have you done this?

428
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:55,581
Don't you need to gas up?

429
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:57,742
No, we're fine.

430
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,910
So you're not gonna stop?

431
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,327
Do you need to stop?

432
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:08,539
I have some movie in my head
where I give you the slip,

433
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:10,237
but I might as well tell you:

434
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,155
I'm not going to Bedford.

435
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:17,474
Well, I am,
so I guess you kind of have to.

436
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,187
Why do you care?

437
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,343
You're just gonna
go back and screw her.

438
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,969
I don't know
if you're capable of understanding,

439
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,316
but that job is important.

440
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:34,186
Did you get me the job?

441
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,051
- No.
- So shut up.

442
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,742
I'm not retarded.

443
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,267
Julius Caesar had epilepsy.

444
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:43,892
- He ran Rome.
- Things didn't turn out well for him.

445
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:46,223
I know what's waiting
for me at that place.

446
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:47,941
I'm 25 years old, Don.

447
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:51,444
I don't want to be cleaning
toilets until I die.

448
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:57,951
Just pull over.

449
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:14,093
Hold on.

450
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,070
What?

451
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,304
I'm older than you

452
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:22,893
and I'm telling you it seems bad now,
but you can still change things.

453
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,482
Pull myself up by the bootstraps?

454
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,116
Does that just sound stupid to you?

455
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,044
How do I explain this?

456
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,573
I can't do anything that you can do.

457
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:42,102
Everyone knows, sooner or later,
that there's something wrong with me.

458
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,196
They're kind and they try,

459
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:47,538
but then when I come to
with piss in my pants,

460
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,538
they stare at me like
i'm from another planet.

461
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,401
I am afflicted, okay?

462
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:59,007
It's not a question of will.
I can't change that.

463
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,038
- Do you need money?
- Always.

464
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,696
I swore to myself I would
try to do this right once.

465
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:17,829
Do what?

466
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,621
I want you to call me

467
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,106
if you ever need to.

468
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,420
And I want you to remember

469
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:31,172
if something happens to you,
your sister will never forgive herself.

470
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,447
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

471
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:40,554
That I let you out
20 miles outside of Framingham?

472
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:50,856
Take care.

473
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:45,289
I know he thought I was passing him off,
but he means the world to me.

474
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:49,367
He knows that.

475
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,451
What was the place like?

476
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,015
- Nice.
- Bullshit.

477
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,933
He'll be as good as he can be.

478
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:18,113
Don, I don't want to.

479
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:20,903
I don't.

480
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:24,471
It's okay.

481
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,890
Coffee?

482
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,690
No.

483
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:32,851
Can you get my wife on the phone?

484
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:46,114
- Betty.
- Where were you last night?

485
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:51,244
- I told you... I was with Hilton.
- Oh, I must have forgotten.

486
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,288
Did you remember
to pick up my tuxedo?

487
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,570
Yesterday. It's in the closet.

488
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:57,167
<i>I'll get home at 5:30.</i>

489
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:59,526
<i>We should leave within the hour.</i>

490
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,713
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm going to go.

491
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:04,049
What's wrong?

492
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,715
"What's wrong?" "What'swrong?"

493
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:12,557
I don't feel well.

494
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,718
Get into bed and grab a hot-water
bottle. You have seven hours.

495
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:21,274
<i>It's all the clients and the partners,
and they're all expecting me to show up</i>

496
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:24,778
with the glamorous, elegant,
stunning Betty Draper.

497
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,950
I want to show you off, Betts.

498
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,270
Okay.

499
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,582
Are you ready? Don's expecting us.

500
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:43,378
I've got nothing.

501
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,384
What a relief. Mine's garbage too.

502
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:49,524
No, I had something,

503
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,641
something incredible,

504
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,491
but I lost it.

505
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,758
I didn't write it down.

506
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:01,873
I hate that.

507
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,693
It might've been
the best idea I ever had.

508
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:08,034
I did everything:
I talked to Achilles;

509
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,658
I spent last night recreating
every detail of the evening,

510
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,992
hoping it would come back.
You know how it is.

511
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,748
There was nothing, then there was it
and now it's nothing again.

512
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,051
I'm so sorry.

513
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:24,129
How do you talk to Achilles?

514
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:26,865
He's a janitor
with a very bad memory.

515
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:31,003
Do you know what the Chinese say?

516
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,265
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

517
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,798
Come on. We've failed before.

518
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,864
Okay, we really looked
for advantages.

519
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:59,018
One of them is
phone calls happen every day.

520
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:01,201
A telegram's a big deal.

521
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,844
Some thing like
"she's getting married.

522
00:41:04,096 --> 00:41:06,296
Are you really just going
to give her a call?"

523
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,950
Sounds like you're
talking to her parents.

524
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,336
They should really be
at that wedding.

525
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,545
Also, old people love them.

526
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:18,725
"When you care, send one there."

527
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:22,899
- That's a slogan, not an idea. Paul?
- Mine aren't any better.

528
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:25,628
Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?

529
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,284
- Don't yell at him.
- Excuse me?

530
00:41:30,544 --> 00:41:32,192
Tell him what happened.

531
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,199
No.

532
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,960
The dog ate my homework.
I had a great idea and I lost it.

533
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,366
I didn't write it down.

534
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,464
I hate when that happens.

535
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:54,534
I keep thinking about that Chinese thing
you said. What was it?

536
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:57,806
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

537
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,142
It just makes me think.

538
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,862
You call someone on the phone,

539
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,149
"hello, I'm getting married"
or "congratulations on the baby,"

540
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,369
then you hang up.

541
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:11,027
It's gone...

542
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:15,453
It's different
if you send a telegram.

543
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,409
A telegram is permanent.

544
00:42:19,485 --> 00:42:20,787
Something like

545
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,456
"a telegram is forever."

546
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,169
You can't frame a phone call.

547
00:42:32,994 --> 00:42:33,994
My God.

548
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:39,560
That's the way to go.
You two keep working on that.

549
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:43,560
When do you want it?

550
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,101
The party's tonight. Monday.

551
00:42:51,128 --> 00:42:53,381
See? It all works out.

552
00:43:00,552 --> 00:43:02,029
<i>Bes, are you ready?</i>

553
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:06,168
The car's downstairs.
The driver's Chinese.

554
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:09,294
<i>Ready, Betts?</i>

555
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:21,556
Look how pretty mommy is.

556
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:27,463
Where are we going?

557
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,319
The Waldorf Astoria, mummy.

558
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,933
Well, then we passed it.
It's on 5th avenue.

559
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:34,258
It's on park. It moved years ago.

560
00:43:34,414 --> 00:43:35,612
Oh, that's right.

561
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:38,973
That's right.
When did they ever do that?

562
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,359
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.

563
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:46,970
They'll change it
and never give you a reason.

564
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:50,778
Mummy, she's not Margaret.
She's Jane. She's my wife.

565
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:55,632
- Does Mona know?
- Yes, she knows.

566
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:10,563
You seem surprised
that there's traffic.

567
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:12,500
There's always traffic.

568
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:15,565
Calm yourself.
We'll arrive when we arrive.

569
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:20,337
- They're selling the company.
- What?

570
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:24,303
They're selling Sterling Cooper.

571
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:27,083
- When?
- I have no idea.

572
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:32,045
- What happens to the Americans?
- They'll go to the highest bidder.

573
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:38,337
I know you hate uncertainty,

574
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:42,114
but take comfort in the fact that
we'll return to England.

575
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:55,004
I'm going to keep going on

576
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:59,129
and make Don Draper wait, because
God knows we've all waited for him.

577
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:03,499
As if being

578
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:06,369
decorated for his service
in Korea weren't enough,

579
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:09,330
his career has yielded
even more awards:

580
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:14,095
the American association of advertising
agencies' Arthur Kudner award,

581
00:45:14,698 --> 00:45:17,547
"Printers' Ink" magazine's
advertising gold medal,

582
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:20,245
the advertising writers
association of New York...

583
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,383
I'm not reading all of these.

584
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:27,396
He's loyal, charming,

585
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:30,560
quiet, but not modest.
Why should he be?

586
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:34,522
We have to thank
his beautiful wife Betty

587
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:37,567
and his three children
for sharing him with us,

588
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:41,780
cos as we all know, sometimes Sterling
Cooper has gotten the lion's share.

589
00:45:43,822 --> 00:45:47,162
Bert Cooper and my father,
Roger Sterling Sr.,

590
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,621
bravely set this
in motion 40 years ago.

591
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:55,085
Let me introduce the man who will stand
alongside me for the next 40 years...

592
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,238
Our creative director,

593
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,541
partner,

594
00:45:58,709 --> 00:45:59,709
father,

595
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:01,139
husband

596
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:02,759
and friend...

597
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:05,553
Donald Draper.

598
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:21,928
Please.

599
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:23,657
Please.

600
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,719
Please.

601
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,195
I'm very honored.
