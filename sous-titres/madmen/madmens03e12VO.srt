Previously on Mad Men.

2
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,544
I wanted you to come to me.

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,796
- And why is that?
- Because you're married.

4
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,591
- So you're missing here?
- Are you asking if I miss you?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,968
- What's your name?
- It used to be Dick Whitman.

6
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,810
I didn't want to go
to her wedding, but I did.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,015
The least you can do
is not come to mine.

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,767
You're not even
giving Jane a chance.

9
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:21,520
I wanna take you in that bedroom, And
give you a go round like you never had.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,649
I wanted to inform you
that you're now the head of accounts.

11
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:27,652
- Excuse me?
- We're making you head of accounts.

12
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:29,962
Spectacular.

Season 3 Episode 12
<i>The Grown-Ups</i>

15
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:17,125
I've got your hot cocoa.

16
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,262
Wonderful.

17
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:25,123
I just got back from lunch,
and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

18
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:30,085
- It's instant.
- It's from the diner.

19
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,308
- How you can tell ?
- You can tell

20
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,427
because they use water
instead of milk.

21
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:38,484
It's warmer outside.

22
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,724
It's ridiculous.

23
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,120
The building will take care of it.

24
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,559
They always do.

25
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,482
Sorry about that.

26
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:49,150
This really is hitting the spot.

27
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,429
Come in.

28
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,458
Have a seat.

29
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:09,503
I believe I have what is
rather disappointing news.

30
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:12,589
It's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove

31
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:15,846
will be made senior vice president
in charge of account services

32
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,971
and you will be made
head of account management.

33
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:22,496
Really?

34
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,431
This is not to ignore
that you've distinguished yourself

35
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:28,147
and been of great service
to the company.

36
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:30,087
What is it based on?

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,333
Our billings are neck and neck.

38
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:36,530
I think I've done a lot with what
I was given in this arbitrary scheme.

39
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:40,032
It's become apparent taht

40
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,319
you are excellent

41
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:45,542
at making the clients feel their needs
are being met, but

42
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,998
Mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift

43
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,878
of making them feel
as if they haven't any needs.

44
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,288
I see.

45
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,133
I improved your title.

46
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,807
And you tell your clients

47
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,721
there'll be no need
to be deprecating.

48
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:04,164
- Bert and roger know about this?
- This is under my authority.

49
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:08,938
And I have to commend you
on taking it as well as you have.

50
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,436
I hope this was
a difficult decision.

51
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:20,622
It was.

52
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,123
There you go.

53
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,182
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

54
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:55,251
Why did you pick that place?

55
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:58,590
I don't know why a lunch counter
is any better than eating at your desk.

56
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,554
You could've joined me for a drink.

57
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,479
I can drink at my desk if i want to,
and i'm not out $1.25.

58
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm sorry i'm not

59
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,391
asstimulating a lunch
companion as doug.

60
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,541
It's duck, and I work most lunches.

61
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,681
I don't like his aftershave.

62
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:15,918
I can smell it on you and I can smell it
in the bathroom in the morning.

63
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,540
What's wrong with him?

64
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:18,908
Nothing.

65
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,719
I don't even know why I'm weighing
in on men right now.

66
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,927
I think it's good that
you're being picky, finally.

67
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,299
Well, there's nothing around
but married ones,

68
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,993
I mean, we can't all
throw caution to the wind.

69
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,587
Duck's not married.

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,846
Then why are you with him?

71
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:41,303
Well, this is me.

72
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,528
- Are you working late tonight?
- I don't know yet.

73
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:50,055
Van cleef.

74
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:52,413
How very Janie Siegel-Sterling.

75
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,955
They're blue and they're new.

76
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,212
She's trying.

77
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,580
You always take her side.

78
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:02,657
I do not.

79
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:06,764
She started giving me advice,

80
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,308
"don't go to bed angry.

81
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,434
Let them do what they want.

82
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,937
Dress sexy".

83
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,522
And all I kept thinking
about was daddy.

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,650
It's disgusting.

85
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,822
Doesn't she know that?

86
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:22,331
That she ruined my life?

87
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,489
Your father had a part in it.

88
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,608
You don't think i know that?

89
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,123
Brooks is different
than your father.

90
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,174
I don't want to get married.

91
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:40,736
Everything's pointing
to the fact that I shouldn't,

92
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:42,331
and everybody knows.

93
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,546
Brooks knows.
His mother knows.

94
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,559
Do you know what she said to me?

95
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,721
She said in India...

96
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:55,238
if the wedding doesn't take place
at the appointed hour,

97
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,722
they burn the bride.

98
00:05:57,134 --> 00:06:00,899
Just because she went to india,
doesn't mean she's not an idiot.

99
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,232
And jane...

100
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:04,131
if she's coming,

101
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,950
I'm not going.

102
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,577
She's coming because
your father's coming

103
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,594
and he paid for everything.

104
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,526
You're having the wedding.
The bride will not be burned.

105
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,211
Turn those earrings into
a tea service or something.

106
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,889
- Aren't you listening to me?
- I am, and you're babbling

107
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,490
- like a little fool. Go to your room.
- What?

108
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:27,565
You heard me. You want to act
like a child, I'll treat you like one.

109
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,907
Would somebody get that?

110
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,445
Daddy.

111
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,197
Are you alone?

112
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,811
- Yes, what's wrong?
<i>- Nothing's right.</i>

113
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,958
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me
something blue and something new

114
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,165
- or mommy. She should know that.
- Who?

115
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,289
I don't like her, daddy,

116
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:01,529
and I've told you
I don't want her to be there.

117
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,810
- Honey, put your mother on the phone.
- He wants to talk to you.

118
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,641
Keep Jane under control.

119
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,229
First of all, tell the bride that
everything is copacetic.

120
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,605
We both agree that she's nuts
and she should shut up.

121
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,402
Your father said that he's sorry,

122
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,693
that jane will stay out of your way
and that we're both tired of the drama.

123
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,016
He said all that?

124
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,633
I'm not playing chicken anymore.
If she wants to cancel the wedding,

125
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll take the deposit
out of her inheritance.

126
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,411
- He said the wedding's off.
- Fine.

127
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,081
You men that.
You are not worried about India ?

128
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:41,418
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you want to cancel it or not?

129
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:44,546
No.

130
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,256
Then go eat something.

131
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,721
I'm not taking that dress in again.

132
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:57,476
Why did jane get her
such an expensive gift?

133
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,979
- I didn't know they saw each other.
- Of course you didn't.

134
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,189
I forbid it.

135
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,775
I can't wait to get her out of here.

136
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,665
Is everything okay?

137
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:09,867
<i>Goodbye.</i>

138
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,360
Yeah, goodbye.

139
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:16,439
Get in here now.

140
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:19,748
I didn't know you were home.

141
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,417
I overdid it at lunch,
as did you, I heard.

142
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

143
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,840
I just wanted to make amends.
I got her a beautiful present.

144
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,819
Why the hell are you even talking
to her? You're screwing things up!

145
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,744
I'm tired of the awkwardness

146
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,283
and i'm trying to be nice.

147
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,285
I don't know what kind of world
you live in, but

148
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,464
- I am the good person here.
- You're not good

149
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,023
because you didn't listen to me
and you really upset her.

150
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,574
Everything you do is for her.

151
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:55,112
I'm yourwife.

152
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,885
And guess what. I live here
and I get to do what I want to do,

153
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,648
so stop trying to tell me
that you know better.

154
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,875
You'd better not have
locked that door.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go away!

156
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,015
Or what? You'll commit suicide?

157
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,019
Peter, what are you doing home?

158
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:25,859
I got fired.

159
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,459
What happened?

160
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,574
Lane told me kenny is

161
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,330
senior something

162
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:37,726
of something accounts and i'm not.

163
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,927
I'm account something.

164
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,908
I couldn't even hear him.

165
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,085
All I saw was his froglike
mouth flapping.

166
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,922
So did he ask you to leave?

167
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,964
No.

168
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,700
I have to ask this,

169
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,803
but did you lose your temper?

170
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,318
No, i didn't.

171
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:01,456
That's good.

172
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,423
That's very good.

173
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,773
Do you rember if he said anything
about how much they want you to stay?

174
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,734
No.

175
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,695
That's good too.
So it didn't come up.

176
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,814
Stop it with the ellery queen.

177
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,672
- I'm going to call duck.
- No, you're not.

178
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,458
They would have fired you
if they wanted to fire you.

179
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,668
You need to wait
and see how it goes.

180
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,471
He basically said I care too much
about my clients and they notice it.

181
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,273
How could that be bad?

182
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,639
You hold all the cards.

183
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,310
It's going to be fine.

184
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,574
I thought you had left.

185
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,336
I'm here.

186
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,028
I see.

187
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,300
Well, thank you.

188
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,985
I've done it before.

189
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,375
Go back to bed.

190
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,092
- Do you want anything?
- No. I'll be in in a bit.

191
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,498
It's got to be 100 in here.

192
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,204
You ask the building
for heat, you get heat.

193
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:53,165
<i>Mr. Herman on line one.</i>

194
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,176
- Can you give me a minute?
- No.

195
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,512
I'm right around the corner
at the elysee, room 531.

196
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm in the middle of something.

197
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,257
Peewee sweetheart,
it's been three weeks.

198
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,507
You can get room service.

199
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:13,560
I think they have a Monte Cristo
sandwich. You love that.

200
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:15,484
I'm having lunch
with kurt and smitty.

201
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,903
They're a couple of homos.
Tell them you have plans.

202
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:24,999
- It's kind of short notice.
- Come on, creative,

203
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,315
be creative.

204
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:34,773
I have to go to the printer.

205
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,090
I know a nooner when i hear one.

206
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:40,126
You're disgusting.

207
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:47,626
I was hoping to catch you
on your way to lunch.

208
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:48,558
Too late.

209
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:56,334
I found out yesterday
that head of accounts

210
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,193
is going to kenny and his haircut.

211
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,028
I heard.

212
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:04,163
- Can you turn that off?
- Not really.

213
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,545
- Were you consulted?
- After the fact.

214
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:18,863
What does it mean?

215
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,642
It's not good.

216
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,871
I know it's not good.

217
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,878
There's no future for me here.

218
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,090
How did you do it?
You made your job up.

219
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,459
I didn't.
I looked at other agencies,

220
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,662
saw that they had tv departments
and wondered why we didn't.

221
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,734
There's no such thing
in the accounts field.

222
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:42,043
- There's marketing.
- That's a research job.

223
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,020
- Is this official?
- Yes.

224
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:49,703
I'm afraid we can't hire
Mr. Charcot.

225
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,205
Well, at least you had the guts
to send me a memo.

226
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,481
He's far too expensive.

227
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:58,587
Salvatore Romano is gone. There is
no one in charge of the art department.

228
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,310
I haven't heard a complaint from
any of the clients.

229
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,470
Jesus! It's hotter
in here than in my office.

230
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,427
That's because you're overexcited.

231
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,966
Do you want me to walk you through
a delivery schedule?

232
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,186
<i>This is Walter Cronkite
in our newsroom and</i>

233
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,982
<i>and there has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now, on the life</i>

234
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,511
<i>of president Kennedy.</i>

235
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:22,252
<i>He was wounded in an automobile</i>

236
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,079
<i>driving from Dallas airport
into downtown Dallas</i>

237
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,073
<i>along with governor
connally of texas</i>

238
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,061
<i>They've been taken to Parkland hospital
there where their condition is as yet</i>

239
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,030
my god, how much have
you been smoking in here?

240
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,491
Sorry about that.

241
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,116
I'm, uh, glad

242
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,391
you ran over.

243
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,770
Me too.

244
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:58,813
I don't understand. I can't run
my department without an art director.

245
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,524
Do you want to call Saint John?

246
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:03,708
Bert Cooper still has
a say around here.

247
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,371
Quoi ?

248
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,321
If they wanted to fire you,
they would've fired you.

249
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:19,420
I'm gonna die at this desk,
unnoticed.

250
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,113
Do you have any idea
what I've done for this company?

251
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,215
- What are you doing?
- They shot the president.

252
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,614
What?

253
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:30,053
<i>...top of the president's
car was down</i>

254
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,780
<i>they drew their pistols,
but the damage was done.</i>

255
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:34,474
<i>The president was slumped over</i>

256
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,589
<i>in the back seat
of the car, face down.</i>

257
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:39,727
<i>Then governor Connally, after slumping
to the left for a moment,</i>

258
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,523
<i>lay on the floor of the rear seats.</i>

259
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,476
- Oh my god.
- Is he dead?

260
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,618
What the hell is going on?

261
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,858
<i>Every person listening at this moment
has flashed back</i>

262
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,149

263

<i>excuse me, chet, here is a flash from
the associated press, dateline Dallas.</i>

266
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,738
<i>Two priests who were
with president kennedy</i>

267
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,269
<i>say he is dead of bullet wounds.</i>

268
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,505
<i>There is no further confirmation,
but this is what we have</i>

269
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,612
Is he okay?

270
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,197
They just said he died.

271
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,822
<i>Who were with president kennedy
say he is dead of bullet wounds.</i>

272
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,955
<i>There is no further confirmation.
This is the only word we have</i>

273
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,308
<i>indicating the president may,
in fact, have lost his life.</i>

274
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,716
<i>It has just moved on the associated
press wires from dallas.</i>

275
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,686
<i>The two priests were called
to the hospital to administer</i>

<i>the last rites</i>

277

<i>And it is from them we get the word</i>

278
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:56,328
<i>that the president has died,
that the bullet wounds</i>

279

<i>inflicted on him as he rode
in a motorcade through downtown Dallas</i>

281
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:03,730
<i>We would remind you there
is no official confirmation</i>

<i>of this from any source as yet.</i>

283
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,407
<i>Just moments before
you brought the flash,</i>

284
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,029
<i>I had word from the hospital
that the vice president,</i>

285
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,141
<i>Lyndon Johnson, and his wife
had just left the hospital...</i>

286
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,914
Did you give me a hickey?

287
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,206
- I don't think so.
- I told you I don't like that.

288
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,836
I get questions from my mother.

289
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,273
Listen. There was

290
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:30,868
a news story that was on right
before you came in.

291
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,400
It's been distracting me.

292
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,543
You didn't seem distracted.

293
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,642
I just want to see what's going on.

294
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,353
What's going on?

295
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,073

Everything is going to be okay.

347
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:19,962
We have a new president

348
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,888
and we're all gonna be sad
for a little bit.

349
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,975
And then on monday
there's gonna be a funeral.

350
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,352
Are we going to the funeral?

351
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,748
<i>...shots rang out, but by that time
the motorcade had sped away.</i>

352
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,267
<i>...fair play for cuba,</i>

353
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:22,488
<i>a pro-castro organization,
where he had been arrested </i>

354
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,075
<i>on disturbance of the peace charges.
He denied</i>

355
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,120
<i>he was a communist, said he was
a marxist and claimed there was</i>

356
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,349
<i>quite a difference between the two.</i>

357
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,919
<i>Police in Dallas
have just announced...</i>

358
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,294
you should get ready.
It's almost 2:00.

359
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,003
Really, don?

360
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,916
<i>...gunpowder traces on both hands,</i>

361
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,435
<i>indicating he'd recently
used a rifle.</i>

362
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,225
<i>The type of weapon that killed
Mr. Kennedy yesterday.</i>

363
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,806
<i>As we told you a short time ago,
oswald has refused...</i>

364
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,434
he's 24 years old.

365
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:56,689
<i>In washington, the body
of the late president lies...</i>

366
00:21:58,631 --> 00:21:59,880
Come on, betts.

367
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:05,113
Are you sure they haven't canceled it?
In "the times" they were doing that.

368
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,593
I'm not gonna
call roger to find out.

369
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,663
If we go in and it's off,
we'll grab dinner or something.

370
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:16,857
I can't sit in front
of the tv all day.

371
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:18,983
Fine.

372
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:23,318
<i>...ailing Mr. Kennedy
stricken by a stroke two years ago--</i>

373
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,643
just stay here until Carla comes.

374
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:28,615
<i>...greatly increasingly
failing health for the last--</i>

375
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>after the terrible news</i>

376
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,160
<i>had reached us...</i>

377
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,563
Can you see bags?

378
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,478
I don't understand this.

379
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,971
And here we are...

380
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,862
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.

381
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:46,823
Nobody voted for him.

382
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,254
It felt for a second like everything
was about to change.

383
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,975
You should get
your coat and your scarf.

384
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,797
I know it's far, but I really feel
like walking.

385
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:57,583
Why are we going?

386
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,616
Because it's your boss's
daughter's wedding.

387
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:03,756
It's business, Pete, and there's
a system. You always say that.

388
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:07,965
It's one thing to go to this wedding
and act like I don't hate them.

389
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,597
It's another thing to go and act
like the President hasn't been murdered.

390
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:15,393
Maybe they'll cancel it,
but we have to show.

391
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:29,852
- Have you been drinking?
- The whole country's drinking,

392
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:33,244
and not to celebrate some
spoiled brat's wedding.

393
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:37,224
<i>We are mourning together
with his widow...</i>

394
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,899
They'll never cancel.

395
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,620
You know why?

396
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:43,963
Because they're happy.

397
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,876
You should've heard some of the things
people said yesterday.

398
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,468
Like what? What did they say?

399
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:54,125
"The man made a lot of enemies,"
things like that.

400
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:55,955
That's awful.

401
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,660
I don't care what your politics are,
this is America.

402
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,646
You don't just shoot the President.

403
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,772
Chet Huntley was talking about
Jackie and those kids,

404
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:09,623
how she just lost that baby,

405
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,548
and Harry Crane was looking at
his paperwork,

406
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:16,771
calculating how many commercials
weren't going to be aired.

407
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:19,921
I'm not going.

408
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:23,484
You can go and say I'm sick
if you think it's that important.

409
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:27,307
<i>... Demonstrates the internal threat
that can never be underestimated.</i>

410
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,875
No, you're right.

411
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,335
<i>Our sympathy
for the Kennedy family is no less </i>

412
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,031
<i>that it is for the millions of people
who have sustained equal losses </i>

413
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,906
<i>in the fight for freedom.</i>

414
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:46,484
I got a call from Leona, the girl I used
to work with at the phone company.

415
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:50,320
My friend Francine called me.
Don couldn't get through.

416
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,972
The system was
completely overloaded.

417
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:55,791
It's annoying that people think
the operators were watching tv.

418
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,116
They were as frustrated as anyone.

419
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,957
The maitre d' has reorganized
the seating.

420
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,626
If you are at an even-numbered table,
take these first six.

421
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:08,397
If you are at an odd-numbered table,
the left side of the room.

422
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:10,072
Maestro, do you mind?

423
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:11,858
Thank you.

424
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:15,179
Look, everybody, grab your plate
and come on up to the front here,

425
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,432
sit wherever you feel like.

426
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,408
And please feel free to have
the prime rib and the fillet of sole.

427
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,114
Help yourself.

428
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,439
I mean that. There are no waiters.

429
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,312
Three months after Roosevelt died,
we bombed Hiroshima.

430
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:33,233
That's how we got over it.

431
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:36,599
I say we hang Lee Oswald
and then we take care of Texas...

432
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:38,244
Hell, the whole south.

433
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:42,915
What did everyone
think of the sweetbreads?

434
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,294
You were right, mommy. Okay?

435
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,608
Problem solved.

436
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:52,612
Hardly.

437
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:55,237
They just told me
the cake's not coming.

438
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:56,935
Shit.

439
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:29,504
I have to say on some level
Harry has a point.

440
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,048
I think he wanted attention.

441
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,133
He obviously didn't fit in.

442
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:35,746
Congratulations.

443
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:39,452
You are so beautiful,
like Natalie Wood or something.

444
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,565
Daddy, I really wish you could've gotten
to see the ceremony.

445
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,854
It's okay. We understand.
We're honored you're here.

446
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:50,783
- I heard the church was packed.
- Those weren't our guests.

447
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,597
Have a seat.

448
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,069
Just...

449
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:57,345
sit anywhere.

450
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,291
I'm so happy for you.

451
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:08,006
<i>I would like some
legal representation,</i>

452
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,631
<i>but these police officers
have not allowed me to have any.</i>

453
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,631
<i>I don't know what this is all about.</i>

454
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,330
<i>- Did you kill the President?
- No, sir, I didn't.</i>

455
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,305
How would you know that's
what a monster looks like?

456
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,850
<i>Naturally, if I work in that building,
yes, sir.</i>

457
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,304
- Did you see "The Times"?
- He lived in Russia.

458
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,772
- I thought he just visited.
- Would you visit?

459
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:32,825
<i>I'm just a patsy.</i>

460
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,990
There you are.
What are you doing here?

461
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,270
They're about to interview Oswald.

462
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:42,377
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.

463
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,894
<i>Has the gentleman been identified?</i>

464
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,652
I need you out there.
I'm about to give my toast.

465
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,412
I've heard your toast
a million times.

466
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,943
The President is dead.

467
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:58,540
And I'll tell you something else
our table has no one at it.

468
00:27:58,665 --> 00:28:00,465
I consolidated the tables.

469
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,839
Would you keep an eye on her?

470
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,224
Absolutely.

471
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,029
We'd better get back in there.

472
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:24,057
This toast is going to be much shorter
than it was supposed to be.

473
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:26,536
Obviously,
we're all in a different mood.

474
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,361
Can someone get my
wife out of the kitchen?

475
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:33,150
I have something very nice
to say about her.

476
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,975
But while we're alone...

477
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:39,133
...I want to say something
nice about my ex-wife.

478
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:43,367
You're a lioness.

479
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,724
And thank you for resisting
the urge to eat your cub.

480
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:52,065
This could've been an awful day,

481
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:54,029
but here we are...

482
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,563
Not watching tv

483
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,170
but, together,
watching the two of you.

484
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,570
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.

485
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:09,000
The adults, we all wanted to be
strong for you,

486
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:12,458
but your spirit your love, your hope

487
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,226
is giving us strength.

488
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,235
And I promise you now if you can
make it through a day like today,

489
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,715
marriage is a cakewalk.

490
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:22,823
To many years of happiness.

491
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:23,948
Cheers.

492
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,858
We invite the father of the bride and
the bride to share the dance floor.

493
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,333
Sorry about that.

494
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,235
Now if there are any other fathers
and daughters...

495
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:42,387
You know what?
Everyone, please, join them.

496
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,120
Do you want to dance?

497
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:53,833
I don't know.

498
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,703
Want me to teach him how to dance?

499
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:10,527
He's a great dancer.

500
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,447
She's happy.

501
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:21,360
That's because she doesn't know
his net worth just dropped by half.

502
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:23,106
Stop it, daddy.

503
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,048
Everything's gonna be fine.

504
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,707
How do you know that?

505
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:04,778
You'll see.

506
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,642
Why do you keep
looking at that woman?

507
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:22,866
What are you talking about?

508
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,556
- Are you ready?
- Did jennifer fall in?

509
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:53,990
She'll be right out.

510
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,262
See you tuesday.

511
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,421
He was so handsome,

512
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,747
and now i'll never
get to vote for him.

513
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,240
You want me
to cut you out of that dress?

514
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,220
I'm making a phone call.

515
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:02,103
Hello.

516
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,632
So what's new?

517
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,068
It's incredible, isn't it?

518
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,070
Yes.

519
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:12,615
Margaret got married today.

520
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:14,997
That's right. I forgot.

521
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,118
Poor thing.

522
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:22,833
I wish you could've seen it.
Oh my god, what a disaster.

523
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:24,275
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,488
Yeah, she pulled through.
They pulled through.

525
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:28,963
I pulled through.

526
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,346
I can't believe how
quiet it is out there.

527
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,001
Not everywhere.

528
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,392
Greg just called. He's working
the night shift at the E.R.

529
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,354
<i>People are still getting sick.</i>

530
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,434
Car accidents are happening.

531
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:48,272
Babies are are being born.

532
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,331
Well, i'm glad he's not home.

533
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,044
I had to talk to you.

534
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,079
Nobody else is saying
the right thing about this.

535
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,456
My god, you're really upset.

536
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,184
What's that about?

537
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:09,421
Because there's nothing
funny about this.

538
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Well...

539
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,993
- Hang in there, red.
- You too.

540
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:25,046
Bye-Bye.

541
00:34:25,614 --> 00:34:27,084
<i>Goodbye.</i>

542
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:38,224
<i>Put him on a standby of
indeterminate length, will you?</i>

543
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,800
<i>Let me have it.
I want it.</i>

544
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:45,876
<i>Being led out by Captain Fritz.</i>

545
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:50,656
<i>Clearers are pushing.
There is Lee Oswald.</i>

546
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,263
<i>He's been shot.</i>

547
00:34:54,388 --> 00:34:56,938
- Oh my god. Oh my god.
- What happened?

548
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,810
They shot him.

549
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,808
The police were walking him through
the building and some man shot him.

550
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:03,892
What?

551
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,986
<i> Detectives have their guns drawn.</i>

552
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,563
What is going on?!

553
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:12,138
<i>There is no question about it.
Oswald has been shot.</i>

554
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,275
Don, please leave me alone.

555
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:19,491
What happened?

556
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,000
Nothing.

557
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:29,746
Go upstairs.

558
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:38,208
<i>The family, incidentally,
asked that there be no flowers</i>

559
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,092
<i>But there nevertheless
have been flowers.</i>

560
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:43,109
<i>People either didn't hear
or chose to ignore it.</i>

561
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,738
<i>And one room or two rooms
in the white house</i>

562
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:48,729
<i>have had to be set aside to...</i>

563
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,467
<i>To host.</i>

564
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:58,864
I'm going out.

565
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,557
- Where?
- For a drive.

566
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:09,115
Let me drive.
I'll get the kids. We'll all

567
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,502
go somewhere.
That's a good idea.

568
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:13,054
No.

569
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,771
I need to clear my head.

570
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,892
I'm so glad you could see me.

571
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:50,958
Where does your husband
think you are?

572
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,466
I don't care.

573
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:57,419
He's been lying to me for years.
I couldn't be in that house.

574
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,135
Then I saw you yesterday.

575
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:05,095
I didn't know
you were going to be there.

576
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,182
I hoped you would be there.

577
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,740
Derby day...

578
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:13,813
It seems like 100 years ago.

579
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,411
And then this morning,
seeing that man shot to death...

580
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,199
what is going on?

581
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:26,291
It will be okay.

582
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,496
We've lost a lot of presidents
and we're still standing.

583
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,070
I wish I could believe you.

584
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,626
I can't believe anything right now.

585
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:39,446
Have you thought that
there are other ways to live?

586
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:45,473
Listen. I'm not in love with
the tragedy of this thing.

587
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:48,448
It's not "Romeo and juliet."

588
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,099
I want it to happen.

589
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,477
I have three children.

590
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:57,012
I'll know more when the primaries
start to shake out in spring,

591
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,589
But I can leave the campaign
right now.

592
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,360
I don't want you to do that.

593
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,455
You don't have to answer me now...

594
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,980
But I want to marry you.

595
00:38:20,015 --> 00:38:21,505
I don't know what to say.

596
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,636
You don't have to say anything.
I told you.

597
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,453
But if you search your heart,

598
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:28,878
You'll know that

599
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,438
I can make you happy.

600
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:52,204
I should go.

601
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:57,841
I wish I could take you
to the movies right now,

602
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,717
Some theater that's playing
your favorite movie.

603
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,412
"Singing in the rain."

604
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:08,723
Well,

605
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,223
just think about that.

606
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,551
<i>...it was made possible
by a special equipment,</i>

607
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,230
<i>it will move at one fourth speed,</i>

608
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,695
<i>so we would like
to show you in slow motion</i>

609
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,311
<i>the shooting
of Lee Harvey Oswald now.</i>

610
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,641
They just stood there.

611
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:50,570
No security for the most
wanted man in America.

612
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,234
He didn't even have a trial.

613
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,266
Just throw him over the mob.

614
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,526
<i>You can see the two detectives,</i>

615
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,901
<i>one in a light suit, one in a dark,</i>

616
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:01,917
<i>bringing Oswald out.</i>

617
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:05,392
<i>The camera changes its length,
for a close up of Oswald.</i>

618
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:08,600
<i>The shot has been fired,
you cannot hear it</i>

619
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,961
<i>in this version of the tape.
Oswald falls</i>

620
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:15,090
<i>and the man with the hat moves in on him
and he's grabbed by the man in light.</i>

621
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:19,502
- Do not go in to work tomorrow.
- No, of course not.

622
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,481
It's a national day of mourning.

623
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,090
You're going to go on Tuesday.

624
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:27,811
That's another happy thought.

625
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,280
Those people don't care about you.

626
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:34,402
And honestly, what's the difference?

627
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:36,027
What are you saying?

628
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:39,422
You did everything
they asked you to do,  but

629
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:41,447
You don't owe them anything.

630
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,308
You should start
gathering your clients.

631
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,733
They'll follow you wherever you go.

632
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:02,453
<i>The only other president buried there
is William Howard Taft.</i>

633
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:05,377
<i>Though of course, there are many
other heroes of perhaps</i>

634
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:06,880
<i>lesser renown.</i>

635
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:17,724
Francine has the kids.

636
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,498
I don't know where to begin.

637
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:25,482
What?

638
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,088
I want...

639
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:32,377
To scream at you.

640
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:34,905
For ruining all of this.

641
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:39,085
But...

642
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,488
Then you try to fix it and...

643
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:43,488
There's no point.

644
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,837
There's no point, Don.

645
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:54,145
You're very upset, I understand.

646
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:58,587
I know it's painful.

647
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,280
But it's going to pass.

648
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,050
I don't love you.

649
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:07,205
Betts, don't.

650
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:11,181
- You're distraught.
- It's true.

651
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:14,718
But I don't love you anymore.

652
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:18,683
I know that.

653
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:19,954
Stop it.

654
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:22,016
I kissed you yesterday.

655
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:25,706
And I didn't feel a thing.

656
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:34,405
You'll feel better tomorrow.

657
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:35,784
You'll see.

658
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,722
You can't even hear me right now.

659
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,816
You're right.

660
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:01,901
Morning.

661
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:03,890
- Morning, daddy.
- Morning.

662
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:10,675
Where are you going?

663
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,732
I have to go to work, I'm sorry.

664
00:44:13,044 --> 00:44:14,255
It's cold outside.

665
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:15,671
I'm fine.

666
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:55,578
What are you doing here?

667
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:58,838
I don't know. Aqua Net.

668
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,500
It doesn't shoot till after
Thanksgiving.

669
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:13,338
We'll be ok.

670
00:45:22,495 --> 00:45:23,845
What do you have?

671
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,597
What are you doing here?

672
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,529
The bars are closed.

673
00:45:29,908 --> 00:45:33,332
My roommate invited over half
the building so they can watch TV

674
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:35,456
and write condolence letters
to Jackie.

675
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:40,241
Then I went to my sister's
and my mother was crying...

676
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:41,866
and praying so hard.

677
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:45,742
There wasn't room for anyone else
to feel anything.

678
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:52,241
The funeral has already started.

679
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:56,406
I was gonna watch it in Cooper's office.
Is it ok?

680
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:06,805
Are you coming?
