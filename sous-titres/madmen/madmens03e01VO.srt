1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,876
Don't push *** that window.

<i>Last season on Mad Men.</i>

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,839
He's leaving me for a secretary.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,701
I want you to be my wife.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,412
You've an office.
I'm the Head of the Tv.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,197
Damn it Don.
I know you having an affair.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,808
- It's okay.
- *** No.

8
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,221
It's man

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,287
Don't come home. I don't care
what you do. I just ** here.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,725
If I bring you every accounts
of Sterling Cooper.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,282
I ruined everything.

12
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:35,284
I had your baby.

13
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,663
- And I gave it away.
- Why you don't tell me that?

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,457
You bought us.
We dont't expect autonomy.

15
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:42,892
I'm pregnant.

00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:18,091
Season 3 Episode 1
<i>Out of Town</i>

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,060
Do you know how hard I've prayed?

19
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,147
Why does he make me suffer?

20
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,779
God will give you a child.

21
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:08,851
Let me see her.

22
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,218
So you killed another one.

23
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,474
Because you had nothing
to do with this.

24
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,022
Maybe you ought to stay off her
once in a while.

25
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,536
Get out, you witch!

26
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,413
I've got 85,

27
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,659
and my boots are off.

28
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,692
You don't have a sheep.

29
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,003
I'll get one,

30
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:46,786
but that'll be another quarter

31
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,150
and this is all I have.

32
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,838
Go wash yourself.

33
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,153
You get me in trouble

34
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:02,896
I'm gonna cut your dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

35
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,716
I'm gonna cut his dick off...

36
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:12,711
I'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

37
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,553
What was that, sweetheart?

38
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,869
I'm cold.

39
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:27,147
Do you want to hold him?

40
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:31,584
I'm gonna cut his dick off
and boil it in hog fat.

41
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:52,959
It's midnight.

42
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:54,747
What do you want?

43
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,695
I told you God would give
you a child.

44
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,958
Whose is it?

45
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,579
Is your husband home?

46
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,827
God is giving you a child.

47
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,924
His name is Dick,

48
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,970
after a wish his mother
should've lived to see.

49
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,381
Come on. Drink this.

50
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:13,157
You know, there's no point
in both of us not sleeping.

51
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,067
She wakes up at night
when I drop off.

52
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,787
Are you so sure it's a girl?

53
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:24,613
Well, believe me,
she knows what she wants.

54
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:29,898
I packed your valise.

55
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,165
- I could have done that.
- Well, you'll get a chance...

56
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,840
The clasp was broken.

57
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:40,964
Carla said she saw Sally
hitting it with a hammer.

58
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,267
She's taken to your tools
like a little lesbian.

59
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,320
Am I ever going to sleep again?

60
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:08,098
At least you don't look tired.

61
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,551
I just want everything
to be perfect.

62
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:15,377
I want her to come
into our home at its best.

63
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,263
Close your eyes.

64
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:30,216
You're on a warm sandy beach...

65
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,820
Because I'm a whale.

66
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,565
You're on a warm

67
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,688
sandy beach.

68
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,641
You can smell the faint scent
of coconut oil.

69
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,703
And as you slide your hands,

70
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,767
you feel that cold patch of sand
underneath the shadow

71
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,367
of your deck chair.

72
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,140
You're good at this.

73
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:16,328
Hello?

74
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,815
Yes, but on occasion,

75
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,916
you have to resign yourself
to sleeping where you are.

76
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,648
That's why they sell
subway tokens, silly.

77
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,016
You look lovely today.

78
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:32,579
Thank you.

79
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,078
Are you here to see me?

80
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,828
No, I'm just verifying
some information.

81
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,829
Thank you, lola.

82
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:46,666
He just always stops
by concerning the strangest things.

83
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:50,647
- Yesterday it was my engagement ring.
- Enough, Lola.

84
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,596
You know there's something
about the way he talks.

85
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,099
I could listen to him
read the phone book.

86
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,769
When he gets to "s"

87
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,185
I need Howard Sullivan
at Lever Brothers.

88
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,393
Remarkable.

89
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,830
I picked it for its sensuality,

90
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:12,831
but it also in some way

91
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,582
reminds me of our business.

92
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,330
Who is the man who imagined
her ecstasy?

93
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
Who indeed?

94
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,267
We were just talking about you.

95
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,553
Burt's on his way. Where's Roger?

96
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:36,139
Probably taking another
Grecian treasure out of its crate.

97
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,705
I apologize for Baltimore.

98
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,393
It has to be done.

99
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,708
It's a sales call.
Isn't there more I can do here?

100
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,200
It's not a sales call.

101
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,475
You're the face of our business.

102
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,643
They need someone they can trust.

103
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:51,767
London fog...

104
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,452
How ludicrous.

105
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,534
Really? I have one.

106
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,267
- So do I.
- No, of course...

107
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,205
It's just the name.

108
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:03,205
There is no fog in London.

109
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,142
There is no London fog.

110
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,144
- Are you sure about that?
- Quite.

111
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:09,393
Never was.

112
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:12,233
It was the coal dust
from the industrial era...

113
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,455
Charles Dickens and whatnot.

114
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,833
<i>Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson is
here to see you.</i>

115
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:22,957
- Come on in, Burt.
- Hey, Don.

116
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:24,853
Bert, Lane.

117
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,407
We need you to have a seat, Burt.

118
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,279
You got a blindfold too?

119
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,631
This isn't easy.

120
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,249
It really isn't.

121
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,455
Oh God.

122
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:51,209
I really thought I'd made it.

123
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:55,593
I know it's unkind,
but it's generous and it's fair.

124
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,262
Why the hell did you wait so long?

125
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:04,015
It was brought to our attention
that your wife was undergoing radiation.

126
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,331
We thought it decent to wait.

127
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,332
That was decent.

128
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,209
Sorry I'm late.

129
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,021
Did I miss anything?

130
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,474
Sad meeting.

131
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,536
Sorry about that.

132
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,272
It wasn't easy.

133
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:26,638
We'll see how you do
without my Rolodex.

134
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:29,401
- We're going to take that risk.
- You make me sick.

135
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,976
You're the dying empire.

136
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
- We're the future.
- Burt, control yourself.

137
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,634
I'm the Head of Accounts, damn it!

138
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,447
I'm sure we'll regret it.

139
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,584
I'm serious.

140
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:45,537
See you on the bread lines, fellas.

141
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,747
Is that the last of it?

142
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:55,136
Because I don't like how much
I'm getting to used to these.

143
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,111
I don't know anything
you don't know.

144
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,272
You understand there's no point ever
in making over $40,000

145
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,215
when you'll be taxed 69%?

146
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,082
You're working for them.
And God forbid you really make it...

147
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,750
- Everything over 70 grand is 81%.
- Even if you're married?

148
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,211
Fellow comrades in mediocrity,

149
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,132
I want you to listen
very carefully.

150
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,119
You can all go straight to hell.

151
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,169
I heard he's going
in-house at Nabisco.

152
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,696
- You're sure it's not starting again?
- Mr. Campbell's office.

153
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,197
- What?
- I'll let him know.

154
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,883
- The firings.
- Mr. Campbell,

155
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,858
Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

156
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,719
I'm at lunch.

157
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:45,328
I'll bring you a doggy bag.

158
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,695
Holy crap.

159
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:54,196
You couldn't have pulled me
aside to say that?

160
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:55,796
I'm sure it's nothing.

161
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,795
How the hell am I supposed
to live like this?

162
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,890
Drop dead, you limey vulture!

163
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,070
Son of a bitch!

164
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:12,070
I assume you can continue
handling this beautifully

165
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:14,608
while I dispense psychotherapy
to the girls in the pool.

166
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,820
You americans don't know
how to handle your emotions.

167
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,447
- It's unbecoming.
- His wife is sick,

168
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:23,484
and if you had talked to his girl,
she would've informed him.

169
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,507
So he would've had a long walk
to Mr. Cooper's?

170
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:29,382
And if you had talked to me,
I would have been waiting with his coat

171
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,915
and his Rolodex.

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,777
While we're
on the topic of decorum,

173
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,508
I'd like to speak to you about the way
I'm being addressed.

174
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:37,820
Could you be more specific?

175
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,409
The switchboard. I'm not John.

176
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,035
I'm Mr. Hooker.

177
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,246
That's the way they've been taught
to address the secretaries.

178
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,321
As I've explained,
in Great Britain...

179
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:51,667
A truck is a lorry,
and an elevator is a lift.

180
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,473
I've got it, mr. Hooker.

181
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,083
Despite your title,
you are not a secretary.

182
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm Mr. Pryce's right arm.

183
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:00,821
I'm not his typist.

184
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,330
Of course.

185
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:08,749
I assume you will let him know when
Mr. Peterson has left the building.

186
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,172
- How are we today?
- Very well, thank you.

187
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:24,468
Burt Peterson's left the agency.

188
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,187
- Really?
- Yes.

189
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,259
I can't speak for everyone here,

190
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,269
but I like you.

191
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:35,688
And I like you.

192
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,035
But you don't know me.

193
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,674
But I will make that effort if given
the opportunity.

194
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,197
Pardon?

195
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,013
I apologize that I haven't been
more welcoming, socially.

196
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,745
It seemed until
your wife arrived...

197
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,750
I didn't want to make it awkward
with a threesome.

198
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,516
Although, now that I think of it perhaps
your being alone is all the more reason

199
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,331
- I should've offered my hospitality.
- Do have a seat.

200
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,136
Why?

201
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,130
Is something wrong?

202
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,512
I don't know. You just removed the head
of my department and now

203
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,128
you're offering me a chair.

204
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,995
How cruel of me.

205
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:16,136
I wanted to inform you
that you're now Head of Accounts.

206
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:21,488
- Excuse me?
- It seemed like the right thing to do,

207
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,904
despite your lack of hospitality.

208
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,936
The specifics are pending,
as is the announcement.

209
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,145
Is this really happening?

210
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,204
I need to know it's certain.

211
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,760
Oh yes, but...

212
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,519
Wonderful.

213
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,199
Thank you.

214
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,325
Splendid.

215
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:58,013
Well, it turns out
things are splendid.

216
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:02,603
- That's good.
- Could you get my wife on the phone?

217
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,604
<i>I have Mrs. Campbell for you.</i>

218
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,594
- <i>How are you sweetheart?</i>
- What are you doing?

219
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,010
I told you this morning

220
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:34,558
I'm having luncheon with the docents'
committee from the met.

221
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,477
- How are they?
- Since when do you care?

222
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,981
Since I was made Head of Accounts.

223
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,234
Oh my goodness.

224
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,821
- That's wonderful!
- <i> It really is.</i>

225
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,626
I knew it would happen
one day for real.

226
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,032
I love the sound
of your voice right now.

227
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:54,951
That's because I'm already drunk.

228
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:56,076
Good for you.

229
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,886
Just one more minute.
My husband got some good news.

230
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,335
Make a reservation.

231
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:03,988
<i>Surprise me.</i>

232
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,702
I should call my mother.

233
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,888
Don't go to the well.
There's no water there.

234
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,511
I don't even know
if I'm getting a raise.

235
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,059
I didn't ask. I forgot.

236
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,131
That's very noble. You see?

237
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,229
One doesn't need money
to be fulfilled.

238
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,073
Don't let those ladies
from the met hear you say that.

239
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,568
I should go.

240
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,076
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

241
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,290
I heard you wanted to see me,
so I grabbed a sandwich.

242
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,649
What can I do for you?

243
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,170
Mr. Peterson's left the agency.

244
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:48,507
If that's your news,
I think you've been scooped.

245
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,136
So you've heard?

246
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,345
Let's just say he did not
"go gentle into that good night."

247
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,371
So you're probably wondering
where that leaves you.

248
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,065
Should I be worried?

249
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,541
No, I should say not.

250
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:05,690
We're making you Head of Accounts.

251
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:08,745
Spectacular.

252
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,077
Thanks a lot.

253
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:14,927
We're charting the course
of transition right now.

254
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,285
There are many details to come.

255
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:22,666
I wouldn't be much of an account man if
I didn't ask what it pays.

256
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,119
I wouldn't be much
of a financial officer

257
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
if I wasn't prepared
to disappoint you.

258
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,296
It's 21,

259
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:32,342
but we'll reevaluate this year.

260
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:36,182
Ken, this is not for broadcast.

261
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,589
There'll be a formal announcement.

262
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,871
Great.

263
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,037
Can you believe this?

264
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,918
What's the world coming to?

265
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,375
That is a big bottle.

266
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,460
That's not a bottle.
That's his date.

267
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,786
"My oh my,
what a big bottle you have."

268
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,175
"I'm sorry, honey, but I'm taken."

269
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:16,344
"I just pawned my typewriter
so we could be together all weekend."

270
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,794
The captain's about to announce
our descent into friendship.

271
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:22,642
- Quick refill?
- I don't know.

272
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,222
Don't you need something
to run the plane?

273
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,897
And what about you, mr. Hofstadt?

274
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:29,669
Excuse me?

275
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:31,918
I took a look at your luggage.

276
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:33,403
You're William Hofstadt?

277
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,990
Bill. Call me bill.

278
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:38,700
And this is my associate,

279
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,762
mr. Fleischmann.

280
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,750
Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?

281
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,734
- Baltimore.
- Well, how about that?

282
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,734
We're heading
to hausner's for dinner.

283
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,057
You should've been in line two hours ago
if you want to eat by 8:00.

284
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:58,302
Lorelei has made some inroads
with the maitre d'.

285
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:01,669
We have to check in and we have
an early meeting.

286
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:04,183
- Where are you staying?
- The Belvedere.

287
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,394
Well, this is too much. Us too.

288
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,024
7:30.

289
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:14,791
It'll be a hoot and a half.

290
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:19,150
Now you have to take
someone else's luggage...

291
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,625
Bill Hoffman's.

292
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:22,899
Hofstadt...

293
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:24,912
My brother-in-law.

294
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:28,439
He borrowed a suitcase
to go to Puerto Rico,

295
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:31,650
but he never tires of putting his name
on other people's things.

296
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,798
I've flown a few times,

297
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:37,801
but I've never actually seen
a stewardess that game.

298
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:39,964
Really?

299
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,056
Any plans tonight?

300
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,455
All I know is
to avoid grand central.

301
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,780
I heard Burt Peterson's
still at the bar.

302
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,829
Now now.

303
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,080
It had to happen, I guess.

304
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,573
He didn't put up much of a fight...

305
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,530
Not counting today, I mean.

306
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,344
It's a tough job.

307
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:08,694
No doubt about that.

308
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,570
I just want to let you know

309
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,318
I've always been
a big fan of your work

310
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,657
and I've been very vocal about it.

311
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,993
I appreciate that.

312
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,094
Maybe now things will
finally settle down.

313
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,145
That's true.

314
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:50,038
Listen, I just want to say

315
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,018
that through all of this

316
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,394
I know that you were
there reminding me that

317
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,670
I can do this job.

318
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,320
Well, you're welcome.

319
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,855
I guess it's
because I think you can.

320
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,768
- Have a good night.
- You too.

321
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:12,896
And my friend and I were listening
to some radio program

322
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,648
and we had
this huge bag of fritos...

323
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,776
We're not allowed in uniform...

324
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,654
So at some point
my friend stops eating,

325
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,042
but I can't.

326
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,849
And I ate all
of them and I got so...

327
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,730
It was quite unladylike.

328
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:36,457
And I still can't eat
them to today.

329
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:38,520
Too much of a good thing.

330
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:39,630
It happens.

331
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,021
I think accounting
sounds fascinating...

332
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:44,584
Going through other people's
bank accounts.

333
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,969
It sounds sexy.

334
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,055
Jesus, Lorelei,

335
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,945
how deep did you have to dig
to come up with that?

336
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,751
Why would you insult
a man's profession?

337
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,018
No, it's okay.

338
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:00,025
I don't usually tell
people I'm an accountant.

339
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:01,985
Listen,

340
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:06,460
I didn't mean
to insult your profession.

341
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,076
Don't sweat it.

342
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,332
Of course, you do know there are
different kinds of accountants.

343
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:15,457
Are there?

344
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:18,669
Tell 'em what we do.

345
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,657
I don't know, Bill.

346
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:26,468
I'm gonna have to
swear you all to secrecy.

347
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,957
You can't guarantee that.

348
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:32,585
You're right.

349
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:38,446
Well, someone just brought everything
to a screeching halt.

350
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:39,856
We'll be good.

351
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:48,950
You ever heard of James Hoffa?

352
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:51,694
You know, I don't just throw
away newspapers every day.

353
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:53,169
I also read them.

354
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,375
There is a lot of money missing.

355
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,871
And they don't really
keep receipts.

356
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,185
So you're a couple of G-men?

357
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,434
No, we're accountants.

358
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:14,147
Isn't the service exquisite?

359
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,943
I'm based in New York.
I'd always rather be there,

360
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,733
but it's my job to be out of town.

361
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:25,688
I don't know.

362
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,194
I keep going to a lot of places
and ending up somewhere

363
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,669
I've already been.

364
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:38,333
How about a nightcap?

365
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,293
I don't know.

366
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,463
Your face is red.

367
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,003
Order for us.

368
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,661
Felt self-conscious there
for a moment.

369
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,498
We're the only ones
without a uniform.

370
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,145
- Good night, Bill.

371
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,508
It's been swelly.

372
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,109
Well, this is me.

373
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:45,367
Let me see if it's different
than my floor.

374
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,675
What are we doing?

375
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,349
I don't know.

376
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,677
I'm engaged.

377
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:41,273
On the other hand...

378
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,168
You might be my last chance.

379
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,480
I've been married a long time.

380
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:54,552
You get plenty of chances.

381
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:07,297
It's my birthday.

382
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,636
Really?

383
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:13,602
Is it?

384
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:16,823
It really is.

385
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,185
Let me see your driver's license.

386
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,999
That's not gonna help.

387
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,617
Happy birthday.

388
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,013
Hello.

389
00:27:13,818 --> 00:27:15,949
My air conditioner does not work.

390
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:17,948
It is stagnant in here.

391
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,961
Take your hand out.
I can't breathe.

392
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:30,074
Stand up.

393
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:36,169
Lorelei thinks you look
like ty power.

394
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,674
You remember him?

395
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,949
Go on.

396
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,188
And while you're distracted,
I'm gonna take off my shoes.

397
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,576
Is that okay?

398
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,561
Your turn.

399
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Not yet.

400
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,090
Do you like?

401
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,689
Everyone's always asking me
if I was a model,

402
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:43,715
but I wasn't.

403
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,590
The one I have
at home is different.

404
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:53,540
I hope I didn't break it.

405
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,249
No, it's fine. Just a minute.

406
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:02,968
Thank you.

407
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,491
Airplane.

408
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:01,512
Oh, God.

409
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,466
Oh, Jesus.

410
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,033
- Whats that?
- Fire alarm.

411
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,827
Come on, let's go.

412
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,882
Come on. Forget your shoes.
Let's go. Come on.

413
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,470
Come on.

414
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,717
- Do you have
another cigarette?

415
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,683
Everything's okay, folks!

416
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:55,894
- Morning.
- Morning.

417
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,042
You ever get nervous wearing
that on the subway?

418
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,139
I don't ride the subway.

419
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,796
I do worry about
being followed, though.

420
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:08,383
I think lola takes
a horse and buggy.

421
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,357
She's never on time.

422
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:12,544
I'm not at work yet.

423
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,737
I don't want to sit
in my office and listen

424
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,724
to someone talk about
their water retention.

425
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:19,227
Peggy, brides are
very self-conscious.

426
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,659
If she's so worried
about getting married,

427
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:25,317
then why is she shamelessly flirting
with Moneypenny all the time?

428
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,643
Don't call him that. He hates that.

429
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,654
Are you defending him?

430
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:33,409
He's repellant. He reminds me
of a doorman.

431
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:36,744
And the typing she does for him?

432
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:40,409
God, I'm so glad I'm gonna be out
of here soon.

433
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:43,909
- That's very comforting, Joan.
- There's nothing I can do.

434
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:49,246
Congratulations.

435
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:51,218
Thank you.

436
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,596
Mr. Pryce just called. There's a meeting
for the Heads of Accounts immediately.

437
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:56,394
Excuse me?

438
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,601
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting for you
and Mr. Cosgrove.

439
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,652
What are you talking about?

440
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,444
Whatever the circumstances,
it's nice to see you.

441
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,269
I'm just here to show you the continuity
of our service.

442
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:15,658
With or without Burt Peterson,
you are on our mind.

443
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,253
- I apologize.
- Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.

444
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:29,456
I don't know how, but I left my plane
ticket at the hotel.

445
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:32,258
He's the guy with the marker
who always does what I say.

446
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,947
- Words, pictures.
- Sal, this is Howard.

447
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:37,207
Pleasure.

448
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:40,122
I don't remember...

449
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,517
Do you have a family?

450
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,832
Not yet. I have a wife.

451
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:48,483
Howard is my son. He's gonna be part
of this from now on,

452
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,994
starting with taking
you two gentlemen on a tour.

453
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:55,522
That's it?

454
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,088
You're not gonna say anything?

455
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:02,872
My father is extremely concerned
about the business right now.

456
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,398
Well, is it about our work?

457
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:08,582
We don't want to take credit
for everything,

458
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:10,708
but two of every three
raincoats sold last year

459
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,882
had "london fog" stitched
on the inside pocket.

460
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,536
Dad is worried that everyone

461
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,025
who is ever going to buy a raincoat
already has one.

462
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,001
Because a business has
to get bigger every year.

463
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,598
That's capitalism.

464
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,411
Well, our worst fears
lie in anticipation.

465
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:31,271
That's not me, that's Balzac.

466
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:32,896
Balzac, huh?

467
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:35,023
You are not Burt Peterson.

468
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:38,345
I've been investigating
umbrellas, bags, hats.

469
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,277
There are companies
that all they do is make hats.

470
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,337
London fog is a 40-year-old brand

471
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,823
that sounds like
it's existed forever.

472
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,522
You have established,
with our help,

473
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:51,841
that it means
one thing... raincoats.

474
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:55,273
New products aside,
there will be fat years

475
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,348
and there will be lean years,

476
00:34:57,648 --> 00:34:59,298
but it is going to rain.

477
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:04,712
That's true.

478
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:09,796
Let's see if we can
find you some earplugs.

479
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:38,115
And now for Mr. Campbell.

480
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,775
- Why does he have Utz?
- Some of this was done

481
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,679
based on accounts, some of this
was done based on relationships.

482
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:03,093
You figure out
what happened with Utz.

483
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:05,370
So you decided all of this?

484
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,617
42 of every dollar at this agency
is spent in the television department.

485
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:11,217
But no, we did.

486
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:16,256
- What are these os for?
- Olson.

487
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,050
- She's all over the place.
- You know that's not true.

488
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,528
You're each taking
half the company.

489
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:26,416
Of course it's possible someone could
distinguish themselves.

490
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,176
Would be easier that way.

491
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,053
Can you believe this?

492
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,571
If you're upset, you seem
to be hiding it.

493
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,484
I'm excited. I mean.

494
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:47,427
I feel badly about Burt Peterson...

495
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,403
Three kids, wife with cancer.

496
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,999
But you greased up the chute
and shoved him down it.

497
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:55,378
What could possibly be the matter?

498
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,256
Why did you even accept this?
You have no interest in this.

499
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,467
Why wouldn't I want this?

500
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,009
Because you're no good.

501
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:05,427
They want us to hate each other.

502
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:07,598
I refuse to participate in that.

503
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:09,868
Very nice.

504
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,396
Very very nice.

505
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:16,441
Look at you... Never break a sweat.
You're right.

506
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,152
I should just lay down, and we should
run together, holding hands.

507
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:37,991
What time is it?

508
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
1:15.

509
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,551
We should be back
in the office by 3:00.

510
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:45,975
We're going back to the office?

511
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:57,553
I'm going to ask you something,

512
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:59,818
and I want you to be completely
honest with me.

513
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:08,457
London fog...

514
00:38:12,854 --> 00:38:14,290
It's a subway car

515
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,168
and there's a commuter looking up.

516
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,681
There's a girl with her back to us.

517
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,156
She's wearing one

518
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:23,884
of those short tan ones,
but it's open.

519
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,033
Her legs are bare.

520
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,905
We know what he's seeing.

521
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,640
"Limit your exposure."

522
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:39,117
That's it.

523
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,555
Good.

524
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,274
Mr. Hooker, may I speak with you?

525
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,580
I thought it was a good idea
that P. P. l. had an office

526
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:10,520
for when visitors come.

527
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,349
Of course, it would make sense
for someone to be occupying it

528
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,774
in the meantime.

529
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,432
I rustled up an office for you.

530
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:21,065
I hope you find it
appropriate to your status.

531
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:22,619
My position.

532
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,305
It's near Mr. Pryce.
It's not exactly in the thick of things,

533
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,408
but you will have someone
to attend to your typing

534
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,366
to avoid you siphoning
off the man-hours.

535
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,069
My own girl...

536
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:35,179
- Of my choosing?
- I will have a lineup.

537
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,806
Did he take the ant farm?

538
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,835
No, it's actually mr. Cooper's.
It just lives there.

539
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:48,032
Hello, sweetheart.

540
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:52,356
Now don't be cross.
I'll only be a minute.

541
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,682
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

542
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:04,191
"Peter Campbell."

543
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,547
"The buck stops here!"

544
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:08,931
"The buck stops here"...

545
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,614
Unless it stops over there.

546
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,994
- What's the matter?
- There's two Heads of Accounts.

547
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,704
Kenny Cosgrove
and I are sharing it.

548
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm so sorry.

549
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,666
I was sitting there
and they just...

550
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:26,633
read off a list of names,
a list of companies.

551
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:28,868
That's my life.

552
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:37,242
I know you won't like hearing this,

553
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,812
but you're a lot like my father.

554
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:42,808
You're an ambitious man,

555
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,399
and an ambitious man is
never happy with what he has.

556
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,995
Why does it always
have to be like this?

557
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,697
Why can't I get
anything good all at once?

558
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,177
This is an amazing opportunity.

559
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:56,035
They believe in you.
Don't turn it sour.

560
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,157
It's a test.

561
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,206
Why not just cut it short
and tell them I want it?

562
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:04,106
You can do whatever you want, but
they do not want to hear your outrage.

563
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,045
They want you to beat Ken.

564
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:08,596
I know what they want, Trudy.

565
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:09,933
And honestly,

566
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:11,746
I don't know.

567
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,872
I can't live with this!

568
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,103
But you'll try.

569
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:29,209
That's great.

570
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,071
It's a great ad.

571
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:33,881
So how was everything in Baltimore?

572
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,909
Out of town. Don Draper.

573
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,452
- It was first class.
- Go on.

574
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,300
Two old married men.

575
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:43,040
There was a fire in the hotel,
but no casualties.

576
00:41:43,227 --> 00:41:45,668
- That's too bad.
- For casting this lucky fellow

577
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,796
in the subway, what's he look like?

578
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:49,415
I don't know.

579
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:51,264
A little excited.

580
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:54,093
- A little shocked.
- No, what's he look like?

581
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,963
Handsome.

582
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,139
Your girl's gone.

583
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,015
I have Stolichnaya

584
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:08,162
and cuban cigars.

585
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:09,913
I sent them from Greece.

586
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,278
I should've tried a pound of opium.

587
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:16,010
Help yourself.

588
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,161
So Cosgrove versus Campbell.

589
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:23,413
Is Cooper playing God or Darwin?

590
00:42:23,538 --> 00:42:26,418
I know it sounds japanese,
but it's not Cooper.

591
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:29,128
Lane read about it
in some management book?

592
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,355
I think it came
from the home office.

593
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,914
When he told me about it,
I thought he was joking.

594
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,968
I told him it was a stupid idea,

595
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:41,474
but they don't always
get our inflection.

596
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,644
Can I speak with you for a moment?

597
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:47,228
Come in.

598
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,916
What?

599
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:01,432
I just wanted to let you both know

600
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:04,371
how honored I am
with this promotion.

601
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:06,624
Help yourself.

602
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,163
- Not the Stoli.

603
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:12,478
Hello.

604
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:16,540
I was going to tell Don,

605
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:18,979
but I can tell you myself.

606
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:22,979
I have an old pal
at the mayor's office

607
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:26,733
that wants to do
a small campaign for...

608
00:43:27,095 --> 00:43:28,915
I don't know... Something about

609
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:31,192
penn station.

610
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,990
It'd be my pleasure.

611
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:37,446
Is there any brandy?

612
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:41,268
Any glass will do.

613
00:43:43,864 --> 00:43:45,955
I told him that despite life

614
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,575
under british rule,

615
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:49,478
we still had

616
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:51,042
a real yankee.

617
00:43:54,228 --> 00:43:55,917
I don't care what they say...

618
00:43:57,543 --> 00:44:00,231
London fog is a great name.

619
00:44:11,517 --> 00:44:12,870
I like the ants.

620
00:44:13,896 --> 00:44:16,544
There's no shortage
of distractions here.

621
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:18,432
Now if we can find a proper pub,

622
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:20,030
we'll have everything.

623
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,328
Why do you have this office?

624
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,423
I thought it was necessary

625
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:30,007
that we have place
for when superiors visit.

626
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,870
Of course, it would make sense

627
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,004
for someone to occupy it
in the meantime.

628
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,998
It's a hare-brained idea.

629
00:44:38,638 --> 00:44:41,071
We just fired one-third
of their workforce.

630
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:43,679
It's unseemly to go through
their pockets as well.

631
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,309
A visitor's office is good,
but you sit out front.

632
00:44:49,623 --> 00:44:50,623
Of course.

633
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:52,321
It was presumptuous.

634
00:44:58,007 --> 00:44:59,904
This place is a gynocracy.

635
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,348
I hadn't noticed.

636
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,499
My only point is

637
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,588
if you decide to take
the train tomorrow

638
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:12,435
and you run into Carlton,
I told them we were busy.

639
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:15,560
Our stories are straight.

640
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:18,247
Sally has something to tell you.

641
00:45:20,497 --> 00:45:21,947
I got it out of her.

642
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,720
Out.

643
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:31,644
Go ahead.

644
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,874
I'm sorry I broke your suitcase.

645
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:39,352
Find out how much it is to repair,

646
00:45:39,477 --> 00:45:41,348
and it'll come out
of your allowance.

647
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:42,997
I don't have an allowance.

648
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,074
Then don't break things.

649
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,310
I just thought...

650
00:45:48,435 --> 00:45:50,566
I just didn't want you to go.

651
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:54,432
Come here.

652
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,616
I will always come home,

653
00:46:02,617 --> 00:46:04,093
and you'll always be my girl.

654
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:20,862
Your eyes look tired.

655
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,850
I don't sleep well
when I'm not here.

656
00:46:26,062 --> 00:46:27,512
You squint too much.

657
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,999
You need reading glasses.

658
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,788
Daddy!

659
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,873
Are these for me?

660
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,750
Yes.

661
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,494
Give me that. It's a stickpin.

662
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:49,125
There you go.

663
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:53,212
Was I really in there?

664
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:54,499
Nine months.

665
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:58,375
Tell me about the day I was born.

666
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,357
Well, it was

667
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,687
the middle of the night

668
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,977
and it was raining

669
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:16,062
very hard.

670
00:47:18,965 --> 00:47:21,386
I had just come home from work.

671
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,563
He did not feel like getting back
in the car,

672
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:32,973
but he did.

673
00:47:33,841 --> 00:47:35,388
He took my suitcase

674
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:39,025
and my little stuffed eeyore
that I knew I was going to give you.
