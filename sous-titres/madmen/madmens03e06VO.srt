Season 3 Episode 6
<i>Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency</i>

3
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,293
Daddy, don't.

4
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:23,749
It's 10:30. Why aren't you asleep?

5
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,209
- I'm afraid.

6
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:30,589
I know. You're not Thomas Edison.

7
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:33,647
What are you afraid of?

8
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:37,224
I'm afraid of what's going to happen
when you turn off the lights.

9
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:42,865
I'm home now.

10
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,804
Nothing can hurt you...

11
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,489
Except maybe this mess.

12
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:55,154
Pick up your room
and I'll get you a night light.

13
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,077
Go to sleep.

14
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:17,093
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

15
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:19,378
I bet they're gonna make us work
over the holiday.

16
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:20,966
And Cosgrove's late.

17
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,477
Can we have everyone's
attention, please?

18
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:29,081
This will only take a moment
and it will not be repeated.

19
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:30,691
That's not true, mr. Hooker.

20
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:34,916
We've just been informed
that there will be

21
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,033
a visit from the director and chairman
of the board of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

22
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,080
the purpose of which
is both friendly

23
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,068
and of course
to evaluate our performance.

24
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:51,341
The visit will commence tomorrow...
That is tuesday...

25
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,088
At 10:00 and will continue

26
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,717
into the next day. We apologize.
We realize we were to be closed

27
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,845
- wednesday july 3rd, but...
- Come on.

28
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,999
They were unaware of the holiday.

29
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:09,858
Now we merely need
that everyone continue

30
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,530
to operate at the height
of their productivity

31
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:15,486
and to make sure that their desks
and offices

32
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:18,404
are shipshape and bristol fashion.

33
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,950
And by no means should
these preparations interfere

34
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,570
with our work today.

35
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,469
Very good then.

36
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,541
Don, may we have a word?

37
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,092
Well, isn't this perfect?

38
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:43,594
Well, we'll just move it from lunch
to the end of the day.

39
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,218
I'm having a cake delivered.

40
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,601
- How's that going to look?
- A cake for what?

41
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:50,406
Tomorrow is Joan's last day.
I told you that.

42
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,857
But if we're working on wednesday,
wouldn't that be her last day?

43
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,087
I don't know why she'd come in.
Greg finds out about his residency

44
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,969
today or tomorrow... I'm not sure.

45
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:59,942
I think they're going
away to celebrate.

46
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,615
I'm going to get some money.
We should buy her something.

47
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,494
Harry and Pete,
we will need presentations

48
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,939
for wednesday morning
on the state of television

49
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,876
and, of course, account updates.
Just a few minutes each.

50
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,296
- On each account?
- No, a few minutes for each of you.

51
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,257
And Mr. Kinsey, you might want
to shave your beard.

52
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,779
What?! Who the hell
are you people?!

53
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,296
That was a joke.

54
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:32,320
There's no need for panic.
Just think of this as the same

55
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,268
as any major client visit.

56
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:37,445
They're flying across the ocean to have
their knobs polished?

57
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,695
4th of july... Subtle.

58
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,157
- Get the door, will you?
- The british are coming.

59
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,912
I assume you know
what this is about.

60
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,126
I have a theory.
I believe they're coming to see you.

61
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:55,419
Why?

62
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,214
They've shown a great deal
of interest in you.

63
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,409
Since you swung around your privates
in the boardroom with Duck last year.

64
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,944
They study and dissect your work,

65
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,873
trying to decipher what is
your particular american genius.

66
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,809
What do you think it is?
The presidency?

67
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,768
No, I think it'll be
a creative umbrella

68
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,483
with a dual position
in London and New York.

69
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:22,238
- London?
- Bye-bye, Don.

70
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,013
How congenial you two are.

71
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:30,019
I hope you can maintain this pretense
when they arrive.

72
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:31,144
Excuse me?

73
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,722
Kiss and make up

74
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:37,397
before you cost us all something.
You're being melo dramatic.

75
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:42,070
Miss Blankenship, please make
an appointment at Angelo's

76
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,551
for Mr. Sterling and Draper,

77
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:49,014
- the soonest available.
- I have my own barber.

78
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,669
- That's not necessary.
- Enough!

79
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,833
Everyone wants Martin & Lewis...

80
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,456
Reconcile.

81
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,710
Damn it!

82
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:13,957
It's done!

83
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,032
John Deere is done.

84
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,457
The 110 lawn and garden tractor
with snow thrower,

85
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:22,006
transparent vinyl enclosure
and a key.

86
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,259
Look at him. He just
brought in a mastodon.

87
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:30,957
Sorry I'm late.

88
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,475
Big accounts move slowly,
but the John Deere doesn't.

89
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,863
Listen, Mr. Clampett.

90
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,399
You might want to get your iron horse
out of reception.

91
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,480
I will... After everybody sees it.

92
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,400
- No, P. L. L. is coming.
- When?

93
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,806
- Tomorrow morning.
- And we have to work wednesday.

94
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,822
- We have to give presentations.
- You got that one just in time.

95
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,784
Yeah, I guess I did.

96
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:00,838
She's in here!

97
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm resting and your little

98
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,035
brother's sleeping.

99
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:07,885
All he does is sleep.

100
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,262
What are you doing?

101
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,804
I'm bored.

102
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,016
- Go bang your head against a wall.
- Mom!

103
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,285
Only boring people are bored.

104
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,284
Can I pet him?

105
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,812
Don't wake him.

106
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,459
Come over here.

107
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:30,490
Go play.

108
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:41,298
You can sleep all you want,
little pig in a blanket.

109
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,714
That is quite a shave.

110
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,476
I'm thinking about
my toes right now.

111
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:53,459
- Go to town.
- He's next.

112
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:57,308
- I already had one.
- See, that's not true.

113
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,807
You think thers something
feminine about it?

114
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:02,808
My father was
the tallest, handsomest,

115
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,192
vainest man in New York,
and he got his nails done.

116
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:12,458
He had his fourth coronary
behind the wheel

117
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,147
and then hit a tree.

118
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,022
Windshield severed his arm

119
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:19,776
and he was dead,
so they never put it back on.

120
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,936
In the casket, he had one hand...

121
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,209
- The nails were perfect.

122
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,710
I don't believe that story.

123
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:29,560
Okay, so he hit
another car and not a tree.

124
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,930
It's my company.
Why should I be nervous?

125
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:38,662
Because you sold it.

126
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,834
So that's it?
That's what I did to you?

127
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,647
I got you half of a million dollars?
I'm really sorry about that.

128
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,061
No one said you did anything.

129
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,110
You sound like burl ives.

130
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,795
Part of the problem with mona

131
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,163
is that one day she just started
judging people.

132
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,547
Never gave a crap before.

133
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,516
I'll tell you right now, Don,

134
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,778
I don't like being judged.

135
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:07,951
Listen, Roger...

136
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,923
I'm okay. I'm okay.

137
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,821
We don't need to talk
about this anymore.

138
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:15,803
I promise.

139
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,020
I was holding out for gratitude,
but I'll take that.

140
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,570
Thank you.

141
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:27,944
Maybe now you'll have the money
and the glory.

142
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:32,833
Call the photographers,
type service and vendors

143
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,461
and tell them all deliveries should come
between 9:30 and 11

144
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,157
so the british can see lots of activity
when they arrive.

145
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:40,009
Now.

146
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,693
Are you being short with me

147
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,881
because you think
it'll make parting easier?

148
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,626
My mother used to do that.

149
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:48,382
I'm noticing for the first time
that the ladies out here

150
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,964
are rather plain,
present company excluded.

151
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,067
We could hire some prostitutes.

152
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,142
I know your prime minister
enjoys their company.

153
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,579
The secretary of war,

154
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,901
and you'd do best not
to bring that up tomorrow.

155
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,570
- I apologize.
- I apologize

156
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:04,505
that tomorrow's visit will steal
from your spotlight.

157
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,522
Perhaps we can reschedule your surprise
party till after the holiday?

158
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:09,607
Why did you do that?

159
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:11,552
Do what?

160
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,645
Mrs. Harris knows everything.
I'm sure she was expecting it.

161
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,099
I'm going to go home and make
a celebratory dinner for my husband.

162
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,908
And when you wake up
in the middle of the night

163
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,664
and wonder what you forgot,
don't call me.

164
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,123
That's smooth.

165
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,304
I got a shave.

166
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,300
- Why?
- They ordered me to do it.

167
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,850
We have an inspection
tomorrow... the british.

168
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:47,441
Well, you look very successful.

169
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,648
Hot or cold?

170
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,883
Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?

171
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,502
Chicken salad.

172
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,198
Did you pick up a nightlight?

173
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,678
I did, and I read her to sleep.

174
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,493
She was still clingy.

175
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:06,247
I don't remember her being that
resentful when Bobby was born.

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,207
I don't know that she resents him.

177
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,492
Well, she won't go near him.

178
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,906
She won't even go in his room
unless I make her.

179
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:18,404
- Why are they visiting?
- We don't know.

180
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:22,141
Delayed everybody's vacation plans.

181
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,709
He was perfect today.

182
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,180
- Who?
- Gene.

183
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,751
Would you ever want
to live in London?

184
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:38,968
I'm serious.

185
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,744
Of course.

186
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,966
I could get a pram
and a real nanny.

187
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:46,871
What do you know?

188
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:48,868
Nothing.

189
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,482
Where the hell were you?

190
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:18,403
I told you... I was going
for drinks with the docs.

191
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,807
You didn't tell me anything.
You didn't call me.

192
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,533
I called you at work.

193
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,245
That's a lie.
I just ate dinner for two.

194
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,249
Get over here.

195
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:39,679
I know you're drunk.
Come sit next to me.

196
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,596
So what happened?

197
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,558
I didn't get it.

198
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,695
What happened?

199
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,840
It doesn't say anything except

200
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,235
that they made Doug Hutchinson
chief resident.

201
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,594
And I felt the floor
open up under me.

202
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,242
So you'll get it next year.

203
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,432
You knew it was possible.

204
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:33,458
I ran into Eddinger about a half hour
before the letter came.

205
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:37,819
I could tell something was wrong.
He wouldn't look me in the eye.

206
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,733
I figured he felt bad

207
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,583
and that I'd at least find out
what the hell happened.

208
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,022
But he didn't feel bad.

209
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,556
What are you talking about?
He loves you.

210
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,057
He sat me down in his office,

211
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,289
he poured a drink...

212
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,381
and he said...

213
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,169
He said I had
no brains in my fingers.

214
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,746
But he wrote you all
those nice evaluations.

215
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:21,876
Damn it!

216
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,460
Doctors don't write bad
things about each other.

217
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,348
- So you'll go to another hospital.
- Not in New York.

218
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,858
If I want to stay in surgery,
I can go to...

219
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,685
Alabama or something.

220
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:51,807
So what happens?

221
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:55,562
- You're still a doctor, right?
- I am.

222
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,136
Just not a surgeon,

223
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,060
and I will never be a surgeon.

224
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:08,507
- Did they fire you?
- I don't want to talk about it, okay?

225
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,868
I was hoping you were asleep.

226
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:18,167
I have another year of residency.

227
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,885
You're not gonna be able
to leave your job.

228
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,707
Greg, that's done.

229
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,334
Well, get another one.

230
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:28,421
Honey.

231
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,170
Listen.

232
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:39,984
You are still a doctor.

233
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:45,269
I married you for your heart,
not your hands.

234
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,911
They all went out to celebrate.

235
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,022
I couldn't do it.

236
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:55,433
I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't fake it.

237
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,207
I've been sitting in the dublin house
since 2:00.

238
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,238
Go lay down. I'll undress you.

239
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,659
Just let me close the light.

240
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,543
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me
that our guests have arrived.

241
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,671
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- This is Mrs. Harris.

242
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:50,424
She was the office manager before me,
but she is off to greener pastures.

243
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,760
That's a shame. Guy MacKendrick.

244
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,344
This is mr. Harold ford

245
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,726
- and you recall Saint John Powell.
- We've spoken on the phone.

246
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,171
I believe that's true.

247
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,355
I just wanted to tell you
I made a reservation

248
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,290
at La Grenouille at 6:00
and got you two tickets to "Oliver."

249
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,776
It's a wonderful show.

250
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,663
I've heard that...
A tragedy with a happy ending.

251
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:13,405
My favorite kind.

252
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,048
Thank you, Joan.

253
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,159
Shall I give you
the threepenny tour?

254
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,039
Please let everyone
know that they're here.

255
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,359
We have you scheduled to meet
with Sterling, Cooper and Draper

256
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,042
and then with Mr. Pryce.

257
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:33,105
Then a light lunch in the conference
roomwith the personnel you requested.

258
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:36,557
Tomorrow, the presentations
and client meetings.

259
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:40,724
- Saint John, good to see you again.
- Peter Campbell.

260
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,067
- Guy MacKendrick.
- I know everything about you.

261
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,958
You're a very impressive fellow.

262
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,147
I wish I could
return the compliment.

263
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,458
Well, perhaps one day you shall.

264
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,075
Good morning, gentlemen.

265
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,484
Miss olson, one of our copywriters.

266
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,373
I know everything about you. You are
a very impressive young woman.

267
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,675
Why thank you.

268
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:07,961
I was just writing copy.

269
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,046
- As you were.
- I hope we chat later.

270
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:17,507
Mr. Draper is waiting for you
in Mr. Cooper's office.

271
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,799
This way.

272
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,854
That is a very handsome man.

273
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,710
- Good to see all of you.
- It's a pleasure.

274
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,125
Don. No worse for wear, I see.

275
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,663
What a delightful custom.
From the far east I assume?

276
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,331
- Japan.
- How was your trip?

277
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,801
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Harold Ford

278
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,362
and this young man is
Guy MacKendrick.

279
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,672
Mr. Cooper.

280
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:56,259
- Mr. Sterling, what an honor.
- Call me Roger.

281
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,487
- And you must be Don Draper.
- I am.

282
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,250
I can't tell you how exciting
it is to finally meet you.

283
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,682
That's very flattering.

284
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,746
Guy here has done a study of your work
and that's quite a compliment.

285
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:11,234
You see, in addition
to his inestimable charm,

286
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:13,540
Guy here has degrees
from Cambridge university

287
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,425
and the London school of economics.

288
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,530
Three years at the bank,
two years at McCann

289
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,657
and his most recent coup...
Mercedes benz.

290
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,361
- That's very impressive.
- I apologize.

291
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:25,288
I didn't realize he was going to recite
my entire curriculum vitae.

292
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,082
You left out "modest."

293
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:30,454
We're going to debrief Mr. Pryce

294
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,732
and the plan is for you
to join us for luncheon.

295
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,923
In the conference room at 1:00.

296
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:37,842
Sounds like Agatha Christie.

297
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:40,428
Apparently our tour continues.

298
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,987
I look forward to... How do you say?
Catching up.

299
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,307
I as well.

300
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,263
Well, that was strange.

301
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,488
- Look at that.
- The suspense is killing him.

302
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,291
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford
are here to see you.

303
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,473
- Spectacles.
- Right.

304
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,313
Send them in.

305
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:27,662
Gentlemen.

306
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,186
Greetings, Saint John.

307
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,223
Harold, what a pleasure.

308
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,634
Please see to it that guy has
a space to prepare.

309
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,662
- Right away.
- Gentlemen.

310
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,659
There's coffee and cake.

311
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,848
We're very impressed, Lane.

312
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,608
Very very impressed indeed.

313
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:55,539
In nine months, you've trimmed
every bit of excess,

314
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:58,631
increased billings and we haven't heard
a word of complaint.

315
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:01,425
Yes, well, pax romana and all that.

316
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,036
Bravo. We've decided
to offer you something

317
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:07,493
that we hope you'll view
as a reward and a challenge.

318
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,913
- Is it in the box?
- In a manner of speaking.

319
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:15,989
Open it.

320
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,817
What is that?

321
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,659
It looks like a snake.

322
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,598
Fancy that.

323
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,599
- Is it real?
- It was.

324
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,912
It's for our snake charmer.

325
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,719
We're sending you to Bombay.

326
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,388
Bombay? What would I do there?

327
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:51,767
Well, hopefully the same thing
you accomplished here.

328
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:01,055
Where shall I put this?

329
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,747
I guess I needn't find a spot for it
if I'm simply moving again.

330
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,823
Don't pout.

331
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,668
One of your greatest qualities is
you always do as you're told.

332
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,710
No, it's just

333
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,280
the logistics...

334
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:24,247
My wife just settled,
my son just accepted to school

335
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:25,717
and now we're moving on.

336
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:28,387
Nonsense. You're moving up.

337
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,510
That's the spirit.

338
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,937
So without further ado,

339
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,260
I will give the floor
to Guy MacKendrick.

340
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,686
Let me begin by offering
my warmest wishes

341
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:54,439
and admiration for Lane Pryce
and his exemplary work.

342
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,942
It'll be hard to lose him,

343
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,877
but there's no doubt that
our loss is india's gain.

344
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,063
Now let me say
there's no cause for anxiety.

345
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,376
There will be no further reductions
in the ranks.

346
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,212
Yes, that's good news

347
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:21,476
if I might, I'd like to walk you through
this slight reorganization.

348
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,447
As before,

349
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,936
P. P. L. London will be the head
of this body and Sterling Cooper,

350
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,493
now more than ever,
our american presence;

351
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:37,087
our business maturity
with your creative edge.

352
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:40,812
A triumvirate of Don,
myself and Mr. Cooper,

353
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,860
our chairman emeritus,

354
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:45,365
will oversee three
streamlined departments:

355
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,007
creative art and copy,

356
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:51,589
account management...
That's Mr. Cosgrove and Mr. Campbell

357
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:52,888
for the present...

358
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,099
And a combined television media
department headed by Mr. Crane.

359
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,438
Mr. Sterling's not
on that chart at all.

360
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,775
That's true.

361
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,125
Well, that was an oversight.

362
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,779
As you can see,
nothing much has really changed.

363
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:13,776
Frankly, my presence
here is just to ensure

364
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,380
thorough communication,

365
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,464
that we help each other
on both sides of the pond

366
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:21,597
whether it be a sharing
of creative genius,

367
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,046
media savvy,

368
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,764
or the unbridled acquisition
of new business.

369
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,095
I'm sure you all have
1,000 questions.

370
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,841
But for the time being
I say we inform the troops

371
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,726
so that the transition can begin
immediately after the holiday.

372
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,591
Shall I have
mr. Hooker prepare a memo?

373
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:42,751
No. Nonsense.

374
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:46,041
This is not to be the kind of place
where such news is delivered that way.

375
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:47,714
Shall we?

376
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:58,407
Gosh, we're really
going to miss you.

377
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,948
- What the hell just happened?
- They reorganized us

378
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,833
and you're the only one
in this room who got a promotion.

379
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,753
- Really?
- Yes, really.

380
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:18,895
I apologize
for my wild imagination.

381
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,529
See? It's clean.

382
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,374
That's not what I want
to talk to you about.

383
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:43,154
What's this?

384
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:47,370
It's for you.

385
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,576
"For my new big sister,
the best in the world."

386
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:52,592
And my goodness,
it's from baby Gene.

387
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:56,929
Look.

388
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:07,819
Baby Gene can't write.

389
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:12,820
Babies get fairies to do things.
You know that.

390
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,717
It's really from him.
I'm not kidding.

391
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,784
I think you should open it.

392
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,970
- What is it?
- It's a Barbie.

393
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:50,749
I think he wants you to know
that he wants to be your friend.

394
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,933
And you are
very important to me too.

395
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,474
I'm sure you all have
1,000 questions,

396
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,392
but before I raise a glass

397
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,186
to Sterling Cooper's future,
I should like

398
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,906
to recognize its past,

399
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,779
most recently,

400
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,554
the inspired stewardship

401
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,028
- of Lane Pryce.
- Hear hear!

402
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:41,732
I'm also aware of a rather
significant milestone.

403
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,037
Mrs. Harris,

404
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:48,344
from those who have
known you only hours

405
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,084
to those who have cherished your nearly
10 years of service,

406
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:54,583
I wish you caviar,

407
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,308
and children

408
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,468
and all that is good
in your new life.

409
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,806
Oh, there there.
That wasn't my intention.

410
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,564
Mrs. Harris, please.

411
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,079
We'll have our
presentations tomorrow.

412
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,879
Let this afternoon be
a fete worthy of Joan.

413
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:29,678
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.

414
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:36,267
Thank you.

415
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,155
Thank you all.

416
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:40,911
This is completely unnecessary.

417
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,952
You'll be sorely missed.

418
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,888
We got you the cake.

419
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,828
So what now?

420
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,016
They keep adding people above us.

421
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:02,823
One more promotion and we're going to
be answering phones.

422
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:08,724
We should go say hi.

423
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,235
This is good champagne.

424
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:18,868
I don't think so.

425
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,242
I'm going to get something to eat.

426
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:33,956
Mr. Draper,

427
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,531
Conrad Hilton's office
is on the line.

428
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:38,900
- What?
- Conrad Hilton,

429
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,690
the hotel owner.

430
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,905
I know what he does.
Why is he calling?

431
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,115
I don't know.

432
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:48,034
- And he's calling for me?
- Yes. Well, his office is.

433
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,189
Put him through.

434
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:58,692
Donald Draper.

435
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,215
<i>Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.</i>

436
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,128
<i>Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire
to meet with you.</i>

437
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:07,318
- May I ask what this is regarding?
- <i>I just set his schedule.</i>

438
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:09,143
<i>When are you available?</i>

439
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:13,727
- How about right now?
- <i>"Right now."</i>

440
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,229
<i>Please hold.</i>

441
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:21,503
<i>How far are you
from the Waldorf Astoria?</i>

442
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:23,758
15 minutes.

443
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:25,530
<i>It's the presidential suite.</i>

444
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,658
I'm on my way.

445
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:45,898
- Where's Miss Blankenship?
- She's down there saluting union jack.

446
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:48,254
What is that?

447
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,221
Chocolate pudding.

448
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:55,537
I wasn't even on the chart.

449
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:59,398
- My name's on the wall out there.
- You want some?

450
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:04,778
I like to think, "I'm rich.
They can't hurt me."

451
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:08,917
That's a mistake.

452
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:13,123
I'm being punished
for making my job look easy.

453
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:15,755
Although...

454
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,882
That kid Guy, he has a spark.

455
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,126
He is a pure account man.

456
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,422
And what is that job all about?

457
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,816
I don't know. It's about
listening to people

458
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,262
and never saying
what's really on your mind.

459
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:32,756
No. It's about letting things go

460
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,975
so you can get what you want.

461
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:42,706
Have a nice holiday.
Enjoy the fireworks.

462
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:44,959
We took their money.

463
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,034
We have to do what they say.

464
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:00,817
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam.

465
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,045
Like he wants me to get drafted.

466
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:06,254
First of all, they're hardly
drafting anybody.

467
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,300
Second of all, you're too old.

468
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:13,069
Third of all, I have a friend
in the army,

469
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:15,067
and if you're smart, you're set.

470
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:18,519
He sits behind a desk at fort dix
and screws secretaries all day.

471
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,882
Does he shoot the peoples?

472
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,233
I don't know.
I've gotta take a piss.

473
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:32,945
- May I speak with you?
- Thank you.

474
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:40,132
I just... I wanted to get you a card
or a present.

475
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,132
It'd be nice if I gave you
a gift for once

476
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:45,494
and you didn't wonder
if I wanted something.

477
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,963
Knock yourself out.

478
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,968
I don't want you to think
I never listen to you.

479
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,178
It's just... We can't all be you.

480
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:58,182
Be that as it may, I do take some credit
for your success here.

481
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:09,706
Hey, put that back.

482
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,384
I'm going home!

483
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:17,968
I can't believe
I'm going to Miss this!

484
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm really happy that
you got what you wanted.

485
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:29,403
I remember on my first day you said

486
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:31,759
that could happen to me
if I played my cards right.

487
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,969
Are you getting sentimental?

488
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:37,771
Oh my God.

489
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,102
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll see
each other all the time.

490
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,968
If we don't, I just have to say...

491
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:55,908
For the love of christ!

492
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:57,618
Oh my God.

493
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,453
- My foot!
- Call an ambulance!

494
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,663
- Holy crap!

495
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:03,494
Jesus!

496
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:09,254
There's a tourniquet
in the first aid kit.

497
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,419
You're gonna be okay.

498
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:13,676
Dear God.

499
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:16,553
I can't feel a thing.

500
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,557
Oh, God! What did I do?!

501
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,276
Get her out of here!

502
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,486
The ambulance is on its way.

503
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,863
- I'm Donald Draper.
- We've met before.

504
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:44,372
- We have, haven't we?
- Yellow rock country club.

505
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,541
We had a drink. Of course.

506
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,615
You fixed it for me.

507
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:50,378
Let me return the favor.

508
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,155
I can't believe
you're Conrad Hilton.

509
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,210
Food?

510
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:00,722
Best kitchen in the world...
Got a salad named after it.

511
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:01,979
I'm fine.

512
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:06,290
- I really should have known that.
- I don't know.

513
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:07,415
Now, uh...

514
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,525
After this comes out

515
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,138
next week...

516
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,825
Well, they don't
do that for everyone.

517
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:22,411
I think I look like an arab.

518
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:25,106
How did you find me?

519
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,839
I called around,
told people I had a long chat

520
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:29,894
with a handsome fella
from Sterling Cooper

521
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,603
and your name never came up.

522
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,338
Apparently you don't have
long chats with people.

523
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:36,227
Well, here I am.

524
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,594
What can I do for you?

525
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:42,680
What do you think?

526
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:48,912
I think you wouldn't
be in the presidential suite

527
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:50,791
right now if you worked for free.

528
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,918
Don, this is friendly.

529
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:55,694
Connie, this is my profession.
What do you want me to do?

530
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,505
I want you to give me one for free.

531
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:19,605
I don't think anybody wants to think
about a mouse in a hotel.

532
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:34,926
That was my idea.

533
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,543
You got something better?

534
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:38,919
I might.

535
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,229
So...

536
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,769
What do you want?

537
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,017
I'm not gonna lie...
I'd love a chance at your business.

538
00:36:56,729 --> 00:37:00,156
But the next time somebody like me
asks you a question like that,

539
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,104
you need to think bigger.

540
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:12,483
There are snakes
that go months without eating

541
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,614
and then they finally
catch something,

542
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,401
but they're so hungry

543
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,746
that they suffocate
while they're eating.

544
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:23,545
One opportunity at a time.

545
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,543
Sorry to interrupt.

546
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,997
Mr. Draper, you have
an emergency call.

547
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:32,123
Home or office?

548
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,793
Do you understand what's happened here?
That we're not to be trusted?

549
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,606
She's an idiot.
I didn't know she couldn't drive.

550
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:40,299
You took the machine out. You have
to have respect for that equipment.

551
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,133
It's very safe
when operated correctly.

552
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,233
We had the world handed
to us on a plate,

553
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,222
and then you swing in on a chandelier,
drop your pants and crapon it.

554
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,433
Jesus, it's like
Iwo Jima out there.

555
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,355
We should put a rubber mat down
so Cooper can get around.

556
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,544
They're changing the carpeting.

557
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:56,522
Any news?

558
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,191
He might lose his foot.

559
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,749
Right when he got it in the door.

560
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:05,357
Oh God.

561
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,743
Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale.

562
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:12,747
I take full responsibility.

563
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:16,668
Believe me, somewhere in this business,
this has happened before.

564
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,601
Joan... my God.

565
00:38:33,692 --> 00:38:35,571
I know. It's ruined.

566
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,202
How is he?

567
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:40,108
I didn't expect you to come over.
I just thought you should know.

568
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,443
Honestly, when I called you,
I thought he might die.

569
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,231
But he's not going to?

570
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:47,120
No. He's lost the foot.

571
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:49,231
Jesus. That's awful.

572
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,703
Lane went to retrieve Powell
and Ford from dinner.

573
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,699
They've already talked
to the doctor.

574
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
I'll wait.

575
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,137
Despite the circus today,

576
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:14,533
I hope you know that you are going
to be terribly missed.

577
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:17,103
That's nice to hear,

578
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:19,587
especially from you, Don.

579
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,923
I bet he felt great
when he woke up this morning.

580
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,276
I'm sure you're right.

581
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,109
But that's life.

582
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:43,449
One minute you're
on top of the world,

583
00:39:43,574 --> 00:39:45,446
the next minute
some secretary is running

584
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:46,960
you over with a lawn mower.

585
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,934
I'm heartbroken.

586
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:58,310
It's a terrible tragedy.

587
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,672
One that surely could have been avoided,
although,

588
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:02,465
thank you for your quick thinking.

589
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,027
- You may have saved his life.
- Such as it is.

590
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,795
He was a great account man...

591
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:08,924
A prodigy.

592
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,967
He could talk a scotsman
out of a penny.

593
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,872
Now that's all over.

594
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,204
I don't know if that's true.

595
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,923
The man is missing a foot.

596
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,358
How is he going
to work? He can't walk.

597
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:22,696
The doctor said
he'll never golf again.

598
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,881
I'm afraid we have to reevaluate
our entire strategy.

599
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,524
Lane will remain here indefinitely.

600
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,924
We'll close the office
tomorrow, obviously.

601
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:36,109
Mrs. Harris, please allow the company
to reimburse you for that dress,

602
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,954
just as a token of our gratitude.

603
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,186
I think Saint John and I
should see him if we can.

604
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:41,798
Of course.

605
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,914
You should get home
to that lucky husband.

606
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:22,649
Can I get you one?

607
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:24,298
Sure.

608
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:32,739
I've been reading a lot of american
literature lately.

609
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,558
- "Tom sawyer."
- That's a good one.

610
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,128
I feel like I just went
to my own funeral.

611
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:47,076
I didn't like the eulogy.

612
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:48,737
Daddy!

613
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,801
I've got you. I've got you.
Just breathe.

614
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:02,223
- Get him out, daddy!

615
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:07,813
I don't even know what to say.

616
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:15,908
Daddy.

617
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:22,390
Calm down

618
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:25,142
and tell me what's going on.

619
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,813
Grandpa Gene...

620
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,014
He's not supposed
to be here anymore.

621
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,814
- He's not.
- He's called Gene,

622
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:34,753
he sleeps in his room,
he looks just like him

623
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,751
and I bet when he starts talking
he's gonna sound just like him too.

624
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,600
He's a baby.

625
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:43,749
That's it.

626
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,151
I want you to go to sleep.

627
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,461
There's no such thing as ghosts.

628
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,264
Betts, this has to stop.

629
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,985
There's nothing I can do.
She's jealous of her little brother.

630
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:19,571
No, she's not jealous. She's scared,
and it's all because he has that name.

631
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,509
"That name." You've never liked it,
you haven't hidden it well

632
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,411
and now you're bringing her
into this.

633
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,372
That's ridiculous.
Let's talk about Sally.

634
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,790
She's a child. She'll get over it.

635
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:31,686
Now you have to.

636
00:44:31,811 --> 00:44:34,286
He was my father
and that was his name.

637
00:44:34,683 --> 00:44:36,483
It's what people do, Don.

638
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,716
It's how they keep
the memory alive.

639
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,926
He hated me and I hated him.

640
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:43,551
- That's the memory.
- That's his name.

641
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:50,776
I'm really sorry.

642
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,440
I didn't mean to wake him.

643
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,686
That's okay, honey.

644
00:44:57,924 --> 00:44:59,274
Everything's fine.

645
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,776
Come on. Let's get you to sleep.

646
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:33,215
Come over here.

647
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:48,185
You see?

648
00:45:49,402 --> 00:45:50,579
It's all right.

649
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:00,129
This is your little brother

650
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,290
and he's only a baby.

651
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:08,438
We don't know who he is yet,

652
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,729
or who he's going to be.

653
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:17,654
And that is a wonderful thing.
