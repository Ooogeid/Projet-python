Season 2 Episode 12
<i>"The Mountain King"</i>

3
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,350
Sally ** in your room.

4
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,025
And Bobby, put your trucks
in ***-box, I'm not your maid.

5
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,161
What do you think you're doing?

6
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:29,049
- Nothing.
- Get over here.

7
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,837
You could burn the house down.

8
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:33,471
- You're hurting me.
- Good.

9
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:37,206
- I can't believe you were smoking.
- I wasn't.

10
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:38,704
Go upstairs.

11
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,398
You're not going to be
watching television.

12
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,211
You're not going to be
playing with your friends.

13
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,337
I'm taking away Barbie.

14
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:44,690
- You're mean.
- You betcha.

15
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,082
Get in there.

16
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,149
I'm telling Daddy
when he gets home.

17
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:50,112
Go ahead.

18
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,094
He left because
you're stupid and mean.

19
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,804
You want to sleep in there?

20
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,288
Why won't you let him come home?

21
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,841
Is that what you think?

22
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,581
His suitcase is here, and he's not.

23
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:16,182
Daddy's on a trip.

24
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:17,707
I told you.

25
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,267
It's for business.

26
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,145
Can we call him on the phone?

27
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,156
It's long distance.

28
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,568
And I know he'd be very upset
about you doing what you just did.

29
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,308
Please don't tell.

30
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,069
Take your schoolbooks upstairs.

31
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,150
As soon as Carla gets here,
I'm going riding,

32
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,859
and I want a good report.

33
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,587
Who wants a Popsicle
when it's snowing?

34
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,526
Don't they sell enough
during the summer?

35
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:05,646
Obviously not.

36
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,683
I love Popsicles.

37
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,006
I can't think in here.

38
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,780
It's a storage closet,
not an office.

39
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,323
I called the meeting.

40
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:18,033
Where are the refreshments?

41
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,411
Why do moms give treats?

42
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:23,080
There's no good reason.

43
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,472
My mom would come out
to the truck with us.

44
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,794
She'd break the Popsicles in half
and give it to us

45
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,906
like Jesus at the Last Supper.

46
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,731
Sounds cheap.

47
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:36,009
No. My mother did it, too.
It was great.

48
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,026
In Vermont, we made
our own ice cream.

49
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,014
It was a pain in the ass.

50
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,230
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.

51
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:49,965
So?

52
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,035
You can do it all year'round.

53
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,865
The ritual. It's like Communion.

54
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,199
It's kind of Catholic, isn't it?

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,646
It's Christian,

56
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,158
as in behavior, not religion.

57
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,077
Let me tell you something.

58
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:08,505
The Catholic Church
knows how to sell things.

59
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,190
Any calls?

60
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:16,017
Mr. Peterson had some question
about your expenses regarding...

61
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:17,634
Why doesn't he just die already?

62
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,066
Lutèce.

63
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:21,762
Christ. It's IBM.

64
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,434
Myopic. What else?

65
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:28,604
And you have an appointment
with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.

66
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:29,814
Who's that?

67
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,318
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.

68
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,192
I'm sorry. What?

69
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,725
Mrs. Campbell set it, and I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

70
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:39,531
Good luck.

71
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:45,872
Yes, of course. Thank you.

72
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,195
I think it's one
of the most blessed things

73
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:50,585
that a person would give
a home to an abandoned child.

74
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,885
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell
on the line?

75
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,817
Just get me Bert Peterson.

76
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:03,894
Well, hello, there.

77
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,742
Hello, Bertram.

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,260
Is Florence with you?

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,395
No. She's taking care
of her mother.

80
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:14,018
Then we were thinking about going to
the Breakers through New Year's.

81
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,568
She's a good companion, isn't she?

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,613
She's moody.

83
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:22,502
Damn it, Alice.
I don't ask much of you...

84
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,635
My stockings cost more
than your carpeting.

85
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,574
Have you looked everything over?

86
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,124
It's a very generous offer.

87
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:35,980
I always say it's the smartest thing
I ever did helping you out.

88
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,971
22.50 per share per year
for the next 10 years?

89
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,512
To think that Mother
thought you were a failure.

90
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,492
She made me who I am.

91
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,825
Do you mind if I have a drink?

92
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,595
Sweet vermouth, please.

93
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,107
You can trust Cleveland.

94
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:58,351
You said on the telephone
you were undecided.

95
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,028
What's your hesitation?

96
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:03,282
I promised to take care of Roger.

97
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,785
Let Roger Sterling have
what he always wanted...

98
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,539
to die in the arms
of a 20-year-old.

99
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,249
The truth is
you don't want to retire,

100
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:14,823
and I hate to say this, Bertram,

101
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,293
but you are old...

102
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,040
older than me.

103
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,717
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

104
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:22,694
Charming.

105
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,284
Please. You're not well.

106
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,182
This is what I do.

107
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,810
It's a ***,
you can continue to do it.

108
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,396
I'll be as useful
as the Queen of England.

109
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:35,853
Don't you want to go to Montana?

110
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,628
You ruined that poor
architect's life.

111
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:40,694
Go visit your cattle.

112
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,364
I do love them.

113
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,769
But you can't trust the Brits.

114
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,639
I've left a letter on my bureau.

115
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:12,940
If I'm not back in two days,
the police will be here.

116
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,746
Why would you bring that up?

117
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,875
Because I don't
want you to hurt me.

118
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:20,182
I just want to know
where my husband is.

119
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,112
It's a simple misunderstanding.
There's a lot of men with my name.

120
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:25,364
You're the only one who used
my husband's serial number

121
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,069
to get a driver's license.

122
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,451
Car title. Apartment lease.

123
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,329
Do you have a birth certificate?

124
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,499
- In a safe deposit box.
- Will you stop?

125
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:37,334
I saw the look on your face.

126
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,254
I don't know what to say.
There's been a mistake.

127
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,406
Can't you be a human being?

128
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:44,475
I'm his wife.

129
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,804
I don't care what he asked you to do.
I need to know.

130
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:51,083
- I have to get back to work.
- Stop lying.

131
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,350
You've been caught.

132
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,255
Don't make me do something
I don't want to do.

133
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,241
He died.

134
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,738
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,430
What?

136
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:10,992
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,286
Are you sure?

138
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,953
He never said he had a wife.

139
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,303
Seven years.

140
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm very, very sorry.

141
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,405
What happened?

142
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,823
He was killed in combat.

143
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,160
So who are you?

144
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,100
They thought I was him
and he was me.

145
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,748
I didn't think
I was hurting anyone.

146
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,756
I can't believe it.

147
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,213
I just had to get out of there.

148
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,135
What are you going to do to me?

149
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:13,147
He never mentioned me.

150
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:16,274
I didn't know him long.

151
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:17,871
Maybe...

152
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,934
What's your name?

153
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,688
Anna.

154
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,484
I don't know what to say.

155
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,944
I'm making good money, if that's...

156
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,696
I know I owe you more than money.

157
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,119
I have his purple heart
and his dog tags, if you want them.

158
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,059
He wanted to marry my sister.

159
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,836
She looks just like me,
with two good legs.

160
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,466
What is your name?

161
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,802
Dick Whitman.

162
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,516
What do I do with you?

163
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,137
Well, this is a welcome surprise.

164
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:14,919
I can come back.

165
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh no. Come. See this.

166
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:43,365
I guess all you need
was an audience.

167
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:44,605
Are you next?

168
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,440
I don't play.

169
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:49,527
- Teddy, this is my friend Dick.
- Hi.

170
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,321
It's called, "The Hall
of the Mountain King."

171
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:53,948
It's scary.

172
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:55,470
I know.

173
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:58,910
Take a lollipop.
I'll see you next week.

174
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,212
Bye, Mrs. Draper.

175
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,921
You're tan.

176
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,632
Are you here on vacation?

177
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Business.

178
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,435
You look good.

179
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,347
Where are your things?

180
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:27,071
Or are you just here for the day?

181
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,685
I didn't even think about it.

182
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,137
I didn't mean to intrude. I can...

183
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,409
- Are you in trouble?
- No.

184
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:38,771
Well, then, what?

185
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,949
Can I take a shower and lie down?

186
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,611
Of course.

187
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:55,362
You're late.

188
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,897
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?

189
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,868
I put us on the list. I don't know.
We went right to the top.

190
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,117
Well, I'm not going,
and neither are you.

191
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,760
- Peter, you're shouting.
- Don't do that.

192
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:08,897
Listen to me very carefully.

193
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:13,388
We are not adopting a child.

194
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,421
That's final.

195
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,181
Will you calm down,
and we can talk...

196
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,157
Hell's bells, Trudy! That is final!

197
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:21,576
You don't speak to me that way!

198
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,292
You have lost your mind!

199
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,492
<i>We now return to tonight's "Million
Dollar Movie" presentation of...</i>

200
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,749
<i>The Day the Earth Stood Still.</i>

201
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,389
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.

202
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,675
I am, but my autopilot's working.

203
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,064
What are you doing?

204
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,367
You're tired.
Let me do the driving.

205
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,487
It's okay.

206
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Stop.

207
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:16,159
Honey.

208
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,747
You know what? I am tired.

209
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,307
Is something wrong?

210
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,537
Where'd you pick that up?

211
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:43,742
Greg, stop that.
You know there is no before.

212
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,044
Right.

213
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:51,769
I'm sorry that I don't know

214
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,941
all the things you want.

215
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,367
But you do.

216
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,791
I'm on call again on Wednesday.

217
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,947
Whose pants have a 38 inseam?

218
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:05,726
Harold.

219
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,665
I would like to meet him.

220
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,412
I kicked him out.

221
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,317
Even though old ladies
shouldn't be picky.

222
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,962
It's beautiful here.

223
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,992
You like the porch?

224
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,727
You paid for it.

225
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:30,932
I think about you.

226
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:34,352
Just in passing, I'll wonder.

227
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,746
They were making
a commercial on the pier.

228
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,151
And then you called me.
How about that?

229
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,989
You've been in California too long.

230
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,743
How old are your children now?

231
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,916
Sally is 8.

232
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,166
Bobby is 5.

233
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:05,851
If you don't want to talk about
what happened, that's fine.

234
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:08,965
But you can, you know.

235
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:13,502
I always felt that we met so that
both of our lives could be better.

236
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,816
That's just how it is between us.

237
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:20,411
I ruined everything.

238
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:26,778
My family, my wife...

239
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,290
my kids.

240
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:32,104
I'm sure that's not true.

241
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,077
My brother came to find me.

242
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,037
I told him to go away.

243
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,878
I didn't know you had a brother.

244
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,245
I've told you things

245
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,297
I've never told Betty.

246
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,390
Why does it have to be that way?

247
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,102
You love her.

248
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,865
You don't have
to tell her everything.

249
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,819
I'm sure there are things
about her you don't know.

250
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,930
Do you want to call?

251
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,904
That would just confuse things.

252
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,365
Then what are you going to do?

253
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,726
I don't know.

254
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:27,232
I have been watching my life.

255
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,125
It's right there.

256
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,650
I keep...

257
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,575
scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

258
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:43,526
I can't.

259
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:47,653
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,846
Did you get the same thing in your
stocking last night that I did?

261
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,532
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,784
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered

263
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,050
to put a lot of marmalade
on your toast.

264
00:18:12,278 --> 00:18:13,400
Sit, Roger.

265
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,531
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.

266
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,722
I don't like being in the position

267
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:23,595
of having to sell off
my life's work

268
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:26,400
because you have
an increase in overhead.

269
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,402
So Mona's crying
on your shoulder now?

270
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:32,001
The late Mrs. Cooper
introduced you.

271
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,115
Let her know it didn't work out.

272
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,155
I know you don't think
I got my hands dirty.

273
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,595
I'm sorry I missed
the Great Depression.

274
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:43,208
Still, I have served
this place for the last 20 years.

275
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,983
It's a merger.

276
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,004
We can still come to work
in our building, in our offices,

277
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:50,226
only they'll be diamonds
on the doorknobs.

278
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,453
So we'll have
a meeting of the partners.

279
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,193
And for your information,
Jane makes me very happy.

280
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,601
That's good to know.

281
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:19,446
As Don illuminated, advertising
is essential for aerospace,

282
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,611
especially in reaching out
to the public

283
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:23,909
to see that... congressmen vote

284
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,555
for the spending bills
which bring new jobs.

285
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,762
Actual advertising,
not public relations.

286
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,508
<i>I have your father-in-law
on line 1.</i>

287
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,856
Tom. How are you?

288
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,014
To be honest,

289
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,195
I don't like having
to make this phone call.

290
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:56,824
Why not?

291
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,098
We've been thinking
about things over here,

292
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:01,829
and we're going to have to
put Clearasil up for review.

293
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,333
Really?

294
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,705
That's a shock, Tom.

295
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,672
Now, why would you do that?

296
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,378
Sales have been spectacular.

297
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:13,409
All right, calm down.
I said review,

298
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,079
not that we're moving.

299
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,301
You'll have 90 days
to turn it around.

300
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:18,845
Turn what around?

301
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:20,847
You're distracted.

302
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,099
What are we talking about?

303
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,554
Look, son...

304
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:29,290
Every good businessman knows that,
if his wife's unhappy,

305
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,731
his work suffers.

306
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:34,205
Yes, they seem very directly
related in this case.

307
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:35,820
Don't they, Tom?

308
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,532
Trudy's happiness should
be your first priority.

309
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,251
I think you should pull
Clearasil right now.

310
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,971
I don't think you're going
to get what you want.

311
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:46,597
What about my daughter?

312
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:48,666
She's my wife. That's between us.

313
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,093
You know what?

314
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:52,473
I was in love with Trudy
when I met her.

315
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:55,411
And then you stuck your nose in,
put these ideas in her mind,

316
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:56,716
and made her unhappy.

317
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,968
What do you mean,
you were in love with her?

318
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,555
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

319
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:06,351
Perhaps it is best
if we just give notice.

320
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:07,648
Good-bye, Tom.

321
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,069
I bought you some clothes.

322
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:39,675
Tomorrow morning.

323
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:47,098
- There's something else.
- What?

324
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,479
I met a girl.

325
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:52,521
Another one?

326
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,422
She's so beautiful and happy.

327
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,111
She's a model.

328
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:00,489
And she's

329
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:03,616
from a good family,
and she's educated.

330
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:05,201
What's her name?

331
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,217
Elizabeth. Betty.

332
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,783
- I want you to meet her.
- Look at you.

333
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,380
You're in the lavender haze.

334
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:18,144
I just like the way she laughs,

335
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,967
and the way she looks at me.

336
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,012
You are very hard to look at.

337
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:30,726
I wanna ask her to marry me.

338
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,979
Dick, that's wonderful.

339
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:39,763
Well, I need you
to give me a divorce.

340
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:43,216
Of course.

341
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,492
I never thought of that.

342
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,842
You should hire a lawyer out here.
I'll pay for it.

343
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,847
And I want you to know that

344
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,793
I'm going to take
care of you forever.

345
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,528
You don't have to do that.

346
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:56,653
I do.

347
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,903
You don't owe me anything.

348
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,531
This whole life,

349
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,556
- if it wasn't for Don, if it wasn't...
- Stop that.

350
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:13,031
So...

351
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,841
there'll be another Mrs. Draper.

352
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:21,217
I guess so.

353
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,455
You'll have a family.

354
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,241
That'll be good for you.

355
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:30,404
I want to.

356
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,084
This will probably be
our last Christmas together.

357
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:36,959
Why?

358
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,903
You're gonna be my cousin.

359
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,507
This is a chance
at a whole new life.

360
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,969
Thank you, Anna.

361
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:06,254
So where's Don?

362
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:09,867
I'm sure you rember Peggy Olsen.

363
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:12,534
She'll be walking you through this.

364
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:15,205
And when Don climbs out
from under the weather...

365
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:19,043
Don has signed off on all of this.

366
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:22,911
When I was little,

367
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,081
my mother would take a twin pop

368
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:26,732
and break it in half

369
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,533
and give one to me
and one to my sister.

370
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:32,942
We were completely equal
in her eyes.

371
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:34,718
Beloved.

372
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:39,189
Everyone does this with Popsicles,
but they may not realize what it means.

373
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,473
It has nothing to do
with an ice cream truck

374
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:45,152
on a hot summer day, or the flavor,

375
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:46,780
or the color.

376
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:49,264
It's a ritual.

377
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:53,787
You take it, break it,
share it, love it.

378
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:59,507
People do do that.

379
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:07,251
This act of sharing,
it's what a Popsicle is.

380
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,475
It's the same treat
from the freezer

381
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,245
as it is from the truck.

382
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:13,162
I don't care if it's
snowing or hailing

383
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:14,921
or 100 degrees.

384
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:18,429
You can still take it,
break it, share it,

385
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,819
and love it.

386
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:24,199
I like the way she's
handing out the pops.

387
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,675
The kids are excited, but...

388
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,114
the mom reminds me of something.

389
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:33,142
No, this is original.

390
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,498
I can tell you this now,

391
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,037
but we wanted something
with the word love in it.

392
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,827
When asked, the first
thing people say is,

393
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:45,379
"I love Popsicles."

394
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:03,230
Carson residence.

395
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,913
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.

396
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,970
Hello, Betty.

397
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:10,404
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

398
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:12,381
I'm at my wit's end.

399
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:16,369
Sally... I think she may
need private school.

400
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:18,999
<i>How does Becky like
Rockland Country Day?</i>

401
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,166
Well, it's a drive,
but she seems more independent.

402
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,331
I haven't seen you at the stables.

403
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:30,549
I saw it in the paper that Tara and
Arthur are getting married next weekend.

404
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,220
Yes, I heard that.

405
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:38,350
Well, I hope they're
very happy together.

406
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,854
Are you there?

407
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,142
Betty, I'm sick about it.

408
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,100
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,492
That's why they call them crushes.

410
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,797
It was more than that.

411
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:00,855
Really?

412
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:04,273
<i>I'm telling you, I haven't
been able to sleep.</i>

413
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,682
I keep thinking about him.

414
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:10,108
I think Raymond knows.

415
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,910
I can't even look at Becky.

416
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,571
What did you do?

417
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:18,296
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.

418
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:21,387
<i>You did?</i>

419
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,758
Don't act surprised. He told me all
the things you said about me.

420
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,106
I was grateful.

421
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,607
Why would you do that?

422
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,259
What?

423
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,279
You wanted him, too.
You know you did.

424
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,157
There's a difference
between wanting and having.

425
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,659
You did everything you
could to encourage me.

426
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,869
I didn't make you do anything.

427
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,678
My God, you're an awful
woman, you know that?

428
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:47,542
No one made you sleep with him!

429
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,191
I'm going to tell you this, and
you can tell all your little friends.

430
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,453
This is a delicate
piece of machinery.

431
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:07,771
You don't just shove paper in it.
You don't bang on the buttons.

432
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:09,766
You don't sit on the glass.

433
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:13,092
If you want it to work,
you have to treat it with respect.

434
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:25,571
What do you want?

435
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,499
I need to speak with you.

436
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:29,518
Honey, I have a 6:30
dinner reservation,

437
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,838
and unless you want to pull me there
in a rickshaw, I have to get going.

438
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:34,924
I'm a copywriter.

439
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,653
- Why, did I call you something else?
- No.

440
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,267
I don't know if you're aware,

441
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,573
but I brought
in the Popsicle account today.

442
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:42,640
On my own.

443
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:44,894
Hey, Ginger, did you
hear about this?

444
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,507
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

445
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,000
I need my own office.

446
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,637
It's hard to do business
and be credible

447
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,762
when I'm sharing
with a Xerox machine.

448
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:57,203
Freddy Rumsen's office
has been vacant for some time.

449
00:28:57,323 --> 00:28:58,947
I think I should have it.

450
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,033
It's yours.

451
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:02,868
Really?

452
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:04,703
You young women
are very aggressive.

453
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,887
- I didn't mean to be impolite.
- No, it's cute.

454
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,578
There are 30 men out there
who didn't have the balls to ask me.

455
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:13,202
There you are.
Mr. Sterling, Miss Olsen,

456
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:15,672
this is my fiancée,
Dr. Greg Harris.

457
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,842
So you're the one
who got our Joanie?

458
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:19,012
Yes, I am.

459
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,150
You're a lucky man.

460
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,931
- So nice to meet you.
- Congratulations.

461
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,093
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.

462
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,192
It was a pleasure to meet you.
I have a dinner reservation,

463
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,024
and I don't think
I'm going to make it.

464
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:36,068
- Well, we do as well.
- We're going to <i>La Côte Basque</i>.

465
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,446
- I thought you hated French food.
- There's a new chef.

466
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:43,117
Good night, Ginger.
Pleasure to meet you, Greg.

467
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,336
Let me get my purse.

468
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,948
Mix me a drink, will you?

469
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,576
I don't know.

470
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:58,581
Isn't that what these
guys do all day?

471
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,251
I've seen the movies.

472
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,393
Pretend like I'm your boss.

473
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:03,671
Donald Draper.

474
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,505
Okay, one drink.

475
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:24,645
Dr. Harris, are you
trying to examine me?

476
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:25,765
Maybe.

477
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,491
Not in here.

478
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,806
That Sterling guy knows
an awful lot about you.

479
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:35,724
I've been working here
for nine years.

480
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:40,777
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.

481
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:46,887
It's okay.

482
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,020
No, I mean it.

483
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,964
Come on.

484
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,390
Greg, this isn't fun.

485
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,136
This is what you want, right?

486
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:08,211
Stop.

487
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:11,163
- It's okay.
- Greg, no!

488
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:43,976
Are you ready to go?

489
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:48,190
I don't want to miss
our reservation.

490
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,188
No, of course not.

491
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:07,262
They're changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

492
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:09,763
Christopher Robin
went down with Alice.

493
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:10,883
Very good.

494
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,203
You look well, Roger.

495
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:15,273
Best babysitter in the world.

496
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:18,195
So.

497
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,888
I call to order a meeting
of the partners

498
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:25,235
in the presence of
our attorney, Mr. Whitehouse.

499
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,247
Members attending:

500
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,888
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,

501
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,949
Roger Sterling, senior partner,

502
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:34,872
and Alice Cooper,
secretary-treasurer.

503
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,667
And Donald Draper, absent.

504
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:39,960
We are meeting to
discuss the merger

505
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:42,902
with Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

506
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,820
the details of which we've

507
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,636
all had time to examine,
including Mr. Whitehouse.

508
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:51,179
Where's Mr. Draper?

509
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,765
Do you want me to go get a picture
of him so you can stare at it?

510
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:56,081
His 12% makes him

511
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:58,813
mathematically insignificant.

512
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,978
Still, I would like to know
what he thinks, wouldn't you?

513
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:04,527
He's very savvy.

514
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,574
I'm sorry, I don't know
whose eyes to look at.

515
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:13,076
Where is Draper?

516
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:15,833
He took a business
trip to California.

517
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,183
He's taking some time.

518
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,248
Marital troubles.
Don't write that down.

519
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:24,588
He stands to make over half a million
dollars. Let's proceed, shall we?

520
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,815
That a'34 Sedan?

521
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:45,818
Mostly.

522
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:48,278
What'd you do to it?

523
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,535
Made some improvements.

524
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,976
Got a 60'Nailhead,
39'LaSalle transmission,

525
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:55,744
and a'40 banjo rear end.

526
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,183
Two Fords and a Buick.

527
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,638
What happened here?

528
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:02,708
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.

529
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,349
You know anything about hot rods?

530
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:07,487
No, but I remember these.

531
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,522
I used to sell them. Used.

532
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:12,679
All motor, no weight.

533
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:14,805
How fast does it go?

534
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:18,101
Well, that one does
the quarter in 11 seconds.

535
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,143
This one's going to scare people.

536
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,156
The color on that one,
I've never seen anything like it.

537
00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:28,652
I'm, uh, Kess.
That's my kid Doogie.

538
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:34,308
The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder
of "Indian-no-place."

539
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,909
Walt. Indianapolis.

540
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:39,706
You guys need y help?
I'm looking for work.

541
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:41,456
Working on hot rods?

542
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:43,041
Don't people buy them?

543
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:46,516
There's a couple of custom
shops, and they do great,

544
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:49,664
but I came out here to get into it,
and I'm working at a bar.

545
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:52,634
He's an artist.
Built a car that looked just like it.

546
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:56,430
- I'd like to see her race.
- Sunday.

547
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:58,047
Lions Drag Strip.

548
00:34:58,448 --> 00:34:59,448
Long Beach.

549
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:04,149
I'll look into that.

550
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:20,913
Mr. Sterling.

551
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:24,751
Miss Cooper.

552
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:28,570
Bertram Cooper,

553
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,206
So we'll proceed.

554
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:42,069
Mr. Whitehouse will prepare
a counter-offer.

555
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,010
Wonderful.

556
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:45,520
Meeting adjourned.

557
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:47,575
Well done.

558
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,198
- Look who just got richer.
- This is good for you, too.

559
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,385
You have your children to think of.

560
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,212
I just have the one.

561
00:35:57,826 --> 00:35:58,760
Really?

562
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,011
- Hello, Joan.
- Hello.

563
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,263
- Have you heard from him today?
- No.

564
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,187
Do you think it's odd?

565
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,775
I don't think about it at all.

566
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:37,948
Congratulations.

567
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:39,702
Thank you.

568
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,161
Your fiancée is so handsome

569
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:43,513
He is.

570
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:46,706
He's the doctor you'd hope to see,
but only exists in movies.

571
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,199
Thank you.

572
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,016
He's specializing
in thoracic surgery.

573
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:54,586
It's very difficult.

574
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:56,824
And he volunteers
at Harlem Hospital Center,

575
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:58,552
stitching up Negro children.

576
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,639
He's a keeper.
When's the wedding again?

577
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,926
Look who I found
protesting in the lobby.

578
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,725
Our man from the evening news.

579
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:07,561
Welcome back.

580
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:10,322
Look at you. What's different?

581
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:13,108
Nothing. How was Mississippi?

582
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:15,248
I think we made a difference.

583
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:17,560
And it was the adventure
of a lifetime.

584
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,830
Sheila dropped him 3 days into it.

585
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,201
There's a Bankers Box
in the corner.

586
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,038
- What the hell is this?
- My new office.

587
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,667
What?

588
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,304
Why don't you just put
on Draper's pants while you're at it?

589
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:32,256
You have your own office? You?

590
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:35,714
I'm the head of television, and I spend
the day staring at an orangutan.

591
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,969
I have some unpacking to do.

592
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,136
Has anyone heard from Don?

593
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,806
Yes. He called.
He wants you to get back to work.

594
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:48,018
I'd get a new couch if I were you.

595
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:49,619
Thank you.

596
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:54,649
Do you know
who I talk to about this?

597
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:57,345
I'll have it taken care of.

598
00:37:57,747 --> 00:38:00,363
Christmas.
I'm getting married at Christmas.

599
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,970
That's wonderful.

600
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:12,685
Hello.

601
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,281
Sally, can you come in here?

602
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:18,336
I'm in the living room.

603
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,261
Hello, Mommy.

604
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,169
I want to talk to you.

605
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,722
I realize I haven't been
completely fair to you.

606
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:44,939
And if there is something you want,

607
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,743
I'd love to give it to you.

608
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,359
You're getting to be a big girl.

609
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:54,133
Someday you'll want something,
and I won't be able to give it to you.

610
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,803
Mommy, they're beautiful.

611
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:05,951
Thank you.

612
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:11,060
You're welcome.

613
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:13,688
Can we go now?

614
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,795
- Do you have homework?
- Arithmetic, I can do it in the car.

615
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,523
Sally, now that you're a big girl,

616
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:29,828
I'm going to tell you something.

617
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:36,448
Your father and I are
having a disagreement,

618
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,213
and he went away.

619
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,235
Where did he go?

620
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,060
I'm not sure.

621
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,305
When is he coming home?

622
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:52,307
I don't know.

623
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,547
I know it's hard to understand.

624
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:00,821
But I promise,
everything's going to be okay.

625
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:10,327
Mommy, you're bleeding.

626
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:15,585
Go take those in the kitchen
and have a snack.

627
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:17,229
I'm going to change.

628
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:30,556
That's an ink blot.
You see what you want to see.

629
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:33,868
You don't have to pick them,
just put your palm on the deck.

630
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:03,999
Did you read it?

631
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:05,687
I did.

632
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:07,898
Reminded me of New York.

633
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,775
And it made me worry about you.

634
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:15,673
What about the cards?

635
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:18,262
Should I be worried?

636
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:20,862
It's all here.

637
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,442
You're definitely
in a strange place.

638
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,936
But here is the sun.

639
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,618
- That can't be good.
- It is.

640
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:34,661
It's the end of the world.

641
00:41:34,823 --> 00:41:36,373
It's the resurrection.

642
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,756
Do you want to know
what this means or not?

643
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:40,998
No, I don't.

644
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:53,289
I smell the ocean.

645
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,176
This is the one.

646
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:58,894
Who's she?

647
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:02,040
She's the soul of the world.

648
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:05,161
She's in a very
important spot here.

649
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,570
This is you, what you are bringing
to the reading.

650
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:12,131
She says you are part of the world.

651
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,784
Air, water.

652
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:17,307
Every living thing
is connected to you.

653
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,806
It's a nice thought.

654
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,284
It is.

655
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,395
What does it mean?

656
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,295
It means

657
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,034
the only thing keeping you
from being happy

658
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,887
is the belief that you are alone.

659
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:41,558
What if that's true?

660
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:45,868
Then you can change.

661
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,059
People don't change.

662
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:55,806
I think she stands for wisdom.

663
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,623
As you live, you learn things.

664
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:20,976
Come in.

665
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:27,148
Look at you, celebrating.

666
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,163
- You getting a secretary?
- Yes.

667
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:33,197
Well, she's in for it.

668
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:38,863
You should get some pictures
in here of your family

669
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,833
or some people or something.

670
00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:43,948
I'm going to put up my campaigns.

671
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:46,876
- Isn't that Freddy's bar?
- He left it.

672
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:49,045
How the hell did you swing this?

673
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,531
I'm sleeping with Don.

674
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:53,466
It's really working out.

675
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:02,413
I haven't told anyone because it's
probably a formality at this point,

676
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,807
but Clearasil has pulled out.

677
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,184
How did that happen?

678
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:09,035
Sales have been great.

679
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,367
What about your father-in-law?

680
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,695
I guess I'm not doing my job.

681
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:15,571
I know that's not true.

682
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:18,700
Don will dance on my grave,
if he ever comes back.

683
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,957
Did something happen
in Los Angeles?

684
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,878
He disappeared.
He didn't even check out.

685
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:32,926
I almost called the police.

686
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,341
Why didn't you?
Maybe something happened.

687
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,470
It didn't surprise me.
I know some things about him.

688
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,307
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.

689
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:45,673
All I'm saying is
he may not be coming back.

690
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:48,683
He's done it before.

691
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:53,769
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,

692
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,529
I am sure it's with good reason.

693
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,970
Guess I should probably go home.

694
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:10,043
Congratulations.

695
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:12,797
Good night.
