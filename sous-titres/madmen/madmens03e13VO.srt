Previously on Mad Men

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:04,128
You don't have to answer me now,
but I wanna marry you.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,512
Put your nose down
and pay attention to your work,

4
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:10,865
Because there's not one thingthat you
done here that I couldn't live without.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,216
I want...

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,361
To scream at you.
For ruining all of this.

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,399
- You are very upset. I understand.
- I don't love you.

8
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:24,190
You don't owe them anything.
You should start gathering your clients.

9
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,566
Sometimes you're more
than a son to me.

10
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:31,364
I don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

11
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,074
Or lack thereof.

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,695
Sign.

13
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,634
- Sterling Cooper is for sale.
- Why?

Season 3 Episode 13
<i>Shut the Door. Have a Seat</i>

16
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,226
Sorry I'm late.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,016
That's okay.
I was occupied.

18
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,855
How are you today ?

19
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,379
I'm well, Connie.
Thank you. How are you?

20
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:51,192
I'm afraid I have some
serious business to discuss.

21
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:52,653
Have a seat.

22
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,760
I was at McCann Erickson yesterday,

23
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,155
and they let me know

24
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,337
that effective January 1, they're buying
Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

25
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,443
What?

26
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm sorry, but that means
I'm going to have to

27
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,545
move my New York
properties elsewhere.

28
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,097
Why?

29
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,893
Because P.P.L. owns Sterling Cooper.
You're all gonna be part of McCann.

30
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,239
So we're all gone.

31
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,942
Sterling, I don't know.

32
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:35,271
Cooper will definitely
be put on an ice floe.

33
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:37,868
But you're a prize pig.

34
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,158
You'll make more money,
pick up stock.

35
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,624
You won't have to live
and die with every account.

36
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,060
Bullshit.

37
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,214
It's a sausage factory.
I turned them down three years ago.

38
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:51,913
This happens all the time, Don.

39
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,422
It's business.

40
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,723
I'd ask them to put you
on the Caribbean hotels,

41
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,948
but I don't think I'm gonna
stay there much longer.

42
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:01,388
You come and go as you please.

43
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,432
Yes, I do.

44
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:05,399
And you don't give a crap that

45
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:08,084
my future is tied up in this mess
because of you?

46
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,066
You wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.

47
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:14,276
And you wanted to play with me.

48
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,842
Kick me around,
knock me down to size

49
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,281
while you called me son.

50
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:22,856
I get it now, Connie.

51
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,033
It's business.

52
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,824
You know...

53
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,214
I got everything I have

54
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:37,386
on my own.

55
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,584
It's made me immune to those
who complain

56
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,888
and cry because they can't.

57
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,680
I didn't take you
for one of them, Don.

58
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,603
Are you?

59
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:03,181
Some other time we'll try again.

60
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:05,175
Yes.

61
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:07,765
Have a nice holiday.

62
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,771
69 cents a bushel.

63
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,444
- That's half last year.
- We ain't gonna make it.

64
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,572
It's as fair a shake
as we could get,

65
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,803
considering that allotment act made
no allotment for wheat.

66
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,756
You were supposed
to get us a good deal.

67
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,838
There's a surplus.
What the hell's he supposed to do?

68
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,315
I ain't selling at that.

69
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,057
- You've got no choice.
- Sure I do.

70
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:59,101
I've got a silo. Store it till winter
when the price goes up.

71
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,738
- How you gonna pay your mortgage?
- That's none of your concern.

72
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:02,927
Settle down.

73
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,096
- We're all in this together.
- No, we ain't, thanks to you.

74
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,430
I take care of mine.
You take care of yours.

75
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:12,104
Damn it, Whitman,
this is a cooperative.

76
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,229
No more.

77
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,326
Now get out of my kitchen.

78
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,812
What's so urgent
that you had to wake me?

79
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:42,992
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L.
is being sold and us along with it.

80
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:48,441
- So you knew about this?
- No, but it makes sense.

81
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,557
All that short-term thinking.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,392
So what do we do?

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,323
There's nothing to do.
I have a contract.

84
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,098
You have a contract.
Roger has a contract.

85
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:00,812
So that's it?

86
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,579
You're losing your business
and you don't care?

87
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:07,519
- I lost my business last year.
- Well, do something about it.

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,830
If Sterling Cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P.P.L.?

89
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,633
We could put everything
back the way it was.

90
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:19,753
Young men love risk because
they can't imagine the consequences.

91
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,034
And you old men love
building golden tombs

92
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,659
and sealing the rest
of us in with you.

93
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,471
You're done.
You know that, right?

94
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:30,389
So I should just
throw away my fortune?

95
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,406
I don't have the rest
of my life to earn it back.

96
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,894
I understand. I'll let you get
back to sleep.

97
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,464
Why do you care?

98
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,481
Because I'm sick of being batted around
like a ping-pong ball.

99
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,070
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch
of accountants trying make $1 into 1.10?

100
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,358
I want to work.

101
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:48,917
I want to build something of my own.
How do you not understand that?

102
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,939
You did it yourself 40 years ago.

103
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:52,864
That's true.

104
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:58,704
But I'm not sure you have
a stomach for the realities.

105
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,061
Try me.

106
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,485
Well, we're gonna need accounts.

107
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:09,219
American Tobacco, that's most of
Sterling Cooper. But that's Roger.

108
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,495
I understand that.

109
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,602
Did Hilton tell you when this
blessed event is supposed to take place?

110
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,727
New Year's Day.

111
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:26,612
- We have to talk to Roger now.
- You talk to him.

112
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,156
Do you want to do this or not?

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,910
Honey.

114
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:35,254
Honey,

115
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,676
he probably feels bad about
the president getting shot on his watch.

116
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,651
Now stop reading the paper.

117
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,186
She's obsessed.

118
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,990
It's the most interest that girl's
ever had in a book depository.

119
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:48,557
McCann is buying P.P.L.

120
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,513
and is absorbing
Sterling Cooper along with it.

121
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:56,141
- What?
- Conrad Hilton told me this morning.

122
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,661
Christ.

123
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:01,156
From one John's bed to the next.
What a joke.

124
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,191
Don and I have been discussing
the idea that we

125
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,776
buy the company back.

126
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,275
Really?

127
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,364
- Why?
- Because we don't want to go to McCann.

128
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,144
Now you're sniffing around
because I have

129
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,819
a golden pork chop
dangling from my neck.

130
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,325
It's more than that.

131
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,714
- You know Bert's done for.
- Now it's about Bert?

132
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:31,235
I want to see what you look like
with your tail between your legs.

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,158
You sold your birthright
so you could marry that trollop.

134
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,450
Here we go.
This is your pitch?

135
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,717
Well, move along.

136
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,353
I'm not gonna throw it all away because
he doesn't want to work at McCann.

137
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,034
Do you want to work there?

138
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,366
You don't value what I do
anymore than they do.

139
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,467
I was wrong.
I learned that with Hilton.

140
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,406
I can sell ideas
but I'm not an account man.

141
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,075
You're not good at relationships
because you don't value them.

142
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,619
- I value my relationship with you.
- You do now.

143
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:59,182
I do.

144
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:06,909
I'm sorry.
I've got points, stock.

145
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,425
If I'm useless, so be it. There's a
deck chair somewhere with my name on it.

146
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:19,320
You're right, Roger. If you've lost
your appetite, you should retire.

147
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,895
Of course, I've seen
that before, so have you.

148
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,904
Men my age, even younger,
they play golf,

149
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,668
go on vacation,

150
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,859
lose their appetite.

151
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,252
In three years...

152
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,873
Join or die?

153
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,411
Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.

154
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:43,547
- You know it's true.
- You're still gonna outlive me.

155
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,071
We have to try.

156
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,092
So you do want to be
in advertising after all.

157
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,740
Go upstairs.

158
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,417
- Daddy just got home.
- I'll be up.

159
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,318
Do you want me to go too?

160
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,536
Please sit down.

161
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,815
I made an appointment
with a divorce attorney

162
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,616
and I suggest you do the same.

163
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,411
Come on, Betts.

164
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:41,396
- What are you doing seeing a lawyer?
- I want to be civilized about this.

165
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:45,518
- Please don't act surprised.
- You haven't been yourself.

166
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,314
Maybe you need to see a doctor.
A good one this time.

167
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,983
Because I'd have to be
sick to want out of this?

168
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:56,551
You've had a tough couple of weeks.

169
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,224
We all have.

170
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,230
I've had a tough year.

171
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:09,725
I felt I should tell you rather than
just let you get a phone call at work.

172
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,150
Well, forget it.

173
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,111
I'm not gonna let you
break up this family.

174
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,286
I didn't break up this family.

175
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:37,782
Please shut
the door and have a seat.

176
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,002
Certainly.

177
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:50,250
We know McCann Erickson
bought P.P.L.,

178
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,793
and we know that makes
Sterling Cooper chattel.

179
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,463
Who told you that?

180
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,739
Someone outside of this building
who knows.

181
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:58,591
They're wrong.

182
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,295
We've worked next to each other
for a year.

183
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,569
Don't act like a stranger.
We've got tea.

184
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,314
Well, I suppose you'll
find out soon enough,

185
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,067
but your information
isn't completely correct.

186
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,287
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold.

187
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,072
P.P.L., well, will remain p.P.L.

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,930
That doesn't change our plans.
We want to buy back the company.

189
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:27,610
We're willing to offer
the purchase price plus 12%.

190
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,773
It's worth more than that now.

191
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,233
- What did you get?
- I'm not gonna say, but more than that.

192
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,958
I apologize you had
to find out this way.

193
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,724
Believe me, it wasn't my decision.

194
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:47,171
I've quite enjoyed it here.

195
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:57,373
Well, they've only got me for a year.
You for what, three?

196
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,627
We'll make another run at it.

197
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:05,080
The only grounds for divorce
in this state are absence of a spouse,

198
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:08,305
incurable
insanity, life imprisonment or adultery.

199
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,621
Well, he hasn't been faithful.

200
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,629
Do you have any witnesses
or corroboration?

201
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,168
Not really.

202
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,838
It wouldn't matter anyway
with both parties at fault.

203
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:21,107
No. We haven't...

204
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,604
- we aren't
- Ken, what are you doing?

205
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,580
You think the governor needs
another scandal on the ticket?

206
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,561
I am sorry for presuming,
Mrs. Draper. That was wrong.

207
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:38,150
- So what do I do?
- I know it's hard to understand,

208
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,388
but the state of New York doesn't want
<i>anyone to get divorced.</i>

209
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,008
That's why people go to Reno.

210
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:44,738
It's painless.

211
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,060
I met my second wife.

212
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,870
You stay there for six weeks
to establish residency.

213
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,539
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,

214
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:54,247
just consent.

215
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,306
I see.

216
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:59,212
We need to discuss what you
want in terms of settlement.

217
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,047
Whatever I'm entitled to.

218
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:04,803
Give us a second.

219
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,058
You don't need what he can provide.

220
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,360
- Henry, I have three children.
- I'll take care of them

221
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,285
and I'll take care of you.

222
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:21,177
I don't want you owing him anything.

223
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,433
We want to get this done
as soon as possible.

224
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,121
Saint John, I'm glad I caught you.

225
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,339
What is it?

226
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:37,541
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper
have learned of the sale.

227
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:38,904
What do they know?

228
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,956
<i>It was a mixture of</i>
<i>truth and half truth.</i>

229
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,360
They knew about McCann,
but they were under the belief

230
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,559
that P.P.L.
was being sold as well.

231
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:48,010
- And what did you tell them?
- <i>That they were wrong.</i>

232
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,507
They even wanted to bid
for Sterling Cooper

233
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,559
12% above our purchase price.

234
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,497
Listen, I apologize, lane.

235
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,064
Obviously the news is getting out.

236
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,904
- What news?
- P.P.L. is being sold as well.

237
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:07,151
What ?

238
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,657
- Why wasn't I told?
- Didn't seem pertinent.

239
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,286
Trying to keep our company
calm as well as theirs.

240
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:17,165
- Well, where's my place in this?
<i>- With McCann, I suppose.</i>

241
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,268
There there, Lane.

242
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:22,830
<i>They know you're
essential to the transition.</i>

243
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,715
- And then what?
<i>- You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.</i>

244
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,374
You always do.

245
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:33,795
Yes?

246
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,648
Don't be disheartened.

247
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,103
I'll put in a good word for you.

248
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:39,938
Thank you.

249
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,064
No.

250
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,634
Thank you.

251
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,853
We've got a month till winter,
then we'll be set.

252
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:29,112
This is what I showed
the man from the bank today.

253
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,355
What are they gonna do,
sell this place?

254
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,452
The bank's gonna get their
payday right after me.

255
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,830
We got nothing and we're about
to have less.

256
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,972
Fine!

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,989
I'll sell.

258
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:44,628
I'll sell my crop for nothing.

259
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,423
What are you doing?

260
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,550
I'll drive it to Chicago tonight.

261
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:51,967
You're drunk.

262
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,393
Go.
He can barely stand.

263
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Calm down.

264
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,039
Here.

265
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:10,348
Calm down.

266
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:15,158
It ain't gonna rain.

267
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,896
Pa!

268
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,117
Daddy! Daddy!

269
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,009
Your guests have arrived.

270
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,921
Close the door.
Have a seat.

271
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,475
- What's he doing here?
- You gonna read us your will?

272
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,041
- I want the Cadillac.
- I couldn't sleep.

273
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:29,777
And I thought, why don't
we go to McCann directly?

274
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,943
Because you can't. It's done.

275
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,061
- You're not even gonna ask?
- I did, yesterday.

276
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,283
And you were right.
P.P.L. is being sold,

277
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:41,348
So it seems we're all
going to McCann.

278
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:42,923
They cut you loose.

279
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,892
I want you to find out
what the price was and give us a shot.

280
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,017
Enough.

281
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:50,098
I should fire you for even trying
to involve me in this conspiracy.

282
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:52,210
Go ahead. It's the only thing
you did well here.

283
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:55,446
- Don, let it go.
- I did a great many things here.

284
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,113
Have another. It's 9:30
for god's sake.

285
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,336
Jesus, that's right.

286
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,008
You have absolute authority
to fire anyone.

287
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,195
Fire us.

288
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,533
Fire us. Sever our contracts.
Let us go.

289
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,798
- Can you do that?
- Why would I?

290
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,649
Because once this sale goes through,

291
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:30,851
you'll be thrown overboard and you'll be
a corpse knocking against their hull.

292
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:33,296
Nothing good ever came
from seeking revenge.

293
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,243
Nonsense.
We'll make you a partner.

294
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,596
I should think this
is worth more than that.

295
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,025
So we're negotiating.

296
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,478
- We'll put your name on the door.
- I don't know.

297
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,356
- Do you know how to do what he does?
- I don't.

298
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,386
It could be done,

299
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:03,049
But getting you, us,

300
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:05,442
out of here isn't
the difficult part.

301
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:09,218
- We need accounts.
- Let's say we have Lucky Strike.

302
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:14,521
And although that's, let's see,
$23 million in Billings...

303
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,714
24.

304
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:19,142
We'd still need another
third for cash flow.

305
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:23,164
I can't take anyone else or Lee Garner
sr. won't think that he's special.

306
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,849
- What about Hilton?
- No.

307
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:28,643
Can we get any
of our other accounts?

308
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,061
We'll get them.

309
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,690
If I were to send a telex in at noon
today That you've all been sacked,

310
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,865
It's after close
of business in London.

311
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,970
It would remain unnoticed until Monday
morning there, 2:00 A.M. here.

312
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,867
That gives us today and the weekend

313
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,892
to first gather accounts and then
a skeleton staff to service them.

314
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,021
We would have to obtain
all the materials required

315
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:53,898
for continuity of service.

316
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:55,295
Obtain?

317
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,381
We he to steal everything.

318
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,909
Anyone approached
must be a certainty.

319
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,674
If news spreads,
they'll lock us out.

320
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,395
Do we vote or something?

321
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,177
Well, gentlemen,

322
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,216
I suppose you're fired.

323
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,060
We'll, it's official.

324
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,645
Friday, December 13th, 1963.

325
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,871
Four guys shot their own legs off.

326
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:38,402
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requested
an office-wide memo.

327
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:42,095
"The office is closed this weekend.
All work is suspended. Carpet cleaning."

328
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:45,653
- Can you get me Mr. Campbell?
- He didn't come in today. He's sick.

329
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,423
Call his house.
It's important.

330
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:48,920
Peggy, my office.

331
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,944
What do I bring?

332
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,984
Shut the door.
Sit down.

333
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:08,187
I know we have to roll out
Western Union by New Year's.

334
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:10,768
I don't have art.
There's no one there.

335
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:13,094
They're selling the company.

336
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,529
Again?

337
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:19,120
I'm starting a new agency. I need you
here Sunday evening to get your things

338
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:21,965
And to help us collect
whatever accounts we end up taking.

339
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,101
- Really?
- Yes.

340
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:28,513
- Who else is going?
- Why do you need to know that?

341
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,831
- Because it's important.
- I can't tell you.

342
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:35,436
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann.
Do you know what that means?

343
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,672
You just assume I'll do
whatever you say...

344
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,651
Just follow you

345
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:43,695
like some nervous poodle.

346
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,733
- I'm not going to beg you.
- Beg me? You didn't even ask me.

347
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,578
Fine, I'm asking you.

348
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:56,423
I've had other offers, you know,

349
00:22:57,265 --> 00:23:00,165
that came with a sales pitch
about opportunity.

350
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:03,256
Everyone thinks you do all my work.

351
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,625
Even you.

352
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,743
I don't want to make
a career out of being there

353
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:16,068
so you can kick me when you fail.

354
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,398
I guess I'll have to talk
to Kurt and Smitty.

355
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:22,018
I guess so.

356
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:38,124
- Where the hell are my pajamas?
- Will you please relax.

357
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,046
Trudy, I called in sick today because
I had my interview with Ogilvy.

358
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:45,389
- I have to look sick.
- You do.

359
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,499
What a pleasant surprise.

360
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,281
Sorry to drop in.

361
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,483
- How are you?
- Better than my husband.

362
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,986
And how are you?
We've been calling all day.

363
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,606
- May I take your coats?
- We're fine.

364
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,816
I'm going to change the sheets.

365
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:28,925
Is everything okay?

366
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,886
McCann bought P.P.L. and us.

367
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,972
What? Again?

368
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:37,683
We need to talk to you.
It's serious.

369
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,643
We're not firing you.

370
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,435
Am I getting a few more adjectives
added to my title ?

371
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,526
Don't bother.
I have other plans.

372
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,862
Peter, may I speak
to you for a moment?

373
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:55,436
Pete, we're starting a new agency.

374
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,155
We're here to talk
to you about joining us.

375
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,458
Wait a minute.
They're letting you go?

376
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,222
Keep it to yourself,
but I'm taking American Tobacco.

377
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:10,455
We need another $7-$10 million
in billings for cash flow or something.

378
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,695
What do you have
in your saddlebag so far?

379
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,744
I don't have a saddlebag.

380
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,579
I don't know what
you're talking about.

381
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,811
I don't blame you for bailing out
the way you've been treated.

382
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:27,861
- So Kenny turned you down?
- We haven't spoken to Ken yet.

383
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,821
And yes, we want your accounts,
but we also want your talent.

384
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:33,534
Really?

385
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:36,117
And what are my talents?

386
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,140
You'll do what it takes.

387
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,747
I want to hear it from him.

388
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:49,197
It's not hard for me to say, Pete.

389
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,017
You saw this coming, we didn't.

390
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,938
In fact, you've been ahead
on a lot of things

391
00:25:56,944 --> 00:26:00,427
Aeronautics, teenagers,
the negro market.

392
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:04,728
We need you to keep us
looking forward.

393
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,133
I do, anyway.

394
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:15,819
I want to be a partner
and I want my name in the lobby.

395
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,542
There's not gonna be a lobby.

396
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,838
North American Aviation,
Secor laxatives,

397
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,768
Gillette, Jai Alai, maybe Pampers.

398
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,852
That's close to $8 million already.

399
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:38,930
I don't think you get conditions.

400
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:42,015
We'll make you a partner
if you can deliver by Sunday.

401
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Sunday?

402
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,195
We'll leave the name
and the title as a goal.

403
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,670
Like it or not, that works with you.

404
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:53,008
I'd like to say
I'll think about it, but I

405
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,459
don't think that's an option, is it?

406
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,154
I'm not really sick.

407
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,544
Welcome aboard.

408
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:15,331
Good night, Trudy.

409
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,802
Good night, gentlemen.

410
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:21,579
- What if I come up short?
- That's not an option.

411
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:24,284
Good night.

412
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,315
I want you to call
Hubert Adams as Secor.

413
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:36,697
His number's in my Rolodex.
I threw it under the bed.

414
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,122
Try him at home.

415
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:42,076
Tell him I'll meet him at the St. Regis
at 7:30 and sound like a secretary.

416
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,402
I have to get dressed.

417
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,543
I can't believe he was gonna leave.

418
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:53,875
That little shit.

419
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,593
Look, they still have
a picture of Kennedy up.

420
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:05,002
Although, what are they gonna do,
take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?

421
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,890
Not in this place.

422
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:12,049
I've acted like I've started
a business my whole life,

423
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,995
but I inherited it.

424
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,590
I need an attorney.

425
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:22,483
Divorce.

426
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:25,482
So it's true ?

427
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,719
- What are you talking about?
- Henry Francis.

428
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,213
Who?

429
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:36,823
Jesus.

430
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:40,658
Right when things
were almost normal.

431
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,277
I need you to tell me what you know.

432
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,436
Margaret's friends
with his daughter.

433
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:49,810
- Are they sleeping together?
- I don't know.

434
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,088
It came from his daughter.

435
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,584
He talks about her.

436
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:00,265
It sounds like it's serious.

437
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,247
I was gonna tell you.

438
00:29:02,664 --> 00:29:03,675
No, I wasn't.

439
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,075
I thought you knew.

440
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:09,336
I'm sorry I told you.

441
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,271
Believe me.

442
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,617
I'm sorry about that.

443
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:38,150
Wake up.

444
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,570
- He's sleeping.
- I don't care.

445
00:29:42,134 --> 00:29:43,697
Who the hell is Henry Francis?

446
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
No one.

447
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,498
Stop it.
Stop it!

448
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,116
Who the hell is he?

449
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:56,377
Why do you care?

450
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,213
Because you're good
and everyone else in the world is bad.

451
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:01,966
- You're drunk.
- You're so hurt,

452
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:05,052
so brave with your little
white nose in the air.

453
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,554
All along you've been
building a life raft.

454
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:08,763
Get out.

455
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:12,712
- You never forgave me.
- Forgave what?

456
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:15,984
That I've never been enough?

457
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,399
You got everything you ever wanted.

458
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,467
Everything! And you loved it.

459
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:23,279
And now I'm not good enough for
some spoiled mainline brat?

460
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,598
That's right!

461
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,033
You won't get a nickel.

462
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:32,133
And I'll take the kids.

463
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,269
God knows they'll be better off.

464
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:38,592
I'm going to Reno, you're going
to consent and that's the end of this.

465
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,534
Don't threaten me.

466
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:43,229
I know all about you.

467
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,362
You're a whore.

468
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,648
You know that?

469
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,722
I want you out of the house.

470
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,333
Hold the elevator.

471
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,308
- They called you in, too?
- Yes, they did.

472
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:42,754
I'll admit it. I'm a little scared.

473
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,135
Of what?

474
00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:49,492
- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

475
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,092
Cooper called me.

476
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:53,720
First they're cleaning the carpets,
now they're not.

477
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:55,308
Why are you here?

478
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:58,655
Work.

479
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:05,693
Hey, everybody, Harry Crane is here.

480
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:09,172
Relax, Pete, we're expecting him.

481
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,484
- What's going on?
- Why are you here?

482
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,998
I'm sorry, what's going on?

483
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,259
P.P.L. has been sold to McCann.
We're starting a new agency.

484
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,434
We'd like you to join us
as our new head of media.

485
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,813
- Are you kidding?
- Yes. Yes, we are.

486
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:30,188
Happy birthday.

487
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:33,022
We need your answer.

488
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,663
I should really call my wife.

489
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,472
Mr. Crane. Harry,

490
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:44,174
this matter is secret
and time sensitive.

491
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,164
If you turned us down
and elect to be

492
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,355
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,

493
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,967
we'll have to lock you
in the storeroom until morning.

494
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,352
I'm sure you understand.

495
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:05,511
We were hoping you could
decipher these job sheets.

496
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:07,886
Where exactly are these materials?

497
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:09,867
I never look at these.

498
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:14,929
Can't we just take everything?

499
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:18,662
That's good thinking, but
we don't know where anything is.

500
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,788
No one knows how this works?

501
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,714
Let me make a phone call.
I'll take care of this.

502
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,739
- No. No more conspirators.
- I'll be discreet.

503
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:31,277
Where's Don?

504
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,586
What did we do?

505
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:41,469
Nothing.

506
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,610
Then why are we in the living room?

507
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:48,942
We want to tell
you something because...

508
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,344
Well, it's going to be
a little bit of a change.

509
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:56,573
Your father is going
to be moving out.

510
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,712
Now, we'll still be living here

511
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:04,375
and he'll come to visit.

512
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,803
Then why is he going?

513
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,049
Because...

514
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:18,211
It'll just be temporary.

515
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:20,474
Like when you lived in the hotel?

516
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:23,351
- Yes.
- It'll be different.

517
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:31,840
- Is it because I lost your cufflinks?
- No, it has nothing to do with you.

518
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,018
That's not what I mean.

519
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:43,029
I love you both.
You know that.

520
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,250
Then why are you going?

521
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,888
I'm not going.

522
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:54,216
I'm just...
living elsewhere.

523
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:57,680
That's going. You say things
and you don't mean them.

524
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:01,306
- You can't just do that.
- Sally, sweetheart...

525
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:03,976
- Go away.
- Sally, stop it.

526
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:08,036
You said you'd always come home.

527
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,599
I will.

528
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,106
It's just a different home.

529
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:22,722
Will you be here for Christmas?

530
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:26,815
- You'll get to have two Christmases.
- I only want one.

531
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:29,144
Did you make him leave?

532
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:33,105
No. We both decided.

533
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,258
You made him sleep in Gene's room,
and it's scary in there.

534
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,277
Listen to me, both of you.

535
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,712
I will be here.

536
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,732
You can call me, I will
answer and I will be here.

537
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,141
Let her go.

538
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,864
Please don't go.
I don't want you to.

539
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,119
Nobody wants to do this.

540
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,559
I need you to be a big boy.

541
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:32,898
You look awful.

542
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,269
Can I come in?

543
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,507
Do you want anything?

544
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:54,211
Yes, I do.

545
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,986
You were right.

546
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:07,924
I've taken you for granted
and I've been hard on you,

547
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,688
but only because I think

548
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:15,941
I see you as an extension of myself.

549
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,862
And you're not.

550
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:23,490
Well, thank you for stopping by.

551
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,658
Please.

552
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,830
Sit down.

553
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:39,422
Do you know why
I don't want to go to McCann?

554
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:42,143
Because you can't work
for anyone else.

555
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,386
No.

556
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,149
Because there are people
out there who buy things,

557
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:51,977
People like you and me,

558
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:55,853
And something happened.

559
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,624
Something terrible.

560
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,976
And the way that
they saw themselves...

561
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,830
Is gone.

562
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:20,082
And nobody understands that.

563
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:24,765
But you do.

564
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,247
And that's very valuable.

565
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,159
Is it?

566
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,185
With you or without you,
I'm moving on.

567
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:49,564
And I don't know
if I can do it alone.

568
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,565
Will you help me?

569
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,300
What if I say no?

570
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,682
You'll never speak to me again.

571
00:39:13,881 --> 00:39:14,886
No.

572
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:20,190
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to hire you.

573
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:35,331
Mrs. Harris, what a
pleasure to see you.

574
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:39,412
- What is she doing here?
- I said I'd be discreet.

575
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:41,250
Tell them what to do.

576
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,297
I made a list and I
called some movers.

577
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,589
Can you read these?
Do you know where this stuff is?

578
00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:48,635
Yes. Of course you'll need
the job bags on all these accounts.

579
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,880
We'll also need logo files,
all the film we can find,

580
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:53,932
and negatives which
aren't actually here.

581
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:56,849
- There you go.
-  Very good.

582
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,770
Now I can pack.

583
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,797
Sorry I'm late.

584
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:06,638
What a good idea.

585
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:09,441
You're here.
Who did you bring?

586
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:13,451
North American aviation,
Secor, Jai alai, samsonite.

587
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:16,606
- Clearasil.
- Really?

588
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:18,758
I made it.

589
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:21,001
Where do we start?

590
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,809
I'd start in the art department.

591
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:24,321
It's locked.

592
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:33,027
Great.

593
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,280
I'll start in my office.

594
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,652
Joanie, I can't read your writing.

595
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,557
It's perfectly clear.
"Correspondence".

596
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:55,735
I'm tired.

597
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,025
Peggy, can you get me some coffee?

598
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:05,358
Did you wash your hands?

599
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,850
Hold the elevator.

600
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,887
Greg is going to kill me.

601
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,973
I'm at the Roosevelt, but I'll
need you to find me an apartment.

602
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:20,603
- Furnished?
- For the time being.

603
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:23,327
Sorry. Good night.

604
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:33,195
Go ahead, fellas.

605
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:51,337
How long do you think it'll take us
to be in a place like this again?

606
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:55,506
I never saw myself working
in a place like this.

607
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:13,694
Don't bother.

608
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:35,509
We've been robbed!

609
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,389
He's waiting on the line.
It's his third attempt.

610
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,464
Saint John, how are you?

611
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,396
What in god's name is
going on over there?

612
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:50,442
I think at this point
it should be very clear.

613
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,060
You're fired.

614
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,905
You're fired for costing this
company millions of pounds.

615
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,728
You're fired for insubordination!

616
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,284
You're fired for lack of character!

617
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:01,395
Very good. Happy Christmas.

618
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:06,012
I've been sacked.

619
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:09,262
Please have my office and things
put in storage at this address.

620
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,483
What's happened?

621
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:13,075
You're a sharp boy.
You'll figure it out.

622
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:15,800
So let's see.

623
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,553
I have Peggy and Pete
sharing the desk.

624
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:21,714
Don, we'll replace one of these couches
with a table for you,

625
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,007
and we're adding
two additional phone lines.

626
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:26,394
Media will be in the bedroom
with the television.

627
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,308
Accounts gets the bed.

628
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:31,116
And no one is to come
to this office.

629
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,526
If you have meetings,
please take them elsewhere.

630
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:37,089
I don't want them in the lobby
or the bar of this hotel.

631
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:41,495
Well, look at that.

632
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:48,333
Good morning. Sterling Cooper Draper
Pryce. How may I help you?

633
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:53,630
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.

634
00:43:56,436 --> 00:43:59,178
He didn't leave a note.
Nothing.

635
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:00,678
Where is he?

636
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:04,278
I just heard from John Deere.
Pete tried to poach them on Saturday.

637
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:05,975
He must have gone with Draper.

638
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:16,575
Damn it.

639
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:19,425
Sure.

640
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,554
Everything is exactly the same.
Don and I will both be on the account.

641
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:27,203
Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye bye.

642
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:31,112
- Hello, everybody.
- Lovely, what are you doing here?

643
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:34,963
I brought lunch. There's every
kind of sandwich imaginable and a cake.

644
00:44:35,444 --> 00:44:36,643
Thank you, Trudy.

645
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:39,070
- Isn't this exciting?
- It is.

646
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:42,902
This looks great, Trudy.

647
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:49,744
- There's food.
- Thank god.

648
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,076
Draper residence.

649
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,332
It's me.

650
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:18,965
I'm not sure where I'm staying right now
but I'll be working out of the Pierre.

651
00:45:26,554 --> 00:45:27,982
Listen, betts,

652
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:31,311
I want you to know
I'm not going to fight you.

653
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:37,321
Thank you.

654
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:43,198
I hope you get what
you always wanted.

655
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,778
You will always be their father.

656
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:01,841
Goodbye.

657
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,282
Goodbye.

658
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:25,375
You know,

659
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,161
if you leave your shoes outside
the door here, somebody polishes them.

660
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,336
Hello, don.

661
00:46:31,385 --> 00:46:32,862
How was your morning?

662
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,287
Very productive.
