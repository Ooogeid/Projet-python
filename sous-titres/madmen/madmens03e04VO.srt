1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,587
My God.

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:06,172
Where is your drink?

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:09,954
I have to work tomorrow.

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,845
We lost our farm,
ended up in coal country.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,430
And here you are.

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,350
- What is this?
- It's Patio, the diet drink for pepsi.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,185
Sal sent up the storyboards.

8
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:21,228
It's sexy, and it's what they want.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,898
Clients don't always
know what's best.

10
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:27,151
Good night grand pa Gene.

11
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,581
Synchro:
FBK

12
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,632
Season 3 Episode 4
<i>The Arrangements</i>

13
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,234
I don't care
if it's windy or rainy,

14
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:21,911
there's no reason for a shake roof
to fail if it's laid right...

15
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,984
Except that one.

16
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,460
No flashing around the chimney...

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,179
That's gonna cost 'em.

18
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:34,305
Go around!

19
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,894
Now I'm gonna push it up

20
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,731
to 25mph. That's what
we're allowed to do here.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,472
You've gotta really pay attention.

22
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:03,581
15 minutes of news and nothing
about the holy father.

23
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,957
He's still dead, ma.

24
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,923
- The shower cap pulled up?
- Yes.

25
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:11,620
Piece of junk.

26
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:15,718
If you want, i'll have Gerry come over
and fix your shower.

27
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,175
It was fixed,

28
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,324
but I think Ronnie the super
sneaks in and breaks it.

29
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,641
For all I know, he's going through
my things right now.

30
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,894
You don't like getting a little bit
of attention?

31
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,896
Anita, this man does
not look the way you want him to.

32
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,114
I'd offer you a room,
but since mom moved in, I don't have it.

33
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,801
I want to move to Manhattan.

34
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,614
Really?

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,490
It's so far away.

36
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:42,611
It is far, and I commute almost
two hours total every day,

37
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:43,877
five days a week.

38
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,955
That's an extra week
of work each month.

39
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,574
My goodness,
I never thought of that.

40
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,419
Pegs, the rents there...
They're outrageous.

41
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,928
I know, but I'm already spending
a fortune between subway fare,

42
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,551
cab fare on late nights,

43
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,579
pantyhose...

44
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:01,028
If I can't find a newspaper, the cane
on the seats destroys them.

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,600
And it'll be easy with that savings
and a roommate.

46
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,460
Jeez louise, you've been
really thinking about this.

47
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,367
Ma! That's not good for it!

48
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,568
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to Manhattan?

49
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:20,841
Are you going to be
one of those girls?

50
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,356
I am one of those girls.

51
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:29,077
Well, ho-ho, I've observed
your wishes for secrecy,

52
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:30,652
but now is the time.

53
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:33,576
Gentlemen...

54
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:37,453
Imagine the perfect mixture

55
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:40,761
of athletics, spectacle and speed.

56
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,680
Jai Alai.

57
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,392
Jai Alai is like handball,

58
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,336
only you fling the ball and catch
the ball with this basket thing.

59
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:53,816
It's more complicated
than that... And dangerous.

60
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,016
I'll leave the loose-leaf, but it shows
the way jai alai attendance is growing.

61
00:03:58,141 --> 00:03:59,322
In seven years,

62
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,540
it'll eclipse baseball.

63
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,581
Go ahead, you can laugh,

64
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:06,494
but it's got the same fingerprint
as baseball, only better.

65
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,497
A special stadium called a fronton

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,285
and you can sit real close,

67
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,628
which is a thrill because the ball
goes 175 mph.

68
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,293
And it's got Patxi.

69
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:18,828
He's babe ruth,

70
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,153
only handsome.

71
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:24,305
This is Patxi.

72
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,350
I was looking for boxers, but I bought
his contract instead.

73
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,518
He's the greatest player
in the world.

74
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:32,904
Mel Ferrer.

75
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,459
I'm terrified of him catching
balls in the face.

76
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:42,208
So let's say there's enough money.

77
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,392
How would you chop it up?

78
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,828
Most of it's going
to end up in television.

79
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,913
Perfect, because I want a tv show.

80
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,154
- A sports show?
- Did you see Patxi?

81
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,204
You don't see him
flying around the world,

82
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,211
solving crimes and banging broads?

83
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:01,954
Harry has excellent relationships
with the networks.

84
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,843
Well, it'll probably
have to be ABC.

85
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,804
I want to be on all the networks,

86
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,099
like when the president
addresses the nation.

87
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:11,997
Tuesday night,

88
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:13,332
8:30-9:00,

89
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:16,106
all three networks...
The same show.

90
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,068
No one's ever done it.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,486
Because...

92
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,121
That's true.

93
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,143
How about a star-studded

94
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,270
big musical special

95
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,791
witha jai alai match. Desi arnaz.

96
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,919
- What else you got?
- Well, there's print.

97
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,458
Women's magazines.
A glamorous night in Miami

98
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,551
- with a free admission.
- Tuesday night is ladies'night.

99
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,468
And of course newspapers are key,

100
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,846
but you can't limit yourself to less
than 10 markets.

101
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,908
This is impressive.

102
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:55,771
- Don't get up.
- Horace, this is Don Draper.

103
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,580
I told you he'd be stopping by.

104
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,355
Don't let me interrupt.

105
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,776
So far for the jai alai campaign:

106
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,028
Sterling Cooper will produce
an adventure program,

107
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,221
starring your handsome fella,

108
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,699
A musical spectacular...

109
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,456
On all three networks
and it has to be in color.

110
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:12,870
CBS doesn't have color.

111
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:15,896
Fine. I'd like

112
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,457
to get the ladies
magazines in color

113
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:21,471
and maybe a color page
in the sunday paper.

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,007
What about radio?

115
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,217
You'll have to take radio
the way it is.

116
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,581
I don't think it's worth anyone's time
unless you're willing

117
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,346
to commit to at least

118
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,144
$1 million to start.

119
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,980
Sure, but that's a third
of my ad budget.

120
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,833
Well, as they used to say
at the freshmen mixer,

121
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,085
"when you get a yes, you go home."

122
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,363
Only, humps, you never got one.

123
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,871
Listen, Draper,
I'd love to buy you dinner,

124
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,783
run some slogans by you.

125
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,183
Actually, ho-ho, we buy you dinner.

126
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,081
- That was fun.

127
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:09,957
I'm going to have to buy Campbell
a case of something.

128
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,082
Patxi.

129
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,317
During the depression,
I saw somebody throw

130
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,567
a loaf of bread off
the back of a truck.

131
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,242
It was more dignified.

132
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,023
Are you going to have trouble
sleeping tonight?

133
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,020
I've seen clients far more
defenseless than he.

134
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,319
Well, as the bible says,

135
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,622
"enjoy your fatted calf."

136
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,543
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

137
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,205
He said he's a shipping magnate,
not a client.

138
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,567
Horace senior is connected
to Bert Cooper in a million ways,

139
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,293
and I don't know if he would like
what just happened in there.

140
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,193
You want to run it by his daddy?

141
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:45,757
He's my age.

142
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,833
So he was born with a lot of money.

143
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,552
He has a dream and it's our job
to make it come true.

144
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,655
Well, there you have it.

145
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,256
Nicely done, my boy.

146
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,356
Get off your feet.
It's bad for the baby.

147
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,070
- As soon as I finish the dishes.
- Sit with me.

148
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,444
You're cleaning up for the maid.
You're just like your mother.

149
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:26,335
I don't like watching you
commit suicide.

150
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,536
Neither do your kids.

151
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,568
What do you want, daddy?

152
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:36,884
It's... it's all...

153
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,333
laid out in here...

154
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,855
My arrangements.
Just follow the directions.

155
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,065
I don't want to talk about this.

156
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:48,138
We talk about it now and then
we don't talk about it. That's the idea.

157
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,111
Fine.

158
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,420
Jesus.

159
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,183
Smoke your cigarette.

160
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,934
Funerals are a dishonest business.

161
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,149
People don't want to think about it...
That's how they get you.

162
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,420
Remember what happened
with your mother?

163
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:06,723
The will's

164
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,025
translucent, transparent or something
according to the lawyers.

165
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,593
You run the show.

166
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:13,971
You took me in.

167
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:15,804
Anything else?

168
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,770
I want you to have
your mother's coats.

169
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,129
I gave Judy the hudson seal, but I want
you to have the chinchilla and

170
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:26,864
obviously the mink.

171
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:29,259
They're in the cedar closet.

172
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:31,245
They key's in Gloria's end table.

173
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:33,488
Okay, daddy.

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,218
You don't want to hear about it,

175
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,495
Scarlett O'Hara?

176
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,045
I have the folder.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,667
You've always been sensitive.

178
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,247
That's my fault
for shielding you from

179
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,383
all the dangers out there,

180
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:54,470
that's probably
why you married this joker.

181
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:58,823
If you'd even known
what was possible...

182
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,217
But that's that. I wrote it down.

183
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,274
We never have to
talk about it again.

184
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,761
I don't understand
why you like talking about this

185
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:12,623
when you can see
so clearly that it upsets me.

186
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:16,405
Selfish and morbid.

187
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,242
I'm your little girl.

188
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,429
And I know it must be horrible to be
looking at whatever you're looking at,

189
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,873
but can't you keep it to yourself?

190
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:34,591
- What kind of mood is he in?
- I'm never right.

191
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,337
Has anybody been outside?
Do I need a coat?

192
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:38,458
I'd take it.

193
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,432
George Caan dropped out of Patio
to direct a picture in L. A.

194
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,293
I look forward to his average work.
Replace him.

195
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:47,518
There's no time
and there's no talent.

196
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:50,036
What were you going
to do if you had to fire him?

197
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,442
- Have Sal do it.
- Are you serious?

198
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,251
- Sal, do you want to do it?
- Of course I do.

199
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,714
It sounds good, but it makes me
very nervous.

200
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,469
It's lifted straight from
"bye bye birdie." It's a single shot.

201
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:05,666
Sal did the storyboards. I could go on,
but I don't think I should have to.

202
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,768
- Alison?
- Keen's chophouse.

203
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,172
Thank you, Don.

204
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:13,111
Tag. You're it.

205
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,837
Hey. You don't want
to cut towards yourself.

206
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,093
There we go.

207
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,470
I've got some great things in here.

208
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,704
This is

209
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,382
an exact imitation

210
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:09,143
of the gettysburg address.

211
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,147
- You know about honest abe?
- He learned to read by candlelight.

212
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,216
That's right.

213
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,022
Well, I'll be.

214
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,340
Don.

215
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,081
Look at this.

216
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,536
Victory medal, france.

217
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,289
I should have another
for beating the clap.

218
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,434
Here we are.

219
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,867
That spike...

220
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,392
It's prussian.

221
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:48,893
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

222
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,385
That's where I got him.

223
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:53,897
You see that?

224
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,864
Dried blood.

225
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:57,869
You shot him?

226
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,654
I think so. I shot lots of them.

227
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,126
They were trying to kill us.

228
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,283
- War is bad.
- Maybe,

229
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,890
but it makes a man out of you...

230
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,892
Living off the land,

231
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,331
battling the elements,

232
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:15,419
standing alongside your brothers.

233
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,192
Ask your pop.

234
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,298
What?

235
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,383
Gene, don't.

236
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,126
Come on.

237
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,893
Bobby, give it back.

238
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:27,096
Let him have it!
That's why I got it!

239
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,100
- Can't I have it?
- There was a person in that helmet.

240
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:31,768
An enemy.

241
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,082
Bobby, it's a dead man's hat.
Take it off.

242
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,408
Keep it on.

243
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:37,441
It's yours.

244
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:03,507
There was this girl...

245
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:12,354
You like?

246
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,154
It was on sale at A&S.

247
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:17,786
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

248
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,232
Kitty.

249
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:31,359
Kitty.

250
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,557
I'm working.

251
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,669
Something's wrong, isn't it?

252
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:47,468
No.

253
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:49,858
No no no, don't say that.

254
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:52,519
Don't say that.

255
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,969
I'm not myself.

256
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,307
What does that mean?

257
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:07,256
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

258
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:15,671
Please.

259
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,670
Sal...

260
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,281
The past few months...

261
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,709
Something's wrong.

262
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,422
- That's not true.
- It is true.

263
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,595
You know, I don't need
that much, but

264
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:33,997
I do need tending.

265
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:39,985
I'm so sorry.

266
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,202
Well, what can I do?

267
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,805
You won't even tell me.

268
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,706
Make some excuse.

269
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,297
For the last six months,

270
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:56,963
maybe a year even,
I've watched my job disappear.

271
00:15:57,643 --> 00:16:00,542
Nobody wants illustrations anymore.
It's all about photography.

272
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,598
And yes,

273
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,838
I've been nervous.

274
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,211
And now I have this opportunity
to do something

275
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,212
that really does have a future.

276
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,300
So it's been building to this and

277
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,112
tomorrow you will triumph

278
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,775
and come home a conquering hero.

279
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,127
What's wrong with you?

280
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:24,027
Well, I do have one

281
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,577
horrible flaw.

282
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,444
I love you.

283
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,029
I don't want to fail.

284
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:35,684
Just,

285
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:39,053
with a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

286
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,178
So what?

287
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,771
You've seen the movies. Take two.
Take three. Do it again. Action...

288
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,201
It's one shot...

289
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:47,113
The whole thing.

290
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,784
It's the beginning
of "bye bye birdie."

291
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,676
I'm trying to remember.

292
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,327
She starts singing
against a blue background

293
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:56,594
- and her voice is very girlish.
- Oh, yes.

294
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,973
- Yes, I rember that.
- She's offering us this can of

295
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:00,905
patio

296
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:03,313
and she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

297
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,650
- She's walking back and forth?
- No no.

298
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,067
She walks towards you.

299
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,154
The wind is blowing in her hair.

300
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,221
And she sings about how
patio is low in calories.

301
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,658
Then she extends her hand out

302
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,327
and she waves goodbye.

303
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,079
Then we move back too,

304
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,282
but she stops

305
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,430
and she takes her dress in her hands

306
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,668
and she runs forward
as fast as she can.

307
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,694
But then she turns her back

308
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,570
and looks seductively
over her shoulder.

309
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:36,469
The treadmill pulls her back again
and she comes towards you

310
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:37,908
one last time,

311
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,477
dancing right up to the camera.

312
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:44,146
She sort of pushes her shoulders
together, leans over with the can

313
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,473
and she smiles.

314
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,613
"Hello, patio."

315
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,299
Something like that.

316
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:56,325
Sound good?

317
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,837
It... you're gonna do great.

318
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,235
You really think so?

319
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,086
Yes.

320
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,624
Don, I'd like you
to meet horace cook.

321
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:27,929
We've met.

322
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:29,724
- Lincoln center.
- Of course.

323
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,056
Have a seat.

324
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,224
Lane has brought it to my attention
that Mr. Cooke's son has

325
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,738
approached us for work.

326
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,867
Actually, it was Don who thought
it best, out of deference,

327
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,414
to include you.

328
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,913
We're not psychiatrists.
There is no...

329
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,789
Confidentiality.

330
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,761
That's not strictly true, but

331
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,233
you are family and

332
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,003
well, it appears
to be a lot of money.

333
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:53,119
Bert seemed alarmed.

334
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,683
What exactly happened
in this meeting?

335
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:59,052
Well, you know,
your son has a dream.

336
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:00,894
Yes, jai alai.

337
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:04,228
When he first mentioned it
I assumed he was gambling,

338
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,152
but he seems convinced
of its financial potential.

339
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:10,374
- And there's no reason to doubt that.
- Are you drunk?

340
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:14,120
It's like polish handball. You can't
even play it if you're left-handed.

341
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,912
There's no wall on that side.

342
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,724
Well, then that's done with.
We needn't be involved.

343
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,201
Bert, you know that's not the way
the marketplace works.

344
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,767
A man comes through your door,
he knows what he wants,

345
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,006
he's got the money to back it up,

346
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,702
you do your best.

347
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,809
Perhaps I'm unclear

348
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:34,713
because I'm childless,
but they're not.

349
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:37,925
Well, should you

350
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,849
be lucky enough to strike gold,

351
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:44,110
remember that your children weren't
there when you were swinging the pick.

352
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,078
I've seen his plan.

353
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,722
It's gibberish.

354
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:52,856
But if you refuse him,
he'll only find someone else.

355
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,615
My son

356
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,216
livres in a cloud of success,

357
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,049
but it's my success.

358
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,574
Perhaps when that evaporates

359
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:08,725
and his face is pressed against
the reality of the sidewalk

360
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,240
he'll be of value to someone.

361
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,071
"Kill or be killed,
eat or be eaten."

362
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:21,803
That's how I was raised.

363
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:25,038
So you want us to proceed?

364
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,583
When we put that money
aside for him,

365
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,112
he was a little boy.

366
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,357
We didn't know what kind of person

367
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,813
we were making.

368
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,726
Don't be so hard on yourself.

369
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:46,077
Easy for you to say.
He doesn't have your name.

370
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,664
You'll stay for lunch.

371
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,339
There's no discussion.

372
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,389
A pleasure to see you again.

373
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,443
A pleasure.

374
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,475
- I'll sign him tonight.
- Very good.

375
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:04,789
These are ideas.

376
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,291
You can skip some if you want to,
but do not go out of order.

377
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,027
- Hello, this is margaret.
<i>- Hello,</i>

378
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,738
my name is Elaine and I'm 22.
I have a good job

379
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,139
<i>and I'm interested
in a roommate too.</i>

380
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,108
Well, it's nice
to speak with you, Elaine.

381
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,495
- Where do you work?
<i>- Well, I live</i>

382
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,604
in teaneck, New Jersey,
so I want to be in this city

383
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:34,900
to be near my job.

384
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:38,167
<i>I work in a tannery
on the west side.</i>

385
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,290
Really?

386
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:40,765
They make leather?

387
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,800
<i>I'm a secretary,</i>

388
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,542
but I am around animal skins

389
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,290
and carcasses most of the day,

390
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:47,965
so I don't keep pets.

391
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,378
<i>The smell makes them go crazy.</i>

392
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,974
I don't know if the west side is
what I had in mind.

393
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,858
<i>I need someplace
near a major hospital.</i>

394
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:02,277
<i>My face is very badly burnt</i>

395
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:04,614
and I need frequent
prescriptions for

396
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,112
<i>unguents and salves.</i>

397
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:13,455
- It would have to be two bedrooms.
<i>- Two bedrooms is good.</i>

398
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,151
Now...

399
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,227
About the bathroom,

400
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:21,430
<i>i'm going to need some help there.</i>

401
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,968
Who is this?

402
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:27,779
You know something? You're a jerk.

403
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:40,650
Why do you do that?

404
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,427
I've got a salt tooth.

405
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,529
It's right here
in the back of my mouth.

406
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,204
Grandpa.

407
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:49,993
It's getting harder to fool you.

408
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,560
I got two spoons.

409
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,914
Mommy doesn't let us
have ice cream before dinner.

410
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:59,768
Is she afraid you're gonna be fat
like she was?

411
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:04,328
Your grandma Ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

412
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:07,353
and make her walk herself home.
That put a stop to it.

413
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:09,306
You remember grandma Ruth?

414
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,041
She gave me a ukulele.

415
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,681
- Did you learn it?
- No.

416
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,892
You can, you know. You're smart.

417
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,521
You remind me of your grandma
more than your mother.

418
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:21,457
You know,

419
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:24,885
she did drafting in the'20s for this

420
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,101
engineer...

421
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:31,290
- A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.
- That's good.

422
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,413
You can really do something.

423
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,335
Don't let your mother
tell you otherwise.

424
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,642
She won't let me eat this either,
and I don't want to be the only one.

425
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,317
So I'll tell you what:

426
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,745
I'm gonna keep a lookout.

427
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,923
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

428
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,938
She's coming! Quick, hide it!

429
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,475
I knew you were gonna do that.

430
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,453
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges.

431
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:09,897
You smell that?

432
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,834
A year from now there'll be nothing
but Rum and Mexican beer in this place.

433
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,710
- You ever have Mexican beer, Humps?
- I don't drink a lot of beer.

434
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,827
You have to when you're there...

435
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:26,302
Amoeba, dysentery.

436
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:28,456
Patxi caught a bug, lost 8 lbs.

437
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:30,218
That's a lot on his frame.

438
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,522
Ho-ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedy
enjoying Jai Alai

439
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:35,912
would be a tremendous endorsement.

440
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,437
My father hates Kennedy,
because he knew old Joe

441
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,203
when they were criminals together.

442
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:42,084
Plus dad's against integration.

443
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:44,044
He called Patxi a wetback.

444
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,319
Jack kennedy certainly ended up
with a better job than his father.

445
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:53,093
I know this idea sounds crazy,
but read your history.

446
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,579
I've got a 50% chance at least.

447
00:24:57,217 --> 00:25:00,718
My father's dead,
but I know he'd be interested.

448
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:02,864
This is his kind of investment.

449
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:07,687
I think about the way
my father made his fortune,

450
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:11,519
renting ships for troop transport
during the war.

451
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,182
He didn't care about the Germans.

452
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:18,209
And then I think
I could really do something.

453
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,322
I might not be president,
but I could...

454
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:22,982
I could build something.

455
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:26,240
People will like it.
I'm going to be the father of this sport

456
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:29,970
and people are going to be dying to do
business with me, even my father.

457
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:34,552
I have this

458
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,670
image in my mind:

459
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,360
it's his

460
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,639
75th birthday

461
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:42,633
and I give him

462
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:44,801
a team.

463
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:54,980
I want to give you
a piece of advice.

464
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:59,395
I've been doing this awhile
and I applaud your enthusiasm,

465
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,685
but I think you should take
this decision a little more seriously.

466
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,190
- What are you saying, Don?
- No, let him... let him talk.

467
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,280
You have a great fortune,
and that's not just money...

468
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,755
That's the future.

469
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:17,200
We will take all of your money,
I promise you,

470
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:22,116
but I think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.

471
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,166
You can do better.

472
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,764
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

473
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,584
You zig away from me
and I zag back into your arms.

474
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:47,335
I've got the galleys
of this book by Ogilvy.

475
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,147
I learned a lot about advertising.

476
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,333
Then why aren't you
eating dinner with ogilvy?

477
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,722
'cause campbell talked me out of it.

478
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,219
Now let's get one thing straight:

479
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:03,682
if Jai Alai fails,

480
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:06,415
it's your fault.

481
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,795
- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
- Don't apologize.

482
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,131
Everybody thinks that.
Nobody says it.

483
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:29,188
Are you removing that or moving it?

484
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:32,024
Did everybody in Manhattan decide
I'm not allowed to live here?

485
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,264
No. Actually, I think the right girl
could have a very good effect on you.

486
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:40,240
I do, however,
find your ad unfortunate.

487
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,798
It's perfect.
I proofed it thoroughly.

488
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,914
"Clean, responsible, considerate.

489
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:50,125
I have some nice furniture
and a small television."

490
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,044
It reads like the stage directions
from an Ibsen play.

491
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:56,667
So what then?
You'll give me some ideas,

492
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:59,342
i'll use them and you'll all
have an even bigger laugh?

493
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,338
No, I thought I'd tell you
how to get a roommate.

494
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:03,913
This is not the way.

495
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,121
Fine.

496
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,870
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.

497
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,021
For one thing, why "Margaret"?

498
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:17,894
It's my name and it's more adult.

499
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,209
But this is about
two young girls in Manhattan.

500
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:24,849
This is about an adventure.
Am I wrong?

501
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:29,810
If this were me,
I would say something like

502
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:33,513
"fun-loving girl,
responsible sometimes.

503
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,714
Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

504
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,347
Seeks size 6 for city living
and general gallivanting.

505
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:43,047
No dull moments
or dull men tolerated."

506
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,596
Or something like that.

507
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,850
Well, thank you.
That's very helpful.

508
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:51,437
Don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

509
00:28:52,924 --> 00:28:53,960
Branch out.

510
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:56,898
Good night, peggy.

511
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:04,775
Don. There you are.

512
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,585
I was just on my way over to Lane.
I've got signatures.

513
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,712
Horace Cooke Jr. Is all dressed
and ready for the oven.

514
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,728
In light of all of the trepidation,

515
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,535
perhaps you should deliver
this to Lane yourself.

516
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,759
- Are you following me?
- I spent two years at dartmouth

517
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:29,938
hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

518
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:36,107
Mr. Hooker,

519
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:38,134
has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?

520
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,709
I'll go and get him.

521
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:44,573
That's called a cesta.
It's made of reeds from the Pyrenees.

522
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,678
The ball is called a pelota.
They just sent all this over.

523
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,475
So did Horace have anymore ideas?

524
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,312
For one thing,
he wants us to call it the N.J.A.A.

525
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,191
National Jai Alai Association?

526
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,115
He has no idea how confused America's
gonna be about that J.

527
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,906
Look at this camaraderie.

528
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:10,135
Perhaps we've discovered
America's pastime after all.

529
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,610
Full steam ahead.

530
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:13,510
Bravo, boys.

531
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:16,022
How about "Patxi:
the motion picture"?

532
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:18,167
God, I wish I was a part of this.

533
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:22,045
I've informed the home office.
There was a flutter of adding machines.

534
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,823
Well, you heard him, boys.

535
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,327
Don't stop until you see
the whites of his pockets.

536
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,468
Cosgrove.

537
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,137
Oh! Good god.

538
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:37,902
Bill it to the kid.

539
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,032
- What the hell is that?
- It's an English muffin.

540
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,255
The hell it is. Put it away.
You can eat at school.

541
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,066
I already ate my breakfast.

542
00:31:57,953 --> 00:31:59,705
Don't keep me waiting
this afternoon.

543
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,567
I want you dressed and ready for ballet
at 3:00 on the button.

544
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,334
- No dawdling.
- Okay.

545
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:08,623
I'm going to buy fruit.

546
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,508
- What do you want?
- Peaches, please.

547
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:14,672
- Peaches give me a rash.
- Your sister likes 'em.

548
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,883
Are you Peggy?

549
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:22,507
They just sent me back from reception.
I'm Karen Erickson.

550
00:32:22,632 --> 00:32:25,266
Yes, I am.
How nice to finally meet you.

551
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:28,257
You have your own office.

552
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:31,799
At the travel agency it takes years.

553
00:32:31,924 --> 00:32:34,535
Martha Winston's the only girl
and she's married to the boss.

554
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,536
Well, it's different up here.

555
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:40,107
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

556
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:44,044
You seem like someone I could really
be friends with, not like the last girl.

557
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:48,572
I'm fun and I love to have...

558
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:49,747
Fun.

559
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,306
She was always
keeping her door shut.

560
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,763
I think you should only close your door
for one reason.

561
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:56,443
What's that?

562
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,686
I just don't get along
with women like I do men,

563
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:06,133
but she left to get married, so I must
be some kind of good-luck charm.

564
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:09,527
- Do you have a steady?
- No, I'm still playing the field.

565
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,322
There are so many
interesting men out there...

566
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,742
Except sailors.
I have a couple of rules.

567
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,146
One of them is
I don't like sailors.

568
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,196
No sailors. I agree.

569
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:22,319
So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask:

570
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:24,251
are you swedish? Because I am.

571
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:26,252
Norwegian.

572
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,631
We won't tell my parents.

573
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,509
I'll make appointments
and come by at 5:00.

574
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:35,378
Or do you want your girl to do it?

575
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:37,178
I finish up around 6:00.

576
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,391
- Well, then tomorrow?
- Most days.

577
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,852
- Can we look on Saturday?
- But not this saturday.

578
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,197
- Do you work on saturday?
- Not every Saturday.

579
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:48,942
And Saturday nights never.
I'm out in the city, ready for fun.

580
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:52,195
Well, okay. I'll call you, roomie.

581
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,365
I got you a sandwich.

582
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,954
- I'm gonna walk around the park.
- Well, have fun, roomie.

583
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,707
It's mommy.

584
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,775
- Where's grandpa Gene?
- It must've slipped his mind.

585
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,368
Where is he?

586
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:33,054
Probably at home.

587
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,281
I'm sure he'll be there
when we get home.

588
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,387
<i>Bye bye, sugar.</i>

589
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,788
<i>Hello, Patio!</i>

590
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,352
<i>When the cake is</i>

591
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,906
<i>on the plate</i>

592
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,241
<i>i'm afraid</i>

593
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:11,056
<i>to gain the weight</i>

594
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:12,569
<i>but now</i>

595
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,343
<i>I have some extra room.</i>

596
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,055
<i>Patio,</i>

597
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,020
<i>you make me swoon.</i>

598
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:22,558
<i>Diet cola tastes divine
get your own,</i>

599
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:25,747
<i>'cause this one's mine
it's the brand new slender you.</i>

600
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,021
<i>Now we'll have you singing too!</i>

601
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:37,491
<i>It's great to see you go.</i>

602
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,867
I can't even tell you
how thorough Sal was.

603
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,805
Well, I appreciate that,
but this is...

604
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,006
I don't know. This is not
what I thought it was gonna be.

605
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,992
I'm glad i'm not alone.

606
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,329
Look, I don't think
there's any ambiguity

607
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:17,272
about this being exactly...

608
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:19,551
And I mean exactly...
What you asked for.

609
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:23,196
I know, but there's something
not right about it.

610
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:24,868
What?

611
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,809
I can't put my finger on it.

612
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,807
I wish I could but I can't.

613
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:31,306
It's an exact copy...

614
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:32,681
Frame for frame.

615
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:34,432
I'll tell you what:

616
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:36,919
why don't we send a dupe
back to the office with you?

617
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:38,906
No. I'm sorry.

618
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:41,406
I wish I could explain it,

619
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:43,374
but it's just not right.

620
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,795
I'm gonna be magnanimous
and say it's our idea

621
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,170
and our failure,

622
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,499
but it is a failure.

623
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,377
That is magnanimous.

624
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,758
- I'm sorry about that.
- Maybe next time.

625
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,250
It's true. It's not right.

626
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,269
It doesn't make any sense.
It looks right.

627
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,112
It sounds right, smells right.

628
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:14,056
Something's not right. What is it?

629
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,214
It's not Ann Margret.

630
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,661
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

631
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,385
Yes, may I help you?

632
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:45,803
Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt?

633
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:47,723
Yes, I am. What is it?

634
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,315
We regret to inform you
that he passed away.

635
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,310
God.

636
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:54,975
I'm fine.

637
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,984
What happened?

638
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,851
He collapsed in line at the A&P.

639
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:02,820
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

640
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:14,541
We need to know what you'd like to do
with his body.

641
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,537
Yes, of course.

642
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,415
<i>Mr. Romano's here to see you.</i>

643
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,712
Send him in.

644
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,618
I figured i'd bring myself
to the woodshed.

645
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,928
It must be horrible having
a client insist on something

646
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,139
and then change their mind
once they've seen it.

647
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,874
I hope it never happens to me.

648
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:59,618
I was the director
and I let you down.

649
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:04,917
- I'm in a meeting.
- I have Mrs. Draper on the line.

650
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,142
It's urgent.

651
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,102
I can go.

652
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,740
What's the matter?

653
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,334
I'm sorry, Betts.

654
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:27,573
I'm very sorry.

655
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:31,431
Do you want me to call William?

656
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:35,869
Just stay put.

657
00:39:35,994 --> 00:39:37,444
I'll be right there.

658
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,503
- I have to go.
- Is everything okay?

659
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,554
There's nothing you can do.

660
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:49,494
Don't ruin the only good thing
to come of this.

661
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,920
You are now a commercial director.

662
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:58,241
How do I know you're not just saying
that to make me feel better?

663
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,616
You'll know when

664
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,230
I hire you again.

665
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:03,616
Alison, I'm going for the day.

666
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,196
Oh my goodness.

667
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,366
It's beautiful.

668
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,950
Is that all
the noise that this was?

669
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:22,890
Why didn't you wait
for Gerry to help?

670
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,452
Because he's playing cards
and Peggy gets up early.

671
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:26,756
Say thank you, ma.

672
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:28,927
Thank you, sweetheart.

673
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:32,913
An Admiral. You must be doing well.

674
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:34,827
I am.

675
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,916
What's the matter, peaches?

676
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,103
Sit down, ma.

677
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,989
What's this about?

678
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,540
Don't, Anita.

679
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,204
Stay.

680
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,533
Ma, I'm having problems
with my apartment,

681
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:57,454
my commute is very long and...

682
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,374
It doesn't mean nothing
if you want to stay here with us.

683
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,130
Your father and I lived with grandma
and grandpa for years.

684
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,816
Your sister was born there.

685
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:10,591
Ma, I'm getting an apartment
in Manhattan.

686
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,057
That makes sense.

687
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:20,172
It really does.

688
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:24,189
I guess i'm the kind of mother who would
rather have a new tv than a daughter.

689
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,732
I got you a new tv
because you need one.

690
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:29,921
You got me a new tv 'cause you think
I was born yesterday.

691
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:31,946
You belong in the city.

692
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,173
Do you see this, Anita?
This is what they do.

693
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:36,548
Family is cheap.

694
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,244
Take it back, okay?

695
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:41,413
Because it's just gonna remind me of
how stupid you think I am.

696
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,274
Ma! You knew she'd have to move
there eventually.

697
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,174
Someday both of youse is
gonna feel this,

698
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:55,299
this... this broken heart
i'm carrying.

699
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,298
You'll get raped, you know that?

700
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:05,521
It's just as dangerous as here,

701
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:08,567
and I'm going to have a roommate.
She's a nice girl.

702
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,490
Her name is karen erickson.
She's norwegian.

703
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,656
- There's a man, isn't there?
- No.

704
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:17,462
Why would I ever believe
anything you say?

705
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,625
Stop it, ma. You're being cruel.

706
00:42:23,114 --> 00:42:24,364
Good night, ma.

707
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,249
That wasn't so bad.

708
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:37,677
Really?

709
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:41,050
She's been through
a lot of change lately.

710
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:44,113
The holy father dying...
That was very hard on her.

711
00:43:00,516 --> 00:43:02,501
Eugene Hofstadt #2.

712
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:12,314
What does that mean?

713
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,858
There were two Eugene Hofstadts
at his bank,

714
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,182
so he had to be called
Eugene Hofstadt #2.

715
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:24,372
He's with ruth now.

716
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:26,865
I hope so.

717
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:31,191
Once he asked,

718
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:35,226
"what's gonna happen when I get
to heaven and I have two wives?"

719
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:40,033
Knowing Gloria, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

720
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,627
Betts, don't eat that.
It was in his car all day.

721
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:52,889
I don't care.

722
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,884
- Why are you laughing?
- Sally sweetheart...

723
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,929
- We weren't laughing, honey.
- I heard you.

724
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:02,388
I heard you laughing.

725
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,990
How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?

726
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:09,395
Like he's not gone?
He was here, now he's not here.

727
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,022
He's gone forever
and nobody even knows that.

728
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,091
Stop it.

729
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:16,148
You're being hysterical. Calm down.

730
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:17,401
He's dead!

731
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:20,115
He's dead and he's never
coming back!

732
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,241
And nobody cares

733
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:24,868
that he's really
really really gone!

734
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,830
Sally, go watch tv.
