<i>Previously on Mad Men.</i>

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:05,540
I don't care what you do,
I just don't want you here.

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:08,257
- I'm at the Roosevelt.
- I'm sorry about that.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,301
It goes without saying
that this is personal.

5
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:11,677
Of course.

6
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,473
- You aren't just another woman, Joan. *
- That doesn't matter now, does it?

7
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,433
I fall in love.

8
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,935
Daddy, Don and I want you
to live here with us.

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,982
He's living me for his secretary.
He's in love.

10
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:27,318
Don, I can explain.

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,103
I want her off my desk.

12
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:59,413
Synchro: zelda-zelda

13
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,441
Season 3 Episode 3
<i>My Old Kentucky Home</i>

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,528
And after that I played
the nurse in "Romeo and Juliet."

15
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:15,275
And after that I played
Dorine the maid in "Tartuffe"

16
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,786
by Moliere.

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,997
And I guess that's it.

18
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,679
Thank you, Hillary.

19
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,375
I'd love it if you could do
the twist one more time.

20
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,895
Thank you, hillary.
We'll let you know.

21
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,507
You are not in this process.
You're a spectator. Don't forget it.

22
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,940
Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday
to see if daiquiri beach has legs.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,723
Don wants copy Monday
morning and art Monday night.

24
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,606
- We should probably have the{\whole}team.
- This weekend?

25
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:59,057
- I'm sorry, but we just heard about it.
- Bullshit.

26
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:01,787
I have plans. I really do.

27
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,467
Well, I would love to work all weekend,
but I'm just a spectator.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,742
Whose crack did it fall through?
Because you are going to spend

29
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:11,458
- the weekend being our slave.
- No finger-pointing.

30
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,592
The bad news is they need
five more vacation situations

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,343
for bacardi rum.

32
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,915
The good news is we're going
to be out of your hair.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,625
Jane and roger sterling's
garden party on the island.

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,727
Derby day.

35
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,625
- You're going back in time?
- Are any of you wearing seersucker?

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,632
I don't want to look
like a barbershop quartet.

37
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:29,763
- You're all going?
- I really wish I wasn't.

38
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,410
Well, then don't. Give me
your glasses. I'll go as you.

39
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:33,772
Sorry about that.

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,289
- Good luck, gentiles.
- Sorry.

41
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:42,187
You know,
we all started at the same time.

42
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,764
I've been here
six years longer than you.

43
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,297
They hate creative.

44
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,061
My goodness.
I didn't expect to see you here.

45
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:04,066
- For a little while longer.
- Lovely to see you, Jane.

46
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,646
I mean, mrs. Sterling.

47
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,022
I'll catch up with you, girls.

48
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,196
I just stopped by.
Roger had my rings resized.

49
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,141
I keep losing weight.

50
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,668
- Where are you living now?
- Same old place, but we're looking.

51
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,497
We're thinking about Riverdale.

52
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,789
It's near columbia pres
and Greg wants a yard.

53
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know. I get a nosebleed
anywhere above 86th street.

54
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,931
- God, it's so great to see you.
- Likewise.

55
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:39,468
Joan, I have a tiny favor
to ask you.

56
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,513
They're doing construction in front of
the building and my driver's gonna be

57
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,546
circling,*. So if you could have
one of the girls run down

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,559
at 1:15 and flag him down.

59
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:51,937
Hello, ginger.

60
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:04,085
Olive, from now on there's no need
to include Mr. Crane in casting.

61
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,212
Of course.

62
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,747
And I brought you tea and coffee. I'll
just have whichever one you don't want.

63
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,294
I have coffee.

64
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,210
That's what I usually drink.
That's what I've been drinking, right?

65
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,498
Lola said you don't like a second cup of
coffee because it makes you edgy.

66
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,633
I want you to forget everything
lola told you.

67
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:31,457
I left for an hour to go get the nylons
for tomorrow, and look what happened.

68
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,857
Carla said he thought
he was on K.P. Duty.

69
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,745
- We don't have to go, you know.
- I said we would.

70
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,507
It's Roger and Jane.

71
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,681
I want to go. I bought a dress.

72
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,370
"The warmth of the climate
disposed the natives...

73
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:59,758
to the most intemperate enjoyment
of tranquility and opulence,

74
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,964
and the lively licen...

75
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,120
- licent...
- Licentiousness.

76
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:09,551
Go ahead.

77
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,181
"Of the greeks was blended

78
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,815
With the hereditary softness
of the syrians.

79
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,053
Fashion was the only law,

80
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,560
pleasure was the only pursuit

81
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,233
and the splendor of dress
and furniture

82
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,786
was the only distinction
of the citizens of antioch."

83
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,337
- Gene.
- Well, hello, Don.

84
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,394
- How's babylon?
- Bedtime.

85
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,105
It's all right. Go wash your teeth.

86
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,519
You just wait.
All hell's gonna break loose.

87
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,273
Good night, grandpa gene.

88
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:08,040
- Like that.
- Paul kinsey with the two-stroke lead.

89
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:11,413
- What is your secret?
- I use Harry Crane's paddle,

90
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,372
And I pretend that's his fat head.

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,354
- What kind of fruit do you put in this?
- It's rum and coke. I don't know.

92
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:21,630
A cherry? All we have is olives.

93
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:24,225
New drinks, new copy or both?

94
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,853
Bikinis that match the drinks
and new copy. Something cute.

95
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,559
It's bacardi-licious.

96
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:36,321
It's bacardi-lightful.

97
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,463
We're supposed to sit here
and pretend like we're on vacation?

98
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:43,236
They're probably drinking
mint juleps.

99
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,474
Booze puts me to sleep.

100
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,716
I will take grass any hour
of the day. It helps me think.

101
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,663
When I was at Princeton,

102
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,588
I wrote my senior thesis
on the passions of the stoics.

103
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,580
Mary jane was my muse.

104
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,059
Paul helps me sleep.

105
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,208
Peggy, go get a blender.

106
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,131
- Maybe we can turn this into a frappe.
- You get it.

107
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:05,944
I'm eating.

108
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,474
Olive?

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,696
- What are you doing here?
- Well, if you're working, I'm working.

110
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:30,282
It's okay for you to go home.

111
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,376
I already canceled my plans.

112
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,255
Phil and I were going to drive up
to the cloisters. And steven, my son

113
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,292
he's at Boston College, was thinking
of coming down with his girlfriend, but

114
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,462
I'm not sure that's working out.
He's picky.

115
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:49,185
Anyway, so Phil's taking a trip
to the dump and here I am,

116
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,847
no worse for wear.

117
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,464
Don't I seem as important
as cosgrove?

118
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,457
I mean, Campbell makes
sense to the manner born.

119
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,544
- So you like to get high?
- Whenever I can.

120
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:10,301
My cousin used to know someone,
but he got married.

121
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,638
Who's your friend?

122
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,994
A guy like you? There must
be somebody you can call.

123
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,799
No. Of course.

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,337
Sally, get up here.

125
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,220
I just walked backwards all
the way from the living room.

126
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:34,996
Zip.

127
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,675
You look pretty.

128
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,154
I look like an open umbrella.

129
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,565
Grandpa says
that you're going to a soiree.

130
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,367
Don't bother him.

131
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:49,498
Go watch tv.

132
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,412
- Grandpa?
- I'm indisposed.

133
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,551
What are you doing?
You're going to break it.

134
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,814
- Who told you that?
- I've done it.

135
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:36,450
If it happens, I'll go get my little
screwdriver and put on a new one.

136
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:41,456
Jesus, I stink.

137
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:44,833
I can finish up out here.
You take a nice, long bath.

138
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,145
No. No no no. Eddinger
goes at the head of the table.

139
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:55,076
He's the chief of surgery.
It's where he always sits.

140
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,464
Not in your home, Greg.

141
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,872
Host at the head, hostess at the foot
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen

142
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,116
- and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl.
- Who says?

143
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,852
Emily Post. Everyone.

144
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:07,692
Ronald Eddinger does not read Emily
Post. He's going to expect to sit there

145
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,774
And he's going to expect me and
rick stoller to be his footstools.

146
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,722
I won't have their wives think your{\have a}wife
{\who}doesn't know how to set a table.

147
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,658
I don't want to have
a fight right now.

148
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,115
Then stop talking.

149
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:27,454
A buffet would be slightly more casual
and people could sit where they will.

150
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:31,094
And we could put the chafing dish
that they gave us right in the middle.

151
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:33,665
Perfect.

152
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:53,846
<i>In state news, governor rockefeller
is being urged to appoint</i>

153
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:57,766
<i>a special prosecutor to investigate the
scandal-ridden state liquor authority.</i>

154
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,456
Is she here?

155
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,170
Look at you.

156
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,446
I know I look good for my condition,
but I'm still in my condition.

157
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,596
- Did they leave yet?
- I think they're in the living room.

158
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,919
Well, I've been robbed.
I had it right here and now I don't.

159
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,404
Daddy, what are you talking about?

160
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,932
I had $35. Now I have $30.

161
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,411
- Are you sure?
- Mr. Hofstadt,

162
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,228
Why don't you go sit down
and we'll all look for it?

163
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:33,517
- You'll look for it, will you?
- Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.

164
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:36,215
I'm missing $5.

165
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:38,949
I'll give you $5.

166
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,350
Don, will you give him something?

167
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:45,454
Here, Gene. Here you go.

168
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,540
No, I don't want your money.

169
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:51,085
You people, you think money
is the answer to every problem.

170
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,071
No, just this particular problem.

171
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,379
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I don't know what you want.

172
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,591
I want my $5!

173
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:03,722
Well, I think I am finally
ready to go.

174
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,112
Come on, let's go out in the yard.

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,926
I forgot how many tourists
are in midtown.

176
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,450
They're like vermin.

177
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,690
Jeffrey,
this is my colleague Smitty.

178
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:27,722
- How you doing, Jeff?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

179
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,790
So what do you have for us?

180
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,094
What do you want?

181
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,628
I've got dexies,
benzedrine strips, boo.

182
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,998
Probably get you junk
if you really wanted it.

183
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,509
- How do you know each other?
- Jeffrey's an old friend.

184
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,220
You're looking at the two
great cocksmen of Princeton'55.

185
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,787
Oh, the times you must have had.

186
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,648
Can we buy some dope?

187
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:54,282
I'll give you all four
for $10, plus delivery.

188
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,084
I'm just kidding, but I should.

189
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,170
I mean, you never call me.

190
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,995
When's the last time I saw you?

191
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:07,285
- Give me your sweater.
- It's mohair.

192
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,292
- May I?
- Relax.

193
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,424
Sit down.

194
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:27,597
You ever look out this window?

195
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,746
It's beautiful.

196
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,256
Nice to see you both.
Isn't it something?

197
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,150
Betty, you remember Trudy.

198
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,277
Harry Crane. My wife Jennifer.

199
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:07,387
Ken Cosgrove. We've... we've met.

200
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,599
- Nice to see you all again.
- When are you due?

201
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,382
Any minute. Can't you tell?

202
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,986
That last month was the worse.

203
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,691
- But of course this is your second.
- Third.

204
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:23,450
- How old is yours?
- Eight months. Beatrice grace.

205
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,895
Should we take a tour?

206
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,454
- I grew up in a club just like this.
- Me too.

207
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:42,179
That portly fellow
in the glen plaid...

208
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:43,507
Second at dupont.

209
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,534
The one next to him, pan am.

210
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,483
Don't hand out your card.

211
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,511
Now you're getting ridiculous.

212
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:08,448
- Maybe it fell out of your pocket.
- It didn't.

213
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,701
- Well, I didn't take it.
- I didn't say you did.

214
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,411
Not yet.

215
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,988
Will you stop it, Viola?

216
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,641
My name's not Viola. It's Carla.

217
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,710
Do you know Viola?

218
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,502
We don't all know each other,
Mr. Hofstadt.

219
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,399
Are you done looking already?

220
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:33,348
Really?

221
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:06,223
Are they still here?

222
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,049
Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.

223
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,303
I know what they're doing.
You don't want to go in there.

224
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,718
- What are they doing?
- All I'm saying is

225
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:17,767
they obviously don't want to
work, so you should just go home.

226
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,663
I love the commercials where the dog
runs right up to the bowl of food.

227
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,570
How do you make him do that?
You starve him?

228
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,369
So you two got a lot of girls?

229
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:38,663
Shit.

230
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,456
Is that that old lady again?

231
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:43,918
- Let me in.
- Go away.

232
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,641
It stinks out here.

233
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:49,790
Come in quick.

234
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:53,399
What are you doing?

235
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,182
I know what you're doing.
Who are you?

236
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,685
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton,'55.

237
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,396
Look, I need it for inspiration.

238
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,650
It's Saturday, for god's sake.

239
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,873
You can go home. We'll do the work.

240
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,238
Are you kidding?
We'll end up with nothing.

241
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,187
I've got some ideas
we can kick around,

242
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,578
but you're gonna have to tell me
your name, sweetheart.

243
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:25,335
I'm Peggy Olson, and I want
to smoke some marijuana.

244
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,015
You won't like it.

245
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:31,386
How do you know what I'll like? You
never ask me how I feel about anything

246
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:34,201
except brassieres,
body odor and makeup.

247
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,975
I'd like to know how you
feel about a lot of things.

248
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,853
- Jesus. Give it a rest.
- Come on.

249
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,707
It's just like a strong cigarette.

250
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,996
Can you believe this?

251
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,398
Can we go?

252
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:55,275
What about the horse race?
What about supper?

253
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,567
Don't disappear. I want to dance.

254
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,686
I did this at home threw
on a little shoe polish.

255
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,249
- She thought it was a scream.
- I love it.

256
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,692
Can I get an old-fashioned?

257
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,065
We're on the same mission.

258
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,135
This bar looks like
it was set up by a blind man,

259
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:40,142
And there's no bourbon.

260
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,378
There's a hole at the end here.

261
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,814
I don't have a lot of time.

262
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:57,998
Rye okay with you?

263
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,535
You look like you know
what you're doing.

264
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,350
I'm Connie, by the way.

265
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,332
Service always this good around here?

266
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,276
- You're not a member either?
- No no.

267
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:16,218
Nice piece of property, though.

268
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,925
Who are you hiding from?

269
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,304
I am at work disguised as a party.

270
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm at work disguised as a wedding.

271
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,820
I hate other people's weddings.

272
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,835
- Why's that?
- Make me nervous,

273
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,881
All those expectations.

274
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,364
And these poor kids in here.

275
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,871
That is a match made
in the boardroom.

276
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,139
When I was a boy,

277
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:53,334
there was a mansion on the river
I used to paddle by in my johnboat.

278
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,664
The twinkling lights,

279
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,758
Violins, girls giggling
about something.

280
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:11,010
It's different inside.

281
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:17,321
Where you from?

282
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,969
San Antonio, New Mexico.

283
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,178
Before it was a state.

284
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:23,840
Don't ask me that

285
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:24,824
old.

286
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,952
You look fit.

287
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,059
You ever see

288
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:33,100
"a midsummer dream"
with Mickey Rooney?

289
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,168
"A midsummer night's dream"?

290
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,621
By golly, you're prickly.

291
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:42,325
I'm republican,
like everyone else in there.

292
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,411
But somehow,

293
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:47,097
no matter how expensive my cufflinks,

294
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,957
I feel like I've got
the head of a jackass.

295
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,036
Where I grew up,
there was a roadhouse.

296
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,794
It boasted live music
that meant a drum,

297
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,820
a bass and a player piano
with nobody at it.

298
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:05,482
I parked cars.

299
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:08,485
Fancy people would go there.

300
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,820
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk,

301
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,724
but they wouldn't let me
use the toilet.

302
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,196
So when nature called

303
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:20,338
I'd open up a trunk
and relieve myself.

304
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,257
You didn't.

305
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,086
I was 15.

306
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,147
There's probably some kid out
there doing it to us right now.

307
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,582
Where you come from?

308
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,186
Pennsylvania by way of Illinois.

309
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:40,483
We lost our farm,
ended up in coal country.

310
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:43,069
And here you are.

311
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,991
A pleasure to meet you, Don.

312
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:50,034
Hell of a cocktail.

313
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,668
Rum. Have some.

314
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:16,269
Some rum?

315
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,023
If you were feeling it,
you'd be hungry.

316
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,692
I am hungry,
but it's not worth moving.

317
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,821
She is a riot.
Makes me wish I had a job.

318
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:29,282
Bacardi Eisenhower.

319
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:36,954
What are you laughing about?

320
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,592
You do have a job, jeffrey.

321
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,878
You're a drug pusher.

322
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,567
What is that, an english accent?

323
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,235
It's a little different
than freshman year.

324
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,881
Kinsey was a real jersey.

325
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,486
I guess
that's why they have scholarships.

326
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:03,529
Get out.

327
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:09,830
You're arrogant.

328
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:11,775
And you know what else?

329
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:13,576
You can't sing.

330
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,329
Take it back.

331
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,540
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here not to fight.

332
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,667
Take it back, graves.

333
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,731
Fine. I guess they kicked
you out of the tigertones

334
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:27,624
because you were too tall.

335
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,249
Graves.

336
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,312
We're done here.

337
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:35,815
And by the way,
I left the tones because I had mono.

338
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:38,610
Fine.

339
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:41,687
Why don't you sing a little
and let them be the judge?

340
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:36,529
I am so high.

341
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,377
I wish you were waiting for me.

342
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:54,886
So who are you waiting for?

343
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,082
A friend.

344
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:03,827
What is that like?

345
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,901
I don't know.
I don't think about it.

346
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,572
Right now it's uncomfortable,
mostly.

347
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:17,575
But it moves around in there.

348
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:19,911
It does.

349
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,818
I'm going to blame
this on martinis, but...

350
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:29,419
May I?

351
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:52,027
She's not moving now.

352
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,241
- Who are you waiting for?
- My date.

353
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:02,176
You can't show up
to these things stag,

354
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:04,872
but then you run into people.

355
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:16,257
I apologize. There was a line for
the mirror and I feel like I'm melting.

356
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,386
No trouble at all.

357
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,003
I hope they start playing some real
music. I'm here to dance, aren't you?

358
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:28,354
Martinis.

359
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,864
Please, don't stand
on ceremony, dig in.

360
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:37,863
I'll cut the cheese.

361
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,295
What are you laughing about?

362
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,417
Everything is some private joke
with them.

363
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,490
What were you giggling about
the other day?

364
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:50,000
- A code pink.
- What's that?

365
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,177
They put a call over the p. A.

366
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:54,797
whenever there's an attractive
unconscious female.

367
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,926
- I've never heard of that.
- Me either.

368
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,212
Sounds like where I work.

369
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:05,508
- I'm gonna check the roast.
- You need a hand?

370
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,858
- I don't think so.
- Nonsense.

371
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,527
You really have a lovely place.

372
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,656
I'm glad you like it.
I did most of it myself.

373
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,685
You must do well.

374
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,120
It's not easy.
Not that I'm complaining.

375
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,606
You think they make no money now?

376
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,551
You should've seen back when
Ronald and I were first married.

377
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,225
I taught kindergarten and
made three times what Ron did.

378
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,129
We lived in a pit.

379
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:40,065
But one day you'll look
back on this time and smile.

380
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,303
- Just don't get pregnant.
- Excuse me?

381
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:47,094
The last thing you want right now
is a child.

382
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:50,351
I told her the same thing, but
she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.

383
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:55,566
You do what you want. If Greg becomes
chief resident, things will get easier.

384
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:59,799
The fact that Greg can get
a woman like you,

385
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:02,782
makes me feel good about his
future, no matter what happens.

386
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,653
Bobby, sally, suppertime!

387
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:20,593
You have to eat something.

388
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:24,895
- You don't tell me what to do.
- You either eat

389
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,390
you don't eat,
But there'll be no more of that.

390
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,878
I told you I'm not hungry.

391
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:37,149
- I want my money.
- You don't even know that you lost it.

392
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:40,986
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!

393
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:10,240
Grandpa, is this it?

394
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,376
Grandpa, is this your money?

395
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,042
I don't know.

396
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,437
Let me see it.

397
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,699
That's it, all right.

398
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,977
Well, that's a relief. Sally,
your food's getting cold.

399
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,093
Why, thank you.

400
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:34,357
He's pretending like we didn't
have a fight on the way over.

401
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:37,840
- He seems amenable right now.
- I warned him that with this set

402
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,493
there was a good chance
one of my old beaus might appear.

403
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:42,608
- And yet they didn't.
- Which is a relief.

404
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:49,770
I don't want to. All I have to talk
about is work, which is verboten.

405
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:52,016
That's nonsense.
You're very charming.

406
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:53,834
Come on. I'll talk.

407
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:56,881
They want to know
we're having a good time.

408
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:09,209
We're really having a good time.

409
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,048
Haven't seen you two
on the dance floor.

410
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,352
Oh, I don't move that well right now.

411
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,488
Don loves to dance,

412
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,148
But I think I'm disappointing him
because I don't feel like it.

413
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:27,240
Your asses are going to
wear out those chairs.

414
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:32,243
Don, Betty,
this is Henry Francis and...

415
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:35,703
- Sherry Ardmore.
- Henry works in the governor's office.

416
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,497
Don Draper. This is my wife Betty.

417
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,521
Hank, tell them where
you were this afternoon.

418
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,385
They're gonna read about it
in the paper.

419
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,279
He just came from pocantico.
Rockefeller married happy.

420
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:51,635
She just got divorced a month ago.
She has four children.

421
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,383
You see? That's the first reaction.

422
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,391
Divorce is political hari-kari.

423
00:32:58,257 --> 00:33:00,122
Now we'll be stuck with goldwater.

424
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,407
The primaries are still
a long way off.

425
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:05,482
- Why did Rocky marry her?
- They're in love.

426
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:16,243
We're going to dance. Betty, Don,
are you sure you're not up for it?

427
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:38,541
I have got to bring a date next time.

428
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,108
"This is the way the world ends.

429
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,887
This is the way the world ends.

430
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,131
This is the way the world ends

431
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:03,726
Not with a bang but a whimper."

432
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:07,046
We got it you're educated

433
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,599
And you sang in the tiger...

434
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:11,734
- What are they called?
- Tigertones.

435
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,273
I went to the university of michigan.

436
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,744
I went to
miss Deaver's secretarial school.

437
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:24,121
Can you believe her?

438
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:27,722
I keep thinking about rum,
I keep thinking about cuba

439
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:30,802
and I keep thinking about
how we're all going to die.

440
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:34,378
- We almost died.
- But we didn't.

441
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,176
How about something about life?

442
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,777
Let's go on the roof.

443
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,415
And do what?

444
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,643
Think about daiquiri beach.
We need five more situations for rum.

445
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,990
On the roof is a good idea, actually.

446
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:55,059
A hammock right between
the clotheslines.

447
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:58,214
And you still say daiquiri beach.

448
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,282
Are you working?

449
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,464
I think so.

450
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,503
You both can leave.

451
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:18,107
I'm in a very good place right now.

452
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,939
You left your purse in
your office unattended.

453
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:44,284
- Someone could have stolen it.
- No one's here.

454
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,677
You think I don't know
what you've been doing in there?

455
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:54,607
- I don't know what to say.
- I've got nothing to hide.

456
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:57,085
You're free to do
whatever you want, but

457
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:59,675
you're not thinking about
your future.

458
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,592
The thing is

459
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:05,964
I have a job.

460
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:09,685
I have my own office
with my name on the door,

461
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,896
And I have a secretary.

462
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:14,772
That's you.

463
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,987
And I am not scared of any of this.

464
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,027
But you're scared.

465
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:30,664
Oh my god.

466
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,135
You're scared.

467
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,865
Don't worry about me.

468
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,001
I am going to get to do everything

469
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:44,894
you want for me.

470
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,556
I'm going to be fine, Olive.

471
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:52,917
I really am.

472
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:01,886
Your expense report is ready
for your review. It's on your desk.

473
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,785
I need you to get the dictaphone set up

474
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,437
and I need a glass of water,
and then you can go.

475
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,943
That's very pretty.

476
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,952
Thank you.

477
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,752
- When are you due?
- Early september.

478
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,708
You and the first lady.

479
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,251
- Well, I think she looks a lot better.
- You could dress like that.

480
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,765
Go to Lord & Taylor and ask
for my friend Bunny appelle.

481
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,707
- She'll take care of you.
- You really know everything Joan.

482
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,130
Honey,

483
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,041
would you talk to your husband? I don't
know what I'm going to do next year.

484
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,208
He is going to be
a tough act to follow.

485
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,032
Those people in Texas will
be crawling all over you.

486
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,801
If I ever need a
pneumonectomy, that's the man.

487
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,804
You heard me say it, great hands.

488
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:15,546
Look, Greg,
it's a complicated operation.

489
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,146
- Oh, christ, that's not what I meant.
- It happens.

490
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,264
What happened?

491
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:24,423
I don't like to worry Joanie
about those kinds of things.

492
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,497
Oh, come on. Everyone gets a
bad result every once in a while.

493
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:31,729
You know what?

494
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:34,329
Enough shop talk.
This is not civilian conversation.

495
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:38,565
Do you want to play charades?

496
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:41,628
- Come on. You're terrible.
- No, I'm not.

497
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:46,025
Well, Joanie has many many talents.

498
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:47,921
You should play for them.

499
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,095
- No.
- Come on. I'll go get it.

500
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:55,642
- You're all gonna love this.
- What do you play?

501
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,020
I am out of practice.

502
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,798
- Come on, Joanie.
- Wonderful!

503
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,984
Come on, just sing a little something.

504
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:10,533
It'll be just like the olden days.

505
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,668
We used to sit in the parlor
after supper.

506
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,053
My mother would play the piano
while we read.

507
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,396
Just let me have another
bite and then we can go.

508
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:33,093
I guess we're the last ones to eat.

509
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:36,363
- That's what my mother always said.
- Family holds back.

510
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:43,477
You shouldn't be filling your
plate. You're the hostess.

511
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,972
- I'll get you some food.
- Come on. Come on.

512
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,673
You should sit down.

513
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:52,092
Oh my god! You're pregnant.

514
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:55,270
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

515
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:57,532
Don't you just love looking at her?

516
00:41:57,657 --> 00:41:59,984
Aren't they a beautiful couple?

517
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:03,478
I knew you two would
get back together.

518
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,482
I never had any doubt,
no matter what the problem was.

519
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:11,695
I'll take care of her.

520
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:20,062
You don't like me.

521
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:23,264
I'm a nice person.

522
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,063
What's going on here?

523
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,174
I should've eaten something.

524
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:39,514
Will someone please get her
a glass of milk?

525
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:42,390
Don, can I talk to you for a second?

526
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,859
- What the hell was that?
- Your wife's drunk.

527
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,417
I don't know what I did
to get under your skin.

528
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:00,793
Roger, it's late.

529
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:05,376
You know, my mother was right:

530
00:43:05,742 --> 00:43:08,332
It's a mistake to be
conspicuously happy.

531
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,130
Some people don't like it.

532
00:43:11,582 --> 00:43:13,441
No one thinks you're happy.

533
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:15,975
They think you're foolish.

534
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:23,468
You know, that's the great thing
about a place like this

535
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,322
You can come here and be happy,

536
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:28,872
and you get to choose your guests.

537
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,086
Good night, grandpa.

538
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:53,398
Get in here.

539
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:02,655
Sit down.

540
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:24,077
Where were we?

541
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,744
"The rustic manners of a prince

542
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,672
who disdained such glory,

543
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:47,074
and was insensible
of such happiness,

544
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,837
soon disgusted

545
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:52,481
the delicacy of his subjects

546
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:55,433
and the effeminate orientals

547
00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:57,319
could neither imitate nor admire

548
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,333
the severe simplicity

549
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,450
which julian always maintained
and sometimes affected."
