00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,709
Previously on Mad Men.

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,000
I want you to spend the all night.

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,675
He's living me for his secretary.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,965
I will never be a surgeron.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,974
You're not gonna be able
to leave your job.

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,575
- That's done.
- Get another one.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,275
The will's transparent or something
according to the lawyers.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,099
You run the show.
All do you care about is the house.

9
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:19,935
His name is Dick,

10
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,397
after a wish his mother
should've lived to see.

11
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:00,843
Synchro: zelda-zelda

12
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,674
Season 3 Episode 11
<i>The Gypsy And The Hobo</i>

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,275
They sell it at woolworth's.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,475
There's a section that says
"halloween costumes."

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,000
You'll wear it once. Plus
it's made out of plastic and it's crap.

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm always gonna love minnie mouse.

17
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm gonna be an astronaut.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,221
- Didn't you hear me? The luggage.
- I'll go get it.

19
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,375
That's not the point.
They don't listen.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,075
There's more? It's a week.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,980
We're going for a week?
Are we gonna miss halloween?

22
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,649
Hey have halloween there.
You'll go with your cousins.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,850
Say goodbye to your father,
Then get the bags.

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
They have a woolworth's
in philly, too.

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,790
I only have $40.

26
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,461
Swing by the bank. There should be
at least $200 in your checking.

27
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,005
- That's plenty.
- You have no more money?

28
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:15,500
Take care.

29
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,806
Roger, I think you remember...

30
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,565
Annabelle.

31
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,400
You look wonderful.

32
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,148
You look exactly the same.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,113
- This is annabelle... What is it again?
- Mathis.

34
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:39,575
I can't tell if you two know
each other or not.

35
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,700
Hello.

36
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,287
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.

37
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,064
How the hell were you
in town and not look me up?

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,005
I wasn't sure about coming back here.
I'm running the company now.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,580
- You divorced what's-His-Name?
- No, david died,

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,350
And because of my father's will
the company went back to me.

41
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,225
51 years old. Lung cancer.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,350
That's too bad.

44
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:12,107
So...

45
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,674
So yes, if you're open to it.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,950
Caldecott farms,
I'm sure you've heard,

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,951
had a public relations crisis
followed by disastrous sales.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,652
- I hadn't heard.
- "The Misfits", the movie, Clark Gable.

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,124
It was about horses
being turned into dog food.

50
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,668
There was an expose.

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,754
We were singled out.
I don't know why.

52
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,007
You don't know why? She owns
a horse farm that makes dog food.

53
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,675
We had a 15% share of the market,

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,675
but now Benton & Bowles
has dropped us for gravy train.

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,675
Well, that was a mistake.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,375
Well, people eat cow,
but they call it beef.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,061
Chicken is poultry. Pig...

58
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,108
We've got it, sweetheart.

59
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,234
There is no other word for horse-Meat.
I thought maybe you could invent one.

60
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,652
- What do you think, Don?
- I think it's a tall order.

61
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:02,500
- Do you have to use horse-Meat?
- All dog food is horse-Meat.

62
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,214
People eat it all over the world.
I've eaten it. It's delicious.

63
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:07,120
- It's like venison.
- I've eaten it.

64
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,775
Well, I'll tell you
what i'm telling the avenue:

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,835
Best idea gets my business.

66
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,175
How long do we have?

67
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,900
I'm in town until friday,
But only the big firms are rushing.

68
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,732
Well, i'm not gonna sit here
and brag about how big i am.

69
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,600
Roger.

70
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,500
Bert.

71
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,333
I have two simple rules.

72
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:36,025
I don't want to change the recipe.
It's all meat.

73
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,361
And two, my father named it
Caldecott Farms.

74
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:43,895
Don't change the name.
Don't change the product. Got it.

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,300
Walk me out?

76
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:54,418
We had their business before,
but her father was a son of a bich.

77
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,089
You know, people spend more money
on dog food than baby food.

78
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:01,236
I'll put the fellas on it.

79
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,145
Is that really necessary?

80
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,860
- You've never walked in high heels.
- No, coming in here.

81
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,251
What are you doing here?

82
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,689
I wanted to see you
and I need something new...

83
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,675
I'll bet you do.

84
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
... for my business.

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,636
- Besides, you're married, aren't you?
- I am.

86
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,365
Still or again?

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,201
You know it's again,
and don't get cute.

88
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,500
I heard she's a teenager.

89
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,748
Probably too jealous To let
you have a business dinner with me.

90
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,708
Gonna need a reason.

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,775
Because I know you're good at this...

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,638
advertising, I mean.

93
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,420
Tomorrow night. Somewhere french.

94
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,900
<i>Avec plaisir.</i>

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,770
All the lights were on.
I figured you'd be home.

96
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:55,775
I knew you were coming over,
It might be dark when I got home

97
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,821
and I didn't want the Mckays
to see you turning on the lights.

98
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,596
That's very thoughtful.

99
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,569
I'm making spaghetti
with cream,and butter

100
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,354
and cheese.

101
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,851
- And hot pepper?
- Yes.

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,950
I had it like that in little italy.

103
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
I love that place.

104
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,700
Believe it or not,
I get treated very well there.

105
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,700
I wish I could take you there.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,100
I know.

107
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,760
Don, I swear I'm not
talking about our future.

108
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,904
I entered into this
with my eyes open.

109
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,600
I pushed you.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
What does it matter?

111
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,903
Here we are,

112
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,551
and I look at your life.

113
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:00,100
And even if i remove
myself from the picture,

114
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,398
I see a man who is not happy.

115
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm happy now.

116
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,500
What?

117
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,246
I'm going to lie down.

118
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,783
Come get me when you want to.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Why did i decide to leave surgery?

120
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,175
These last few months
have been difficult,

121
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,964
but I found a reserve of strength
in myself I didn't know I had.

122
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,093
I realized there are other ways to
heal people Besides cutting them open.

123
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,803
What experience have you
had with psychiatry?

124
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:53,460
That's kind of personal.

125
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:58,475
Remember what Steve said this is a field
about the most intimate details in life.

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,375
More intimate than their organs?

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,575
I'm curious why you won't
answer the question.

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
What is your experience
with psychiatry?

129
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,975
None personally, but my dad
had a nervous breakdown.

130
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,446
- I didn't know that.
- No one was buying furniture.

131
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:14,137
My mom ran away for two weeks because
he wouldn't get a christmas tree.

132
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,175
A headshrinker got him through, but
we weren't allowed to talk about it.

133
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,455
That's wonderful.

134
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,799
- It was a lot of things, Joan.
- No,

135
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:24,875
answer like that.
This is a talking profession.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,065
The way you just were
with me right now. So open,

137
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,342
He's gonna love you.

138
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,067
The most important thing
about an interview

139
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,175
is to express enthusiasm
in a believable way.

140
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,100
No self-Deprecating humor.

141
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:42,865
You're smart. You're funny.
You're great to be around,

142
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,310
But you haven't decided
if they're the right one.

143
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,300
- This isn't a beauty pageant.
- I've seen executives crash and burn.

144
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,330
I can't believe
I never told you that.

145
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:17,000
I just...

146
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,300
Wanted more
than I thought I would want.

147
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,007
But it'll pass.

148
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,800
Actually, I know for a fact it will.

149
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,201
I don't want it to pass.

150
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:46,700
One day i dropped the kids
off at school and i saw you in the yard.

151
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,400
I kept wishing for you to get in the car
and drive away with me.

152
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,800
Just let it go.

153
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,671
I'll clear my schedule.
We can go to

154
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,596
Mystic or something
for the rest of the week.

155
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,974
Mystic?

156
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,575
I can think of someplace
if you're serious.

157
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
I am.

158
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:23,800
Damn it.

159
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,211
- Hello.
<i>- Roger, it's joan.</i>

160
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:32,175
- Joan Harris.
- Jesus.

161
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,466
You're lucky I answered.
Ginger's not in.

162
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,636
I know. She has a hair appointment
The last tuesday of every month.

163
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,075
She does?

164
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,349
- And I know that your lunch canceled.
<i>- What am I wearing?</i>

165
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:47,854
- So how are things?
<i>- Mr. Hooker</i>

166
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,775
has rearranged the secretaries
in the pool alphabetically.

167
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,277
By cup size?

168
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,518
Well, I know where you'd be sitting.

169
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,322
<i>You're making me sorry I called you.</i>

170
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,076
I need a favor.
I need help finding work.

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,912
- Something happen with dr. Cut up?
<i>- Not at all.</i>

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,828
He's pursuing his dream of becoming
a psychiatrist, but that means

173
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:10,175
more training and I just don't want him
moonlighting all the time.

174
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,586
Why does it matter?

175
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,715
It doesn't. None of my business.
Why don't you come back here?

176
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:17,175
Roger, I've been replaced

177
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,637
and a secretary makes less money Than
if I was working at a department store.

178
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm so glad you called me.

179
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,073
I'm sorry it had to be for a favor.

180
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,457
I like that you thought of me...

181
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:31,100
You know, to ask.

182
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,300
You want to be
on some people's minds.

183
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,800
Some people's, you don't.

184
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:39,031
- That's nice.
- So do you miss it here?

185
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,364
Are you asking if i miss you?

186
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,579
Well, I guess I am,
Because everything else is different.

187
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,900
- I should go.
- Well, how do i work this

188
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,418
If I think of anybody?
Just give them your number?

189
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,671
Look at you, figuring
things out for yourself.

190
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,200
Bye bye, Joanie.

191
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,300
Look who's here.

192
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:11,875
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.
My grandson was graduating.

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,232
It was beautiful.

194
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,575
Judy fixed lunch.
We don't have to talk right away.

195
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,550
I don't have a lot of time.

196
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,450
Betty wants to know
what the house is worth.

197
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,827
I'm a lawyer.
I'm not a real estate agent.

198
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,225
The house was left to both of us. I
don't understand why I shouldn't be able

199
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,775
to buy it away from her at double
what dad paid for it.

200
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,475
They bought it in the late '20s.

201
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Dad said it was
the top of the market.

202
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,875
Your father intended you to get
as much money for it as you could

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,096
If you were going to sell it. Otherwise,
somebody has to buy somebody out.

204
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:47,349
So basically dad gave it to Betty
because he knew i didn't have any money.

205
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,500
This is ugly. You know that?

206
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,800
Milton, I need to
speak to you in confidence.

207
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,400
I need your advice.

208
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,798
I need complete confidentiality.

209
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,843
It's my husband.

210
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,308
I just found out

211
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,900
some compromising facts.

212
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,600
He's been married before

213
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,779
And he...

214
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,790
Well, it's not even his real name
and he...

215
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,863
bought her a house, his ex-wife.

216
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,200
I need to know what to do.

217
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,200
I don't know him, betsy.
I met him at your wedding.

218
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:53,454
I know your father
didn't want him in the will.

219
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,792
- So?
- What do you want to do?

220
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:00,116
Do you want a divorce? In New York state
you need to prove adultery. Can you?

221
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,665
Maybe.

222
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,646
I mean prove it in a court of law.
That's hard to do.

223
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:10,280
Unless he wants out,
But you're not gonna get anything.

224
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,564
You won't even be able to
buy william out of the house.

225
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,339
You'll have to sell it.

226
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,661
And he can take the children.

227
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,600
That's my legal advice.

228
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,500
Do you want the rest of it?

229
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,501
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

230
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,400
Is he a good provider?

231
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,800
Well, he is,
but that's not the point.

232
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,900
It's a lie so big, Milton.

233
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,743
I feel like I've been in some
dream since I found out. Just...

234
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,637
saying it out loud to you,
this is...

235
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,271
the first time

236
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,900
I'm realizing it's true.

237
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,600
You have three small children
together.

238
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:02,692
At least go home, give it a try.

239
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,030
That's what I'd tell
my own daughter.

240
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:11,600
Damn it, Betts! This isn't right!

241
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,375
Look, he waited.

242
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
This is number three.

243
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,593
What do you want?

244
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,511
I'm going to have one
of those lovely wines.

245
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:35,000
Why did you have two?
Are you nervous?

246
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,500
- She'll have one of those lovely wines.
- Bordeaux.

247
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,441
Don wants to call in
a focus group right away.

248
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,100
That's enough business.

249
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,574
I want to know everything
that's happened In the last 20 years.

250
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:52,119
Longer.

251
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,605
It wasn't until years later
that I realized

252
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,249
you were the only person
I could remember that time with.

253
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,100
What do you want to remember?

254
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What I was like at that age,

255
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,300
Paris before the war,

256
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,717
Eating in cemeteries.

257
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,930
People were jumping out of
windows and we were on vacation.

258
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't remember much.

259
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,605
Are you trying to tell me when you saw
"Casablanca" you didn't think about me?

260
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,529
You mean Peter Lorre?

261
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,011
You seemed so happy to see me
And now you're just being...

262
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,075
drunk.

263
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,500
Look, Annabelle.

264
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,991
We were not in "Casablanca."

265
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:37,203
The only similarity is
that you left me for another man.

266
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,206
When she gets on the plane
at the end?

267
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,061
That woman got on it with a man
who was going to end world war II,

268
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,586
not run her father's dog food company.

269
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:51,468
You were adrift. You didn't
do anything but spend money.

270
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:56,875
You walked around like you were hoping
to be a character in somebody's novel.

271
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,141
The boxing.

272
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your reasons.

273
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,897
Believe it or not,
i still remember them.

274
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:10,779
Oh, Jesus, where's the wine? I don't
like the way you're looking at me.

275
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,114
How am i looking at you?

276
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,800
With pity.

277
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,296
I finally found

278
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,413
a beautiful carefree girl
unconcerned about the future.

279
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,999
- I was more serious than you.
- Well, I got mine.

280
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
I married Mona, joined the firm

281
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:29,200
and then I got shipped off to
the pacific for the duration.

282
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:32,842
When I came home I went to work
while you were watching "Casablanca."

283
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,596
And I got blamed
when we lost the account.

284
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,142
All I heard was my father said
bert cooper had a screw loose.

285
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,300
Look, you're rich.

286
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,565
Let someone else take your horse-Meat
and slap their label on it.

287
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,526
And do what?

288
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,400
- Oh, I don't want a whole bottle.
- I'll help.

289
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,975
And I told him the closest
we ever got to hemingway

290
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,296
was sitting in a chair
he once sat in.

291
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,753
And that was in the '20s,
not the '30s.

292
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,686
And then he said
he remembered me, because

293
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,675
I was the one who'd
introduced him to peanut butter.

294
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
I never understood. They had peanuts
in europe. No one ever thought of that?

295
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:28,200
- Look at us.
- Oh, will you stop?

296
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,559
Do i look like a widow?

297
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,000
You look great.

298
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,100
You still want me.

299
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,000
So what?

300
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm married.

301
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,896
Newlywed, honeymooning.

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,700
How could I have missed
the window between mona and her?

303
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
There really wasn't
much of a window.

304
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,475
It kind of overlapped.

305
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,475
Well, I was there first.

306
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,147
We'll just take this
And tack it onto that.

307
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,441
I'm gonna get you a cab.

308
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,528
Are you afraid I'll be disappointed?
You were always good drunk.

309
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,428
Let me get you a cab.

310
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:22,745
It's different with this girl.

311
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:30,100
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,400
Good night.

313
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,000
How'd it go?

314
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,605
I screwed up all my answers

315
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,421
And I tried to talk about the articles,
but I couldn't remember anything.

316
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,400
I made a fool out of myself.

317
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,741
I am sure that's not true.

318
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,366
You weren't there.
Stop acting like you know everything.

319
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,575
- You'll have other interviews.
- I don't want'em.

320
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't want to be a psychiatrist.

321
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,800
It's not medicine.

322
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I might as well work at a bank.

323
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't care what you do
as long as you do something.

324
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,000
We need money.

325
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,600
I did everything
I was supposed to do,

326
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,800
Everything they told me.

327
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,747
College, med school.

328
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,352
I wanted to be a surgeon
since I was that big.

329
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,800
I'm sorry, Greg.

330
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,736
- Maybe it's time to move on.
- Hey, you don't know!

331
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,275
You don't know what it's like
to want something your whole life,

332
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,156
To plan for it, to count on it
and not get it!

333
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:51,457
Shit.

334
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,900
What the hell?!

335
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,600
You're insane! You know that?!

336
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,175
Why isn't he wearing a white coat?

337
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,075
He looks like a dog-Food salesman.

338
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,875
Dogs don't like uniforms.

339
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,000
<i>Well, we're lucky.
Everyone has an appetite today.</i>

340
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,977
<i>They said we should
bring them hungry,</i>

341
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:22,447
<i>but he does seem to like this.</i>

342
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,275
<i>How would you describe
her temperament?</i>

343
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,492
<i>She's picky, </i>

344
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,203
<i>and she's nervous sometimes,</i>

345
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>- but she's very smart.
- And yours?</i>

346
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,500
<i>He's independent, you know?</i>

347
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,796
<i>He knows what he likes.
He's pretty hard to fool.</i>

348
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:41,007
Oh my god, they're describing
themselves.

349
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,700
This your first group?

350
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:46,220
<i>What if I told you your dogs
were enjoying Caldecott Farms?</i>

351
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,375
<i>- What's it called?
- I wouldn't like it.</i>

352
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,975
<i>- Bingo, stop.
- I've never heard of it.</i>

353
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,275
<i>Well, you should.
They make it out of ponies.</i>

354
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,275
<i>Goodness gracious. That's this one?</i>

355
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,232
<i>This is the first i'm hearing of this.
I wish you would've told me.</i>

356
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,075
<i>When people are protesting,
I'm on board.</i>

357
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,875
<i>What brand does your dog prefer?</i>

358
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,406
<i>- Why would you do this to us?
- It's inhumane.</i>

359
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,455
<i>- Bingo looks sick.</i>
- Turn it off.

360
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,826
Somebody get that?

361
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,954
I can't turn it off.
- It's actually happening.

362
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,413
Turn off the sound.

363
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:16,876
I already know how people feel.
It's your job to change that.

364
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:21,214
Any agency that does not change
the name is stealing your money.

365
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,286
The product is good,
It's high quality, dogs love it.

366
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,075
But the name has been poisoned.

367
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,305
That name got us where we are.
Do you think that was just luck?

368
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,050
I'm not saying a new name
is easy to find

369
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,400
And we will give you
a lot of options,

370
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,354
but it's a label on a can.

371
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:39,716
It will be true,
because it will promise the quality

372
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:41,566
of the product that's inside.

373
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,900
Well, i'm going to wait it out.

374
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,659
And not for these morons, but for
another agency to solve my problem.

375
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,800
Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.
The name is done.

376
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:54,998
It's unfair, but it's over.

377
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,380
Are you ready for the next group?

378
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,775
I don't like the way
you're speaking to me.

379
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Everybody out.

380
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,450
Is this about last night?

381
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,475
I don't even remember last night.

382
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,195
You threw yourself
at me and I turned you down.

383
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,073
I'm right. You want to hurt me.

384
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,243
No. No, i don't.

385
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,375
You want to know
if it was a great time?

386
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
It was.

387
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:41,373
Do you want to know
if you broke my heart?

388
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,730
Obviously.

389
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,820
Well, it was a mistake.

390
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,762
It's nice to hear,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

391
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,700
It does to me.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,928
When I was burying this man,
all I thought was

393
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,772
I'd have rather had my heart
broken every day by you.

394
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,485
You were the one.

395
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,905
You weren't.

396
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,294
Well, you're lucky you found her.

397
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,800
Good bye Roger.

398
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,775
I think it's about
four hours to Norwich,

399
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,075
but the Norwich inn
might be a little past it,

400
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,689
And we can check in till
midnight. We'll be fine.

401
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll be right out.

402
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,270
Daddy?

403
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:29,029
- I'll be right back, Salamander.
- Daddy!

404
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:35,220
- I left my hat in the car.
- Get it later.

405
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
I need to talk to you.

406
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,789
Go upstairs.

407
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,749
We want to say hi to daddy.

408
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,084
Upstairs.

409
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,010
You're home early.
What did william do now?

410
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,150
Not right now, Don.

411
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,675
Why didn't you just call the office?

412
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,270
I came home to feed the dog and change
shirts. I have a client dinner.

413
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
I need to show you something.

414
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:30,086
- What's going on?
- Open this drawer.

415
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:33,900
Betts, that's my desk.

416
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,429
Open the drawer or i will.

417
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:42,998
Fine.

418
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,800
Betty, this is my desk.

419
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,300
It's private.

420
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,800
Where did you get these?

421
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,800
You left them in the pocket
of your bathrobe,

422
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,950
But i could've had a locksmith
in here anytime I wanted.

423
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,075
I respected your privacy too long.

424
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
Open it.

425
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,587
No.

426
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:15,800
You know I know what's in there.

427
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:29,146
I can explain.

428
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,800
You didn't have to look
at my things.

429
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,600
Which things, Don?

430
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:43,077
The pictures covered with
other people's names?

431
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,100
Is that you?

432
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:49,583
Dick. Is that your name?

433
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
People change their names, Betts.

434
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:57,500
- You did.
- I did

435
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,900
I took your name.

436
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,065
And so did this Anna woman,
whoever she is.

437
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:09,100
- I can explain.
- I know. I know you can.

438
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,100
You're a very very
gifted storyteller.

439
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,400
Betts, I...

440
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,346
I need a drink.

441
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:09,538
Are you thinking of what to say
or are you just looking at that door?

442
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,477
I'm not going anywhere.

443
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,310
I'll get you a drink.
Just sit down.

444
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,850
You bought her a house.

445
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Where do you want me to start?

446
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,477
What's your name?

447
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:15,400
Donald Draper...

448
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:20,600
But it used to be Dick Whitman.

449
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:22,663
And who's that woman?

450
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:24,363
Your other wife.

451
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,100
It wasn't...

452
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:28,800
Romantic.

453
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:34,331
I ended up married to her
because I ran away to join the army.

454
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,200
There was an accident.

455
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,500
This guy was killed
and I was injured.

456
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,700
But they made a mistake.

457
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,903
All I had to do was be him
and I could leave korea.

458
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Be who?

459
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,400
Donald Draper.

460
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,600
You took his name?

461
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Yes.

462
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,300
Isn't that against the law?

463
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,500
Yes.

464
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:37,012
I found out it was easier to be him

465
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:40,661
than to start over.

466
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,800
It turned out he was married to
that woman, so I took care of her.

467
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:51,492
And then I divorced her
the minute I met you.

468
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:53,174
You divorced her

469
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,955
on valentine's day, 1953.

470
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:59,000
Three months before we got married.

471
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,294
Why didn't you tell me?
Why couldn't you tell me any of this?

472
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,736
When? The day we met?

473
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,717
On our first date?
On our wedding night?

474
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,900
- Why did you need to know?
- You don't get to ask any questions.

475
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:21,855
You have a family.

476
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,800
No, I don't.

477
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:34,561
All this time I thought you were
some football hero who hated his father.

478
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:36,900
I knew you were poor.

479
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
I knew you were ashamed of it.

480
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:42,960
I see how you are with money.
You don't understand it.

481
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,464
I was very poor.

482
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:52,136
Did you see her
when you were in california?

483
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I did.

484
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,103
And she reminded me
that I loved you.

485
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,511
What would you do if you were me?

486
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:08,600
Would you love you?

487
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,700
I was surprised
that you ever loved me.

488
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,325
Am supposed to feel sorry for you?

489
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:20,675
I don't know.

490
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,183
You wanted me to know this
Or you wouldn't have left your keys,

491
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:26,208
You wouldn't have kept
all of this in my house.

492
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,675
Say something.

493
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,300
I didn't think I had a choice...

494
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
And I don't know
what the difference is.

495
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,572
This is our house

496
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,496
and those are our children.

497
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,697
Well, there's a big difference.

498
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,300
You lied to me every day.

499
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,900
I can't trust you.
I don't know who you are.

500
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,600
Yes, you do.

501
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,200
We're not done.

502
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:22,673
Betts, I'm in here.

503
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,700
How is he?

504
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,148
He kicked his blankets off.

505
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,400
Sit with me.

506
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,777
This was my father,

507
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,350
Archibald.

508
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:10,793
But this.

509
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,501
That's not my mother.

510
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,451
My mother was
a 22-Year-Old prostitute

511
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:19,165
who died having me.

512
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:24,500
This woman...

513
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,170
Abigail, Archie's wife...

514
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,523
She raised me.

515
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,800
When I was 10,

516
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:40,036
Arch died and we moved.

517
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:45,746
And Abigail

518
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,309
took up with him.

519
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,700
Mack.

520
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,200
Uncle Mack.

521
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,561
He was nice to me.

522
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,640
What happened to them?

523
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:10,519
They're all dead.

524
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,600
Even Adam?

525
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,100
The little boy in all the pictures.

526
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,323
I assume he's your brother.

527
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,195
He was my half-Brother.

528
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,000
And he died.

529
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:50,202
He killed himself.

530
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,993
He came to me because
he wanted help...

531
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,900
And I turned him away.

532
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:13,400
He didn't even want help.
He just...

533
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:18,400
He just wanted
to be part of my life...

534
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,600
And I couldn't risk all of this.

535
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:37,096
He hung himself.

536
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:45,807
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:47,718
I am.

538
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:04,263
Bob, how are you?

539
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,875
Listen, i've got a favor to ask you.

540
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,506
I know this girl...

541
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,154
Actually you met her once,

542
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,800
Joan Holloway.

543
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:14,810
Well, Harris.
Redhead.

544
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:19,481
Yes, she's beautiful.

545
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,821
Anyway, she's expensive,
but you're always

546
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:25,120
complaining about needing
someone to whip your place into shape,

547
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,900
So think about it.

548
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Yeah, I want to help her out.

549
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,700
She's important to me.

550
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:36,864
Jane's fine. Thanks for asking.

551
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,100
Don't be a stranger.

552
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:04,300
I'm sorry, Joanie.

553
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,575
And I'm gonna buy you
another vase to put those in.

554
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm gonna buy you a lot of things.

555
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,961
- It's not about buying things.
- I know,

556
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,662
I know, but I've been an ass,

557
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,275
Feeling sorry for myself because
I couldn't solve this problem.

558
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,285
And it was so easy, Joanie.

559
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,211
The answer was right in front of me.

560
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,900
I joined the army, Joanie.

561
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,304
You're gonna be taken care of.
We're gonna be taken care of.

562
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:36,058
And the best part is
I get to be a surgeon. They need them.

563
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:40,008
- You joined the army?
- I know

564
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:43,675
I should've asked you, but I'll do
six weeks of basic training. That's it.

565
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,300
I'll do my residency in New York.

566
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:49,821
- And then what?
- And then i might have to go somewhere.

567
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,437
West Germany, maybe

568
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:54,692
Vietnam if that's still going on, but
a lot of docs don't have to go anywhere,

569
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:57,200
especially if they have families.

570
00:40:57,514 --> 00:40:59,992
And I'll go in as a captain.
Do you know what that means?

571
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,376
You don't have to work anymore.

572
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,339
I don't know what to say.

573
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:10,678
Please tell me this will make you happy,
because it will make me happy

574
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,386
to give you everything you want.

575
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,473
It's wonderful, Greg.

576
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:26,775
And no more soup.

577
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,575
Get your coat. We're going out.

578
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,900
- We should.
- That's my girl.

579
00:43:03,442 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you want something?

580
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,500
Are you gonna have something?

581
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:13,200
Daddy, are you going
to trick or treat?

582
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,100
Yes, of course.

583
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,600
I'll see you tonight.

584
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:44,175
- I didn't think you were here today.
- I canceled my plans.

585
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,375
Do you want me to reschedule your lunch
with Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?

586
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:51,149
I have plenty to do.

587
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:03,848
I stopped by earlier.
No one answered.

588
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:05,976
I was running all morning.

589
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:10,458
- About last night...
- What happened?

590
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,940
Did you get caught?

591
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,100
It's more complicated than that.

592
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:25,900
So I suppose I'm not
going to see you anymore?

593
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,800
Not right now.

594
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,793
No.

595
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,200
Are you okay?

596
00:44:42,404 --> 00:44:45,100
Only you would ask about me
right now.

597
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,978
Do I have to worry about my job?

598
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,772
No.

599
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:00,900
I should go.

600
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,925
Goodbye.

601
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:06,619
Goodbye, Suzanne.

602
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:18,375
He's home! Let's go!

603
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,100
Shh. You'll wake the baby.

604
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:31,186
- Do I look like a gypsy?
- Yes.

605
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:34,064
Let's go, let's go!

606
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:39,933
- Do you want anything?
- No.

607
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,875
Should I take the carriage
or just carry him?

608
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,300
It's cold out there.

609
00:45:45,457 --> 00:45:48,411
You can stay here with him or i can.

610
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,473
No.

611
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:55,377
Good.

612
00:45:57,614 --> 00:46:00,000
What's taking so long?

613
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,400
Trick or treat!

614
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:23,100
Well, hello there. Look at this.

615
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:24,948
We've got a gypsy

616
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:27,281
and a hobo.

617
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,703
And who are you supposed to be?
