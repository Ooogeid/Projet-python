<i>Souvenir</i>

3
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,699
I've prepared all
of your correspondence

4
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,293
and the summaries are
here for you to go over.

5
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:20,552
You can put them down.

6
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:26,714
Well, it's just... t's 5:00.

7
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:30,131
Sorry about that.
You probably want to be leaving.

8
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,404
What are you up to?

9
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,456
Well, some of the girls from here

10
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,167
and the traveler's insurance
got a place in Saltaire.

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,599
- Mosquitoes.
- They don't bother me.

12
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,768
Some people they bother.
Some people they don't.

13
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,518
I'm just one of those people.

14
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,096
A thing like that.

15
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,332
Is he making you work
because he's got no place to go?

16
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,457
No.

17
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,729
Have a wonderful weekend, dear.

18
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,016
Why is it that a man on his own is
an object of pity

19
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,705
when she's the one you should really
feel sorry for?

20
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,968
I don't feel sorry for her.
Those girls do whatever they want.

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:06,017
Still working, Campbell?
There's no reason to show off.

22
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:08,956
Cooper's in Montana,
Sterling's in Jane

23
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,337
- and Draper's on vacation.
- He's not on vacation.

24
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,218
He's been in Dallas,
Denver or something.

25
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,634
Hilton sent him to every armpit
that he has.

26
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,262
I'd like to get out of town
in august once... Even for work.

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,243
I love this time of year.

28
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,643
It's quiet.

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,645
It used to be like this
when I was a kid all the time.

30
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:29,206
I'd lie in bed at night,
hear horses going by.

31
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,782
New York in august... It's like
a great big melting wax museum.

32
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,707
Nothing but those fat girls
with the hairy armpits

33
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,086
putting their feet in the fountain.

34
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,607
You know what?
My weekend doesn't look so bad now.

35
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,285
I'll take anybody
for a drink who wants one.

36
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:47,906
I poured you a beer.

37
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,582
If you were wondering,
there's a hathaway in there.

38
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,507
The hotel gave me
someone else's shirt.

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,593
Then you should complain
to Mr. Hilton.

40
00:02:57,955 --> 00:03:00,833
- They should be paying you for this.
- There's a hearing,

41
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,847
and I'm paid well enough already.

42
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,132
What are they doing out there?

43
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,392
Catching lightning bugs.

44
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,106
You should join them.

45
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,397
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draper

46
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:57,861
from the junior league of Tarrytown
calling for mrs. Howard Englewood.

47
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,282
We're trying to save
the Pleasantville road reservoir.

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,181
When do you expect them back?

49
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,902
That's no good.

50
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,291
Yes, have a good evening.

51
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:27,372
Draper residence.

52
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,012
Just a minute. Don.

53
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,062
Come on Don. It's for you.

54
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,313
It's Mr. Hilton's office.

55
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,165
This is Don.

56
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:48,412
Okay. When?

57
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,252
Tuesday night.

58
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,376
Pan Am.

59
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,689
Sure, send it to my office.

60
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,975
You as well.

61
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,249
Where are you going now?

62
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,525
He wants me to fly out tuesday night
and join him in Rome.

63
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,751
Rome?

64
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,877
That's a lot better than Dallas.

65
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:16,689
Not for two days, it isn't.

66
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,188
I'll see the Coliseum
from a taxi cab.

67
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,689
We should've gone to the beach
for the summer.

68
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,864
You've been gone
the whole time anyway.

69
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,250
First of all, that's not true.

70
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:32,139
Second, there's nothing stopping you
from coming with me.

71
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:33,414
You have a passport.

72
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,233
I guess our two-month-old
isn't an issue.

73
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:42,001
We can stay at the Waldorf
anytime we want.

74
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,079
Because that's just like Rome.

75
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,165
Sorry birdy.

76
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:53,989
I've gotta catch up on my sleep.

77
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:34,464
Are you okay?

78
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,053
Are you trying
to get that in or out?

79
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,150
It's stuck.

80
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,440
You work for the Lawrences, right?

81
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:46,815
I'm very sorry.

82
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,877
You're their au pair, aren't you?

83
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,317
Yes, but they will send me home.

84
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,153
First of all,

85
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,091
let's take care of this.

86
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,229
- What happened?
- I can't tell you.

87
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:05,441
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

88
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,540
What's your name?

89
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,930
Gertrude.

90
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:15,217
My name is peter. I'm in 14G.

91
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,894
And I'm not going
to get you in trouble.

92
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:27,340
I have this party,
I borrow her dress

93
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,877
and this happened.

94
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,816
No one can clean
and she's coming home.

95
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,278
So you thought
you would throw it away?

96
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,616
They're just going
to think you stole it.

97
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,520
Wait.

98
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,084
Hold on. I don't think
you're thinking clearly.

99
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:45,981
You could put it back in the closet
and when she takes it out,

100
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,504
blame it on the little kids.

101
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,635
- They have a girl, right?
- I would never do this.

102
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:55,598
- When are they coming home?
- Thursday.

103
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,603
- Give it to me.
- For what?

104
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,272
Just give it to me.

105
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:15,004
- Let me see what I can do.
- Are you sure?

106
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,493
And people say
New York's not friendly.

107
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:19,005
Thank you.

108
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,066
I'm not promising anything.

109
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:23,443
I'll do my best.

110
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,504
Good night.

111
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,917
We've read your statement, mrs. Gumport,
and we appreciate your concern.

112
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,798
- So where is he? We're next.
- I don't know.

113
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:51,173
- Did he say he was coming?
- I didn't speak to him exactly.

114
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,920
Maybe he sent a letter,
a proclamation or something.

115
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,968
I believe that completes
our old business.

116
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,448
We'll ve on to the new business
on the agenda.

117
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:02,545
We will begin with addressing the gas
station signs on south water street.

118
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:04,610
Excuse me.

119
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,757
I believe there's been
a request for discussion

120
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:08,798
of the pleasantville
road reservoir.

121
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,433
It's on the agenda.

122
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,444
Somehow that got shifted
into new business.

123
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:18,700
That's definitely old business.
Who are you exactly?

124
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,411
She's with me.
I'm Mrs. Jack farrelly

125
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,288
and we're representing
the junior league of Tarrytown.

126
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,485
Would the trustees
please locate the...

127
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,523
There should be two petions there.

128
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,386
- Am I late?
- No, you're just in time.

129
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:41,011
We have someone
who would like to speak on our behalf.

130
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:42,432
Yes.

131
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,615
Yes. Mayor, trustees.

132
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,174
I'm Henry Francis,

133
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,362
governor Rockefeller's director
of public relations and research.

134
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,300
And I've been sent here

135
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:57,155
to deliver this request
on behalf of the governor's office.

136
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,698
Really?

137
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,799
It's a request that
further study is need,

138
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,347
because as you know,
this project was initiated

139
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,687
based on an assumption

140
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,918
that the water quality
of the reservoir is lacking.

141
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:09,293
I don't think that was an assumption.
There was a study.

142
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:13,337
With all due respect, the governor's
office believes that was not conclusive.

143
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,966
- May I see that letter?
- I've brought copies for everyone.

144
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,067
Very well, mr. Francis.

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,052
We appreciate the governor's interest
in our hamlet

146
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:41,076
and do hereby order that development
of the pleasantville road reservoir

147
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,617
be suspended

148
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,744
until further notice.

149
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:47,788
Calm down, ladies.

150
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,802
I believe that completes
our old business.

151
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,044
We'll move onto the new business
on the agenda.

152
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,590
I am so impressed.

153
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,363
- So how long will that report take?
- No idea,

154
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:01,446
but there's a saying in politics...
"when you have no power, delay."

155
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:04,299
Betty says you're from around here.

156
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,175
Yeah, about three miles that way.

157
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,211
I have to get out of here before
Florence Esterhazi comes out

158
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,226
and reiterates
the financial report.

159
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,064
I should be getting back as well.

160
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,801
- Are you driving to Albany?
- No.

161
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,251
Well, I'm this way.

162
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:23,240
They say you can't fight city hall.

163
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,175
Good night, Francine.

164
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,151
Well, this is me.

165
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,589
No station wagon for you, I guess.

166
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:38,991
I have one.
It's just this was my father's.

167
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,101
I thought it would be good luck.

168
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:50,487
So.

169
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:53,105
"So" what?

170
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,240
Nothing. I'd love
to buy you some coffee,

171
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,694
but I don't think
there's anyplace open.

172
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:04,199
I appreciate the offer,
but I should be getting home.

173
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,901
I just wanted to say thank you.

174
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,327
You really...

175
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,752
You really did everything we wanted

176
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,595
and I know how busy you must be.

177
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,551
I think you'll find that
I put my heart into things

178
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,476
when something's important to me.

179
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:35,989
Or someone.

180
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:47,283
That is a beautiful car.

181
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,403
He loved it.

182
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:56,168
I saw how happy you were in there.

183
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:57,927
I was.

184
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,052
I... I am.

185
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,565
And I thought,

186
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,113
"Dear God."

187
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,721
"Did I have anything
to do with that?"

188
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,707
"Because that would make me happy."

189
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:13,741
You did.

190
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,771
Good night.

191
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,673
Drive safely now.

192
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,298
Do you know what happened
to the Hilton cufflinks?

193
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,958
They're little stetsons,
Sterling silver.

194
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,408
They're in my top drawer.
Bobby was playing with them.

195
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,683
They're fine.

196
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,714
Look at that. How'd it go?

197
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,449
It went very well. We won.

198
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,447
We won, we won, we won.

199
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,226
What time are you leaving?

200
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,520
The car comes at a quarter to 6:00.

201
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,385
- You're leaving from work?
- Yes.

202
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,573
So they just killed
the whole development?

203
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,085
Not exactly.

204
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,469
We had completely forgotten this,

205
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:54,102
but there's a man
from the governor's office

206
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,822
and he had pointed out
something we had forgotten,

207
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,229
which was that the whole project
was based on the idea

208
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,291
that the water's
no good up there anymore,

209
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,637
which is a lie.

210
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,420
It's not true at all, not even a little.
They just made it up.

211
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,995
So he ordered another study,
you know,

212
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,150
like a chemical analysis
of the water.

213
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,200
And that could take years,

214
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,762
so I think they'll move on.

215
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,602
They should just do it up in Newburgh.
It's already disgusting.

216
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,563
- That's real politics.
- Well, you know,

217
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,817
when you don't have any power,
you have to delay things.

218
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,795
I'm up.

219
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,264
- I'm up.
- No, it's not time to wake up.

220
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,049
I want to come with you.

221
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,512
Is it too late?

222
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,077
What? No.

223
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,838
I can buy you a ticket
at the airport.

224
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,582
Carla can watch them
for a few days.

225
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:08,524
Sure, why not?

226
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,987
I know you'll be
working the whole time,

227
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,425
but I just want to get on a plane.

228
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,576
Pardon me. Do you work here?

229
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,888
The men's room is exactly here,
one floor down.

230
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,888
No, I don't need the men's room.

231
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,477
I can't return this.
It has this stain here.

232
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:46,576
I spilled wine on it and my wife
hasn't forgiven me,

233
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,401
and I'd really appreciate if you could
get me out of the doghouse.

234
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,825
I'm sorry, but anyone could've
sewn a tag on this...

235
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,377
Do I look like someone
who wants to steal a dress?

236
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,928
I'll pay for it.

237
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,136
And I was going to say
if we did carry it***,

238
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:02,455
it would be from last season
and I don't know that we still have it.

239
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,332
Let me speak to the manager.

240
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,458
Of the entire store?

241
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,520
Of the republic of dresses...

242
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,213
Whoever can help me with this,
because you're falling short.

243
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:14,963
Just a minute.

244
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:31,863
- May I help you?
- Yes, I...

245
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,614
Is that you?

246
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,002
Yes. Yes, it is.

247
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,326
How are you?

248
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm well. Thank you.

249
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,638
I was asking for the manager.
I had no idea.

250
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,263
Well, I'm just filling in.
They needed some extra help.

251
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,827
I get my pick
before they get put out.

252
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:54,006
Isn't that smart?

253
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,327
So how can I help you?

254
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,076
I don't mean to be a bother,

255
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,264
I was just hoping someone could...

256
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,951
It's this dress.

257
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:04,850
Trudy spilled wine on it.

258
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:06,815
She's beside herself.

259
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,117
I may have spilled the wine.

260
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,391
I was hoping to exchange it
or replace it,

261
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,010
whichever will get me out of
the ladie's dresses department.

262
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,135
May I?

263
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,750
It is our merchandise.

264
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,575
This one's small.
I don't see trudy in a 10.

265
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,457
It doesn't fit great,

266
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,173
but she loves it.

267
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:26,413
It's very...

268
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,396
It's very summery.

269
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,209
Give me a moment.

270
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,524
Take this down to customer service.

271
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,590
They'll send someone
to the stockroom.

272
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,575
It'll be boxed up,
but I'm sure we have it.

273
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,201
I'm willing
to pay for it, of course.

274
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:48,951
It's all taken care of.

275
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,328
That's very generous.

276
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,075
Thank you.

277
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:55,731
So how are you?

278
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:58,154
Never been better.
How are things at the office?

279
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:02,172
Moneypenny hasn't self-destructed,
but it's just a matter of time.

280
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,636
And how are you?

281
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,384
I think I told you already.
I'm very well.

282
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,206
Greg is just finishing
up his residency.

283
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,481
He's actually thinking
about a new specialty.

284
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,986
You know doctors...
Whatever's the latest thing.

285
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,287
And what would that be?

286
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,772
Psychiatry.

287
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:22,345
I'll take the dress
and you take that.

288
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,138
Thank you so much
for getting me out of a scrape.

289
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,447
And I'd appreciate it
if you should happen

290
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,126
to run into Trudy
that you be discreet.

291
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,272
The whole incident was
fraught with drama.

292
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:34,574
Of course.

293
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:36,834
This never happened.

294
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,251
Nice to see you again.

295
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,160
It's beautiful.

296
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,302
What is that smell?

297
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:06,976
Which one?

298
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,915
It's like rubber and diesel.

299
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,776
I can barely stand up.

300
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,727
Let me see what's going on.

301
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:23,605
Grazie.

302
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,066
 I hope you find everything
to your liking, madame.

303
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:51,515
Your italian is very good.

304
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,838
Thank you very much.

305
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,479
It's a lovely room.

306
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,987
- Sorry. I haven't changed my money yet.
- No, signore. Thank you.

307
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,932
American dollar is very good.

308
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:03,727
Thank you.

309
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,908
$2, Don?
That's what he makes in a week.

310
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,624
Don, look.

311
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,477
<i>I'm sorry. Is this
the Draper's room?</i>

312
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,141
Yes, this is mrs. Draper.

313
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:34,415
Is it?

314
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,937
Well, it's high time
I got to meet you.

315
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:39,439
This must be mr. Hilton.

316
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:42,526
Connie. Please.

317
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,528
Welcome to Rome.

318
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:46,655
Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

319
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,950
<i>I want you to put my staff
through its paces.</i>

320
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,996
<i>No complaint's too small.
I'd kick you up to a suite,</i>

321
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,790
but I want Don to see the way
this works for most people.

322
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:58,834
- It's lovely.
- <i>When I see you tonight,</i>

323
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,953
I want to hear all about it.

324
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:43,674
Good morning.

325
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,403
No, of course. Good afternoon.

326
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,719
I'd like to get an appointment
at the beauty salon.

327
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:57,792
I so so appreciate this.
It's an hour or two at the most.

328
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,243
The board is trying to jap us
with a sudden meeting.

329
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:02,223
Ernie, I'm leaving!

330
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,169
One asti spumante, please.

331
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,600
You're drinking alone.

332
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,100
This is in Rome.
Not in the law, eh?

333
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:36,182
But it's legal to bother a woman?

334
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,268
You speak italian very well.

335
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,659
Thank you.

336
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:42,438
What are you doing tonight?

337
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,086
I'll show you the city.

338
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:45,805
He'll show you the city.

339
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,594
He's not roman. He's a bumpkin.

340
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,447
- Where are you from?
- Naples.

341
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,150
It's so beautiful. Like you.

342
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:03,251
Thank you.

343
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,775
If I were that cigarette in your mouth,

344
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:08,417
I would die of happiness.

345
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:11,932
You are not a gentleman.

346
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,190
Whiskey, neat.

347
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:33,113
May I join you?

348
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,527
Hey, yankee. Hey, go home.

349
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,179
It's an american millionaire.

350
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:41,336
He's old.

351
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:42,956
And he's ugly.

352
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:45,375
Are they making fun of me?

353
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:46,715
A little bit.

354
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,937
I'm only in Rome for one night.

355
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,962
I won't have my heart broken.

356
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,985
Room 763.

357
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:13,838
That's right near my room.

358
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,326
Good night, signorina.

359
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,812
To whatever they were saying.

360
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,464
They said you were ugly.

361
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,671
Does that bother you?

362
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:36,009
You think because of the way
I'm dressed that I'm shallow?

363
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,137
I was just hoping you were easy.

364
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,791
They said that too.

365
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:44,100
What brings you to Rome?

366
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,010
Seen anything interesting?

367
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:55,321
I could take it or leave it.

368
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:58,366
Look at the lovebirds, will you?

369
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:02,306
Connie, this is my wife Betty.

370
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:10,589
By golly, you are
an indecently lucky man.

371
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:19,091
By golly, he's nutty.

372
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,267
He's something.

373
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:26,466
He adores you.

374
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:31,924
You're tiny.

375
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,466
He does.

376
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,401
Now I can see what all the fuss
has been about.

377
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,915
He sees great things in you.

378
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,881
- Where are we going?
- We're going for ice cream.

379
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,769
That's a grand idea.

380
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:08,759
Close your window.
My hair is getting mussed.

381
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,915
- How was your day?
- Okay.

382
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:15,085
- Do I look pretty?
- I guess so.

383
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:19,535
What are you doing?

384
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,468
Sally and ernie sitting in a tree

385
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,976
Shut up! I mean it!

386
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,726
- First comes love...
- Shut up!

387
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,633
- Then comes...
- Stop it!

388
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:35,957
I said shut up!

389
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:38,338
That's enough!

390
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,382
She hurt me.

391
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:42,857
He hit me first.

392
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,448
She was kissing Ernie.

393
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,158
- I was not!
- All right!

394
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,587
Both of you... Separate rooms.

395
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:51,635
I'm not gonna let Ernie
and Jessica visit anymore.

396
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:06,220
Well, aren't you a lucky girl?

397
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,389
Go ahead. Open it.
Make sure it's right.

398
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,649
It's like new!

399
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:22,319
They just exchanged it.
No questions asked.

400
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:25,761
Thank you. Thank you, mr. Peter,

401
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,909
from my heart. I promise I never
do this again.

402
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,550
It's all right. It never happened.

403
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,520
We should celebrate.

404
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:35,790
I don't know.

405
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,823
What do you like to drink?
You're german, right?

406
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:41,725
I can get us some beer or Riesling.

407
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:43,322
Schnapps?

408
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,085
You are so nice,

409
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:50,311
but I have my boyfriend.

410
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,234
Thank you so much
to do this for me.

411
00:30:57,651 --> 00:30:58,984
Glad I could help.

412
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:03,822
Good night.

413
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,857
- I woke you.
- What do you want?

414
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,636
I went to a lot of trouble
to solve your dress problem

415
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,864
and I think I at least deserve
to see it on you.

416
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:53,744
Okay, but you have
to be very quiet.

417
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:07,967
This is cozy.

418
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,784
I'll go get the dress.

419
00:32:19,295 --> 00:32:20,845
I'd like to kiss you.

420
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:49,507
Hello?

421
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,809
- Did I wake you?

422
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,433
No. No, I'm up.

423
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,590
<i>Can I interest you two
in some breakfast?</i>

424
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,560
Breakfast?

425
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:01,246
Sure, let me just...

426
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:02,605
Stay.

427
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:04,111
You know,

428
00:33:04,236 --> 00:33:07,607
Betty's telling me she already
ordered breakfast up to the room.

429
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,779
- Can I meet you afterwards?
- <i>Of course.</i>

430
00:33:11,107 --> 00:33:13,421
You let me know
how you like the room service.

431
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,546
Did you hear
the bells this morning?

432
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,671
I did.

433
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,635
Like sleeping
on this side of the bed.

434
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:42,975
I have to get up.

435
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:51,087
Order something.

436
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,300
He wants a full report.

437
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:25,848
Well, hello.

438
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,009
Welcome home.

439
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,109
How was everybody?

440
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,237
Everyone's fine. How was your trip?

441
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,822
It was short but sweet.

442
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,616
Well, good.

443
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,684
I'm going to get my things.

444
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:42,900
Just one more thing...

445
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:46,166
- You might want to talk to Sally.
- Why?

446
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,752
- She'll tell you.
- Carla, you brought it up.

447
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,173
I keep talking to her
about that temper.

448
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:56,957
I'm gonna go check the mail.
Do you want anything?

449
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:00,890
She kissed Ernie Hanson,

450
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,184
Bobby was teasing her
and she really went after him.

451
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,536
Okay. It's OK.

452
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:12,018
- Thank you for telling me.
- I think they just missed you.

453
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,017
Wouldn't that be nice?

454
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,906
Well, I missed you. You know that?

455
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,043
Ed Lawrence. 14C.

456
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:38,302
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?

457
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,472
Is your wife at home?

458
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:43,160
No.

459
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:46,169
Can I come in for a minute?

460
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,684
Of course.

461
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:53,969
What are you drinking, ed?

462
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:56,110
I have a Martini waiting next door.

463
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:58,302
Let me make this quick.

464
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:01,094
You know we have this german
au pair working for us?

465
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:03,843
- No, I didn't know that.
- Yes, you do.

466
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:09,070
- I don't know what she said...
- Please, just relax.

467
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,626
I know it's august

468
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,374
and all the cats are away,

469
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:17,006
I just *** one of my precious vacation
days refilling the kleenex boxes.

470
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:20,296
- I don't understand.
- Would you drop it?

471
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:22,860
I've had four months
without any tears,

472
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,704
Four quiet months.

473
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,518
You know how hard it is to find someone
my wife can get along with?

474
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,144
And now this.

475
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:35,971
Look.

476
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,903
There are plenty of nannies
in this neighborhood.

477
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,610
Stay away from her.

478
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,616
In fact, be smart...
Stay out of the building.

479
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:46,745
I'm very sorry.

480
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,221
It'll be fine.

481
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,958
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

482
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,980
- Bobby, sit down.
- Mayday mayday.

483
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:11,720
Daddy doesn't know,

484
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,794
but Carla told me you were fighting
while we were gone.

485
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,472
Carla was very upset.

486
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,656
- It's not fair. I didn't do anything.
- That's it.

487
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:26,336
You apologize to Bobby
and you learn to control your temper,

488
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,619
or I'm going to have to start
taking things away.

489
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:32,749
I'm sorry I hit you.

490
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:34,697
That's okay.

491
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:42,983
I called the office. Hilton sent
a packet over before we even left.

492
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,594
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,010
Going swimming?

494
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:48,408
Are we?

495
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:50,535
Yes.

496
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,472
See you tonight.

497
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,040
Yes, but what you really would've
enjoyed was watching

498
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:17,200
my father struggle
with the sailboat.

499
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,421
Is everybody having a good summer?

500
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:29,471
Very nice. Very hot.

501
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,776
I see Marta came.

502
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,742
Or did you keep it
this way yourself?

503
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,668
- I did my best.
- My little bachelor.

504
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,287
Come over here.

505
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:10,092
I missed you.

506
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,820
I missed ever part of you.

507
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,780
Trudy, I have to get to work.

508
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:19,255
I don't care.

509
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:31,594
You always get that guilty look on
your face when we see little children.

510
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,260
I told you...

511
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:36,659
I don't care.

512
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,320
You're my husband

513
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,580
I want what you want.

514
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,717
Did you Miss me? A little?

515
00:39:54,846 --> 00:39:56,039
What's wrong?

516
00:39:58,691 --> 00:39:59,591
I can't.

517
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,859
Look at me. Did something happen?

518
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,949
Sally, get down here.

519
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,281
Coming.

520
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,959
I want you to know that
I think Ernie Hanson is

521
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,602
a very nice little boy,

522
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,079
but I don't want you running
around just kissing boys.

523
00:40:58,554 --> 00:40:59,455
I wasn't.

524
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:02,209
And you don't kiss boys.
Boys kiss you.

525
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:06,193
The first kiss is

526
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:07,881
very special.

527
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,269
But I already did it.

528
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:11,597
It's over.

529
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,806
You're going to have
a lot of first kisses.

530
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:22,244
You're going to want it
to be special, so you rember.

531
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,231
It's where you go from being
a stranger to knowing someone,

532
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:33,021
and every kiss
with him after that is

533
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:35,022
a shadow of that kiss.

534
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:41,569
Do you understand?

535
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:45,406
I think so.

536
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:49,907
Go play.

537
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,778
I made some cold salads...

538
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,107
Hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.

539
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:22,722
Wonderful.

540
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,284
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

541
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,659
I walked down Lexington and they opened
a new fruit market,

542
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:34,850
but other than the melons,
most of it was unremarkable.

543
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:36,846
So I stopped in butterfield market

544
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,221
and they had all
of the stone fruits,

545
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,568
and beautiful cherries
and I thought...

546
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,658
... maybe I'd make
a fruit salad for dessert.

547
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,576
What?

548
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:54,446
I don't want you to go away anymore
without me.

549
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:08,347
Good.

550
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:10,222
I won't.

551
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:24,476
Tell me...

552
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:26,734
What happened at work today?

553
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,490
Kinsey invented some contraption
that can shoot a water balloon

554
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:33,954
across the office.

555
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,514
We filled it with ketchup.

556
00:43:36,453 --> 00:43:37,453
Did you?

557
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,517
I have $5 for Carla.

558
00:43:41,642 --> 00:43:43,197
She watched the kids for me.

559
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:46,182
The board called a secret meeting
about the Reservoir.

560
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,667
- I think they reversed us.
- Really?

561
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:50,578
We'll see.

562
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:53,733
So... Did you go

563
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,297
to the catacombs?

564
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:57,139
No.

565
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,890
Throw a coin in the fountain?

566
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,252
You did have a good time,
didn't you?

567
00:44:05,138 --> 00:44:07,703
Do you want some?
The kids didn't eat it at all.

568
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,228
I put them to bed.

569
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,701
Carlton and I went
to lake George for a week

570
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:15,276
after Jess was born.

571
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:18,701
No problems, no kids.

572
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,826
It was magical.

573
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:26,256
We have to do that again.

574
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:30,499
I'm afraid we may
have to be vigilant

575
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,116
about the Reservoir.

576
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:33,702
Although

577
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:37,674
it'd be an excuse for you to get
more help from high places.

578
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:40,779
I'm done with that.

579
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,615
We made our stand.

580
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:47,099
Sunny Madrid. Doesn't that sound
like it would do the trick?

581
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:50,204
I've never been.

582
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,460
- Welcome home.
- Hello, Francine.

583
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,241
I should be going.

584
00:45:03,632 --> 00:45:06,189
From what I hear,
you two must be very tired.

585
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:09,705
Good night, Francine.

586
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:29,139
Don't.

587
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:33,618
- What's wrong?
- "What's wrong?"

588
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,204
I hate this place.

589
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:36,779
I hate our friends.

590
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:38,252
I hate this town.

591
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,615
We'll go away again.
You know we will.

592
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,331
Do me a favor...

593
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,912
Look on your pillow.

594
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:58,712
Open it.

595
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,470
I saw it in the gift shop but we were
leaving, so I had Connie send it.

596
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:11,206
It's lovely.

597
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:15,399
I'll have it put on your bracelet.

598
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:22,016
And I can have something to look at

599
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:24,827
when I tell the story about the time
we went to Rome.
