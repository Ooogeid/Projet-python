1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,698
Last season on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:05,393
- You're our newest features editor.  - Aah! Oh, my god!

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,824
Cal and I have been talking,

4
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,111
And we decided we need to reevaluate

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:12,492
Your role in the company.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,489
- Connor owens.  - You want him alive?

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,679
As long as I get the money, I really don't care.

8
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,635
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,700
I'm sick. It's cancer.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,668
The only thing I care about is the time we have left.

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm moving in with Matt.

12
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:28,592
Do you love him?

13
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,439
- I do.  - I guess this is good-bye.

14
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,469
- What are you saying?  - We're over.

15
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,589
you're just walk away? I'm never gonna see you again?

16
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,943
My dad offered me a job at "Mode"

17
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,852
And I'm gonna take it. I'm your new boss.

18
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:34,626
They were, like, gnarly monster teeth,

19
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:38,066
Like... Like Gollum

20
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:40,590
Or someone from the deep backwoods of England.

21
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,549
You're just nervous

22
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,406
About your first day as a features editor.

23
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,135
That's true. I read a book about dreams

24
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,843
That says teeth dreams means you have anxiety...

25
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:52,117
Or menopause, but I don't think that's the case here.

26
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:54,360
When are those things coming off anyway?

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Soon. The dontist scheduled me for a few months now.

28
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,859
Ay, it's about freaking time.

29
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,422
Hey, Hilda, do you think you could trim my bangs?

30
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:07,680
- Maybe, but I'm kinda liking the look.  - I kinda can't see.

31
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,222
Good morning.

32
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:13,000
- Hi! Justin, my little man.  - First day of school.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,466
Justin, what did you dream about last night?

34
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,078
That Susan Boyle was force-feeding me

35
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,295
Grilled cheese sandwiches and then morphed into a cat.

36
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,073
See? Anxiety dream.

37
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,781
Hey, nice shirt. Let me see. Zegna?

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,814
Gucci, but you're getting better at this.

39
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:28,301
Thanks, mom.

40
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,301
please. I figure we gotta break out the labels

41
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,166
For your first day of high school.

42
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:36,342
We can't afford college now, but at least you'll be styling.

43
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,369
Oh! Oh! Speaking of styling,

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,589
Betty, straight from Edinburgh!

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, Christina asked me

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,580
To wait to give this to you until today.

47
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,884
Oh! Christina.

48
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:48,975
I know.

49
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,793
A pantsuit? It's great.

50
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:59,075
But it just...It's not really me.

51
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,080
Guys, I gotta go.

52
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,494
Wait. Wait. First-day photo op. Come on. Come on.

53
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:07,800
Come on. Squeeze together, freshman and freshwoman.

54
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,641
All right, ready?

55
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:12,464
Everybody say "first day"!

56
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,505
First day!

57
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:18,843
News flash: Wilhelmina slater is on the outs.

58
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:22,001
Meade's savior, Cal Hartley, is continuing to throw

59
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,402
His metaphorical muscle behind Claire Meade,

60
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:27,798
Who is now de facto boss at the publishing powerhouse.

61
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,536
And it's no secret that Claire is a Slater hater.

62
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:35,589
any claim to the company now gone with faux baby Meade

63
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,211
It might be time for Wilhelmina to dust off her resume?

64
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,833
And figure out what color her parachute is.

65
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:44,089
In the meantime, hottie widower daniel meade

66
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:45,813
Is apparently in tibet.

67
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,114
Is daniel now a Dalai?

68
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:49,490
Our sources say

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,560
He may be there spreading his late wife's ashes.

70
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:54,618
A moment of silence for molly.

71
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,517
Moment over.

72
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:01,021
Daniel, get back here and get back on the market, pronto.

73
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,731
"Page six" is a little lighter without you.

74
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,424
You have got to stop doing that.

75
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,456
I only have so much glassware.

76
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:14,131
Hide.

77
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,654
Morning. I come bearing dry-cleaning!

78
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:23,500
With extra plastic for the landfills,

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,295
Just how you like it.

80
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,295
Marc, you could have brought those to the office.

81
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,215
I know, but you've been so in and out lately, I didn't know

82
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,122
If you were gonna be in today,

83
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,653
- And so I just thought I would  - Too many words, Marc.

84
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:31,586
I'll see you at the office.

85
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:32,675
Wait. Can I use your bathroom?

86
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,375
No, Marc, you can't use my bathroom.

87
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,284
No one uses my bathroom, not even me.

88
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:40,411
What was that?

89
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,689
Housekeeper.

90
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,618
But I thought we had her deported.

91
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,389
Willie, what's going on? You're being weird.

92
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,143
And what was that stuff in the news today? Is that true?

93
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:54,767
Marc, how many times have we planted damaging rumors

94
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,064
In the news for self-serving reasons?

95
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,070
Don't you worry your silky little curls.

96
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,795
But I got a message from claire and hartley,

97
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:02,827
- And they want to meet with you tonight.  - Fine.

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,220
But what if they, you know, and then you have to... Mm?

99
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,631
Now not enough words, Marc.

100
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:10,586
What if they fire you? What happens to us?

101
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,050
We will blow up that bridge when we get to it.

102
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,866
Now if you will excuse me...

103
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:37,377
I am an attractive, intelligent, confident...

104
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,376
Associate features editor.

105
00:05:58,975 --> 00:05:59,908
Step forward.

106
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,652
- Here you go.  - I get my own credit card?

107
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,441
Yeah, if you're an editor here, you get one.

108
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,254
It's one of the many perks of your new position.

109
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,266
But don't get too excited. They put a $100 cap on lunches.

110
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:18,431
Oh, per week?

111
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:19,932
Per lunch, honey.

112
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,098
Oh, and if you're here past normal work hours,

113
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,281
Of course you have access to the meade town cars,

114
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,516
As well as the gym and steam room.

115
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,097
And your new ID Badge. Nice picture.

116
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,885
It really is. Thank you.

117
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:48,040
I know Mode is a fashion magazine, and that's great.

118
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,597
I just think that we could also

119
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,395
Be telling stories that matter, you know,

120
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,260
Touching people's lives?

121
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,847
Yeah, I just like the pictures of the shoes.

122
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,110
Yeah. No, the shoes are...The shoes are great.

123
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,671
I have plenty of those kinds of ideas, too.

124
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,114
You know,

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,603
I remember checking you in three years ago

126
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,469
When you first started working here, and I thought,

127
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:11,945
God, I'll be processing that girl's exit paperwork

128
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,985
Within a month.

129
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,572
Congratulations. Enjoy your new office.

130
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,654
Betty, hi.

131
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,298
We've never technically met.

132
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,926
I'm Mee-gan. Not Meg-an or May-gan. Mee-gan.

133
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,631
I know. I've read everything you've done for "Mode."

134
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:40,408
I think your features are amazing

135
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,408
That stuff's gonna have to go.

136
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,921
Super cute, but it's policy

137
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:44,934
Editor decor has to be fashion-related.

138
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:49,307
Oh. Okay. Yeah. Um, are we sharing?

139
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,598
'cause I thought she said that this was my office.

140
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:53,592
That's adorable.

141
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:55,968
You thought an associate editor would get her own office.

142
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,999
I just want to eat you up.

143
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:02,787
Um, well, this will be fun.

144
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,397
We'll be office mates.

145
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,623
Yeah. It's more fun not to be.

146
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,213
I had my own office, which took four years to get.

147
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,456
But I just had to give it to our new boss.

148
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:13,816
I think you might know him.

149
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:15,816
I'm Matt Hartley, your new managing editor.

150
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:18,861
Actually, that's my seat.

151
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,952
- Oh, sorry.  - Some of you I know, some of you I don't,

152
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,292
And some of you I thought I knew but apparently, I didn't.

153
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,870
My role is to be a conduit

154
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,034
Between you guys and the editors-in-chief.

155
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,855
That means any ideas you guys have

156
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,861
For articles or spreads come through me,

157
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,131
Because it's all about communication, people.

158
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:38,902
Some of you may have to work on that.

159
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,730
All right, we're starting work on our global fashion issue.

160
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,378
Betty, why don't you start us off?

161
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,691
You're good with beginnings, not so good with endings.

162
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,269
Okay, um, global?

163
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,173
Uh, well, I've been quite interested

164
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,408
In the situation in sub-saharan Africa.

165
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,558
Uh, malaria is devastating the continent.

166
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:02,825
The awareness in the United States

167
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,138
- Is practically zero  - Uh, malaria?

168
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,850
Um, yep.

169
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,265
Is there a fashion angle?

170
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,048
Yes. I think that there would be a very interesting side story

171
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,747
- With African fashion  - Betty's on to something.

172
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,999
Malaria comes from mosquitoes.

173
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,454
So what if we do an accessories piece on insect jewelry?

174
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,996
Uh, yeah. No, that's not what I was gonna say.

175
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,721
B-b-b-b-betty. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

176
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,087
Insect jewelry had its heyday in the '60s,

177
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,838
But lately I've been noticing a fashion trend

178
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,748
Back toward bugs and gross things, but pretty.

179
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:32,202
I like it, megan. Run with it.

180
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:34,603
Who's next?

181
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,599
Oh, what's up, Fergie?

182
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:45,924
Hi.

183
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:49,382
That's a real pretty, cute shirt you got on.

184
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:50,323
Who makes it?

185
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:53,200
Uh, it's Gucci.

186
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:56,577
Gucci.

187
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,671
Gucci. Oh!

188
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:08,252
Oh, man. Next time, don't be so clumsy.

189
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:21,308
- great. I guess everyone has their assignments.  - I don't.

190
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,323
I'm really excited to be here. Go, team.

191
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:28,398
Matt.

192
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,662
Matt, can we talk?

193
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,187
I'm really busy.

194
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:34,187
I know, which is why I've been calling you,

195
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,603
But you haven't answered any of my calls.

196
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,829
I just there are some things that we need to talk about.

197
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,125
Hi, Marc. I haven't seen you all day.

198
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,535
Oh, I really have to take this. Hello?

199
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:51,772
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really?

200
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:45,675
Amanda?

201
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:47,953
Oh, Betty, hey.

202
00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:49,977
I was just taking inventory.

203
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,481
Since Christina's been gone,

204
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,076
you never know who's gonna come down here steal things

205
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,211
Not me.

206
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,047
Oh, I'm just happy to see a friendly face.

207
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:02,997
And I can finally congratulate you on your big promotion.

208
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,057
Oh, Amanda, thank you.

209
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,872
The first latina supreme court justice...

210
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,045
Tell me, Betty, how does that feel?

211
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,523
How do your people feel?

212
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,971
Amanda, I'm not judge Sotomayor.

213
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,054
Bueno. But just promise me

214
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,174
You will not overturn Roe v. Wade.

215
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:20,224
Hey, you want to grab some lunch?

216
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:23,444
Sorry, I can't. Marc totally hates you for taking his job,

217
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:25,980
And I still have to figure out how you and I can be friends.

218
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:26,400
Mandy?

219
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,707
Get away from me, you bloated troll.

220
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,227
Hi, Betty.

221
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:37,177
I've been meaning to tell you-Cute outfit.

222
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:26,126
Already enjoying the perks, I see.

223
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,420
Hello, Wilhelmina.

224
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:37,668
It's been a... A rough day.

225
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,974
I hope you're not expecting a pep talk.

226
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:41,999
No. No. God, no.

227
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,148
Good.

228
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:47,588
Being an editor--

229
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,835
It's more complicated than I imagined.

230
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,258
We're really gonna do this?

231
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,736
Wake up and smell the aromatherapy, Betty.

232
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,894
Being an assistant is boot camp.

233
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,017
Being an editor is war.

234
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:02,644
You have your allies, you have your enemies

235
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,257
Often times you can't tell which is which.

236
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:06,771
It just sort of feels like

237
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,360
I have more enemies than allies right now.

238
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:11,733
Mm, yes, you do.

239
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,699
Oh, and by the way-- Malaria, really?

240
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,605
Like I would ever put disease-ridden poor people

241
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,276
In the pages of this magazine.

242
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,248
How did you know about that?

243
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,640
I know everything.

244
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:32,171
Well... How does one survive?

245
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,379
You look out for yourself.

246
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:37,396
If it means screwing over everyone else?

247
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,147
So be it.

248
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,449
What if you're not that kind of a person?

249
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,384
Well, then you change

250
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:48,024
Or you'll be eaten alive.

251
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,488
http://www.yyets.net/
www.addic7ed.com

252
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:11,681
Ahh. Are you saying that muffins are your secret weapon?

253
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:13,880
Mm-hmm. Food can be very effective.

254
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,604
The more I have at my campaign rallies,

255
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:17,302
The higher the spike in my polls.

256
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:21,682
Yeah, but this is "mode." Those people don't exactly eat.

257
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:23,917
Which is why I'm making nonfat, sugar-free,

258
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,714
Low-carb blueberry muffins high in antioxidants.

259
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,350
It's just to break the ice.

260
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,119
You should break the ice with something

261
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,248
That you couldn't actually use to break ice.

262
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,869
Ay, mija, try some butter.

263
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,616
No, dad. No butter.

264
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,960
Well, at least add some walnuts, for flavor.

265
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,836
Fine. Look, I don't even care if they actually eat them.

266
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,765
I just need to get in there and make some allies.

267
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,387
I think you should put rat poison

268
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,692
In Matt's muffins and be done with it.

269
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:53,439
Hilda. I'm the one who hurt him.

270
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,421
He needs time,

271
00:15:56,932 --> 00:16:00,600
And I just need to be patient.

272
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,325
Are you saying that you want to get back with him?

273
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,064
A few weeks ago, they were moving in together.

274
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,936
Those feelings don't just go away.

275
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,703
What? He's got to forgive me sometime. Dad.

276
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:16,471
Justin! Hey, sweetie!

277
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,450
Nice queensboro high sweatshirt.

278
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,843
Yeah! Hey, Mr. School spirit.

279
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:22,284
All right.

280
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:24,286
Yay! Thanks.

281
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:28,787
Wait. Oh, oh, oh! Wait. Justin.

282
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,811
What happened at school? Was it great?

283
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,171
Come on. You're not even gonna tell us a little something?

284
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,122
You know, I'm kind of beat,

285
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,503
So could we talk about it tomorrow morning?

286
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,415
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

287
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:40,928
Yeah. Okay.

288
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:43,647
All right.

289
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,324
Yeah.

290
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,714
Now I realize that the three of us

291
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:52,648
Have not always been the best of... friends.

292
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:55,836
Well, I suppose I shouldn't have tried to blackmail Claire.

293
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,748
But in my defense, it's hardly the worst thing

294
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,875
I've done to the woman.

295
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:02,042
Though she really is less of a woman at this point

296
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,387
Than something you use to scare crows or children.

297
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,226
Uh, there's something we need to tell you, Wilhelmina.

298
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,915
But you're not making it any easier.

299
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,956
Enough with the dramatic windups.

300
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,306
I know you want to fire me, so go ahead and do it.

301
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:17,068
But if you expect me to grovel or apologize,

302
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,317
I think you ought to know by now,

303
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,804
You're talking to the wrong woman.

304
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,499
Good luck. Finding someone else that can do what I do.

305
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,707
- Claire? - We want you to stay.

306
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:32,763
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,491
All those face-lifts must have affected your speech.

308
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,292
What did you say?

309
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:41,007
We want you to stay on as editor-in-chief of "mode,"

310
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:42,758
Reporting to me, of course.

311
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,180
You seem surprised,

312
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,370
Yet your eyebrows haven't moved at all.

313
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:51,987
Well, this is unexpected.

314
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,131
You were right.

315
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,628
It was very hard to find someone who can do what you do.

316
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,712
Well, I'm sorry for the insults, Claire.

317
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,342
You know, old habits.

318
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,031
Of course, and for what it's worth,

319
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,555
I had a really good one for you about v.d.

320
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:07,937
You'll have to tell me sometime.

321
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,118
I look forward to it.

322
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,939
Mmm! Que rico.

323
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,757
Would you like a muffin to brighten your day?

324
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,599
Low fat, low sugar, high antioxidants.

325
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,719
Low fat, low sugar, low-everything muffin.

326
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,719
I'll save you one.

327
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,881
Mmm! Que rico.

328
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,808
Hey, Marc.

329
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,853
Oh, hi. Betty's waddling around here somewhere.

330
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:41,405
Last I saw, she was tossing carbs around the office

331
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:43,058
With wild abandon.

332
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,477
Actually, I was sort of looking for you.

333
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,973
Look, I'll take any insect jewelry you've got.

334
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:52,322
Literally everything I've found so far is strictly craft fair.

335
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:53,123
Thanks.

336
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:57,688
Hi. Brought you a muffin-- Made it myself.

337
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,055
I'll just save it for later, hmm?

338
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:06,310
Megan, I just want you to know

339
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,658
That if you need any help at all on your article,

340
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,143
I'm here for you.

341
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,794
Research, calls, anything-- Name it, I'm your girl.

342
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,723
Oh, my god. That's so sweet.

343
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,159
Matt. Matt, I made you a muffin,

344
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,059
And I was thinking maybe we could talk,

345
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,927
You know, about us.

346
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:27,915
Betty, not at work.

347
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,449
Was that my nephew?

348
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:42,793
Sorry. I have to take this. Hello?

349
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,816
Hi, Marc. It's Betty.

350
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,286
That's a muffin.

351
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,965
You can't call a tape dispenser with a muffin.

352
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:50,103
Yes, you can. I just did, and you answered.

353
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,802
Bee boo beep! We're sorry.

354
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,392
Your call has been disconnected.

355
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:57,722
Marc, I know you hate me,

356
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,895
But can't you just answer one simple question? I...

357
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,385
Walnuts.

358
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,469
Justin was talking to Marc? About what?

359
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,832
I don't know why Justin was here talking to Marc.

360
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,870
Marc's throat closed up before he could tell me.

361
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:19,586
- Convenient.  - No, not convenient.

362
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:22,751
He was allergic to the walnuts Papi put in my muffins.

363
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,626
And he didn't say anything to you before?

364
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,881
- I thought you were gonna win him over.  - it didn't work.

365
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,059
No one liked my muffins,

366
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,727
I don't know why Justin was here, and I'm sorry. Good-bye.

367
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:46,620
I miss him, too.

368
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:49,541
Hi.

369
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,356
Hi.

370
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,283
How are you doing, Betty?

371
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:57,851
I'm fine.

372
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,573
Mm, yes, starting a new job

373
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:03,432
Working for your ex-boyfriend.

374
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:06,361
I can see how that would leave you... Fine.

375
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,065
Well, I will be fine.

376
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:13,450
I just need to... Find some allies.

377
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:14,808
And how's that going?

378
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,268
Put Marc in the hospital.

379
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:20,666
That was you?

380
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:23,780
Not on purpose.

381
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,173
What about Matt?

382
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,094
He's just been so cold.

383
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:32,604
It makes me wonder if he ever really had feelings for me

384
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,595
- To begin with.  -He wouldn't be here if he didn't.

385
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:39,590
Trust me.

386
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,802
I know a thing or two about Hartleys.

387
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:48,328
Well, he doesn't want to talk to me about it,

388
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,963
So it really doesn't make a difference.

389
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:51,855
Those feelings are still there.

390
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:55,163
You just have to find a way to bring them out.

391
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:06,459
- What are you doing?  - Jogging in the park.

392
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:09,978
- you're wearing heels.  - Yeah, I gotta get to work later,

393
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:11,491
And my new boss hates it when I'm late.

394
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:14,755
Matt, you don't want to talk about us when we're at work.

395
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,488
- We're not at work.  - There's nothing to talk about.

396
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,860
I know you're hurt,

397
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,782
you're the one who took the job as my boss at "Mode."

398
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:20,782
So?

399
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:22,363
So tell me that had nothing to do with me.

400
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:24,363
Look, what do you want?

401
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,069
You want me to tell you I took the job

402
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,987
Because I still have feelings for you? Because I don't.

403
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:37,410
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

404
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,454
- I don't know.  - You kissed me.

405
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,897
- I know.  - Why did you kiss me?

406
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,067
Because you said you don't have feelings for me.

407
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:46,067
I don't.

408
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,290
I don't believe you.

409
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:51,381
Matt, I think you are doing this to hurt me,

410
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,566
all because of some stupid moment that meant nothing.

411
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,879
I don't know how else to apologize

412
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,899
For what happened with Henry.

413
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,325
Look, I can't do this. Please.

414
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,334
What were you doing at "Mode" the other day?

415
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,158
Who told you that?

416
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:17,334
I ran into Naomi Campbell on Roosevelt Boulevard.

417
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,530
She said she saw you there.

418
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:21,698
So...

419
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,499
What were you talking to Marc about?

420
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,209
I spilled low fat dressing on my new shirt.

421
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,778
It was ruined. I didn't want to tell you

422
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,352
Because you spent so much money on it,

423
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,558
So Marc got me another one.

424
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:40,324
Honey, you could have told me that.

425
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,193
Anyway, it wasn't that expensive.

426
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,389
It was an irregular,

427
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,603
So there was something wrong with the stitching.

428
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:50,108
Yeah, I saw that, but I still liked it.

429
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:53,213
You.

430
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:54,902
Such a good kid.

431
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,108
Marc! What happened to you yesterday?

432
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:07,835
I'm sorry. I had an allergic reaction,

433
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,665
And I had to go to the emergency room.

434
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:12,805
I would have told you about it, but my throat closed shut.

435
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,900
Well, in the future, do it on your own time.

436
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:16,985
I need to hydrate.

437
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:21,613
So I've been too scared to ask,

438
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:25,475
But how did the meeting go with Hartley and the hag?

439
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,769
They want to keep me on.

440
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,687
Well, that's the best news I've heard in days...

441
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,949
After, "you're going to live."

442
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:37,547
Oh, please. Daniel can't run this magazine by himself.

443
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:39,614
They're just buying time till they can lure

444
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:40,978
The only other person in the world

445
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:44,975
That can do what I do -- Isabelle Besset, french "Elle."

446
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,426
I checked. They've been trading calls.

447
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,643
That's not good news.

448
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:51,307
What are we going to do?

449
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,502
Oh, I don't know.

450
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,348
Oh, stop spritzing. I don't always have a plan, you know.

451
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:02,708
Hello?

452
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:04,503
Marc.

453
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:07,546
I don't want you answering my cell phone anymore.

454
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:11,081
It was just a call from your apartment.

455
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,892
Yes. And I would like my privacy respected...

456
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:17,360
Starting now.

457
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:21,535
- She's keeping secrets from me.  - Who?

458
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:24,473
- Wilhelmina. - Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't really listening.

459
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,374
She obviously has someone in that apartment

460
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,623
That she doesn't want me to know about.

461
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,771
Maybe it's a guy she's having a torrid affair with.

462
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,269
Now she tells me she's being pushed out of "mode,"

463
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:34,430
And she doesn't have a plan.

464
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,013
- she expect me believe that - maybe she's running away

465
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,949
With the guy she's having a torrid affair with.

466
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,427
Maybe I can join them.

467
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,230
The only person she ever felt that way about...

468
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:48,629
Oh, my lady gaga.

469
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,037
Mandy, you're brilliant.

470
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:53,108
You take that back. I'm beautiful.

471
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:57,639
It's Connor.

472
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,800
She's hiding him...

473
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:02,989
In her apartment.

474
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,372
And he's already asked her to run away with him once.

475
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,341
And now she has no reason to stay.

476
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,972
What if she actually does it this time?

477
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:12,165
- If she's out... Then I'm out. - Who?

478
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:14,159
Wilhelmina.

479
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,667
I'm sorry. I told you, I wasn't really listening.

480
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:17,608
Start from the beginning.

481
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:33,398
Daniel! Oh, my god!

482
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,017
I was just thinking about calling you.

483
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,662
Are you back? Are you okay?

484
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:40,527
Sort of. I'm having a bit of an issue here at the airport.

485
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:43,876
So you may be

486
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,489
On some terrorist watch list for now,

487
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,829
But they're not gonna press charges.

488
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,289
Press charges.

489
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,166
I should press charges. Betty, they lost my wife.

490
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,312
Daniel, weren't you gonna spread her ashes

491
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,376
At the Jokhang Temple?

492
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:58,999
I did, but I decided to keep some of the ashes.

493
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,899
But then they made me check the urn,

494
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,647
And they lost her.

495
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,318
They lost half my wife.

496
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:07,739
But they found her. You have the urn. It's okay.

497
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,407
Daniel, I know you want to stay at Molly's apartment, but...

498
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,135
Is that really the best idea?

499
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,252
Look, it's fine.

500
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:19,225
My apartment's on the market. I need a place to stay.

501
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:22,586
Besides, I have to go through her things anyway.

502
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:25,242
All right. If you think it's okay.

503
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:26,281
Enough about me.

504
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:27,987
I want to hear about how things have been going.

505
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,640
How's life as an editor?

506
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Great. Really great. Good. It's good.

507
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,060
You are a bad liar.

508
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:35,922
I know.

509
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:39,229
But I'm not gonna complain about my problems to you.

510
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,497
Betty, trust me.

511
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,964
It's a relief to hear about somebody else's problems.

512
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:28,216
So he barely speaks to me-- Thank you--and then my pitch

513
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:30,084
Gets turned into something completely different,

514
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:31,914
Which he decides to give to Megan. Wait.

515
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,444
I can't believe that spoiled little bastard

516
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,069
Gave it to Megan.

517
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,392
Did you talk to Wilhelmina or my mom?

518
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:38,019
No. No. I don't have to do that.

519
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,126
And it's not just matt, Daniel.

520
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:41,319
It's like everybody hates me.

521
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,946
Oh, you can turn that around.

522
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:45,419
maybe it's gonna be like your first year at "mode."

523
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,372
Used to make fun of you?

524
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:49,589
They even started that blog about you.

525
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:54,375
You know, the one about your outfits.

526
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,577
The one where they took pictures of you every day?

527
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:58,695
You have to know about this.

528
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,095
Oh, boy.

529
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,271
Oh, my god.

530
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:08,011
They've been doing this since my first day at "mode"

531
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,254
And nobody told me?

532
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:12,550
Betty, I just kinda thought you knew.

533
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,119
Well, I love that outfit.

534
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,265
Yeah, I-I love that one, too.

535
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,662
Uh, okay, maybe that one was a mistake.

536
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:22,061
You know what? Don't worry about it.

537
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,639
You survived that. You're gonna survive this.

538
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,422
How?

539
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,938
Well, doing what you always do.

540
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,246
Focus on your work, show them you're a team player.

541
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:33,094
I am. I tried to help megan

542
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,178
Find a take on her insect jewelry piece.

543
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:37,527
She didn't like any of my ideas. I love that belt.

544
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,794
Insect jewelry?

545
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,237
So Molly found this in some antique shop a while back.

546
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,049
Turns out it's worth a lot of money.

547
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:47,774
"Olivia"?

548
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:49,562
Yeah, it's, uh, Olivia Guillemette.

549
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:52,289
She was big in the '60s, she's kind of a recluse now.

550
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,104
But I bet a resourceful writer/editor

551
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:58,243
- Could track her down. - Thank you, Daniel.

552
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:01,737
I'm really glad you're back. I missed you.

553
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,231
I missed you, too, Betty.

554
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,967
Did you really have to bookmark that blog?

555
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:20,728
No, that's so cool. I can't believe it.

556
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,558
Well, the doctors overseas are always better.

557
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,496
Willie, how come you didn't tell me

558
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:28,975
That your daughter was back in town?

559
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:31,373
How much do we love Nico's new nose?

560
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:33,219
Hon-honestly, it took my breath away.

561
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:47,795
Are you Olivia?

562
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,009
Shh. You're just in time.

563
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,560
Come in quickly or you'll miss it.

564
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,738
Hurry up. Quick. Come on.

565
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,681
Uh, Willie, I have to ask you a question.

566
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:06,936
- Are you mad at me? - No more than usual.

567
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:08,228
Oh, I just don't understand

568
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:11,260
Why you felt you had to hide Nico from me.

569
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,215
I need to know that you still trust me.

570
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,128
Don't we have an agreement not to discuss your needs?

571
00:31:16,194 --> 00:31:18,727
Yes, of course. It's just...

572
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,727
You'd not believe some of the scenarios I came up with

573
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:23,827
About who you were hiding here.

574
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:28,194
At one point, I even thought it was Connor.

575
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,442
Well, there is something that I haven't told you.

576
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:35,697
Uh, and it's not about Nico. It's about Connor.

577
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:36,813
I knew it.

578
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,950
I knew you knew it.

579
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,608
I hired a bounty hunter to track him down

580
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:43,575
So I could take back the money he stole from meade

581
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:46,308
In order to use it to buy out Hartley.

582
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:51,781
But Hartley's got his snout all up in Claire's spanx.

583
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,108
He's not gonna sell his shares of meade to you.

584
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:57,108
Well, he won't know it's me. I'll use an intermediary.

585
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:58,675
Oh, Marc...

586
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,694
You think this is my first extortion/secret takeover?

587
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:02,487
Please.

588
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,384
Right. Of course.

589
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:07,496
So I'm--I'm sorry I left you out of it,

590
00:32:07,496 --> 00:32:10,308
sometimes I feel I need to protect you from these things.

591
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,341
Oh, well, thank you.

592
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:17,663
But--but no more secrets, right?

593
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,140
No more secrets. Promise.

594
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,786
Okay.

595
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,255
Well, now that Marc knows you're back,

596
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:27,452
People are gonna start to find out.

597
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:33,092
We have to act like everything is normal. You understand?

598
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,851
Sweetheart?

599
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:40,498
I'm scared.

600
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,522
What are you doing here?

601
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,348
I think I'm in trouble.

602
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,301
Don't worry.

603
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,288
I will take care of everything.

604
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:10,524
I've never seen a butterfly

605
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:12,160
Come out of its cocoon before.

606
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,624
Everyone talks about the miracle of birth.

607
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,700
I think rebirth is even more of a miracle.

608
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:22,598
Mm. It looks like he's struggling.

609
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:23,834
Oh, he can handle it.

610
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,752
I suspect that caterpillars stay in their cocoons

611
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:30,034
A little longer than they really need to.

612
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,167
It's gotta be scary

613
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:34,700
To change into a whole new thing.

614
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:38,500
He's so beautiful.

615
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:46,333
But the caterpillar is just... gone.

616
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,167
Oh, he's still in there.

617
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:52,100
Other people see the wings

618
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,034
And colors.

619
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll always see the caterpillar.

620
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,667
thank you so much for letting me see that. That's amazing.

621
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,633
Mm. I think so, too.

622
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,967
That's why I invited everybody to watch.

623
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:06,000
Everybody?

624
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,700
Mm-hmm.

625
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,533
Oh.

626
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Unfortunately, I have now got to get everybody

627
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,496
Back into their house.

628
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:22,440
I'll need some help.

629
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:27,967
So anyway, the reason I came was to talk to you

630
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:31,167
- About a-a feature that "mode" magazine  - Careful.

631
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,959
You don't want to tip over the tarantulas.

632
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,633
Ugh. You are correct.

633
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:40,067
I thought that we could focus the feature

634
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:42,100
On your insect jewelry.

635
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,366
Shh!

636
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:45,158
It's on your shoulder.

637
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,000
A tarantula?

638
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:48,567
A butterfly.

639
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:51,500
Hold very still.

640
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:57,525
I think they're attracted

641
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,439
By the color of your clothes.

642
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,272
Really?

643
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,072
This is kind of tame for me.

644
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,972
Mm. All right. Very still.

645
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,972
Oh, now... You follow me...

646
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:15,706
Back to the butterfly house.

647
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:31,706
Careful.

648
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,539
There you go.

649
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,939
Now shake.

650
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,439
We did it.

651
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:57,939
They like you.

652
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:01,539
Now what did you want to talk about?

653
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,954
These are for you.

654
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:09,439
And here you go.

655
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,373
Oh, my god. Olivia?

656
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,744
I thought she was dead.

657
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:18,106
Nope, she's alive, and a very fascinating woman

658
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:21,239
Who would make a wonderful subject for your feature.

659
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,604
What do you want?

660
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:24,967
Nothing.

661
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:26,144
Are you trying to steal my story?

662
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:30,977
No, I was trying to help. Take it or leave it.

663
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,239
Shoot.

664
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:41,139
Here.

665
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:46,272
Thank you.

666
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,373
Betty.

667
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:03,740
Those muffins you made were really good.

668
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:14,773
Hello!

669
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,067
Hi. There you are.

670
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:19,106
Ah! Betty's younger sister.

671
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:21,639
Oh, oh. Well, thank you for the part of that

672
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,272
That complimented me,

673
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:23,977
But watch it for the part

674
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,345
That slammed my sister. Yeah?

675
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,338
Listen, I came here to thank you

676
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:30,909
- For helping Justin out with the shirt yesterday.  - Oh.

677
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:33,098
Yeah, but I want to pay you for it, all right?

678
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,467
Okay. It was $400.

679
00:37:35,394 --> 00:37:36,306
What?

680
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,206
It was free.

681
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,081
I called the design house,

682
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:39,972
Told them it was a Jonas.

683
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,084
They sent one right over. Keep your money.

684
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:45,639
Oh... That's good, because, you know,

685
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:48,639
This check bond is so hard.

686
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:52,306
Anyway, thank you so much for helping Justin out.

687
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:53,436
Oh, yeah.

688
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,886
Well, it's hard for a kid when

689
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:56,806
He gets pushed around like that.

690
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,473
Yeah. Wait. What did you say?

691
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:01,705
Wait. What did you say?

692
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,206
Someone's pushing my son around?

693
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:05,806
No. No.

694
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay, obviously, he didn't want you to know about it,

695
00:38:08,905 --> 00:38:10,272
So you have to pretend like I didn't tell you.

696
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:11,730
I'm not pretending anything.

697
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,979
If someone is pushing my son around, I need to know.

698
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:18,287
Why--why did he lie to me?

699
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:20,752
Uh, well, because you're his mother.

700
00:38:20,752 --> 00:38:24,047
And I speak from experience-- It is really hard for a boy

701
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:26,120
To admit something like that to his mother.

702
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,428
No, not Justin.

703
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:29,863
We are like this.

704
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:30,379
Clearly.

705
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:33,177
the next time he comes to you with something like this,

706
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,004
I would appreciate it if you sent him right home to me.

707
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:36,451
But...

708
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:37,419
I'm not asking.

709
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,767
Okay. But--mm

710
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,597
Thanks for inviting me to have lunch with you.

711
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:57,267
It feels so good to have someone to talk to.

712
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,190
Trust me. I feel the same way.

713
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:00,239
It's been a rough week.

714
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,163
Remember last year when everyone was like,

715
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:04,538
"Change, yay. Obama. Change"?

716
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,769
This year, change sucks.

717
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:11,302
Justin, I am so sorry that high school's been rough.

718
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:13,369
Trust me. I know exactly what that feels like.

719
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:15,315
I wish I could do something to help.

720
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:16,794
Are you kidding? You're already doing it.

721
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:18,578
I saw Heidi Klum on the way in.

722
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:19,470
Oh, actually, that was Monica--

723
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:22,252
Don't ruin my moment. It was Heidi Klum.

724
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:23,288
Heidi looks amazing.

725
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:25,000
Can you believe she's had three children?

726
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:25,403
I know.

727
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:29,003
Hey. Some of us are eating over there.

728
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:30,019
Come join if you want.

729
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,286
Is that Meg-an?

730
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:35,612
Mee-gan, yeah.

731
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:37,289
But I'm having lunch with you.

732
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,160
Are you kidding? You're so stupid.

733
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,728
Why would you not go eat with them?

734
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,056
They're the popular table,

735
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:44,703
And you won't get a second invite.

736
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:45,989
Justin, I am not abandoning you.

737
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,755
Well, then I'm abandoning you. Bye.

738
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:03,040
Hey, Marc. what are you up to?

739
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:09,206
Is she still here?

740
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,173
Is this a... test?

741
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,140
What are you talking about?

742
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,740
I  want to see if you want to go grab lunch or something.

743
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,440
Well, first of all, I had fries last night,

744
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:23,040
So there'll be no lunch today,

745
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:26,939
And 2nd, tu mama just scared the "hey-soos" out of me.

746
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:30,373
My mother? what are you talking about?

747
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,273
She was just here, and she was very clear

748
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,406
About me not talking to you.

749
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,320
So I'm sorry.

750
00:40:38,662 --> 00:40:40,962
You probably shouldn't come around anymore.

751
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:43,428
Hasta luego.

752
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:48,003
When you first showed up, I didn't think I would like you.

753
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,271
yeah, I could kinda tell.

754
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,289
I just thought you'd gotten the job as a courtesy

755
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,803
Because you were Daniel's assistant,

756
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:53,996
Not because you were talented.

757
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,389
Oh. wow. okay.

758
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,997
Look, I take the title "editor" pretty seriously,

759
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:01,490
But I can see, you do, too.

760
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,130
Hmm. Thanks, Megan.

761
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:04,699
Hey, skinny bitches... and betty.

762
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:07,009
Emergency meeting in the conference room,

763
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,465
Fire in the hole, chippity chop chop chop--All departments.

764
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:12,871
Wait. Amanda, what?

765
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:16,171
Daniel's back.

766
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,980
Hello, everybody.

767
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,930
Thank you so much for cutting your lunches short.

768
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,591
I appreciate all the hard work

769
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:26,891
you've been doing while I've been gone,

770
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:29,587
but I'm back now, and unfortunately,

771
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,585
There are some things going on that I just don't like.

772
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,853
First of all, the feature piece on insect jewelry--

773
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,319
It was a pitch started from betty.

774
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:40,486
It was taken away from her and given to Megan.

775
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:42,352
I know you're new here, Matt,

776
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:45,072
But that's not the way we do things.

777
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:47,861
So effective immediately, the story goes back to Betty.

778
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,304
Sorry, Megan.

779
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:51,287
You have to come up With some ideas of your own.

780
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:54,254
Matt, it's probably a good idea if you did a little legwork,

781
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:58,416
Figure out the dos and don'ts of being a managing editor.

782
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,856
Look forward to reading your piece, betty.

783
00:42:01,857 --> 00:42:04,367
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

784
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:19,971
Guys.

785
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,246
I swear, I did not ask for special treatment.

786
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:25,013
So you didn't mention anything to daniel?

787
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,379
Well, I... I mean, I gave him an update.

788
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,357
But I didn't ask for the article.

789
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:36,068
Liar! Get the liar who spreads the lies!

790
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,360
Go for her fleshy middle!

791
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:10,049
Sorry, betty. I'll just aim for a cankle.

792
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:18,087
I'll aim for the heart.

793
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:20,982
It'll only hurt for the rest of your life.

794
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:47,417
I surrender!

795
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,150
Well, boys and girls,

796
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:09,576
Looks like we caught ourselves a meaty one.

797
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,970
We're gonna eat good tonight.

798
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:17,241
Who's in the mood for some carnitas?

799
00:44:17,308 --> 00:44:19,774
Betty, it did not happen like that at all.

800
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,041
Okay, maybe I'm overexaggerating a little,

801
00:44:22,107 --> 00:44:24,974
But my glasses did break, look.

802
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,654
Ay, then maybe you'll finally get some new ones.

803
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:27,408
What's wrong with these?

804
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:29,046
I've been wearing them since high school.

805
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:32,333
I love these glasses. All I'm saying is,

806
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:34,702
I feel like I'm under attack at work.

807
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:37,141
It's like, Matt, Marc, Megan--

808
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,504
Anyone whose name starts with a "muh."

809
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:41,807
It sounds like Daniel is looking after to you

810
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,074
Yeah, and his name starts with a "duh."

811
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,272
It feels like things have gotten worse

812
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:47,390
Since Daniel got back.

813
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:49,844
I mean, I was finally starting to fit in.

814
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:51,395
I know his heart was in the right place,

815
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:53,250
But he just came and screwed it all up.

816
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,867
Look at it this way-- A few days ago,

817
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:57,267
You were worried you had no allies and no assignments.

818
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:59,457
Now that Daniel's back, you got both.

819
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,321
Papi, you are missing the point.

820
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:01,981
No, no, no.

821
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:04,609
You need to tell Daniel to back that truck up,

822
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,991
That you can take care of yourself. Hello.

823
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:08,976
Well, he juit lost his wife.

824
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,609
I mean, that's a little harsh, no?

825
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,179
Okay, well, then you can kiss fitting in

826
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,103
at your new job good-bye.

827
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,260
So I was at the gates last night,

828
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,348
And that dad from "Jon & Kate plus 8" was there--

829
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:23,682
I think his name's Ben--

830
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:26,449
Anyway, he was totally hitting on me, of course.

831
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,249
And p.s., "plus 8"? More like "plus 4."

832
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,878
Um, Blondre the giant is over there.

833
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:38,095
I think she wants to talk to you.

834
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:41,120
I choose to ignore the elderly.

835
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,493
O.M.G.! The gates?

836
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:45,497
I was there last night, too.

837
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:48,398
Did you see ben from "jon & kate plus 8"?

838
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:52,097
Oh, so sad-- Old and crazy.

839
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:55,865
Don't worry. It'll all be over soon!

840
00:45:57,303 --> 00:45:59,969
Ooh, he's hot.

841
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:02,669
By the way, Serge, that bouncer?

842
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,651
Little handsy.

843
00:46:04,286 --> 00:46:06,719
- I know. - I kind of liked it.

844
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,985
Me, too.

845
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:14,063
Old people usually frighten me,

846
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,240
'cause they remind me of death and all...

847
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,597
But I like you.

848
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:21,856
You're like a giant, knobby shade tree.

849
00:46:21,922 --> 00:46:23,322
Thanks.

850
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:25,455
Anyway, um, can you tell me

851
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,123
Where Daniel Meade's office is?

852
00:46:27,189 --> 00:46:29,089
I'm supposed to be his temp.

853
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,156
I can do you one better.

854
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:33,869
I can take you to the closet where we can steal clothes.

855
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,837
Oh, my god. I worship you.

856
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:39,556
Damn it.

857
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:43,923
Damn it!

858
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:47,523
Betty, hey.

859
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:50,523
How's my favorite associate editor this morning?

860
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,389
Um, better than your stapler.

861
00:46:53,456 --> 00:46:55,256
And, you know, Daniel,

862
00:46:55,322 --> 00:46:58,289
There are a lot of really great editors around here.

863
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:01,289
You probably shouldn't have any favorites.

864
00:47:01,356 --> 00:47:03,157
You're right. You are right.

865
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,690
So about your meeting yesterday--

866
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:09,656
Yeah, wasn't that great? I am so stoked to be back.

867
00:47:09,723 --> 00:47:12,556
It just feels good to be involved again, you know--

868
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:14,023
Helping out, helping you.

869
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,456
Yeah. Yay. Helping me.

870
00:47:17,523 --> 00:47:19,489
So... Ready for your big pitch meeting?

871
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:22,256
I'm sure you're gonna knock it out of the park.

872
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:24,790
Oh, look at that! We are gonna be late. Come on.

873
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:28,023
Um. We?

874
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,589
Wait, Daniel.

875
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:31,956
You don't usually go to department pitch meetings.

876
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:33,566
Well, I've been known to make an appearance.

877
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,680
Besides, I can't miss your first one, can I?

878
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:41,489
I-I really appreciate you wanting to help me.

879
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,489
It's just, I don't want to get a reputation,

880
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:47,723
You know, for being "Daniel's girl."

881
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,863
Now wait. Who the hell is calling you "Daniel's girl"?

882
00:47:49,864 --> 00:47:51,656
No. No, no one.

883
00:47:51,723 --> 00:47:54,956
I just--I just want to keep it that way.

884
00:47:55,023 --> 00:47:58,823
You know, people around here can be rough.

885
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,790
Yeah, I get it. I mean...

886
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:03,489
Back when my father, sister and mother all worked here,

887
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,656
I-I used to worry that people thought I got

888
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,723
Preferential treatment, too.

889
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,289
Yeah. Yeah, right. It's--that's exactly it.

890
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:13,856
All right, then. I'll keep my distance.

891
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:15,690
Good luck in there.

892
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,090
Okay.

893
00:48:23,157 --> 00:48:26,523
Glittered cleavage? Really, Marissa?

894
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,756
I thought you were better than that.

895
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:34,723
No, I didn't. Go. I can't even look at you.

896
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,322
Well, I think we can all agree that the beauty department

897
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,723
Really crapped the sheets.

898
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,756
Features, I hope you can do better.

899
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:45,222
Well, uh, betty is our newest editor.

900
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,489
I'm sure she's dying to pitch.

901
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,157
Okay, uh...

902
00:48:59,222 --> 00:49:02,157
So I've been doing research on an amazing woman

903
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:04,356
Who does very intricate insect jewelry.

904
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,322
Oh, stop.

905
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:10,523
"Elle" did a piece on dragonfly brooches last year.

906
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,456
Is someone not doing their homework?

907
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:18,157
People, I want you to think outside the box.

908
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:19,823
Be bolder!

909
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,956
Preferably, an original idea,

910
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:25,123
If that's not too much to ask.

911
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:27,523
Now, Betty, for the first time in my life,

912
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,256
I want bigger from you.

913
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:32,756
What do you have?

914
00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:45,895
You want to hear another idea, which is okay,

915
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:49,768
Because I have a whole bunch of them. Um...

916
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,813
Okay, okay. I have to say something.

917
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:56,560
So, what? Uh, mosquito netting, malaria.

918
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:59,052
No, don't say "malaria." Wilhelmina hates malaria.

919
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:01,654
Now I can't get it out of my head!

920
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:03,772
- malaria, malaria. - Betty, we're waiting.

921
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,553
Sorry. I just have to, um, organize my notes.

922
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:13,188
Don't say "malaria." don't say "malaria."

923
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:14,180
Don't say...

924
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:17,836
Malaria!

925
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:20,690
Oh, dear god. No!

926
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,060
Wait. See, the united nations has this program

927
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:27,491
they promote bed netting to stop the spreading of malaria

928
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:28,467
In third world countries.

929
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,807
It's called "nothing but nets." it's very clever, right?

930
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,310
You're not gonna stop, are you?

931
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,365
What if we got a big designer to make a series of dresses

932
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:38,943
Out of the bed netting material?

933
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:41,468
And--and the u.n. Will let people shoot there

934
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,275
- If they promote awareness of one of their initiatives.  - Ok

935
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:45,304
It's a win-win, really.

936
00:50:45,324 --> 00:50:47,556
See, we look great, we're promoting a great cause.

937
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,737
It's only $10 to buy a net and save a life. I mean

938
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:51,858
I said okay!

939
00:50:52,474 --> 00:50:53,592
Don't make me take it back

940
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:55,939
Because the sound of your voice is annoying me.

941
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:57,973
Sorry.

942
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,940
All right, I'm done with you.

943
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:08,899
Push all my afternoon meetings to next week.

944
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:09,981
I am going home.

945
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,260
And I'm getting a pedicure. Oh!

946
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:14,283
Ah! And a manicure.

947
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:27,752
Ms. Slater? My name is Oscar Castelar.

948
00:51:27,772 --> 00:51:30,892
I'm investigating the disappearance of Jonathan Vieja.

949
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,725
I believe he's dating your daughter--

950
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:35,484
Or he was before he disappeared.

951
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:37,912
I'm sorry, Mr. Castelar.

952
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:39,126
Did you say you were with the police?

953
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:40,850
No. I'm a private investigator.

954
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,499
Jonathan's family in Madrid hired me to find him.

955
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:46,059
- Well, why didn't they call the police?  - They did.

956
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:48,992
But the American police think he's no longer on U.S. Soil.

957
00:51:49,428 --> 00:51:52,454
His family suspects otherwise. That's where I come in.

958
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,513
Well, where do I come in?

959
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,416
I love to get a chance to ask your daughter some questions

960
00:51:57,436 --> 00:51:58,981
About when she last saw Jonathan.

961
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,336
I'm not sure we can be of any help.

962
00:52:03,547 --> 00:52:05,412
She hasn't seen that boy in quite a while.

963
00:52:05,685 --> 00:52:07,269
You'd be surprised, Ms. Slater.

964
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,348
Sometimes the smallest detail can blow a case wide open.

965
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:12,808
So how about tomorrow?

966
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:25,294
Hey there.

967
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:28,541
I said, hey there.

968
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,603
So what, you're not talking to me now?

969
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:40,436
What gave it away, the not talking part? Hey.

970
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:42,767
I can't believe you told Marc not to talk to me.

971
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:45,820
You're mad at me about that? I should be mad at you.

972
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,561
You lied to me. Why didn't you tell me

973
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,245
That somebody at school was picking on you?

974
00:52:49,245 --> 00:52:50,245
He told you?!

975
00:52:50,773 --> 00:52:51,872
It was an accident.

976
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:53,473
But why do I have to hear it from somebody else?

977
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:54,784
What is going on with you?

978
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:59,016
Justin, don't walk away from me. Justin!

979
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:02,888
Sweetie, look, I know how hard high school is.

980
00:53:02,908 --> 00:53:05,902
Do you think it's easy being pregnant and go to classes

981
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:08,201
Well, skipping classes.

982
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:09,821
But everybody telling me I was getting fat--

983
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,997
So what? Do you think that has anything to do

984
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:14,220
With what I'm going through?

985
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:18,257
I'm just saying, you can talk to me. I understand.

986
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,140
You don't understand me at all.

987
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:35,017
Besides, you hate mosquitoes, we hate mosquitoes--

988
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:37,796
Everybody wins, except the mosquitoes.

989
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:39,935
Yes, I'll hold.

990
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:43,164
Looks like you're gonna make that u.n. Thing happen.

991
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,199
I'm trying. What are you doing?

992
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,178
You still have some office decor violations.

993
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:50,439
I thought I'd help out. Don't want you to get written up.

994
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,272
I can take care of it.

995
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:57,681
Yes, hi.

996
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:01,833
Really? Oh, well, that's, uh, that's amazing news.

997
00:54:01,853 --> 00:54:05,457
Um, yes, we were thinking, uh, sometime next week?

998
00:54:07,797 --> 00:54:08,439
Tomorrow?

999
00:54:10,507 --> 00:54:11,140
Hi, matt.

1000
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:12,398
Are you busy?

1001
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:18,302
Look, I know we're not exactly on the best terms--

1002
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:19,454
Given that you hate me and all,

1003
00:54:19,474 --> 00:54:22,630
But I have an eensy-weensy little problem

1004
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,879
With the u.n. Shoot.

1005
00:54:25,832 --> 00:54:26,897
It has to happen tomorrow.

1006
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:30,601
- Are you serious?  - Yes. It's the only day they can give us

1007
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:31,604
One of the council rooms.

1008
00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:33,496
I've already called about getting international models,

1009
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:34,868
And I spoke to Roberto Dipaolo.

1010
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:36,307
he agreed to design the dresses,

1011
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,907
even with the tight turnaround.

1012
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:38,505
Great

1013
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:40,507
So he thought he was signing up for something long-term

1014
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,769
And ended up with something short-term. I can relate.

1015
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:45,770
Not one of your best slams, but okay.

1016
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,546
- Are we done here?  - No.

1017
00:54:49,121 --> 00:54:52,692
Look, if this is gonna happen by tomorrow, then...

1018
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:56,262
I need the help of the entire department.

1019
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,721
Oh, so... You want me--

1020
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:01,753
Oh, Matt, please don't make this about you and me.

1021
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:03,478
This is about what's best for the magazine.

1022
00:55:05,212 --> 00:55:06,355
You know what? You're right.

1023
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:12,487
So betty needs you to drop everything you are working on

1024
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:14,281
To help her with what she's working on.

1025
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,017
As usual, everything is about what betty wants.

1026
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:19,737
Thank you for that, Matt.

1027
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:22,682
I like to think of this as a team effort.

1028
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,936
And there's no "i" in team, unless you spell it "t-e-i-m."

1029
00:55:30,055 --> 00:55:32,448
Anyway, uh, you all know the basic concept--

1030
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,182
Malaria, mosquitoes.

1031
00:55:34,202 --> 00:55:36,720
But we're at a fashion magazine, right? So still happy.

1032
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:39,108
There's a lot of work to be done before tomorrow,

1033
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,445
So expect to be here late.

1034
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:43,824
But the good news is, coffee's on me!

1035
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:49,594
Betty Suarez.

1036
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:51,433
Yeah, is this, uh, Daniel Meade's assistant?

1037
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:54,477
Um, nope. Not anymore, actually. Now... Whatever.

1038
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:57,126
What's wrong? Is everything okay? Who is this?

1039
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:58,392
Building security.

1040
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:00,487
I think we may have a situation with Mr. Meade.

1041
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:05,475
Stupid...

1042
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:08,018
Betty, I Know, it just

1043
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,502
...Molly and I were supposed to go on our honeymoon.

1044
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:12,610
I just--I have to see

1045
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,133
That stupid ad everywhere in this city.

1046
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:17,335
It just--there it was, right in front of "mode."

1047
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:18,550
I-i just--I lost it.

1048
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:22,333
you are surrounded by things that remind you of Molly.

1049
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:23,881
No, I know, Betty. I-i know.

1050
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:26,001
God, how could I have been so s--

1051
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:30,514
Okay, um...

1052
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:33,734
Let's maybe not hit things anymore.

1053
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:36,339
Look, we can find you another place to stay.

1054
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,344
No. I don't need another place to stay.

1055
00:56:38,512 --> 00:56:41,371
Look, I'm sorry you had to bring me home. I apologize.

1056
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,685
I hadn't seen my temp all day, okay?

1057
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:45,374
Daniel, I'm happy to help.

1058
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:48,497
Is there anything else I can do?

1059
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:50,344
No, nothing. Everything's fine.

1060
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:52,796
Besides, you need to go to work.

1061
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:54,665
Yeah, um...

1062
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,233
Well...

1063
00:56:58,755 --> 00:57:00,295
You probably shouldn't be alone.

1064
00:57:01,658 --> 00:57:02,987
Um... I could call your mom.

1065
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:07,061
No. Look, she just worries. Okay, go. I'm gonna be fine.

1066
00:57:09,216 --> 00:57:10,522
Daniel, you're crying.

1067
00:57:11,653 --> 00:57:13,492
No, it's these.....

1068
00:57:15,428 --> 00:57:16,035
Daniel!

1069
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:17,161
Son of a bitch!

1070
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:34,571
I haven't been sleeping...

1071
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,087
At all.

1072
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,545
Just a little on edge.

1073
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,665
Yeah, I know.

1074
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:44,345
It's just...

1075
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:49,932
I'm used to being in the room with someone.

1076
00:57:55,615 --> 00:57:56,609
And without that...

1077
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,055
It's--it's pretty quiet.

1078
00:58:05,557 --> 00:58:06,744
Just give me one second.

1079
00:58:10,368 --> 00:58:11,591
Betty, betty, where are you?

1080
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:12,885
I've got a room full of people here

1081
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:14,331
Waiting for you to go over your concept.

1082
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:15,831
I'm gonna be a little late.

1083
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:18,893
- What, what?!  - Something came up with daniel.

1084
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,541
Oh, what a shock. You're bailing on something

1085
00:58:21,561 --> 00:58:24,541
That I thought was important to you--for daniel, of course.

1086
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:25,966
I'm not bailing. It's just...

1087
00:58:26,652 --> 00:58:29,776
His wife died, and he's not doing so well.

1088
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,201
And I don't think he should be alone,

1089
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:32,398
So I'm just gonna work from here,

1090
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:33,980
And I'll get there as soon as I can.

1091
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,662
Betty, this is your concept meeting.

1092
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:38,662
Yeah, betty, thanks a bunch.

1093
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,020
Well, can you just run it?

1094
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,676
I mean, you know what the concept is. Fine.

1095
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:46,369
I guess your new job just can't compete with your old one.

1096
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:54,005
Good news. I can stay a little longer.

1097
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:56,310
- Oh, Betty, I can't ask you...  - You don't have to ask.

1098
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:42,666
"Mode" magazine, please hold.

1099
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:47,655
- You hung up on them, right?  - Totally. That felt so good.

1100
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,153
Thanks so much for letting me do this.

1101
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,370
It really takes me back.

1102
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:55,546
I cannot believe that you were a receptionist, too.

1103
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:57,174
Best 20 years of my life.

1104
00:59:57,464 --> 00:59:59,542
You know, being the face of the company...

1105
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,570
Deciding who gets to come in and who

1106
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,980
- Well,you know.  - Yeah. I pretty much run this place.

1107
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,580
Mm. So why'd you give it up?

1108
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,790
Oh,I didn't... Exactly.

1109
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,430
I guess one day,people decided that...

1110
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,470
You know what? You'll find out.

1111
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,180
Wait,no. Tell me.

1112
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,000
There just comes a time when they don't want yours

1113
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,760
To be the first face that people see anymore.

1114
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,150
So what do you do then?

1115
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,140
This.

1116
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,490
I mean,my life is still the same,hon.

1117
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,140
I still do as little work as I have to

1118
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,640
And go out every night,meet people.

1119
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,050
I'm not worried.

1120
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,590
Ooh,someone will marry me...

1121
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,570
Or make me a part of their entourage

1122
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:55,400
Or,or,ooh! Uh... Make a reality show about me.

1123
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,660
It's all good.

1124
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,490
Ooh,you know what? I gotta tinks... Sorry.

1125
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,970
I just tried to talk to Justin,

1126
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,780
And he wasn't saying much.

1127
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,270
Has he,uh,talked to you yet?

1128
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,430
No.

1129
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,970
He says I don't understand him.

1130
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,860
But Bella Santorini is gonna fix all of that.

1131
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,620
What are you talking about?

1132
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,230
I created a fake online profile.

1133
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,090
Bella friended Justin,and if he accepts,

1134
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,550
I have my way in. You can't be serious.

1135
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,680
what am I supposed to do? He doesn't want to talk to me,

1136
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,500
So I thought this is a good idea.

1137
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,040
Hilda,this is not a Hilary Duff movie.

1138
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,110
What? Justin had that Hilary/Haylie period,

1139
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,830
And maybe I'd watch,too.

1140
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,570
Those girls are very talented.

1141
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,100
Well,I... I don't know what to do.

1142
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,970
We were always so close,you know?

1143
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,320
And now everything is changing,

1144
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,280
And it's like I don't know what he needs

1145
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,820
Or how to help him.

1146
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,730
That's exactly how I felt when you were a teenager.

1147
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,240
believe me,you let me know many times and

1148
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,950
in colorful language That I didn't understand you.

1149
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,050
- So what did you do? - You don't remember?

1150
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,750
There were some years you barely talked to me,mija.

1151
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,340
This is being a parent.

1152
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,270
I wish I could tell you there was an easy solution.

1153
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,020
- Well,I can't do this. - Oh,Nico,calm down.

1154
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,117
I can't calm down,mom!

1155
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,650
I don't want talk to detective what happened that night

1156
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,220
You're gonna have to talk to the detective.

1157
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,820
No,mom. I can't go back there.

1158
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,730
I don't want to remember it.

1159
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,170
It was Jonathan.

1160
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,190
We were on his boat and he.he was yelling at me.

1161
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,900
- Well,why was he yelling at you?- I don't know!

1162
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,880
- Well,think. - He just... Sometimes things set him off.

1163
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,420
But this time was different. He grabbed me and he hit me.

1164
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,690
He just kept hitting me. I was so scared.

1165
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,390
I grabbed something to defend myself--anything!

1166
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,650
And I started hitting him back,again and again.

1167
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,800
I didn't know what to do.

1168
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,310
So I...I pushed him. Over the edge.

1169
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,170
And he didn't come up.

1170
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,800
Nico,I know it's hard,but we will get through this.

1171
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,450
And you will never have to relive that night again,

1172
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,740
Because we will invent a new one.

1173
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,320
Oh,my god!

1174
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:17,710
- I'm sorry. - We are way beyond "sorry" at this point,Betty.

1175
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,680
Yeah,well,I don't know what else to say. And I am sorry.

1176
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,550
Look,there's no time.

1177
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,590
We've got a big problem with Roberto Dipaolo.

1178
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,740
- He's threatening to walk. - What?!

1179
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,660
I don't have a problem. Everything is fantastic.

1180
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,380
And what an honor to be here at the United Nations.

1181
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,380
Oh. Great.

1182
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,430
Well,if there is anything you need,just let me know.

1183
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,860
Oh,of course. Mmm,you are such a darling!

1184
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,840
Uh,and I love all the...the things going on here.

1185
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,940
Oh,thank you.

1186
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,310
Roberto is not happy.

1187
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,180
Um,he seemed okay

1188
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,380
No,not happy! Roberto doesn't like to be the bad guy.

1189
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:00,340
He hired me to be unhappy for him.

1190
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,020
So why don't you take me through what you were doing

1191
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,370
The night of your boyfriend's disappearance?

1192
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,660
Go ahead,nico. We have no secrets.

1193
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,830
Well,um,we were both kind of depressed.

1194
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,850
Jonathan just dumped me. my mom recently lost a child

1195
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1196
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:32,430
Yes,but we move on,

1197
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:36,680
Which is why Nico and I wanted to spend some "us" time

1198
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,110
A night where we could just forget about everything else.

1199
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,620
We started by going to see "the proposal."

1200
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,980
Oh,did we laugh...

1201
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,050
And cried.

1202
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,030
And then we went to serendipity for frozen hot chocolates.

1203
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,890
Women will do anything to get their chocolate.

1204
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,780
And then we came home

1205
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,340
And watched a "Gilmore girls" marathon

1206
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:59,390
Until we fell asleep.

1207
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,310
We're just like that.

1208
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,810
Except they talk so fast. I swear,they make me dizzy.

1209
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,970
And I had just stopped being seasick.

1210
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,370
Seasick?

1211
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,850
Why were you seasick?

1212
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:20,510
We took a water taxi to see the city at night.

1213
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,930
Yes,I know it sounds like a romantic thing,

1214
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,560
But we didn't care.

1215
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,900
Sometimes you just need to

1216
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,940
Do those kind of things for yourself.

1217
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,780
Okay.

1218
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,030
I think I have all that I need for now.

1219
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,920
I'll be in touch.

1220
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,890
Thank you,ladies.

1221
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,210
I did dipaolo's contracts that was what you asked me to do.

1222
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,400
Okay,great.

1223
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,870
Well,there's a problem with his rider.

1224
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,000
There's supposed to be an assortment

1225
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,970
Of fun-sized chocolates in his greenroom,but apparently--

1226
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,360
Betty,you asked me to do his paperwork,

1227
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,170
- Not go shopping for snacks. - Right.

1228
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,060
But I thought you would just,you know,do it.

1229
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,030
Okay,it's darling that you thought this shoot

1230
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:00,170
Would somehow come together without you to guide it.

1231
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,400
I've been guiding it. Of course you have.

1232
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,620
Some friendly advice from a senior editor--

1233
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,400
No one is your friend. If you want something done right,

1234
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,990
You do it yourself.

1235
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,630
I could've given you this advice last night

1236
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:13,370
While we were working late,but...

1237
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,620
Where were you again?

1238
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,120
Okay,you made your point.

1239
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,410
What is going on here?

1240
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,210
I wouldn't know. I don't speak russian,

1241
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,330
And I don't think those two speak any english.

1242
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,100
Um,ladies,excuse me? Ladies?

1243
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,580
- where's Suzanne? She's in charge of models. - over there.

1244
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,660
Suzanne!

1245
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,760
Now I know you asked her to book international models.

1246
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:41,480
- Did you ask her to book interpreters,too? - Inter--what?

1247
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,200
Um,Olga,no. No hitting!

1248
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,070
Please,you're gonna tear the dresses. Suzanne!

1249
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,630
I mean,she was a receptionist just like me,

1250
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,080
And now the highlight of her day is getting groped

1251
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,600
- By serge the doorman? - That's the highlight of your day.

1252
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,200
- I know. - Mandy,look. We've discussed this.

1253
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,940
When your looks start to go,we are buying you new ones.

1254
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,350
I know, I know. But it's not just that.

1255
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,193
I guess I assumed things would always come to me

1256
01:08:05,193 --> 01:08:05,954
Because I'm pretty.

1257
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:09,000
Well,as long as people only look at your left side,

1258
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,190
They will. But what if they don't,Marc?

1259
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,940
What if things don't just come to me?

1260
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,650
What if I have to go to things?

1261
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,800
I think I want more than this.

1262
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,520
I can't be a receptionist forever.

1263
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,780
Oh,my god. This is really huge.

1264
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,560
what are you gonna do?

1265
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,140
I'm gonna send the phones to voice mail

1266
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,470
And go drink my face off.

1267
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,790
Hey,Marc. Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?

1268
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,330
That depends on how much

1269
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:43,320
finger-wagging and lip-smacking there's going to be.

1270
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,890
None, unless you keep that up. Stop!

1271
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,730
Sorry, I'm just...

1272
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,170
I'm here to talk about Justin.

1273
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,440
I haven't said a word to him.

1274
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,020
I know, I know.

1275
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,020
I need your help.

1276
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,630
I need you to help me figure out

1277
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:04,860
How to get Justin to start talking to me again.

1278
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:07,280
Well,that's your first mistake.

1279
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:09,110
He only came to me because he wants

1280
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,635
To talk to someone who understands him.

1281
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:12,080
I understand him.

1282
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:13,630
He just thinks that I don't.

1283
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,630
- You're his mom. - So?

1284
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,120
There are a couple of areas

1285
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:22,540
Where... I have an edge.

1286
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,780
Well,it's just...

1287
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,380
It's not easy to see your son

1288
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,680
Going through something so hard,

1289
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:33,530
And I want to do something.

1290
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:38,920
Well, you care about what happens to him.

1291
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,830
Not everybody has that.

1292
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,360
Well, do you think maybe you could talk to him?

1293
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,310
I mean, if he-- If he comes to you again?

1294
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,820
- Yeah, I could do that.  - Okay.

1295
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,520
Oh, uh, just...

1296
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,910
If it's something really big,maybe you could tell me?

1297
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:05,440
Oh. Well, I-I-- Yeah, I could do that.

1298
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,220
Okay.

1299
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,240
They are from different countries.

1300
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,690
Olga's from Georgia, and Tatiana's from Russia.

1301
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,860
Oh. Okay, so-- So they're fighting

1302
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,690
Because their countries are at war?

1303
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:32,200
She's saying, "that bitch stole my boyfriend."

1304
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,600
"I will kill you, you insect-ridden whore."

1305
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,290
Okay, I get the picture. Thank you.

1306
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,410
- Betty, how's everything going? - Hey! Great! Good!

1307
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,200
What's going on there?

1308
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,300
Oh, nothing. They're just hungry.

1309
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:46,040
I'm so glad you're here and looking rested.

1310
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,800
Oh, thank you, again, for last night.

1311
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,020
Don't mention it.

1312
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,830
Would you excuse me just one second?

1313
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,460
Can you tell your friend

1314
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,690
I have to go back to the nuclear disarmament talks?

1315
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,850
Maybe turn it a little bit this way

1316
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,220
- so the stingers...  - Where did that thing come from?

1317
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,090
This is a photo shoot about malaria.

1318
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,320
Which is caused by mosquitoes.

1319
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,130
So why do you want a smiling mosquito?

1320
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,950
Is he happy because he caused some malaria?

1321
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,060
This is your concept, Betty...mosquitoes, malaria,

1322
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,930
But also happy.

1323
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:11,980
That's what you said, remember?

1324
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,550
I didn't say happy mosquitoes!

1325
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,650
Who wants to see an angry mosquito?

1326
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,290
Who wants to see a mosquito at all?!

1327
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,290
You know what? You weren't there at the concept meeting,

1328
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,319
So don't blame me

1329
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,610
If you let something slip through the cracks.

1330
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,710
Matt. you know I was helping Daniel.

1331
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,093
Exactly. And that is why

1332
01:11:26,093 --> 01:11:28,500
You have a smiling mosquito at your photo shoot.

1333
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,920
- You happy now?  - No, I'm not--

1334
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:31,000
Unlike that mosquito.

1335
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,500
You know what? I don't know why I'm surprised.

1336
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,980
I mean, this is totally typical of you.

1337
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,287
You make a big commitment

1338
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:37,210
And then just abandon it at the last minute.

1339
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,060
That is so unfair.

1340
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:39,640
We're not even talking about the shoot anymore.

1341
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:41,700
Yes, we are! I am supposed to be your boss--me.

1342
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,000
You should've been here,

1343
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,210
Not out with Daniel doing whatever.

1344
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,720
You're not his assistant anymore.

1345
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,640
And, you know, what were you doing all night, huh?

1346
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,380
Are you two, uh, sleeping together now, too?

1347
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:15,360
I don't know what to do with these girls.

1348
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,860
Ladies, please! Please! That is expensive!

1349
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,655
I'm sorry, Mr. Dipaolo.

1350
01:12:20,655 --> 01:12:22,010
Please don't go. We can fix this.

1351
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,460
I can get different models.

1352
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,510
Don't leave!

1353
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,140
Ladies! I need you to stop right now!

1354
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,294
Is there anybody here

1355
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,010
who can help me with these models?!

1356
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,300
Anybody?!

1357
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,570
What the hell is going on here?!

1358
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,050
I can explain.

1359
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:46,754
You know what?

1360
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:48,420
I don't even know why I asked that question.

1361
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:49,690
I don't care.

1362
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,500
Your shoot is falling apart--

1363
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,080
Your shoot for my magazine!

1364
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:54,890
It's my magazine, too, Wilhelmina.

1365
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,740
Well, then start acting like it.

1366
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,980
You're punching out your employees.

1367
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,820
Even I know not to do that in public, Daniel.

1368
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,450
I'm throwing you both out.

1369
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,320
- What?!  - What?!

1370
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,560
I'm taking over the shoot.

1371
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:07,398
You're both leaving,

1372
01:13:07,398 --> 01:13:09,760
And we're losing that ridiculous mosquito!

1373
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,330
That was... That was Betty's idea.

1374
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,250
You can't throw me out, Wilhelmina.

1375
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,190
And I'm sure as hell not gonna let you throw Betty

1376
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,170
Out of her own shoot.

1377
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,870
- Daniel...  - No, let me finish.

1378
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,140
You have to understand one thing--

1379
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,001
You mess with Betty,

1380
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:21,880
You're messing with me. You got it?

1381
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,780
That goes for every single one of you!

1382
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:25,230
Daniel, please stop.

1383
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,100
We'll leave.

1384
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:29,910
What?!

1385
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,240
She's right. You just assaulted somebody.

1386
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,320
They could arrest you, so let's just go.

1387
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,110
- I'm sorry, Wilhelmina. - I am, too.

1388
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,550
I had hoped that you were changing,

1389
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,840
But obviously, I was wrong.

1390
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,610
I can't believe it!

1391
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:07,230
I can't believe it! I can't believe it.

1392
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,130
Count 'em-- Five motivations!

1393
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,880
Mind if I join you?

1394
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,430
Or is "wipeout" something you need to do alone?

1395
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,980
How's everything at school?

1396
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,940
Yeah, it's fine.

1397
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,290
Good.

1398
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,730
But if it's ever not fine,

1399
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,260
And you need someone to talk to--not me--

1400
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,100
You know, it's fine.

1401
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,930
I talked to Marc.

1402
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:47,450
Yeah. So everything's... Everything's okay.

1403
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,600
I am sorry

1404
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,280
That I stuck my nose in your business.

1405
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,760
It's just...

1406
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:00,900
I worry about you.

1407
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,770
I know.

1408
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:04,730
But you're growing up,

1409
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:08,320
And I can't tell you who to be friends with,

1410
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:10,780
And I can't tell you who to confide in.

1411
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,330
I just hope that you know

1412
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,630
That if you ever do need someone to talk to,

1413
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,390
You can talk to me.

1414
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,500
Even if I don't... understand you.

1415
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:34,990
Okay.

1416
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,150
You shouldn't have hit Matt like that, you know?

1417
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,080
Yeah, well, he was being a jerk.

1418
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,240
Yeah, that might be,

1419
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,850
But you still shouldn't have punched him.

1420
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,720
Okay.

1421
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,270
Then why are you smiling?

1422
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,900
Fine! I can't help it.

1423
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,280
He was being a jerk. He deserved it.

1424
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,630
But it still wasn't the right thing to do.

1425
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,460
Look, I know. I'm sorry.

1426
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,850
You're absolutely right.

1427
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,310
I, I messed up.

1428
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,530
Daniel, I've been worried about you.

1429
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:23,340
Ever since you got back to New York, it's like you're...

1430
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,040
Angry?

1431
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:26,570
Yeah.

1432
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,590
I am angry.

1433
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,890
Betty, I'm... I'm so angry at myself.

1434
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,210
I'm angry I couldn't...

1435
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,330
Help...

1436
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:41,670
Molly.

1437
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,180
When you told me what was going on at the office,

1438
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,730
I guess I just thought, finally, I could help someone.

1439
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,480
- Daniel  - I know I shouldn't have hit Matt,

1440
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:56,340
But I'm so tired... Of feeling helpless.

1441
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:00,520
I think you need to talk to someone.

1442
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,460
Look, not, not your family,

1443
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:06,010
Maybe not me, just... Just someone.

1444
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,180
Listen...

1445
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,730
I think you might have made a mistake.

1446
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:18,870
What do you mean?

1447
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,360
You decided to help me instead of doing your job.

1448
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,040
You're not my assistant anymore.

1449
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,200
Things are changing, for both of us.

1450
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:27,030
We have to accept that.

1451
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,060
Well, what if I don't want 'em to change?

1452
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,220
Well, why don't you want them to change?

1453
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,580
They could get better.

1454
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,350
I guess. I just

1455
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,160
I just don't want to lose who I am.

1456
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,580
Listen to me.

1457
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,950
You are not the same person I met three years ago.

1458
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,990
Betty, you've already changed.

1459
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,420
But you're still you.

1460
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,570
So...

1461
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:59,060
How does this work now, you and me?

1462
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,800
We're not "boss" and "assistant" anymore.

1463
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,790
No.

1464
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,550
We're friends.

1465
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,290
Friends.

1466
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,170
Good morning

1467
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,200
Good morning.

1468
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,910
You are not gonna believe it.

1469
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,410
I made my very first house call.

1470
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,300
It's like I'm a doctor, you know, but for hair.

1471
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,680
Aw, man.

1472
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,670
- Oh, your glasses broke again?  - Yeah.

1473
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:48,550
I'll get you some tape.

1474
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,080
Oh, hey. Do you want me to cut your bangs?

1475
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,020
No.

1476
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,050
I think I'm okay.

1477
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,080
I might try something different.

1478
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,200
Well, all right.

1479
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,230
Good morning, Amanda.

1480
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,820
Something's different.

1481
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:52,700
- You got your braces off!  - No, I didn't.

1482
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,200
Oh, you shaved.

1483
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,720
Betty.

1484
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,750
Oh, it's not that funny.

1485
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,050
Hi, sweetie.

1486
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,880
Hey, babe.

1487
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,660
Hey, are you leaving?

1488
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:13,720
Yeah, they kind of fired me yesterday,

1489
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,420
But I just came by to pick up some of my stuff.

1490
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:18,760
But you're a temp. You don't have stuff.

1491
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,070
Well, I do now.

1492
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,080
Oh, hey, wait.

1493
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,500
In case you miss it.

1494
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,620
Thanks.

1495
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:33,280
That's, like, the nicest thing anyone's ever gotten me!

1496
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:36,660
Hello, "Mode" magazine.

1497
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,860
No, uh, I don't know where she went. I...

1498
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,950
I'm sorry that Daniel hit you.

1499
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,440
Yeah, me, too.

1500
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,250
And I'm also really sorry

1501
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,380
That the UN Shoot almost fell apart.

1502
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,390
I take full responsibility for that,

1503
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,330
And I promise, it will never happen again.

1504
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,490
I hope not.

1505
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,350
You know, Matt,

1506
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,060
I will always regret what happened between us.

1507
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,590
I made a mistake, and I can't change it.

1508
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,780
But I have to move on now.

1509
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,260
I've worked very hard to get to where I am now,

1510
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,770
And I'm not about to give up.

1511
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,660
Oh, and for whatever it's worth,

1512
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,330
Daniel won't be interfering on my behalf anymore.

1513
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,150
I can fight my own battles.

1514
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,680
So, uh, next time, you're gonna hit me?

1515
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,350
Yeah.

1516
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,190
No, no, no. It's our pleasure.

1517
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:56,390
Nico and I want to get to the bottom of this mystery

1518
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,420
as much as you do.

1519
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,360
Thanks.

1520
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,100
He bought our story.

1521
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:02,390
Oh, thank god. That's such a relief.

1522
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,130
Well, it's a good first step,

1523
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,670
But we can never let our guard down.

1524
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,710
That's when you get into trouble.

1525
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,440
You got a delivery while you were out.

1526
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,810
I signed for it, so I hope it's nothing illegal.

1527
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:29,030
Oh, my gosh!

1528
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,110
I finally found some fashion-related decor for our office.

1529
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,600
You're gonna love it.

1530
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:43,470
That's fashion-related?

1531
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,470
Guadalajara

1532
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,110
Betty, do you want a ride?

1533
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,070
Actually, I have my own.

1534
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,810
You know, when you're an editor and you work late,

1535
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,050
You get your own town car.

1536
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,400
Not so bad, is it?

1537
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:08,720
Nope.

1538
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,880
Hey, I'll see you tomorrow.

1539
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,530
See you tomorrow.
