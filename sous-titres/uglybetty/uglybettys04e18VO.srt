1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,167
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,603
Hey, Austin, just
leaving another message.

3
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,070
Don't really know
how you're feeling.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,982
- Tyler is not who you think he is.
- Well, who is he then?

5
00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:14,450
- He's your brother.
- So who's the father, huh?

6
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,652
Now you tell me there's some
little bastard out there.

7
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,921
Who could just waltz in
here and demand his cut!

8
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:21,257
It's Meade. I want the
whole damn company.

9
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,192
No more nice Willie!

10
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:25,795
Tyler, I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

11
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,997
- They're gone?
- Betty, you look great.

12
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,510
You may now kiss the bride.

13
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,212
- Aah!
- Aah!

14
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,750
What, are you stepping out
on me before our wding?

15
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:51,520
I guess it's a little hard
to tell us apart now that

16
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,923
I'm not wearing braces.

17
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,858
Yeah.

18
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:58,527
Okay, okay. Enough
monkey business. Baby,

19
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:00,682
according to "how to plan
a wedding in 60 days"...

20
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,295
We were supposed to have
a wedding photographer,

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,870
like, last week.
"Based on the popular blog."

22
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:07,897
This woman turned her
blog into a book.

23
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,966
Meanwhile, I haven't
even posted in over a moh.

24
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,901
Because I've been so busy at work.

25
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,380
Well, I hope you haven't
been too busy...

26
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,312
To plan my bachelorette
party this weekend.

27
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:18,148
Hey, I got my party planned...

28
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,884
Booze, boobs and a
bus to Atlantic city.

29
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,953
You're traveling?

30
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,990
- Yeah.
- Why does he get to travel? I want to travel.

31
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:27,806
Travel is the part that
you have a problem with?

32
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:30,775
- Ay, please. Like he's gonna do better than this?
- That's right.

33
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:34,891
Anyway, maid of honor,
what fun thing are we doing?

34
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:37,146
Well, get ready...

35
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:42,017
Because I have scored us a
private after- hours... ooh!

36
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,819
Champagne... wow.

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,855
Tour at the met!

38
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:49,658
Get outta here!

39
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,094
That's a good one!

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,297
- The met!
- The met?

41
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:55,899
That would've been the worst
bachelorette party ever!

42
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,932
Right? I know!

43
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:04,170
I was keeping the
real party a surprise.

44
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:07,740
- Oh, okaygood.
- You're gonna love it!

45
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:10,309
Shh! See you later.

46
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:13,538
Hey, Justin, you, uh,
you want a ride to school?

47
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,274
No, sorry. I'm walking with Austin.

48
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,543
Justin doesn't walk.

49
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:19,598
He's told me a thousand times,

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,626
"shoes are for fashion,
not function."

51
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:24,095
I don't know. You know, we,
uh, we used to be friends.

52
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,064
I don't know what's up with
him lately. Maybe, uh...

53
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,358
Maybe I did something wrong.

54
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:31,570
You're about to be
his new stepfather.

55
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,505
That's gotta be weird for a kid.

56
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,184
You know what? This weekend,

57
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:38,142
you guys go and do
something fun together.

58
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:40,307
That's a good idea.

59
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:45,784
And that is my parents
in a nutshell.

60
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,089
Um...

61
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,089
I don't mean to keep
harping on this,

62
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,796
but you don't have any news
tracking down my father, do you?

63
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,766
Actually, I do.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,534
I- I just learned that.

65
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:04,363
The rehab facility
where we met shut down,

66
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,529
and, uh, those records
can't be retrieved,

67
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,466
so we'll never be able to find him.

68
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:11,844
I... I'm... so sorry, Tyler.

69
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,479
Oh, it's okay.

70
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:15,949
So I was conceived
at a rehab facility.

71
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:19,786
I, uh, guess I was destined
to be an alcoholic.

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,789
I don't think we
should joke about that.

73
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:24,924
Have you spoken to Daniel yet?

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,293
I tried, but...

75
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,762
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

76
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,764
I hate that you're leaving so soon,

77
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,627
and you two never got
to know each other.

78
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,100
It's fine.

79
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:39,706
I came to meet you,
and that part worked out.

80
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:44,877
Ooh! I could take
hilda horseback riding.

81
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,879
For her bachelorette party.

82
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:48,881
Or, better yet,
naked horseback riding.

83
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,551
You're welcome. Gross. And ow!

84
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,040
Well, I'm out of ideas then.

85
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,969
Well, all of your
ideas involve nudity.

86
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,004
You're welcome. Stop saying that.

87
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,992
Oh! An e- mail from
the trapeze school.

88
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:03,830
$1,000? Come on.
That was my favorite option.

89
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,831
This totally sucks!

90
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,766
Are you talking to me?

91
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,170
No. I was talking to... never mind.

92
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh. So what sucks?

93
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,951
I have to plan the perfect
bachelorette party for my sister,

94
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,223
and nothing is working out.

95
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,495
It's just really disappointing.

96
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:19,451
Oh, well, I know disappointment.

97
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,386
My half brother hates me,

98
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:24,256
and I have no hope of finding
my biological father.

99
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,959
Okay... perspective.

100
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:31,046
Well... if it helps,
I've known Daniel for years,

101
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:33,664
and if you just give him time,
he'll come around.

102
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:34,817
Oh.

103
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:42,978
If you'll excuse me,

104
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,346
I have to go deal with
something annoying.

105
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:49,917
I see you.

106
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,421
So, uh... what,
aryou on team tyr now?

107
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,022
No. Daniel, I'm not on team anyone.

108
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:59,772
Tyler is not a bad guy.
Put yourself in his shoes.

109
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,007
Shoes? More like smelly,
old cowboy boots.

110
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:05,144
- Okay, you're 5 years old.
- No, you're 5 years old.

111
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:08,080
Someone needs a nap.
We'll talk about this later.

112
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:11,350
Fine. But I'm putting you
down for team Daniel.

113
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,421
As requested,

114
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,424
here is some clothing from...

115
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,759
The mall.

116
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:22,561
Ugh.

117
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,530
Now I'm not one to pry,

118
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:27,666
but you didn't exactly
specify what this is all for.

119
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,401
It's for an important meeting.

120
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,337
That I can't be seen
wearing cashmere and furs.

121
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,973
Mysterious. Still not prying,

122
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,342
but would this meeting
have anything to do.

123
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:38,444
With your plan to
overthrow the meades?

124
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,834
Yes. It involves Claire's
recently revealed love child...

125
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:44,950
Tyler. Aw, he's such a rube.

126
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,749
And he's so hot.
Must he be a part of all this?

127
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,284
He's just a pawn...

128
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,185
The weak link in the Meade chain.

129
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,021
I gain his trust,

130
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,989
everything else falls into place.

131
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,357
Ow!

132
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:58,259
Willie's being all weird again.

133
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:00,228
And you're being...

134
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,763
British.

135
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:02,988
I'm trying to look authentic.

136
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,285
For my trip to london with Daniel,

137
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,205
but it feels like I'm
missing something.

138
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,866
A riding crop? A horse? Dignity?

139
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,279
Wow. Somebody's jealous.
Yeah, I'm jealous!

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,225
You get to go all
the way to london.

141
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,439
I have to stay here and
figure out who I'm gonna take.

142
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,772
As my plus- one to hilda's
stupid straight wedding.

143
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,309
Why don't you bring your boyfriend?

144
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,395
Oh, my God. I totally forgot I
had that boyfriend trey. Troy.

145
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,231
I like trey better. Or Trevor.
We'll talk about it.

146
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,967
I'm sure he'll want to weigh in.

147
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:31,531
You're going to the london
fashion week, Daniel, really?

148
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,285
No, there are some
big designers there.

149
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,402
You call it "the training
bra of fashion weeks."

150
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,104
And you're only ever interested
in the big, sexy ones,

151
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,873
so why are you going?

152
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:42,014
Is this one of those times
where you ask me a question.

153
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,625
That you already know thanswer to?

154
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:46,016
The answers... you
don't need to be there.

155
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,415
You're just going to avoid
this whole thing with Tyler.

156
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,915
- Am I right? You know what?
- I hate it when you know me.

157
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,283
So send someone in your
place and stay here.

158
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:55,251
Reach out to your
long- lost half brother.

159
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,320
Who traveled across the
country to meet you,

160
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:00,623
- who you've been nothing but a jerk to.
- Okay, fine, fine.

161
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:04,131
- But who's gonna go to london, Hmm? You?
- No, I can't go.

162
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,423
I have to stay and plan
hilda's bachelorette party.

163
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,473
I still have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

164
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:12,227
She wants something big
and exciting and fun,

165
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,463
but with travel.

166
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:16,565
Wait a second.

167
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,935
I can't believe it!
A bachelorette trip to london!

168
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,639
Oh, my gosh! I thought your party
was gonna be so lameass! Hey!

169
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,974
And it turns out
it's gonna be badass!

170
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,043
Yeah! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

171
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,646
Suck on that, talercio! Suck on it!

172
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,675
Oh, my God!

173
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,544
We're in london.

174
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,379
Ms. suarez, welcome.

175
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,681
Oh, you know my name.

176
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,322
Of course. We'reery
honored to have you here.

177
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,751
Oh, my God! You are
totally famous here.

178
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,187
Oh, please wait.
I'd like to, um, tip you.

179
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:25,323
I'm sure I have a few extra
pounds in here somewhere.

180
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:29,227
Somewhere? Uh, what about
here and here and here?

181
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,929
Hey! And how about here?

182
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,198
You are workinfor her this week.
Can you be nice?

183
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,933
Betty!

184
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:40,338
Oh, she looks so elegant! I know!

185
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:44,075
Eyes up, you dozy choob!

186
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,240
Hey, watch where you're goin'!

187
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,711
Yeah, yeah. Stick it
up your fish pipe.

188
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,080
There's the drunk I remember.

189
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,548
Hi!

190
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:53,651
Oh! Look at you! No braces!

191
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,121
Look at you!

192
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,556
How's Stuart and the baby? Oh,
they're good! But they're at home.

193
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,673
So how soon can we get a
drink in this mama's hand.

194
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,857
And get this hen night started?

195
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,575
Well, there's an opening
night cocktail party.

196
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,412
In, like, 30 minutes.
Oh, right- o! Cheerio!

197
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,406
Oh, my God. I sound
like a local, right?

198
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,841
Right. Let's go.

199
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,477
Yeah, right? Hilda,
you're getting married!

200
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,947
These past few months have
been the most challenging...

201
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,416
Away from home.

202
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,820
And my family and my routine.

203
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,390
I've actually been
slipping up a lot.

204
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:28,358
And I've got to say that.

205
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:31,261
Things can get pretty
dark when I drink,

206
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,331
but I'm thankful that I can
come here for your support.

207
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,473
I see a new face in the back.

208
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,742
Will you please stand
and introduce yourself?

209
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,085
Uh, my name is Wilhelmina s.,

210
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:58,321
and I'm an alcoholic.

211
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:00,891
Hi, Wilhelmina. Hi.

212
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,460
You know I love hanging
out at your house...

213
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,429
Playing video games,
watching movies...

214
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:09,199
But... but do you think we should
go somewhere else sometime?

215
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,034
What, like your house?

216
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,503
Like on a date. Is that weird?

217
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,440
No. No, not at all. I love it.

218
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:18,608
You know, our first real date.

219
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,444
How about tomorrow night?

220
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,379
What are we gonna do?

221
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,181
I'll surprise you.

222
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:25,716
Hey, what's up, j.?

223
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,150
Hey. Hi, Bobby.

224
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,653
Um, you know that my mom
is in london, right?

225
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,588
Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm here.

226
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:33,056
Listen, I'm thinking.

227
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,325
We have a special bachelor
party for me, huh?

228
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,928
Suarez men only.
Tomorrow night. All right.

229
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,731
Sounds like fun,
but Austin and I have plans.

230
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,233
But don't let me
stop you and grandpa.

231
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,968
From, you know,
tearing up the clubs.

232
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,304
Can you change your plans?
This is important.

233
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,073
Uh, I don't really think... it's cool.
We can do it another time.

234
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,609
Hey, thanks, Austin. All right!

235
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,244
Tomorrow night,

236
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,379
the three amigos
versus the big city.

237
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:59,182
Ooh! Big city, look out.

238
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,757
Hidy- ho, bitches! Hey,
where'd that bag come from?

239
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,241
I rifled through your stuff earlier,
and it was not in there.

240
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:12,195
The designer had it
messengered to me.

241
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,478
I could get used to that.

242
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,195
Ooh, as the designated
bachelorette,

243
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,664
I call dibs on the next freebie.

244
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,610
So sorry to interrupt,

245
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:23,447
- I just had to tell you, I loved your last show.
- Thank you.

246
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,416
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

247
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,818
Ooh! Aah!

248
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,520
Okay, that was, like,

249
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,488
the third person
who's come up to you.

250
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,924
Do they think you're judi dench?
I'm afraid not.

251
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,360
You see, I had a little
show here about a month ago,

252
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:39,496
and, uh, well, some people
kind of liked it. Oh, come on.

253
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,533
Wow. Christina,
your dreams came true.

254
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,860
That's not what I saw for you.

255
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,369
Oh, I really need a break from her.

256
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,639
We're gonna go get a
drink at the bar. Yep.

257
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,074
Here you go, my dear.

258
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,734
Oh, my God, Christina,
that's Lindsay dunne.

259
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:54,788
Mm- Hmm. He's, like,

260
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,338
the most powerful publisher
in all of britain.

261
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,506
- Oh, my... he's coming this way.
- Christina.

262
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,909
Mr. dunne, good to see you.

263
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,861
This is my good
friend Betty suarez.

264
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,580
She actually works at "mode"
magazine as a features editor.

265
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:08,662
Ms. suarez, a pleasure.

266
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,731
No, me.

267
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:13,100
I mean, I am the pleasured one.

268
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,723
Betty is a rising star, actually.

269
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:18,259
Uh, and she's clearly
very excited to meet you.

270
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:20,094
Oh. Well, I'm flattered.

271
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:23,597
- I'm always on the lookout for a rising star.
- Okay.

272
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,121
Would you be interested
in an opportunity

273
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:27,535
- to do more?
- More? What do you mean?

274
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:29,637
Well, one of my fashion
magazines, "ultramod,"

275
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:31,572
has lost its new
york- based columnist.

276
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:34,508
Being that you're familiar
with the sce over there,

277
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:36,844
would you have any
interest in interviewing?

278
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:39,880
- Oh.
- You can still keep your job at "mode."

279
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,715
Wow.

280
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,285
That would be amazing.

281
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,820
Yes.

282
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:50,124
All right then. Call my
office and set up a meeting.

283
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,793
Aah! Aah!

284
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,563
I have my work, which I love,

285
00:12:55,597 --> 00:13:00,801
but it cannot fill the void
of my estranged family.

286
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:03,137
Thank you for sharing.

287
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:08,175
Okay, everyone. See you next week.

288
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,945
Ms. Slater.

289
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,614
I had no idea.

290
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,850
Ohh.

291
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:18,119
Tyler, please call me Wilhelmina.

292
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:19,303
Okay.

293
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:22,623
Oh, well. I guess my
little secret is out.

294
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,091
I'd appreciate it.

295
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:26,708
If you would not s a
word to Claire or Daniel.

296
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:27,136
Of course.

297
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:31,179
I mean, I- I know how tough
it is when you need to talk,

298
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,348
and you can't turn to
the people around you.

299
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,951
Well, thank God we
have our sponsors.

300
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:38,386
You do have a sponsor, don't you?

301
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:40,388
Actually, since I've been here,

302
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:44,062
really haven't been able
to connect with anybody.

303
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,504
Well, don't say another word.
Consider Willie your sponsor.

304
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:50,139
Okay.

305
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,505
Would you like another scone?

306
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,107
No, I can barely eat.

307
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,510
I'm so excited to go
to these fashion shows.

308
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,048
Hilda, a couple years ago,

309
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,531
I was lucky to be standing
behind a tent pole, and now...

310
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,123
I mean, I don't want
to get my hopes up...

311
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:14,658
- But I might get a chair!
- Ooh! A chair. That means a gift bag,

312
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,461
and as your designated bachelorette-
your name is already on it.

313
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,930
Yay! Okay, we really have to leave.

314
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,899
A waiter has just come up to Amanda.

315
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,834
And asked her if she
wanted bangers and mash.

316
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:26,771
She followed him into the loo!
Turns out, it's just food.

317
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:30,752
Okay, bachelorettes,
since I can't be with you,

318
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,822
I have plann out the perfect day.

319
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,290
Itineraries.

320
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:38,393
Maximizes historical sites.
Minimizes...

321
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:39,861
Fun.

322
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:42,297
I was going to say, "travel time."

323
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,432
They're just suggestions,
and I promise,

324
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,335
- I will catch up with you as soon as I can.
- All right, but, Betty,

325
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,605
you better not be late for my party,
or I'm gonna be pissed.

326
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,508
- Hey. You know that here that means drunk?
- That works, too.

327
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,643
Mwah.

328
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:55,810
Hey.

329
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,013
Oh, Amanda.

330
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,616
Take lots of pictures!

331
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:47,471
So how are things
going with the meades?

332
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,524
I was so touched by what you shared.

333
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,306
About getting to know your family.

334
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:54,961
Oh, I'm actually, uh,
going out tonight with Daniel.

335
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,030
He wants us to get along.

336
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,599
That's very Noble of him.

337
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,780
What is it?

338
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,248
Well...

339
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,751
I've just known the
meades for a lo time,

340
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:10,188
and they're not the most...
Forthcoming.

341
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,928
Well, Claire's been
totally straight with me.

342
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,297
I mean, just this morning
she was telling me.

343
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:17,604
About my father-
how they met in rehab.

344
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,352
And how she's done
everything she could.

345
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,253
To track him down for me.

346
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:25,162
Tyler, can I be Frank?

347
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:29,666
They're terrified of you.

348
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,768
What?

349
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,025
Well, it's true.

350
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,447
As far as they're concerned,

351
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:35,927
you're just other
claim to their empire.

352
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,517
Wh... I- I just want to
get to know my family.

353
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,019
Well, I know that,

354
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,454
but I'm not as cynical
as the meades.

355
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,923
I wouldn't be surprised.

356
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,192
If they tried to pay you
off just to get rid of you.

357
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:48,762
Oh, come on. They wouldn't
do that, would they?

358
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:50,764
I've held my tongue long enough.

359
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,166
I do own half this company, too,

360
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:55,702
so it's time we talk about
Claire's bastard child.

361
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:57,612
What are you talking about?

362
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:59,432
You think this hayseed
crawled out of his corncrib.

363
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,292
And came all the way to Manhattan.

364
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:04,195
Just for a family reunion? - Look,
I'm no fan of the guy,

365
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,710
but I don't think
Tyler's after our money.

366
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:10,460
Daniel, are you that naive?
Take my advice.

367
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,501
Take him out on the town
with his new Big Brother,

368
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:14,116
get him through a
couple of velvet ropes.

369
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,986
And make him feel like a big shot.

370
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,917
Then write him a big, fat check,

371
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:21,287
and stick him on the first
train back to hicksville.

372
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:24,290
Well, you're probably right.

373
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:28,427
Even the meades would
never sink that low.

374
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,029
Sugar?

375
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,967
Trey, there you are. Hi, trey.

376
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,469
It's Troy,

377
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:39,372
and you know I don't like when
you pick new names for me.

378
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:42,208
Actually, I didn't know that.

379
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:44,677
You're so complicated, Trevor.

380
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,646
I'm sorry. I have
been so busy lately.

381
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,115
I got this promotion,
but you are in luck,

382
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:50,464
because I've got a
wedding this Saturday,

383
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:51,864
and you're my date.

384
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:55,012
Actually, I'm seeing
someone else now.

385
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:57,247
What? No, you're not. Yes, I am.

386
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:59,350
Do you really care?

387
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:02,953
You haven't called me in, like,
two months. I said I was busy.

388
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:05,756
Look, I get it. I know I came
across a little stalker- y,

389
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,424
and you got freaked out,

390
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:10,094
but you were my first boyfriend.
I was excited.

391
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,535
You used to sleep on my stoop.

392
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:12,748
Okay, that... that was one time,

393
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,147
and that was because
you kept saying,

394
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:15,106
"one minute, I'll be right down,"

395
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,408
and you never... you didn't show.

396
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,077
So I'm patient.
There are worse traits.

397
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:25,505
Anyway, now I'm with Brian,
so... it all worked out.

398
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,875
I'm sure you'll find someone, too.

399
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,538
Whoa. My ears are still
ringing from that place.

400
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:38,540
I couldn't even hear myself think.

401
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:41,476
Yeah, well, hey, we got a
great plan "b" though, right?

402
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,479
Pizza, beer, great company.

403
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:47,749
Yeahhow about we find
something to watch? Good idea.

404
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:50,552
Hey, Justin, you wanna
help me pick out a movie?

405
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,114
Betty's got a lot of
great musicals here.

406
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,483
Come on, Justin.
Stop texting and join the party.

407
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,918
Hey, one sec.
Um... I have to take this,

408
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,821
but I think I'm just
gonna go over to Marc's.

409
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:02,124
So I don't bother you guys.

410
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,165
Hey. Hey.

411
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,501
I'm here. I'm all yours. Oh.

412
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,969
Yay! No more work.

413
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,706
Oh. Oh.

414
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,108
Well, I might have to do a
little bit of work tomorrow. Mm!

415
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,097
But who am I to complain?
Work is work, right?

416
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,534
What are you guys doing?

417
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,078
We decided that every time
you say "work,"we drink.

418
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,572
Okay. I get it!

419
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:37,209
Tonight is about fun, not work.

420
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,144
Aah! Ohh!

421
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,479
Ohh! Drink!

422
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,914
I said it again!

423
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,083
Dare!

424
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,585
Whoo! Whoo!

425
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,020
Ooh, a brave choice.
All right, all right, all right.

426
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,856
Oh, God.

427
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,225
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
I want you to...

428
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,026
Flash that guy!

429
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,095
No! Yes!

430
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,464
No!

431
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,067
Betty, just do it. Go show him
your mayan temple. Go. Oh!

432
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,470
No, I can't do that.
Yes, you can. Watch.

433
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,240
Whoo!

434
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,545
U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!

435
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,013
Whoo!

436
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,515
See?

437
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,217
No. Okay, I am the queen.
I declare it.

438
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,788
I want you to flash
that stranger! Do it.

439
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,156
No! Go, go, go! Just go.

440
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,824
Hey! Oh, come on, Betty.

441
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,293
Okay, fine! I'll do it. Whoo!

442
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,707
Whoo!

443
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,743
Oh!

444
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,679
Suarez!

445
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,823
Everyone said,

446
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,492
"when you go to london,
don't miss Betty's boobs."

447
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,527
I'm just glad there wasn't a line.

448
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,864
This is... hilarious! Hi, gio.

449
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,121
But I didn't get the shot, so...

450
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,034
Hi, gio. Let's just get
cheech and Chong back out.

451
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,004
Yeah, uh, Amanda! Oh, no, no, no.
Girls, girls, stop it.

452
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,973
Turn around and let
everyone have a look!

453
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,508
Christina! Enough. Stop. Enough.

454
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,443
Oh.

455
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,846
Ow.

456
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,682
I don't generally do
these this often...

457
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,852
Or ever. Right. But when in Rome...
Oh, wait a minute.

458
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,287
You didn't go to Rome
with me, did you?

459
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,324
You chose what's- his- name...
Egg salad.

460
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,259
Henry... and to be fair,

461
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,595
I really didn't choose
either one of you.

462
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,563
What are you doing here?

463
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,034
Layover. On my way to provence.
A food and wine trip. And you?

464
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,903
"Mode" sent me for work. Work!

465
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,905
Hey, listen, I'd love to catch up,

466
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,823
but I want to see the
london eye before it closes,

467
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:52,525
and I'm only here for one re night.

468
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,427
You want to check it out with me?

469
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:57,474
No, I can't. Um,
it's hilda's bachelorette party,

470
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:00,077
and I can't just go, so...

471
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,946
Can you just give us... like,
two seconds?

472
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:05,215
Two sec... don't... don't go. Okay.

473
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,619
What are you doing? Go with him!

474
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,488
What? Why? Betty,
you are on vacation!

475
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,891
You have been all about
work since you got here.

476
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,993
You've got a really nice guy here.

477
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,928
Who has always been
crazy about you.

478
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,496
Go have an adventure!

479
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,499
He does look sort of good,
doesn't he?

480
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:25,869
Yeah, and you might have a
plus- one for my wedding!

481
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,838
Go! Have fun!

482
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,156
Okay.

483
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,658
Good news.

484
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:34,928
Queen hilda has granted
me permission to go.

485
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,835
Wow. It's like a club in here.

486
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,004
Yeah, actually it used
to have a stripper pole,

487
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,479
but I guess it was too
hard to wear a seat belt.

488
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,181
And work the pole at the same time.

489
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:54,588
Look, , I just want you to know,

490
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,990
I'm sorry about the way
I've been treating you.

491
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,327
It's just, uh, kinda
freaky to suddenly find out.

492
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,262
You have a half brother.

493
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,599
Tell me about it.
And then... my mom, your dad...

494
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:07,979
That's an image I don't want
stuck in my head. Wait. My dad?

495
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,380
Yeah, you know,
I never got along with hartley,

496
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:12,609
but I shouldn't have taken that out on you.
So you know my dad?

497
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,043
Know him?

498
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,189
He was the biggest pain in my ass for,
like, six months.

499
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,591
When he was trying
to take over Meade.

500
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:20,660
Mom told you all that, I'm sure.
I think we're here.

501
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:23,563
You know what? Just hang
on a second, all right?

502
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:25,531
I'm gonna go grease the bouncer,

503
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:28,401
make sure we get v.I.P. Treatment.

504
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:30,930
Be right back.

505
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,340
Tyler, everything all right?

506
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:50,677
I think Claire might've lied
to me about who my father is.

507
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,312
Really?

508
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:55,214
I mean, she's been so nice
to me since I got here.

509
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,817
Why would she do that? Oh,
I don't know.

510
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:01,387
But a lie of that magnitude?
If you could never forgive her,

511
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:03,723
it would be completely
understandable.

512
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:05,325
I'm out with Daniel
right now, and...

513
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,627
This news...

514
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:10,396
All I can think about
is taking a drink.

515
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,298
Slipups are inevitable.

516
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,267
And it's okay.

517
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:18,638
I certainly know how tempting
a perfectly mixed cocktail.

518
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,640
Can be. I can...

519
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:22,575
Almost taste it right now.

520
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,110
Mmm.

521
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:26,179
It's like.

522
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:29,616
A warm hug going down my throat.

523
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,584
What should I do, Wilhelmina?

524
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,054
Oh, remember,
if you happen to slip up,

525
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,657
I am always here for you,

526
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:41,961
because that's what
a sponsor's for.

527
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:59,712
Oh, I really love it here.

528
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,315
At this one fashion show,
they served a sandch.

529
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:05,785
That was bread,
butter and french fries.

530
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:07,420
That's disgusting.

531
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:09,722
It was amazing... carbs,
fat and carbs.

532
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,858
It was a miracle. The miracle is,

533
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:14,694
you still eat like that and
look as good as you do.

534
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:16,896
Oh, thank you. You, too.

535
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:22,869
Mmm, it's so nice to
actually see london.

536
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:24,971
I've been stuck indoors
at fashion shows.

537
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,240
Ever since I got here.

538
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:31,144
Yawn. No, not yawn.
I really enjoyed it.

539
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,680
Double yawn. I'm serious!

540
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:36,249
I saw two lines that were
completely innovative,

541
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:39,752
and most of the rest of them
were surprisingly on trend.

542
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:42,321
Ooh- ooh! Look at you.

543
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:44,724
You are a "mode"- y robot.
You're a mo- bot.

544
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,993
I am not a mo- bot.

545
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:50,096
I am Betty. I am a mo- bot.

546
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,499
I care about fashion.
I am... on trend.

547
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:55,468
Okay, I know what this is.

548
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:57,770
This is you doing your little
button- pushy flirty thing.

549
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:00,273
Just to get to me. No, no, I'm not.

550
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:02,809
Yes, you are. You are flirting.
I'm not flirting.

551
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:05,611
I am gio. I am flirting.

552
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,213
I'm not flirting.

553
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,649
It is okay. I am flirting, too.

554
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:12,552
Betty, I'm engaged. I am...

555
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:13,986
What?

556
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:26,089
Is it just me, or is it weird.

557
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:27,885
That you didn't ntion you
were engaged right away?

558
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,786
Why? You disappointed?

559
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,321
Hurts a little you can't have me,
doesn't it, suarez?

560
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,257
No! It doesn't hurt.

561
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,192
I'm just saying

562
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:40,530
I would think it was weird.

563
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,965
That you pked up your
ex- girlfriend at a bar.

564
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,234
And took her on a
romantic stroll. What?

565
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:48,688
I did not pick you up.
You flashed me. It was a dare,

566
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:51,224
and I was supposed to be
flashing a complete stranger.

567
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,627
Why are yostill working
at "mode"? What?

568
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:55,562
What... what does that
have to do with anything?

569
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:58,131
I thought you wanted to write
about things that mattered,

570
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,136
like that crap you
put in your blog.

571
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:01,835
What do you know about my blog?

572
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:03,217
What, you read my blog?

573
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,905
Don't get all excited,
but, yeah, I've read it.

574
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,008
At luast I did until
you stopped posting.

575
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,943
I know. I'm busy.

576
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:12,445
I'm an editor now.

577
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
And I'm interviewing.

578
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,850
To write a fashion column
for another magazine.

579
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:19,753
Wow. That's a job you
never dreamed of.

580
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:23,523
Fashion has been good to me, okay?

581
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:25,625
And since I've been
doing it for a while,

582
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,093
people actually respect me...

583
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,629
As hard as that might
be for you to believe.

584
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,165
And, okay, you know what?
The perks are nice.

585
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,501
So you've gotten comfortable?
I'm not comfortable.

586
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:36,670
Oh, you're comfortable.
Stop. Gio, don't.

587
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,938
Don't do that thing
that you always do,

588
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,149
the "I'm gio, I'm always right!"

589
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,841
Look, I'm just saying,
hey, I'm just saying...

590
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,544
"I'm... know everything." I'm just saying,
what was supposed to be.

591
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:47,113
A stepping stone for you has
completely become your path.

592
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:49,649
It's not my path!

593
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:51,885
It's... everything that I'm doing.

594
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,853
I- is just so that one day,

595
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:56,923
I can create the
magazine that I want.

596
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:58,925
You sure about that?

597
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,461
Because from where I'm
standin it seems like.

598
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:04,564
You're scared to focus on
what you really care about.

599
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:06,666
And you're getting
more and more involved.

600
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:09,536
In something that doesn't
even matter to you.

601
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,137
You know what, gio?

602
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:13,582
I haven't even seen you in,
like, years,

603
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,823
and you show up.

604
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:17,758
And you think that in one
hour you know my entire life?

605
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:20,128
Well, guess what? You don't.

606
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:28,002
I have to go back to my sister.

607
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,943
I think you'll like this place.

608
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:38,679
It's even better than the last one.

609
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:40,481
Thanks.

610
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:45,186
Hey, take it easy.
That's 50- year- old single malt.

611
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,489
What, so I don't
deserve the good stuff?

612
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:50,625
Look...

613
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,593
I realize you haven't had it easy,

614
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:55,196
and I want you to know
that there is no way.

615
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,365
We're gonna send you
home empty- handed, okay?

616
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,267
What?

617
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:01,102
This is for you.

618
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,638
You gotta be kidding me.

619
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,941
No, no. I'm happy to do it, Tyler.

620
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:09,376
U- you're actually trying
to buy me off, huh?

621
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:10,947
No, I'm trying to help.
Hey, what are you doing?

622
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:12,580
All right. Guys, come on.
All right. Guys, come on.

623
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:13,761
Let's take it up the street,
all right?

624
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,010
No, no. We're fine, we're fine.

625
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:17,011
Listen... are you really
that afraid of me, huh?

626
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,580
What? Think I'm gonna make problems
for you, ittle rich boy, huh?

627
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,849
Tyler, take it easy.
You're missing... what are you...

628
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,351
Hey, hey!

629
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:24,986
Wait, wait! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no! Tyler, listen...

630
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,993
Christina, you know
what's really weird?

631
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,261
You're, like, a big,
fancy designer in london,

632
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:37,665
and I'm a big shot stylist in New York.
You're a stylist now?

633
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,334
Well, not in the sense
that I have any clients,

634
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:43,270
but I do get to combine all
of my favorite interests...

635
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:46,040
Criticizing people, shopping
and promoting world thinness.

636
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:48,809
Believe it or not,

637
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:50,611
she really is talented.

638
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:53,314
It's true. I am.

639
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:55,916
Christina, this might be
the beer and the jager.

640
00:29:55,951 --> 00:30:00,354
And the Tequila talking,
but I'm really proud of you.

641
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:03,057
Aw! No, you're a big success!

642
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,760
Thank you. But, you know,

643
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:08,195
I was really terrified
when I left "mode."

644
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,399
All of a sudden,
I didn't have a safety net.

645
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,701
But do you know what it did?

646
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:16,671
It forced me to take a chance
on what I really wanted to do.

647
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,572
Hey, you're back! Oh, hey!

648
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,207
How was your time with gio?

649
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:23,511
It was a lot... of work.

650
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,079
Work!

651
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:33,421
Oh, dear.

652
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,723
Here, eat this.

653
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:37,324
I can't.

654
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,293
I drank so much last night.

655
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:42,129
I don't remember anything
after getting back to the pub.

656
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,864
No, neither do I.

657
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:45,766
I vaguely remember
calling Billy macduff

658
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:48,002
00 in the morning and telling him.

659
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:50,571
That our first kiss
tasted of Sauerkraut. Ugh!

660
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:53,374
Do you not remember?
Seeing gio made us have this idea.

661
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:56,343
To start calling up
all our exes? Ugh!

662
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:57,978
Doesn't ring a bell.

663
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:00,781
I have to meet Mr. dunne now.

664
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,283
Ooh.

665
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:05,653
Are you sure you don't want
to stay just one extra day?

666
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,555
Sorry. Miss my boys.

667
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:11,459
Oh.

668
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,127
Oh.

669
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:16,063
Oh, come on now. We're not gonna
get into a big thing here.

670
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,699
We're far too good of
friends to say good- bye.

671
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,134
Mm.

672
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,269
Now you go and kick ass.

673
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:25,272
I will.

674
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:30,377
Whew.

675
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:43,457
Hey, just the guy
I was looking for.

676
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:46,060
I got a surprise for you.
You ready? Three words...

677
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:51,832
I scored two tickets
for you and me to see.

678
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,068
Miss bootylicious
herself tomorrow night.

679
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:56,003
What do you think?

680
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,472
Wow. Thas. I- I just
can't go with you.

681
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:00,407
What are you talking about?

682
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:02,910
These tickets are unbelievable.
I'm talking fifth row!

683
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:05,379
Yeah, it's just Austin and
I already got tickets.

684
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:07,782
Um... and we're actually
doing homework right now,

685
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,950
so I- I can't really talk.

686
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,887
Hey, uh, what if I got
one more ticket, huh?

687
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,156
We could all go together.

688
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,091
Look,

689
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,827
I changed my plans last
night for your baclor party,

690
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:22,897
and I- I don't want
to change them again.

691
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:26,133
What's going on here? I mean,
I thought we were cool.

692
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:29,036
Are you, uh, going through some
teenage rebellion thing or...

693
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,032
You mad that I'm
marrying your mother?

694
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,840
It's not about you, all right? It...

695
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:37,845
I just... I- I can't go.

696
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:45,820
Honestly, I was surprised
that she chose denim,

697
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:48,088
seeing as it's an
iconically American fabric.

698
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:50,524
But the way she cut it
was completely european.

699
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,394
Well, Ms. suarez,
your materials are impressive.

700
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,329
Christina speaks highly of you,

701
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:58,098
and you're obviously
passionate about fashion.

702
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,034
Yes, I do.

703
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:01,669
I mean, yes, I am.

704
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:03,304
Good.

705
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:05,906
This is the part of
the jo that I love...

706
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,175
Making someone's dream come true.

707
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,244
You are going to
have front- row seats.

708
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:11,712
To every show in New York.

709
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:14,181
And access to anyone
you want to talk to.

710
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:17,718
Go- getter like you should move
up through the ranks in no time.

711
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,620
So how does it feel.

712
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:26,961
Ms. suarez?

713
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,896
Um, I'm sorry.

714
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,831
Uh...

715
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,568
N... uh, I can't do this.

716
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:36,337
I'm... I'm sry?

717
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:37,972
Fashion is not my dream.

718
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:41,742
Well, it's an odd time
to be mentioning it.

719
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,711
Yes, I know.

720
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:46,280
But the last 24 hours
have been crazy.

721
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:49,450
I flashed my ex in a bar,

722
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:51,852
and then he called me a "mo- bot."

723
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:53,821
And I thought he was wrong,

724
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:55,723
but now...

725
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,658
I think he's right.

726
00:33:57,692 --> 00:33:59,393
I'm following.

727
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:02,730
No, you're not. Uh...

728
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:04,198
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:07,801
I really appreciate
this opportunity,

730
00:34:07,836 --> 00:34:10,337
but if you read my blog,

731
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:14,541
you will see what I really
want to be writing about.

732
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:16,510
And it isn't fashion.

733
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:24,451
Thank you so much foyour time.

734
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:35,362
Yeah, I just don't-
I don't get it.

735
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:37,364
You know, he used to like me.

736
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,334
Why am I so bad to hang
around all of a sudden?

737
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,937
There's no explaining
teenagers, brother.

738
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:46,440
Well, I- I even offered to
take his buddy, too, you know?

739
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:49,810
I don't know why he
doesn't want me there.

740
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:52,913
You're trying too hard, Bobby.

741
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,516
Justin will come back to you.

742
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,117
When he's ready.

743
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,054
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

744
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:05,059
Hey, I'm gonna go talk to him.

745
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,601
Uh...

746
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:32,104
Hey, uh, you know,
I was thinking about the concert.

747
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,540
You know, I- I mean-
you... you guys can go.

748
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:37,130
Just please don't tell anyone.

749
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:39,165
No, of course not. Not even my mom.

750
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,201
All... all right. Yeah, I won't.

751
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,970
But, uh, yeah,
I think she'd be cool with it.

752
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,672
I just don't want her to kw.

753
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:48,474
All right. It's just between us.

754
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:50,343
Okay.

755
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:56,382
Thanks for meeting me.

756
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:58,184
Lucky for you,

757
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,254
I try to get to the airport
at the last possible minute.

758
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:02,722
Ugh, I hate that.

759
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,657
I like to be there two
hours ahead of time.

760
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,159
To reorganize my carry- on.

761
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:10,296
There she is.
There's the suarez I know.

762
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,899
Look, I'm sorryabout last nigh.

763
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:17,770
I think that I got a
little overdefensive.

764
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:20,039
Because you made a good point.

765
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,141
I know I did.

766
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,143
I didn't have to say that. - No.

767
00:36:24,178 --> 00:36:27,714
That was annoying,
sn't it? - Yes. Anyway...

768
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:29,716
I did what you said.

769
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,652
I turned down that job.

770
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:36,189
I know it was the right thing to do,
but it's still scary.

771
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:39,192
I mean, what if my blog
doesn't take off? What then?

772
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:41,794
I mean, maybe I was
on the wrong path,

773
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:43,897
but at least it was a path.

774
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:46,366
You know, when you
broke up with me,

775
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,167
I thought it was me...

776
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:50,670
That I had to change myself...

777
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,238
And I went wild.

778
00:36:52,273 --> 00:36:53,973
I tried wraps, open- face,

779
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:55,875
all kinds of crazy stuff.

780
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,811
But then I finally went back
to what was important to me,

781
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,414
and that was making sandwics...

782
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,016
Bread, meat, bread.

783
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,984
And then I met this girl...

784
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:08,922
A Baker who makes the most
amazing rustic sourdough.

785
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:12,091
Our business took off,
we fell madly in love,

786
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,894
all because we pursued our passion.

787
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,498
Well...

788
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:20,600
You seem happy.

789
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,735
I am.

790
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,271
But you were right, too.

791
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:27,740
I was flirting with you a little.
Oh, really?

792
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,476
Now I didn't mean
anything by it. Mm- Hmm.

793
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:32,078
I didn't!

794
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:34,480
It's just our thing.

795
00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:36,115
And besides,

796
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,885
I know there's only ever
been one guy for you.

797
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,854
Ugh! Okay, gio. Can we not
go down that path again?

798
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,990
We were having a nice moment.

799
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:47,126
You'll always hold special
place in my heart, b.

800
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:53,366
I can't believe.

801
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,635
You and Tyler got
arrested for fighting.

802
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:56,898
Are you sure you don't
know where he went?

803
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,538
Look, someone bailed him out
right before you got there.

804
00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:00,606
I didn't see who it was.
How did this happen?

805
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,976
He just went crazy.

806
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,311
You should've warned me
he was such an ugly drunk.

807
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,246
You let him drink?
He's an alcoholic!

808
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:10,149
He's in a.A.! Well,
how was I supposed to know that?

809
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:14,654
Did he say anything?
What did you talk about?

810
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,589
I don't know. Um...

811
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,524
His mother,

812
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,927
his hometown, hartley...

813
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:23,003
What? I told him about his father...

814
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,904
How hartley tried to
take over the company,

815
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,207
how we forced him out. - Oh, God.

816
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:28,975
What is it?

817
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:32,412
I swore to cal.

818
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:35,181
That I would never tell
Tyler who his father was.

819
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:37,150
So I made up a story.

820
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,686
I told Tyler I met
his fath in rehab.

821
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,323
Now he knows I lied.

822
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:46,092
Ohh.

823
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:47,193
Mom.

824
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:47,640
What?

825
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:51,343
I'm sorry, okay?
It's gonna be all right.

826
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:53,679
I promise, we'll find him.

827
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:06,884
Oh, feeling any better?

828
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:09,453
Yeah.

829
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:11,856
Thanks for bailing
me out last night.

830
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,759
Well, I told you I
would forgive you.

831
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,260
You slipped up.

832
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:18,963
I mean, it... it happens
to the best of us.

833
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:20,431
Yeah.

834
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,833
You were right.

835
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:24,935
They tried to buy me off.

836
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:28,606
They're terrified...

837
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,509
That I'm gonna try to
take what they've got.

838
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,477
Oh, I'm so sorry.

839
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:36,213
My heart is breaking for you.

840
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,182
What are you gonna do?

841
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:43,654
What is owed to me...

842
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:46,257
My share in Meade publications.

843
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:50,161
And I will support
you any way I can.

844
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,634
Marc, I'm back!

845
00:39:58,136 --> 00:40:00,638
What happened to you?

846
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:02,707
Everything... Troy broke up with me,

847
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:04,642
I e two slices of pizza,

848
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:07,344
and now I can't stop
thinking about him.

849
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,214
Oh, my God. You ate pizza?
I can't talk about it!

850
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:13,117
Good. 'Cause I have some
really big news of my own.

851
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,086
I think it's time for me.

852
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,021
To make this stylist
thing happen for real.

853
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:19,156
I'm quitting "mode."

854
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,394
Oh! Good, you're here.

855
00:40:23,428 --> 00:40:26,063
I was just dropping off
my reviews of the shows.

856
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:28,332
Thank you so much for
sending us to london.

857
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:32,570
We had the best time.
You can read all about it on my blog.

858
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,939
I just posted all the gory details.

859
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,474
Gory, huh?

860
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:38,943
Yeah, I sort of dropped the
ball on blogging for a while,

861
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:41,979
so I thought I would relaunch
with something juicy.

862
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:45,116
How did, uh, things turn
out with you and Tyler?

863
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,084
Um, kind of blew up in my face,

864
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,020
but at least I'm talking
to my mom again.

865
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:52,923
Whoa! You flashed gio in a bar?

866
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:56,060
Yep. But in my defense,
I had been drinking.

867
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:58,295
And at least now I know.

868
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,699
That all of my ex-boyfriend
craziness is behind me.

869
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:05,870
Hey, it's Betty!

870
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,571
Remember me?

871
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:11,259
Anyway, I'm in london,
and I'm thinking about you.

872
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,227
Sorry.

873
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,796
That was a hiccup, not a burp.

874
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,765
Anyway, hilda's getting married,

875
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,767
and I was just wondering.

876
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:22,703
If maybe you'd want to come
to the wedding as my date.

877
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:24,205
Call me.

878
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:34,206
