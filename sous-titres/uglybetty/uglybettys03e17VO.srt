Ugly Betty Season 3 Episode 17

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:15,426
Made by Nazel

3
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:16,905
Here you go

4
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:20,224
Hey guys, good morning!

5
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,298
Wow Betty, who died?

6
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:30,125
I didn't wanna look too cheerful

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,563
Everyone's so depressed at work

8
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,112
This is a financial crisis

9
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,121
And Daniel's girlfriend is sick ..

10
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:36,058
Did I overdo it?

11
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,660
No, No! All black is ..

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,052
Aunt Betty, you look.. Almost fashionable

13
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:46,448
Justin, are you crying?

14
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,369
No, I'm just proud

15
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,020
You do listen ..

16
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:53,541
You know I still don't understand how that guy Connor

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,147
Could steal all that money from the company

18
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,023
And nobody even noticed?

19
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,053
That's terrible

20
00:00:58,053 --> 00:00:59,166
I know papi, and the worst part is

21
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,350
I think he's gonna get away with it

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,866
He's totally disappeared

23
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,356
Why, why does he do that?

24
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,773
I don't know, I guess some people are just greedy

25
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:08,542
You don't wash mushrooms, you wipe them!

26
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:09,868
He's not talking to you

27
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,233
He's talking to that stupid TV chef on Kitchen Rumble

28
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,044
This Frankie Barata guy really makes me mad

29
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:16,685
Then why do you keep watching him?

30
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,629
Because, I keep thinking somebody's gonna beat this guy

31
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,325
I mean, I mean ..

32
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,716
If the judges like your dish better

33
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,903
You could walk away with thousands of dollars

34
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:29,703
But if they like mine ..

35
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:31,558
All you're gonna get are my leftovers

36
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,188
Hey spit on your leftovers

37
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:36,326
Eww

38
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,810
I keep calling him and telling him I should be on that show

39
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,097
I can cook better than him

40
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,898
Papi, you can cook better than everyone

41
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:43,686
Oh by the way, I'm not gonna make it to dinner tonight

42
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,236
I have plans with my new friend Matt

43
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:47,076
Mmmmmmm

44
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,256
We've been hearing a lot about this new friend Matt

45
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:53,597
Say, you're blushing

46
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,783
Stop! What, it's just a couple of dates and ..

47
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,486
I don't know, I think there's something there

48
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,200
Ok I gotta go, bye!

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,268
- Love you ..
- Bye

50
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,096
Do I look serious enough for a company in ruin?

51
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,102
Yes! Don’t touch your outfit you look perfect

52
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,565
So close and yet so far

53
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,660
Daniel Meade's office

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,176
Did you get the gift I sent?

55
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,226
This is Matt by the way just in case you're wondering

56
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:27,267
Hi Matt, I know who it is

57
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:30,053
Umm, no I don't see a gift,

58
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:32,616
Oh even better, then I'll be on the phone when you get it

59
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,879
I love the looks on a person's face when they get a present

60
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,484
You can't see my face through the phone silly

61
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,413
I'll imagine it

62
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,095
Oh, hold on one second

63
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,574
Good morning Daniel,

64
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,222
how are you, can I get you something?

65
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,571
Coffee, cream, a couple of billion dollars

66
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,570
Or a company that doesn't go bankrupt

67
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,863
Just joking, sort of

68
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,064
Have you spoken to Molly?

69
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,532
She needs time alone, to figure out her treatment

70
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,589
Whether she wants to go through all that again

71
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:07,151
And you don't wanna be there with her?

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,474
She made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone

73
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,610
So I have to respect her wishes

74
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:19,313
Oh .. thank you .. Ohh

75
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:20,719
Someone has an admirer?

76
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,431
Let me just put this away

77
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,735
Sorry

78
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,519
Don't apologize

79
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,419
You should take happiness when you can find it

80
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,545
- You deserve it
- Thank you

81
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:43,673
I just got your jellybeans

82
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,541
Yay! So what does your face look like?

83
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:51,266
My face is .. Smiling

84
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,295
Was that a smile on your face?

85
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:55,722
No Willi, it was a sneer I promise

86
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:56,802
Good

87
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:58,338
What are you ..

88
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,287
Are those gladiator sandals?

89
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,475
Are we in ancient Rome?

90
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,405
Will you be wrestling a lion?

91
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:06,975
Take those off

92
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,661
- Burn these ..
- You are fired

93
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,085
Willi, as much as I love watching fired employees

94
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,425
Scamper off sad and barefoot

95
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,645
Are you okay?

96
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,790
What mood do you think I should be in Marc?

97
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,457
The company's on the brink of collapse

98
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,822
Connor ran off with all the money

99
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,397
Yeah Hey Willi, he did break your heart a little bit, right?

100
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,901
Don't be ridiculous, Connor Owens is a thief

101
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:42,821
Nothing more than that to me

102
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:46,108
Just another disappointing useless male

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,088
Has it occurred to you that my mood of late

104
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,762
Might have something to do with a newborn baby

105
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,259
Who never seems to stop crying?

106
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,657
Speaking of darling baby William

107
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,834
The nanny called, she can't come this week

108
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:02,646
Apparently, her own child has come down with chickenpox

109
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,546
Her own child? Who does this woman think she is?

110
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,248
Get Christina to babysit

111
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:10,539
And here's a list of things I need you to pick up for the baby at Estella

112
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,673
Agh .. I did not sign up for this baby business

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,721
Cashmere diapers, is she kidding?

114
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,487
Aw .. I love shopping at baby stores

115
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:23,114
You do?

116
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,901
I like to sit in a tiny furniture and pretend I'm a scary giant

117
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,824
The children cry, it is so much fun

118
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:30,649
Hey do you wanna go with me tomorrow?

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,624
Yeah, wait .. Mode magazine, this is Amanda

120
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,061
How may I direct your call?

121
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,483
You! How many times have I told you not to call here?

122
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:42,140
Leave me alone you psycho!

123
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,888
What was that?

124
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,712
It was my mother, she's been reading about the company in the news

125
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,823
And she's concerned about my job

126
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,636
Mandy, it's been a year

127
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:53,590
Would it be so horrible if you reconnected with your parents?

128
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,467
They lied to me my entire life about being adopted

129
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:58,687
Now you know me I'm not the one to hold a grudge

130
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:01,265
But I will never speak to my parents as long as I may live

131
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,890
- What?
- Nothing, it's just really pretty when you're dramatic

132
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:12,518
The bad news is our insurance doesn't cover us for a loss of this magnitude

133
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,664
Oh ..

134
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,770
So what's the good news?

135
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:16,936
There is no good news

136
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,249
Oh good god!

137
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,623
Do you even know how the good news/bad news setup works

138
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:23,342
If you're looking for good news, why don't you ask your boyfriend Connor

139
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,833
Well you stole his fiancee no wonder he wanted to steal from us

140
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,660
You were dating him, how could you not know what he was doing?

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,831
Oh so it's my fault now?

142
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,377
Stop! Bickering isn't going to solve anything

143
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,959
Yes, stop bickering Daniel

144
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:41,252
Thousands of people are going to lose their jobs if we don't fix this

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,068
Well easier said than done Claire, what's your bright idea

146
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,151
How about a federal bailout?

147
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:51,913
Oh of course, Daniel and I will just march down to Washington

148
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:54,212
And beg the government to save our magazine

149
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,361
You don't have to march anywhere

150
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:58,133
They're already here

151
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:05,233
Federal government sends panel to New York City to consider print media bailout

152
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,657
Mum, this is genius

153
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:11,080
You may wanna rethink your wardrobe Wilhelmina

154
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,126
We're gonna have a little trouble convincing them we need money wearing mink

155
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,872
It's not mink darling, it's chinchilla

156
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:19,890
Whatever it is, you look like a rich bitch

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,562
Matt, you didn't have to come all the way to Queens just to see me home

158
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,130
Well considering how I left my wallet at work and made you pay for dinner

159
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,880
I could use your brownie points

160
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:38,005
Oh sorry, don't mind me

161
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,960
So you must be Betty's new friend Matt

162
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:43,229
I'm her sister

163
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,316
Betty you didn't tell me you have a sister

164
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:46,513
- What?
- Yes I did

165
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,189
I'm kidding, she talks about you all the time

166
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,980
I have a terrible sense of humor

167
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,142
It grows on you, or it doesn't

168
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,803
- It's nice to meet you Hilda
- You too

169
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,560
Thanks again for dinner

170
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,647
Wait a minute, why was he thanking you for dinner?

171
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:07,930
He didn't pay?

172
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,301
Well sometimes he forgets his wallet

173
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,219
Sometimes? As in more than once?

174
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,199
Oh no no no, Betty, I do not like this man

175
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:22,051
He's just absent-minded, but he's so sweet

176
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,329
He sent me jellybeans at work today

177
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,473
Jellybeans? What kind of a cheap present is that?

178
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,287
Hilda! Stop

179
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:33,318
Okay maybe he's not perfect but..

180
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,287
The more time I spend with him, the more I like him and ..

181
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:42,554
I don't know, just all this craziness at work is really giving me perspective

182
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:46,726
I have a wonderful job and a great family and ..

183
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:52,540
A guy that I like, can't I just enjoy this moment, please?

184
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,486
Mum, Mum! I found this with the mail

185
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:57,403
Honey, what is it?

186
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,300
It's from the landlord

187
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:03,047
This document shall serve a termination of your rental agreement

188
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:07,998
Please be advised you have until the end of the month to vacate the premises

189
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:12,998
Oh my god! We're being evicted

190
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,038
I hate doing this to you Ignacio

191
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:35,101
Then don't, we've been living in this house for 25 years

192
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,204
Mr. Di Lena, this is our home

193
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,914
I mean there's gotta be something we can work out right?

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,220
The truth is I'm having some money problems

195
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,973
I'm gonna have to sell to my idiot nephew

196
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,806
Sao, couldn't we rent from him?

197
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,785
He's turning it into a recording studio cause that's a good investment

198
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,385
A recording studio? But I have my business here too

199
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,194
My salon, what am I supposed to do?

200
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,848
I wish I could help, but unless you can match my nephew's offer

201
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,152
buy the house yourselves

202
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:04,730
Yes! Yes, we'll buy the house

203
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,776
We should've taken the limo

204
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,123
Right and have our picture taking getting out

205
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,003
That will help us get the bailout money

206
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:26,770
But a bus, really Daniel?

207
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,113
Oh god, this is the lowest moment of my life

208
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:32,079
Straight tote across town, come on it's gonna be fun

209
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:37,016
- One please
- Metro cards or quarters only

210
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,488
Do you think I carry quarters?

211
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,602
I don't know whether to laugh or cry

212
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,915
Can you break a 50?

213
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:50,775
Thank you!

214
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,664
Ok, the loan officer said that we do qualify for an FHA loan

215
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:55,723
So what does that mean?

216
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,615
It means we only have to put down 5% before the end of the month

217
00:10:58,615 --> 00:10:59,928
15 thousand dollars

218
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,665
Betty, I don't have that much money saved up

219
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,304
Yeah but if we combine all of our savings

220
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,900
This is my responsibility, I'm not taking money from my children

221
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,454
Dad stop, stop being so stubborn

222
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:12,450
This is our house and we wanna stay

223
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,030
Why don't we just ask Daniel for the money?

224
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,815
Justin! Daniel has his own money problems

225
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:19,844
And I would never ever ask him for something like that

226
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,419
Oh! But Marc and Amanda still owe me the security deposit on my apartment

227
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:24,506
That's a start

228
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,399
I could offer more sodas at my salon

229
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,177
Smear some yoghurt on an old lady's mug and call it a facial

230
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:33,694
Yeah! See? Come on papi it's our house, our memories

231
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,997
We should at least try, right?

232
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:39,805
Come on!

233
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:42,796
Alright

234
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:54,068
Excuse me sir, you're in my personal space

235
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:58,312
So if you're fond of your thumbs I suggest you take one large step backwards

236
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,802
Thank you very much

237
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,065
I thought you were gonna dress down so it looks like we need money

238
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,763
This is what I wear to the gym

239
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,454
For god's sake, hold on to the pole

240
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:11,157
No way, I don't know who touched that thing

241
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:12,533
You're such a baby

242
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,992
We better get that bailout

243
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:20,889
Agh why would anyone want to have a baby

244
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,547
They're so expensive

245
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:23,672
I know right?

246
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:27,257
I need food, I need diapers, think of yourself first

247
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:28,531
Hey thanks for coming with me today

248
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:32,939
If I never see another baby as long as I live it'll be too soon

249
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,820
You guys shop at Estella, best baby store ever

250
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,475
Oh I know, it's like my favorite place in all of New York City

251
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:56,337
And Chelo here just loves her little organic cut and onesies

252
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:59,258
Wait, Chelo? What kind of baby name is that?

253
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:01,742
So creative, really special

254
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,906
I'm Timothy by the way

255
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,943
Marc, and we're not together, she's just my hag

256
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,479
So I'm guessing you have a baby?

257
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,010
No he doesn't

258
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,206
No, not on me, my little angel's at home

259
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,876
Oh with your partner?

260
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:23,925
No, nope, single .. Single and ready to mingle

261
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:27,133
Me too yeah, single parent

262
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,374
You know what, we should get together for a play date sometime

263
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:34,375
Definitely, I'll call you

264
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,834
Play date

265
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,203
That was rude, he didn't even introduce himself to me

266
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,828
Cute and rude! I'm in love

267
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:50,100
Oh just the people I was looking for

268
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,524
I need to talk to you about money situation

269
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,173
Gorgeous! That will be 200 dollars

270
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,198
What?

271
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:01,581
Hey, if you have a Kirsten Dunst and this is Madison Avenue, this is what you pay

272
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,843
Not the same Madison Avenue

273
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,504
Yes, yes, this is Ignacio Suarez

274
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,772
And I'm trying to find someone who can help me

275
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,506
No, I will not hold,

276
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,839
So my family is trying to buy our house

277
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,886
And since you guys are subletting my apartment

278
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:19,166
I thought it was only fair that you pay the security deposit

279
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:23,877
75 dollars, 50 dollars

280
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:25,819
Come one we're trying to buy our house

281
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:40,226
Money makes the world go round, the world go round, the world go round

282
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,813
Money makes the world go round, of this I can be sure

283
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,442
On being poor

284
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,459
Anyway, my family really needs this money

285
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,632
Oh that is just so you Betty

286
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,345
All fluky and sweet

287
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,241
So you can give me the security deposit money?

288
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,268
Not a chance in hell

289
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:01,768
Ta

290
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,971
We stand before you today

291
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,125
Humbled by an economic crisis

292
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,186
That threatens the entire publishing industry

293
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,238
Meade Publications is an American company

294
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,423
Founded by an American family

295
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,744
And today we're asking for your help

296
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:24,853
We understand your plight Mr. Meade

297
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:29,741
But your flagship publication is a fashion magazine

298
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:32,414
Why should the government care about something so frivolous?

299
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,969
Frivolous? Oh my dear congressman

300
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,999
Fashion is art, it enriches people's lives

301
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,411
Not to mention it is a vital part of our New York economy

302
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,851
The industry imploys thousands of people

303
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:48,116
Photographers, construction workers, engineers, vendors

304
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:51,496
Many of whom we rode the bus with just this morning

305
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,469
Yeah you've mentioned that several times

306
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:04,121
Well I must concede, your proposal raises some interesting points

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,309
We will reconvene on Thursday and talk numbers

308
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you Mr. Chairman

309
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,732
So if you add up all of our savings

310
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:25,893
We're still 9644 dollars short, how?

311
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,699
What about the security deposit from Marc and Amanda?

312
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:29,829
Ugh, no luck

313
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,048
You big day at the salon?

314
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,531
Am I the only one who made money today?

315
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,422
My one man show on the street totally killed

316
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,751
Justin, you skipped school and pan handled?

317
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,725
I made like 250 bucks

318
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,523
Oh! Good boy

319
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:47,343
What about you papi?

320
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:50,008
Don't worry, I'm gonna get us that money

321
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,986
Papi, how are you gonna get 10,000 dollars by the end of the month?

322
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:57,766
Ok, here it is

323
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,046
Come on, everybody, quick

324
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:03,388
We have a winner

325
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,003
A man, from Queens New York called us 162 times in a single day

326
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:10,913
He says my food is terrible

327
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,628
Well I got news for you Ignacio Surez

328
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:16,254
I'll be coming to your kitchen to make your dish

329
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:18,161
And with 10,000 dollars on the line

330
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,224
It better be good

331
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:24,070
Because Ignacio Suarez, I challenge you to a Kitchen Rumble

332
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,270
I told you, I told you I'll get us the money

333
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,914
That is so cool, how do they do that?

334
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,557
Oh .. hey!

335
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,709
The camera adds 10, you'll thank me later

336
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:57,149
And you! Betty's new friend Matt

337
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,056
Why does everyone keep calling me that?

338
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:03,211
Wow, that really doesn't move does it?

339
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,224
Can we off this thing?

340
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,003
Justin why don't you go help grandpa

341
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:09,837
So what happens if your dad doesn't win?

342
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:12,418
Matt, don't say that too loud, you'll make my dad nervous

343
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,203
But if you lose the house, where will all of you live?

344
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:17,387
Don't worry about it, my dad's gonna take care of it

345
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,126
Oh my god look it's Frankie Barata

346
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,542
Which one of you is Ignacio Suarez?

347
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,411
I am!

348
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:56,419
Come here you persistant old bird!

349
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,185
You're really gonna be on this show huh?

350
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:00,978
So what you'd do with the money if you win?

351
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:04,467
Fat chance but what, do some travel, new car?

352
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,983
Actually, we're trying to buy our own home

353
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,780
Ah that's great man, the American dream, good for you

354
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,739
Frankie, we're rolling so whenever you're ready

355
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:14,848
In 5, 4, 3, 2 ..

356
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:21,474
I'm Frankie Berata and I'm coming to you from Queens New York

357
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:24,058
Where Ignacio Suarez and I are going head to head

358
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:26,959
For bragging rights to New York's best chicken molé

359
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,729
If Ignacio wins he gets 10,000 dollars

360
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:32,792
But if I win, all he gets are my leftovers

361
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,330
Let the kitchen rumble begin

362
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:39,507
Well it was pretty clear that the committee responded to me

363
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,538
So when we go back let me do all the talking

364
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,595
Hello Daniel

365
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:48,939
- Yeah?
- I'm trying to antagonize you but it's no fun if you're not here

366
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:49,704
Where are you

367
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,736
Sorry, just a little distracted

368
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,143
You know, I couldn't imagine this would ever happen

369
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:57,096
Connor Wiping us out like that

370
00:19:57,387 --> 00:20:00,140
Yeah well I guess you really never know anyone

371
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,660
Yeah but you were in love with him, that's gotta be hard

372
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,595
We're not here to chat about Connor

373
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:05,981
This is a business lunch

374
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:08,230
Save the pillow talk for your girlfriend

375
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,417
Actually Molly and I are ..

376
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:14,772
Trouble in paradise?

377
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:17,377
Can we not talk about her right now?

378
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:20,131
Oh sure, it's okay for you to ask me about my personal life

379
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,434
But you can't be in the hot seat?

380
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:25,653
She's sick Wilhelmina, she's dying

381
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:32,632
Well, now you made me feel awkward

382
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:38,314
Waiter, we're gonna need some wine, lots of it

383
00:20:55,666 --> 00:21:00,001
Now, it looks like Ignacio is making a traditional molé poblano

384
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:04,208
While Frankie seems to be experimenting with a molé of peanuts

385
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,669
Or in espanol, cacahuetes

386
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,976
Pace yourself papi, you still have 10 minutes

387
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,390
Ignacio grinding cherry paste

388
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,233
And can this be right, I don't believe it!

389
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,206
Frankie putting bread crumbs in his pot

390
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:22,399
I can't watch I'm too nervous

391
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,226
What's you grinding over there Ignacio?

392
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:27,037
Frankie getting in Ignacio's head now

393
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,913
Not bread crumbs Frankie

394
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,388
Ooh listen to that trash talk

395
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,373
Papi! What's wrong?

396
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:41,619
Are you okay, is it your heart?

397
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:42,713
No it's my back

398
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,748
Throw it out I can't move

399
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:50,361
Stop the clock, time out, TO

400
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,591
Sorry guys, there's no time out

401
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,955
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen

402
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,315
Fine, then we'll need to make a substitution

403
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,534
A substitution in the middle of cooking

404
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,020
A Kitchen Rumble first

405
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:03,062
I'll allow it

406
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,825
Good, good, ok who's the best at chopping?

407
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,940
No no no don't look at me

408
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,777
- I just did my nails
- Me too

409
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:13,760
- What? No
- Yes

410
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,496
No papi I don't even know how to cook at all

411
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,276
I'll tell you exactly what to do

412
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:19,041
Mi hija, it's for the house

413
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:21,120
8 Minus 9 and counting

414
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:25,770
Okay, I'll do it, what do I do?

415
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,642
Just turn the molé and turn the chicken

416
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,489
Turn the molé, and turn the chicken

417
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:34,442
Smart move, they turned to the sturdy girl to step in

418
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,109
I can hear you, you know

419
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:46,969
Now remember ladies and gentlemen

420
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:51,837
The judges have no idea which dish belongs to which chef

421
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:06,319
That's our molé

422
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,820
I know, and they love it, look at their smile

423
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,290
We're so gonna win this

424
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:14,016
It looks like the judges have made their decision

425
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:18,333
In the battle of chicken molé, there can only be one winner

426
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:21,360
That winner ladies and gentlemen is ..

427
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,423
Frankie Barata

428
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,009
What?

429
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,812
Oh wow! Thank you, thank you

430
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,807
This was so unexpected

431
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:37,855
I can't believe we lost

432
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:40,556
Come on guys! It's not a total loss

433
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,174
You get to eat my leftovers

434
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,688
Well it's not your fault you lost Betty

435
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:53,987
Those shows are rigged

436
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:55,796
It's actually sinking in

437
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,884
We're gonna lose our house

438
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,523
Look, you know what maybe I can help you guys out

439
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,788
No, Daniel, no, I cannot ask you to do that

440
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,102
Especially with all the money problems going on here

441
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:08,820
Chop chop Daniel, we can't keep the government waiting

442
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,321
We have millions to collect

443
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:14,148
You know your family's important to me

444
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,240
We're not done talking about this

445
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,102
Alright, I'll be fine, just go to your meeting

446
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,758
Save the company

447
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:32,277
And so after extensively reviewing our finances

448
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:37,391
We have decided to ask for a subsdidy of 75 million dollars

449
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:41,476
We feel the government must step in to protect the print media industry

450
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,853
Uhmm, well speaking of print media

451
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:50,396
I was wondering if either of you caught this morning's post

452
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:58,543
You look pretty smiley here for people on the verge of bankruptcy

453
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:03,330
Oh no no no, no we were commiserating

454
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:08,504
We were only laughing because the waiter had just tripped

455
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,793
This is a 400 dollars bottle of wine

456
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:17,008
Well to be fair congressman, it was the only drink offered on the menu

457
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:20,333
You expect the hard working American tax payer

458
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,546
To hand over millions of dollars

459
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,006
While you two paint the town red?

460
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:30,251
Congressman, I assure you, we were not using company funds

461
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,806
We were spending our own money

462
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:36,464
Shame on you! Shame I say

463
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,613
Do you know when that hot gay dad asked me on a play date

464
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:44,189
I didn't actually think he meant play date

465
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,813
You're fine! You just borrow Wilhelmina's baby

466
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,297
Slap on a fanny pack and voila, you're a dad

467
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,216
So what do you even do with a baby?

468
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,513
I don't know, lie to it

469
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:54,178
Pretend it's yours, never tell it it was adopted

470
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:58,130
Mandy, is that phone call from your mum still bothering you?

471
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,788
That woman robbed me of the chance to ever know my real mother

472
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:03,695
I mean I was conntected to Fey Summers for years and never even knew

473
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:06,734
- Downer
- I know right?

474
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:10,046
Hey Christina, we need to sign out Wilhelmina's baby

475
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:13,654
He's not a pea coat, you can't just sign him out whenever you want

476
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:16,705
What are you two up to?

477
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:17,775
What are you up to?

478
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,305
- What?
- What?

479
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,081
She's fine Christina

480
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:27,259
Wilhelmina feels that I need to bond more with her little bundle of joy and sticky

481
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,469
Oh, well if that's what Wilhelmina wants

482
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:44,643
Please be careful with him

483
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:47,270
No piercings, no tattoos

484
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,131
I was sure I could beat him

485
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:00,306
Papi, you were robbed

486
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,596
Frankie Barata doesn't deserve to eat your leftovers

487
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,910
- It's gonna be okay
- It's not okay

488
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,147
I promised your mother I would look after you guys

489
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:13,711
And now you, Betty and even Justin are raising money for the house

490
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,536
It's my responsibility

491
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,933
This was my chance

492
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,784
Oh my god! Oh my god!

493
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,126
What are you doing here?

494
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,973
Look, the answer to our prayers

495
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,643
Ten thousand dollars!

496
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:52,666
Daniel

497
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,706
Timothy right on time

498
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,188
Let me just put my fanny pack on and we'll head to the playground

499
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:00,893
Where's Chelo?

500
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:03,657
Sorry, my Chelo is back at home with the nanny

501
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,705
Somebody woke up from her nap with a little fever

502
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,739
That's great!

503
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,607
I mean not for Chelo, poor Chelo

504
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,951
But it just so happens that Amanda here is my nanny

505
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,296
So, why don't we leave the babies with the nannies

506
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:16,697
And we'll get some coffee

507
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,667
Bye bye honey

508
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,544
Marc! Marc

509
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:24,968
Is she okay? She seems a little confused

510
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:28,789
Oh, her English isn't so good

511
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,138
I'll see you later Amanda, thank you so much goodbye

512
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:36,195
I know this fabulous little cafe around the corner, have you been?

513
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,981
Marc, Marc

514
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,775
First of all, thank you

515
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:45,510
You're welcome

516
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,757
But it just doesn't seem right

517
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:48,719
With everything at the company up in the air

518
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,173
We cannot take your money

519
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,014
Okay, what are you talking about

520
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,788
The check, for ten thousand dollars

521
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:59,156
What check for ten thousand dollars

522
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,427
Alright, I know that you're trying to be all anonymous

523
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:04,611
That's why you made the signature so hard to read

524
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:07,533
But, I knew that you were worried about my family and ..

525
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,038
We didn't get the bailout Betty

526
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,081
I just blew our last shot at saving the company

527
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:13,644
What? No but I thought ..

528
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,509
Meade is done Betty ..

529
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:19,636
And I'm sorry, but I didn't write you that check

530
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,791
Here, take it

531
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,112
What happened, where is Marc?

532
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:33,163
I thought Wilhelmina wanted him to bond with the baby

533
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,564
He just needed it to hook up with this guy

534
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:39,643
- What?
- Oh yeah, babies are THE hot accessory in the gay world

535
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,518
Small dogs, totally 5 minutes ago

536
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:53,339
Well he likes you

537
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:55,488
Well I did carry him for 9 months

538
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:00,117
Kinda hard not to feel connected

539
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,000
You have to be careful with some things,

540
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,064
Remind myself that I'm not his mother

541
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,766
What do you mean?

542
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:12,464
Well, you're adopted, you should know more than anyone

543
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,691
Your real mother's not just the one who gave birth to you

544
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:19,644
It's the one who raises you and tuck you in at night

545
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:23,773
And yells at you when you miss your curfew

546
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:30,641
uhoh, you wanna help me change the diaper?

547
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:32,904
No

548
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,618
No notes, no explanation, just 10,000 dollars

549
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,636
Doesn't that seem so weird?

550
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,212
Yes, really weird

551
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,507
I mean what would you do?

552
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:47,946
If I get a check like that?

553
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:49,499
I don't know, cash it?

554
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:50,781
Dance for joy?

555
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:54,225
I can't dance by the way, please don't ever ask me

556
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,723
It's just .. Maybe I'm overthinking it

557
00:30:58,298 --> 00:30:59,514
Oh thank you

558
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:04,130
Thank goodness I've brought my wallet today

559
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,425
I know it's a miracle

560
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:10,567
uhoh, it's work

561
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:12,944
Can you just hold on one second?

562
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,041
Hello?

563
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,549
So without the government's help

564
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:50,388
The company has no money to move forward

565
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,515
As of tomorrow, Meade publications goes dark

566
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,886
I can't believe this is happening

567
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,955
I told you not to flaunt your wealth

568
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:04,715
Oh please, I suppose you've started making bathtub gin to economize?

569
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,800
When you start ordering your botox from Mexico we'll talk

570
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,648
They were right

571
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:12,030
The bailout committee

572
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,086
We don't deserve that money

573
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:15,505
What are you babbling about?

574
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:19,693
Well do we really expect some unemployed auto worker to save us?

575
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:20,877
It's not fair

576
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,094
So what, we throw in the towel?

577
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,736
No, we clean up our own mess

578
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:28,500
It's our name on this building, it's our responsibility

579
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:30,961
What do you propose?

580
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,201
I'm gonna start liquidating my personal assets

581
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:37,797
The house in Amagansett, the town house, stocks, art

582
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:38,734
Everything I've got

583
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,396
I should be able to raise enough to keep the company afloat

584
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,893
Keep everyone on payroll at least for a few months

585
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:47,336
You do realize that if the company doesn't turn around

586
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,742
You will lose everything

587
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,873
I know

588
00:32:55,925 --> 00:33:00,252
Daniel, I don't have the same kind of resources you do

589
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:03,442
But I'll contribute as much as I can

590
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,909
I have a son now and it's his company too

591
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:17,186
Your father would be proud you've taken this off

592
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,144
You are very very brave son

593
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:21,585
Yeah

594
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:26,328
Thanks mum

595
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:31,873
Sorry about that

596
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:32,841
You're ready to go?

597
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,743
Matt what is this?

598
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,130
Is it some kind of a joke?

599
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:39,535
It's not a joke

600
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:41,769
So this is you

601
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,756
And you weren't gonna tell me

602
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,403
You were just gonna let me believe that some stranger gave it to me?

603
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:47,770
You weren't supposed to find out

604
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,415
Betty listen, the last thing I wanted was for you to feel ..

605
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:54,318
I don't understand, how did you even find this much money?

606
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:59,127
Well, well my family is sort of, really wealthy

607
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,174
Okay, and you weren't gonna tell me that either

608
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,675
Well, it never came up in a conversation

609
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:07,570
Betty, please don't be angry

610
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,818
Look, it's not that much money

611
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,025
Yes, it is

612
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,498
No, not when you get billions of dollars laying around

613
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,786
I'm sorry, did you just say billions?

614
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,522
Well,you know it does go up and down you know with the markets

615
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:19,842
The dollar has been pretty ..

616
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:20,898
Matt!

617
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:24,277
Betty, I want you to have this money

618
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,627
Look, I know you're trying to help ..

619
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,767
No no,look, you don't even have to pay it back

620
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,516
Matt, you can't just give me this

621
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:33,484
It's too much

622
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:34,344
No, no it's not, it's not

623
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:37,295
Look we throw money like this at charity all the time

624
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,590
I'm not your charity

625
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,163
No, Betty

626
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:53,137
Hilda, would you please give it up

627
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:54,934
We're not taking Matt's money

628
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,332
You don't even like Matt

629
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:59,587
What? You are crazy, I love Matt

630
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:02,212
Matt wants to give us 10,000 dollars

631
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:04,434
In fact, if you don't marry him

632
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:05,949
I'm gonna scoop him up myself

633
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,174
- Mum
- What, I'm just kidding

634
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,042
I am not kidding

635
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:10,889
Do you smell that?

636
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:13,617
It smells like papi's molé

637
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:16,081
That's because it is papi's molé

638
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,851
You all remember Mr. Barata

639
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:19,740
What is he doing here?

640
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,505
Yeah

641
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,558
Your dad was just giving me a cooking lesson

642
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:24,809
You know I couldn't say this on TV

643
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:27,227
But he really skewed me with his molé

644
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,125
- So then why didn't he win?
- Yeah!

645
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,297
Don't be upset

646
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,740
I gotta win 3 outta 4 contests just to make my show's budget

647
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:37,647
So it was fixed!

648
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:39,142
We really needed that money

649
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,347
Look, I'm really sorry, I know

650
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,542
And that's why I came by to offer your dad

651
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:44,855
A job at my restaurant

652
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:47,948
I'm excited to have his molé, on my menu

653
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:50,449
And I told Mr. Barata that I would love to go work for him

654
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,875
Papi, you just gave this guy your molé recipe?

655
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,876
Gave? This guy don't give anything

656
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,664
He took me for 10,000 dollars

657
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:00,853
It is quite a secret recipe

658
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:03,731
And it's worth every penny

659
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:06,079
- I'll see you monday Ignacio
- You bet

660
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,067
Thanks a lot

661
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,580
Do you think we should've asked for more?

662
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,134
So how was your date?

663
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:24,044
Oh it was terrible

664
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:26,152
Just talked about his stupid baby the whole time

665
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:27,545
Chelo this, Chelo that

666
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,653
Hello! Let's talk about me

667
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,212
But hey listen

668
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:34,070
I'm sorry I left you stranded with the Wiliminini

669
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,825
No, the baby time was good for me

670
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:38,667
Kinda got me thinking

671
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:41,270
You wanna have a baby

672
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,143
Oh my god! You want me to be the father

673
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:45,102
Ew! No, gross!

674
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,854
Okay it's not that gross!

675
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,424
You were saying?

676
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:56,850
I guess .. I just realized that I spent so long being mad at my parents

677
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,318
That I kinda forgot that they were my parents

678
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:01,600
I mean they've always been there for me

679
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,434
They must really miss me

680
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,871
And to be honest I kinda miss them too

681
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:21,482
So I heard you're gonna finance the company with your own money

682
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,263
That's pretty brave

683
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,127
That's what everyone's telling me

684
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,096
Though, I've never felt like a bigger coward

685
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,554
In my entire life

686
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,858
I Just .. Let her walk away

687
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:40,106
Molly?

688
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,531
She told me she was sick

689
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,100
Told me not to get involved

690
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,259
To let her go

691
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:49,584
And the messed up part was ..

692
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:54,841
I felt relieved

693
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,658
Why?

694
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:58,615
Because, I was scared ..

695
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,192
To see her get worse

696
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,245
But ..

697
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,558
But?

698
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:09,217
I love her

699
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:13,974
Well then you should be with her

700
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:16,163
Yeah

701
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:20,682
Go find her .. Go

702
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:24,827
Now

703
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:42,175
Hey mum, it's me

704
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:08,501
Molly!

705
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:10,565
Daniel?

706
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:13,654
What are you doing here?

707
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,814
I thought about it

708
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,768
I decided I'm not letting you go

709
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,797
Daniel, we've talked about this

710
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,314
You don't know how hard this is gonna be

711
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:26,581
I can't put you through it

712
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:29,110
And I can't let you do this alone

713
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,142
I know you're scared

714
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:32,687
Molly, I am too

715
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:35,578
But I need you

716
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,796
I need you in my life

717
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,974
- Hi
- Hey

718
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,379
Thanks for meeting me

719
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:09,115
Matt, I'm sorry that I got so upset yesterday

720
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,788
No, don't, I'm the one who should be apologizing

721
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:14,052
You are not my charity

722
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,580
And I will never try to buy your house again

723
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,326
It's a deal

724
00:40:19,326 --> 00:40:21,223
I don't have to buy anything if you don't want to

725
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,244
No dinners, no jellybeans, no nothing

726
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,933
Alright, alright, let's not go crazy

727
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:28,591
It's just ..

728
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:29,613
When you gave us that check

729
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,144
It's like one minute you're Matt

730
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,484
Who forgets his wallet and then ..

731
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:37,646
Betty, I'm still the same person

732
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,173
I know, I just feel like I don't know that much about you

733
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,611
Well, here's something else you might not know

734
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,022
I'm glad that you're not still mad at me

735
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,384
Cause, I'm kinda really into you

736
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:25,419
- Betty hurry up
- Where's the popcorn?
