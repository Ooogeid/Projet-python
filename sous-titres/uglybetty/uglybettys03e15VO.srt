1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,310
The helicopter
was waiting for me,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,190
gunfire going of all around,
but I couldn't leave.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,790
As long as I live,
I'll never forget the faces of those children

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,630
All right, we get it. Darfur is a bummer.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,560
But who wants those images in their head?

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,430
She's amazing.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,080
I can't believe you get to work for her.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,420
What you do sounds a lot more fun,

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,620
especially during fashion week.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,670
Yeah, well, fashion week isn't nearly as cool
as genocide week.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,470
Sorry. That came out wrong.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,480
You can read the piece in this month's
"New York Review."

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,280
Brilliant and depressing,
but mostly brilliant.

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,000
Ms. Mastronardi has offered to stay a few minutes

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,940
if anyone wants to talk to her.
And no asking for jobs.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,560
Something's been bothering me,
and I'm thinking you could help.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,460
-Is this brown?
-Yes

18
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,120
Because, you know,
I never had the big 64 crayons

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,510
that every other kid had..

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,200
so I don't know all the obscure colors like, uh...
-Brown?

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,730
-Uh, mocha or mud or tree bark.
-Those aren't really colors.

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,360
Oh, well, leave it to fashion girl to clear that up.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,340
Oh, uh, no. I'm not fashion girl.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,990
-I'm fashion girl.
-But you work at "Mode."

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,140
I'm sports guy. You're fashion girl.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,030
-We're known by our magazines.
-Okay

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,720
What do you do at "Mode"?

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,800
Um, excuse me.

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,670
Actually, um, I'm an assistant to the editor-in-chief,

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,130
but I've gotten to do other things.

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,610
Like, sometimes I write a column for the web site,

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,530
and earlier this year I got to oversee a cover shoot.

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Sounds like you're on a great path
 to becoming a fashion editor.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,560
Oh, thanks. Yeah, but, um, I got into Y.E.T.I.
Because I'm interested in other magazines.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,600
Like, one day, I would love to do what you do.

36
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,620
Then you might want to get off the fashion track,

37
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,240
and get some other experience,

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,340
because right now, fashion's where you're heading.

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,260
Oh, okay.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,990
So I suggested to Jodie that anyone who wanted

41
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,280
should pair up with a partner from another magazine,

42
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,740
and that way,we can get experience from different places.

43
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,470
Have you not got enough going on at fashion week?

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,070
Yeah, but if I get the girl from "The New York Review",

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,840
then it would totally be worth it.
-That would be a good fit for you.

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,740
Right? I mean, I love it here,

47
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,970
but I've just never seen myself being in fashion forever,

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,790
and for once, I would like to be in a place
that comes more natural,

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,700
and then people would stop calling me fashion girl.

50
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,670
Who's calling you fashion girl?

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,110
This morning, you've got
the Donna Karan preview,

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,210
followed by brunch with Donna Karan

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,630
and then the Donna Karan show.

54
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,720
So I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume
that you are wearing--

55
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,220
Cavalli.

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,190
Are you sure?

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm worried that the cavalli makes you look
a little too "Michelle Obama at the mall."

58
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,120
Ugh. Remember what we said about unsolicited opinions?

59
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,400
Yes, yes, I do. Uh, it's just--
-The Cavalli, please.

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,580
Have I told you lately what a remarkable body you have?

61
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,060
Ugh! You'd never even know you're about to have a child.

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,270
-Give me the damn dress.
-They didn't send it

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,480
What? Well, why not?
-Well.

64
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,350
Since you've been seeing Connor,
you haven't been working the circuit as much,

65
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,390
and it's possible that you might have...
fallen off their radar.

66
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,470
-Oh, that is ridiculous.
-Of course it is.

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,520
Wilhelmina slater is the most important person
at fashion week.

68
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,500
A "yes" from me determines style.

69
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,140
Do you remember micro buckles of '04?

70
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,940
-Um, no. No, not really.
-Exactly. Because I said no.

71
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,120
Now if the cavalli was not sent,
it was because of human error.

72
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,470
Don't let it happen again.

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,590
Yeah, make sure I'm sitting near
Phillip Lim at Peter Som,

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,960
and nowhere near Peter Som at Phillip Lim.

75
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,480
Or is it the other way around?
You'll figure it out.

76
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,540
Um, more importantly, I really need you
to deal with these.

77
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,530
Last year, the mandate was

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,200
for cuffs to be peering out from jackets.

79
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,010
At Marc Jacobs' preview last night,

80
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,550
suddenly they're peeking instead.
Can you believe it?

81
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,000
-Nope, I can't.
-I mean, it was humiliating.

82
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,010
I need an 1/8 of an inch off all them asap.

83
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,790
Please use your discretion.
I'd be mortified if anyone knew they were mine.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,860
Daniel, do you think you have any
non-fashion related assignments for me?

85
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,050
It's fashion week
at a fashion magazine, Betty.

86
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean, I do have this press release you could write.

87
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,170
It's for this designer Heinrich.

88
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,410
Last minute addition at the "Mode" show, but...

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,910
I'll take it. Knowing how to write
a press release is useful anywhere.

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,630
Okay, I'm ready for fashion week.

91
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,630
Wow! You look beautiful.

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,520
Thank you.
Everything I'm wearing hurts.

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,380
That's good, right?

94
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,400
Uh, whatever it is you're doing,
it definitely works for me. Shall we?

95
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,890
-Bye.
-Have fun.

96
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,940
Peering? My God, Daniel.
Have some self-respect.

97
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey, Betty. We're having a little
going-away party for Elena.

98
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,850
You want to say good-bye before she goes away?
It's Betty!

99
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,840
Good-bye, Elena!

100
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,870
Bye, Betty!

101
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,780
We are gonna miss her so much.

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,740
Okay, all right. We all know you're very excited she's  leaving,
but maybe you could tone it back just a little bit.

103
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,050
Hey, I'm just happy that papi's better,

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,780
and he doesn't need a nurse anymore.

105
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,230
Oh, good, 'cause I don't think this means
they're gonna stop seeing each other.

106
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,750
Ugh. Please. Once that kinky Florence Nightingale fantasy
is over, it's done.

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,970
Haven't I asked you not to use the word "kinky"
concerning our father?

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Look, I have to go.
Oh! Wish me luck with "The New York Review."

109
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,550
-Good luck!
-Bye.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,060
Okay, now I mentioned last week that
we'd be picking partners.

111
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,810
I advise you,choose carefully,

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,630
because you will be working with this person all year.

113
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,540
And if you're like me, you'll hook up, get married,

114
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,990
 get married, cheat, divorce and end up bitter and alone,

115
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,470
but I digress.
Okay!

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,960
Let's... pick... partners!

117
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, I am so excited you want to work with me!

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,350
Totally! Not just because of
the giant cookie you sent to my office.

119
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,710
Oh. Was it good?

120
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,300
All right, is everyone sitting next to the person they picked?

121
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,670
Now turn to the person on the other side,

122
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,170
and meet your new partner.

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,770
In publishing, you must expect the unexpected.

124
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,910
-I get fashion girl.
-And I get sports guy.

125
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,480
And one last thing..

126
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,290
your assignment this week is
to trail your partner at work.

127
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,630
Come back ready to discuss five things you learn

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,710
about each other's magazines,
and nothing stupid.

129
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,690
Class dismissed.

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,270
Jodie.

131
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,670
Um, I don't mean to question you.

132
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,630
It's just.. See, I already work at Fashion magazine,

133
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,220
and I was kinda hoping that I could do something
a little more meaningful, and

134
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,820
I don't know what I can learn working
with the sports guy.

135
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,890
Who's right behind you.

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,020
Awkward.

137
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,890
Hey, why don't we just switch partners?

138
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,500
-I mean, you don't want to learn about fashion.
-No, I do,

139
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,970
and I know that you are the perfect person to teach me.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,240
We are gonna knock this assignment out of the park.

141
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,910
That's a sports thing. I'm gonna teach you all about that.

142
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,170
Ugly Betty
Season 03, episode 15

143
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,800

145
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,950
Matt, I promise we will get to the tour.

146
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,020
It's just, fashion week is crazy,

147
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,550
and Daniel has, like, a million messages.

148
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,180
Hey, no problem.

149
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,000
So did you always know that
you wanted to work in fashion?

150
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,890
-Um, no, not really.
-So how'd you end up here?

151
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,390
What? Oh, I'm sorry. I was listening to the message.

152
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,410
Oh, sorry. You were talking. I thought it was okay.

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,440
And I missed it again. That's okay.
I can just do this later.

154
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh, Amanda?

155
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,030
I have to write a press release on Heinrich.

156
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,080
-What do you know about him?
-Never heard of him.

157
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,590
He must suck.

158
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,170
-Wow. Heinrich..he's great.
-What, you know heinrich?

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,500
-No.
-Oh, 'cause you just acted like you knew him.

160
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,200
I wasn't expecting the follow-up. Sorry.

161
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,160
Oh, Daniel. You were all over the papers today.

162
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,150
-Really?
-Yes. Ahem.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,410
"Looking sensational at Michael Kors' was 'Mode's' Daniel Meade.

164
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,640
He was accompanied by..."  Ugh!

165
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,180
-What?
-Nothing. I just remembered I can't read.

166
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,430
-It's my own secret shame.
-Amanda, what does it say?

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,920
"His new girlfriend/charity case..

168
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,340
a frump with a pulled-back hairstyle
that even a turn-of-the-century

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
librarian would deem too severe."

170
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
See? That is not so bad.
They didn't mention her big ears.

171
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,030
Well, that's insane. Molly looked fantastic.

172
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,420
Oh, not according to this one.

173
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,470
"Daniel meade might want to see a dermatologist.

174
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,720
He seemed to have a 5'5' woman-shaped growth on his arm."

175
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,060
Okay, now that one's clever.
You've gotta laugh at that.

176
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,200
Hello? Heinrich?

177
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,830
I think the door is open.

178
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,890
All right. I've never done this before.
I'm a little nervous.

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,250
So if you have any questions, maybe wait till after.

180
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,760
Got it.

181
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,530
-Oh!

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,240
Is he dead?
S-sorry. That was a question.

183
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,090
Excuse me.

184
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,800
Are you Heinrich?

185
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,400
I am The Heinrich.

186
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,230
Heinrich for short.

187
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,980
I'm Betty Suarez from "Mode."
This is my colleague Matt.

188
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm going to write your press release.

189
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,510
We will make love..not today, but someday.

190
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,090
Ay.Are those your dresses?
They're very nice.

191
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,490
They... are..

192
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,200
garbage.

193
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,710
This is what we will present at the "Mode" show.

194
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,100
Wings. They have wings.

195
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,740
I don't know, though.
I kind like this photo he's given you.

196
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,600
-I like the way it catches the light.
-That's shards of glass!

197
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,400
The dress is on the mannequin 'cause the models
won't even sign the release to wear that thing.

198
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,950
Well, who am I to judge anyone?

199
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,930
Two years ago, I was the "Mode" designer to watch.

200
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,060
Now look at me..knocked up with someone else's kid,

201
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,530
forced to take Brad Pitt's cuffs by an 1/8 of an inch.

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,240
So the closet is just, like, a really big closet?

203
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,270
There is no comparison between
The Heinrich and The Christina.

204
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,030
Well, it's very kind of you to say, but no one's writing

205
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,020
a press release about me, are they?

206
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,100
So do they ever give you any of the clothes?

207
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,750
'Cause if I'm covering a game

208
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,780
and one of the guys is throwing out a bloody jersey,

209
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,290
sometimes I get to keep that. Score!

210
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,380
That's cool.
Hey, Matt, this is probably so boring for you.

211
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,330
Do you want to go back to my desk
and read back issues?

212
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,750
It's such a good way to learn.

213
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,320
And you can open my confidential drawer.

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,010
Don't worry. It's just snacks.

215
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,830
He seems interesting.

216
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,150
I know. It's just a really bad time
to have somebody following me.

217
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,410
I mean, I was willing to make the sacrifice
for "The New York Review,"

218
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,010
but "Sports Experience?
That's not really gonna help me.

219
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,650
All right, what am I gonna say about this thing?

220
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,570
Come here. Here we go.

221
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
"For immediate release"...

222
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
"It has been said fashion is pain."

223
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,720
-You can't write that.
-No, no, no. I can. I can. No write. It's good for a laugh.

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,750
Okay, but this is just for us.

225
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,570
"Science said no, but Heinrich said yes!"

226
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,600
"So get your tetanus shots, and prepare to bleed."

227
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,860
Here you go. I changed "shiny" to "glittering",

228
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,400
and added the words "breakout designer" a few times.

229
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,160
-It's good.
-Thank you so much, Justin.

230
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,150
It was so hard for me to get anything done at work

231
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,180
yesterday with all of matt's questions.
Ooh! Before I forget,

232
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,110
I only get two tickets to the "Mode" show this year,

233
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,360
-so we have to decide who's going.
-I get one or I tell everyone

234
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,830
that you still like Ricky Martin.

235
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,980
I'm sorry. I have to play hardball.
-Mama made pancakes!

236
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Ooh! Someone's in a good mood.

237
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,270
Well, guess who's not taking
papi's blood pressure this morning?

238
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,680
Nurse skank.
-Hilda.

239
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,550
Ay. Let me enjoy myself. Eat your pancakes.

240
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,700
Look, smiley face.
-Aww, chocolate chip eyes!

241
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,910
-Morning.
-Morning.

242
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,120
You have the same hideous robe as grandpa?

243
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,630
It's not hideous. It's, um, retro.

244
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,300
And obviously, we have some things to talk about.

245
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,710
I just hope we can be, um, mature about it.

246
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,570
Oh, sure. I got no problem being mature.

247
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,650
Uh, I gotta get to work. You know, fashion week, all of that.

248
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,340
Sorry. Talk to you later.

249
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,210
Okay, I just have to say something.

250
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,350
You're better than that robe.

251
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,530
And I'm gonna go get you one of mine.

252
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,530
And in the "Ten Designers to Watch" show,

253
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,250
 "Mode" presents cutting-edge fashion, literally..

254
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,780
Made of barbed wire and rusty nails,

255
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,910
designer Heinrich's line promises to intrigue..

256
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,020
and danger.
-What?

257
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,450
-Science said no,

258
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,910
but Heinrich said yes.
-No!

259
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,910
So get your tetanus shot and be prepared to bleed.

260
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,400
-Ouch!
-Oh, my god.

261
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,460
That's the wrong press release.

262
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,340
Morning. You would not believe how much
I have already learned about fashion.

263
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,180
And now I know that these are chinos.

264
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,850
-Khakis.
-Damn it.

265
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,540
Matt, did you see where I put that press release
I wrote yesterday?

266
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,390
-Uh, yeah, I gave it to your boss.
-You what?

267
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,250
Well, he asked for it, and it said "for immediate release,"

268
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,780
so I didn't want to wait until you came back.
-No. No,

269
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,380
that was just a joke, a mean and terrible joke.
I wrote
the real one last night.

270
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,050
-That one was never supposed to go out.
Oh, God. I'm really sorry.

271
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,700
Look, if you get fired, I can get you a new job.

272
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,510
The guy who covers wrestling is leaving.

273
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,080
-What?
-Yeah, it's probably not the best fit,

274
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,080
but we'll..we'll figure something..oh.

275
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,140
Daniel, I'm sorry. This was never supposed to happen.

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,160
Peering is back.

277
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,490
Why did I ever listen to Marc Jacobs?

278
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,480
Lagerfeld laughed in my face because my cuffs were peeking.

279
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,400
Hey, nice job on that press release, by the way.

280
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,940
I liked that it wasn't full of the same old cliches,

281
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,390
and so did Heinrich.

282
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,600
Really?

283
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,620
He wants you to produce his show.

284
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,150
Some jumping and hugging might be appropriate now.

285
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,820
N-no, uh, produce his show..
what would I have to do?

286
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,730
You know, come up with a concept for the show

287
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,020
that gets people excited about his clothes.

288
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,440
Oh, I don't know if I'm the right person
for this particular line.

289
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,890
Betty, come on. Don't worry.

290
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,660
Designers have very clear visions.

291
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,550
Just listen to Heinrich.
He'll tell you exactly what he wants.

292
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,990
Okay. Yeah.

293
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,950
All right, well, then I guess I'm producing a show.

294
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,290
-What was that?
-It's jumping.

295
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,650
It was your idea.

296
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,790
Marc St.James alerting you that Wilhelmina Slater

297
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,550
is on route to the Proenza Schouler show.

298
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,570
Confirming her usual seat.

299
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,650
That's..that's funny.

300
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,370
It's getting less funny.

301
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,710
You cannot do this to me!

302
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,620
Name your price..box at the met,

303
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,160
reservations at Buddakan, Kidney.

304
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm 0-negative. It's a universal donor.

305
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,080
I can hear you, you know?

306
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,490
What's going on?

307
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,570
Oh, you're not gonna throw up, are you?

308
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,090
Roll down the window.

309
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,120
-You're in the second row.
-What?! How is that possible?

310
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,220
-I'm always in the front row.
-I don't know,

311
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,250
but they swear that there is nothing
that they can do.

312
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,290
You say the word, and I will
kill myself right now.

313
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,790
Oh, Marc, stop.

314
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,200
Well, I'm certainly not going in there.

315
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,450
No. It would be more humiliating
than being caught in crocs.

316
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,840
How could this happen?

317
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,680
Have I changed?
Have I gone soft?

318
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,980
No. You're still as horrible and evil as the day

319
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,910
that Satan himself placed you
in your mother's arms.

320
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,810
Oh, darling, that's sweet.

321
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,480
But obviously, the fashion world has forgotten

322
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,690
that I decide who is relevant, not them.

323
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,670
I need to remind them of my power.

324
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,950
I have a surprise for you.

325
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,940
This is Clarissa and Skye, two "Mode" stylists.

326
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,830
You never take advantage of
dating an editor-in-chief,

327
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,590
so I thought, what better time than fashion week?

328
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,950
Thank you.

329
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,320
-Say something.
-I can't

330
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,640
Don't mess up my lipstick.

331
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,840
You are the first person
who understands me, Betty Suarez.

332
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,460
Still, we will wait to make love.

333
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,520
Okay. Let's talk about your show.

334
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,920
I tell you exactly what I want..

335
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,370
the hot, dry vortex of wind,

336
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,850
that blows dreams into dust.

337
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,870
-Okay, so fans..
-No, nooo!

338
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,450
I hate fans. They are cliche'.

339
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,950
-No fans.
-Mm. Give me gray.

340
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,210
Gray..that's good. That's specific.

341
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,150
Gray but obscure.

342
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,890
A rainbow of gray,

343
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,450
but sharp like clear fog.

344
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,520
Heinrich, I-I think we're
going in the wrong direction.

345
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,490
No, no, Betty, Betty,

346
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,350
it is about pain,

347
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,960
und escape, but no escape.

348
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,070
Understand?

349
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,700
Um,  actually..

350
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,960
No, no. Listen to the clothes.

351
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,190
They will tell you what to do.

352
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I am coming to you live from
the Proenza Schouler show.

353
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,510
And now... entering the tent
in a fabulous marc jacobs frock, we have..

354
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,220
looks like somebody's gone from drab to fab.

355
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,820
Hello, "Extreme Makeover: Face edition."

356
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,760
Ugly duckling. Ugly duckling.

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,570
Maybe I should have gone with "swan."

358
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,560
Wilhelmina Slater wants to give you

359
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,350
an exclusive review of the Proenza Schouler line.

360
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,900
And trust me, she'll be at her "wilhel-meanest."

361
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,720
Hey! Hey, sorry I'm late.
I was stuck talking to Heidi Klum.

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,560
-That woman cannot find her way to the end of a joke.
-Actually, I have to go.

363
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,850
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

364
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,950
It--my landlord called and th-there's a leak

365
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,630
in my ceiling that might cave in or something,

366
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,710
and it might take a while,
so I'll talk to you later.

367
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,040
Is it telling you what the concept is yet?

368
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,910
Nope, not yet.

369
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,920
Would it help if I told you I googled you and

370
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,320
there are already 47 mentions of you and Heinrich?

371
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,800
No. Actually, that doesn't help at all.

372
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,190
So it's probably not the best time
to ask you about the clip of you

373
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,230
riding a Harley into a vat of Jell-O.

374
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,530
Okay, Betty, you have got
to get me into the Heinrich show.

375
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,790
He is my favorite designer in the whole world.

376
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,720
Okay, didn't you say that you
didn't even know who he was?

377
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,250
Someone's been hitting the tequila again.

378
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,290
It's like mother's milk to her.

379
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,830
Betty, Heinrich is all people are talking about,

380
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,460
so that means he's good, obvi.

381
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,810
Excuse me.

382
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,420
Daniel, can I talk to you
for just one second?

383
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,370
So, like, the buzz on this Heinrich thing..

384
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,480
-it's getting kind of big.
-Yeah, yeah. Actually, I was just coming to tell you.

385
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,330
We're moving him to the closing
position. Isn't that great?

386
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,110
Oh! Wow! Great!
So, like, if you want to go with someone

387
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,010
with a little more experience
to produce his show,

388
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,470
you know, someone who can,
like, hear when clothes talk,

389
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,460
like some sort of a clothes whisperer...

390
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,920
Why are you so weird today?

391
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,640
I just don't think that
I'm the person for this job.

392
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,620
Betty, I trust you more than anyone.

393
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,670
You are gonna do great.

394
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,850
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't get any of this stuff either.

395
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,240
I mean, aren't you supposed
to be able to wear clothes?

396
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,670
-Yep, one would think.
-So why isn't he good?

397
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,100
I don't know, but apparently,
there's something there,

398
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,230
because everyone's going crazy
for the Heinrich,

399
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,110
-and I don't know what it is.
-Oh, that's not good.

400
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,680
It's very not good.
You know what else is not good?

401
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,860
I think I've wasted three years of my life

402
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,960
in an industry that I don't even understand.

403
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,120
And apparently, it's all I'm qualified to do.

404
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,220
Well, when things get stressful, sometimes

405
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,580
it's good to take a break,

406
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,770
Uh, step outside your world.
We can go over to my magazine.

407
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,770
I could teach you about sports.

408
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,040
Great. Maybe I could find
a career in sports.

409
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,430
I mean, I was thinking a magazine
that actually meant something,

410
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,530
you know, like "The New York Review."

411
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,420
But hey! I could have a future
in fashion or sports.

412
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,850
Right.

413
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,280
You know, I was really excited
when we got partnered up.

414
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,750
You know, I've been listening
to you in class, and you seem so smart,

415
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,420
and interested in things, but..

416
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,750
But I don't know.You haven't asked me
 a single thing about what I do.

417
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,290
It's like you heard "sports"
and judged me,

418
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,100
which is exactly what you don't
want people to do to you.

419
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,890
You know, I know you think
fashion is shallow, but..

420
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,830
it seems to me like you fit right in.

421
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,640
Matt. Matt.

422
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm sorry.

423
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,180
Look, you were right.

424
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,990
I was being awful, and fashion week
is not an excuse,

425
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,790
-and I promise you, I am not shallow.
-I know. I know.

426
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,230
Even as I was saying it,
I wasn't really believing it.

427
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,350
Oh, good, because I do want
to learn about your magazine.

428
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,110
-In fact, let's go now.
-Now?

429
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,290
Yeah! Daniel's out at the shows.

430
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not gonna get any further
on this Heinrich thing.

431
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,930
So let's go learn about sports.

432
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,800
You know, tonight might not be
the best night to start..

433
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,330
I won't take no for an answer.

434
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,710
I tried to warn you.

435
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,020
You could have been a little more specific.

436
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,900
I can't believe you haven't seen
"Step up 2 the streets" yet.

437
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,910
It's only the best
classical-versus-urban dance movie ever.

438
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,490
It totally defines my generation.

439
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,050
Trying to watch a movie here.


440
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,950
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

441
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,180
We should go dancing sometime.

442
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,120
Mm. I got some moves.

443
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,180
I bet you do.

444
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,690
Everything okay?

445
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,400
I can't hear what they're saying.

446
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,690
It's either about stepping up or the streets.

447
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,800
You know what?
I don't even like this movie.

448
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,520
What is going on with you?
You're acting like a child.

449
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,640
You're acting like a horny teenager.

450
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,700
Hilda, I'm sorry you don't like this,

451
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,020
but I have a right to be in a relationship.

452
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,750
And I have a right
not to have your relationship

453
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,020
shoved in my face
every time I turn around!

454
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,320
No, papi. This is my house, too!

455
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,360
For the record, I really like Elena,

456
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,030
and it's not just because

457
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,900
she's turned this place
into a day spa.

458
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,770
I wish Hilda felt that way.

459
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,350
I know. They used to be friends.

460
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,360
Maybe if she stayed in a room
with her more than a minute,

461
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,010
she'd remember that.

462
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,240
Come on. Andie's about to show
the 4-1-0 crew

463
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,160
the true meaning of the streets.

464
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,660
Hey. Nice game.

465
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,490
Uh, Matt, are you sure it's okay
for me to be in here?

466
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,250
Well, they're okay with it
if you are.

467
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,470
Yeah. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine?

468
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,630
Oh! Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't see anything.

469
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,960
Although I think now we might be married.

470
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,930
Hey. Hey, Sasha. Sasha, great game saturday.

471
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,260
Hey, that, Betty, is Sasha Radovic.

472
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,520
I swear, I once saw him drain
a three from the parking lot.

473
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
Oh, well, I understood "parking lot."

474
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,290
So it must be nice, huh

475
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,540
working at your dream magazine?

476
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,700
"Great Sport"? Que nada.

477
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,590
I always..I always stunk at sports.

478
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,460
And I always thought the pros
were just a bunch of overpaid babies.

479
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,000
-Hey, I heard that.
-Good.

480
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,690
-So what changed?
-I got to know the guys.

481
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,310
Brock over there..

482
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,660
got into a car accident when he was 16.

483
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,370
The doctors told him
he would never walk again...

484
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,860
but he had a dream to play basketball.

485
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,720
And, uh, and Jimmy.. um, well, okay,
Jimmy just likes the money,

486
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,300
but, uh, but Sasha..

487
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,460
Just wait. Wait.

488
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,650
Look at this.

489
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,730
Whose names are those?

490
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,480
His siblings.

491
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,530
He was drafted here last year,
passed when he was 18.

492
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,280
Couldn't speak a word of english,
hardly knew a soul,

493
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,920
because the serbian government
wouldn't allow his family
to come with him.

494
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,970
And so he plays to support them.

495
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,110
Want me to, uh, keep going?

496
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,660
Not if it includes pointing
to more naked men.

497
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,300
All I'm saying is that none of this
was a natural fit for me.

498
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,390
You know, but I found my way in
by making it personal.

499
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,600
Maybe that would work for you at "Mode."

500
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,010
Here. Come on.
I want to show you the, uh, showers.

501
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,950
I'm..I'm kidding.

502
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,590
We're actually going to
the, uh, steam room.

503
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,940
Shut up, matt. Hmm.

504
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,610
I spent an hour and a half
trashing Proenza Schouler.

505
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,760
I said the most heinous things.

506
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm surprised I wasn't arrested
for a hate crime.

507
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,360
That'll teach them who has
the real power in this business.

508
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,410
Nobody puts baby in the second row.

509
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,780
Oh, darling, that referee
might be current in Australia,

510
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,830
but we're over it here.

511
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,730
Oh, this must be it.

512
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,950
<i>And finally, my exclusive interview</i>

513
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,580
<i>with "Mode's" co-editor-in-chief, Wilhelmina Slater.</i>

514
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,020
<i>We hear she's got some juicy dish</i>

515
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,490
<i>on Proenza Schouler's new line.</i>

516
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,250
<i>Wait a minute. Breaking news? This just in..</i>

517
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,720
<i>doggy jeans are now low-waisted.</i>

518
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,450
<i>That's right, pups. It's time
 to ditch those mid-rise denims</i>

519
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,720
<i>or risk looking like last year's bitch.</i>

520
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,030
<i>for more on these hoochie poochies,</i>

521
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,020
<i>let's go to our canine correspondent.</i>

522
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,370
You can't let that bother you.

523
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,930
It's slipping away.

524
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,740
What is?

525
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,140
Never mind.

526
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,420
Talk to me. What is it?

527
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,810
For 20 years, I killed myself
for my career.

528
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
I sacrificed everything,

529
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,200
and now because I dared
to flirt with a personal life,

530
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,830
suddenly I'm nothing?

531
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,490
Oh. Silly me. I just, uh, I thought
I could have it all.

532
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,450
You can, with me.

533
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,700
Willie, you and I are both fighters.

534
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,530
And the thing about being
a fighter is, you don't stop.

535
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,410
If you're down,
you look for an opportunity

536
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,030
to claw your way back.

537
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,360
Now people may not like you for it,

538
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,210
but I do.

539
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,040
And we are in this together.

540
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,190
So I learned all about how you
grew up behind the iron curtain,

541
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,480
dreaming of a life
on the other side of the berlin wall

542
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,550
and that you lost your father

543
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,850
when he got caught trying
to escape over the barbed wire.

544
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,470
And so even when the wall came down,

545
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,770
you still carried that pain,

546
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,200
pain that is always with you,
even in the clothes you make.

547
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,820
Maybe the only way
you can imagine escaping

548
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,450
is by raising giant wings

549
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,070
and letting the wind
carry you far away.

550
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,080
Is that right?

551
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,600
Now we will make love.

552
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,710
Well, no. Thank you, though.

553
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,340
Let me show you how I want
to use this in your show.

554
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,330
This is a representation
of the Berlin wall.

555
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,200
You can explain to the fire marshal

556
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,650
that our iron curtain is only
blocking the back two exits.

557
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,470
-There are six more exits in the house.
-Yeah, sure.

558
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,600
Right after I ask him
to introduce me to some firemen.

559
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,670
Everything good?

560
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,840
Steve, we have to move Isaac Mizrahi to the front row.

561
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,560
There are too many sharp objects
for him to throw another tantrum.

562
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,600
-Yeah, everything's great.
-Good. Then it'll seem less

563
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,320
selfish if I make this about me.

564
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,480
-Something is going on with Molly.
-What do you mean?

565
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,610
Well, she ran out of Proenza Schouler

566
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,050
and hasn't returned my calls since.

567
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,480
Well, did you do something stupid?

568
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,700
No, just the opposite.

569
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,210
I got her this big makeover
right before the show.

570
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,180
Daniel, you did something stupid. Thank you.

571
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,800
-What?
-Look,

572
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,750
you basically told her
that you weren't okay with the way she is.

573
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,720
No, I-I am okay with her.
I-I think she's amazing.

574
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Well, then you better find
a big way to tell her that.

575
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,910
Oh! Careful with the razor blades.

576
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,580
What are you doing here?

577
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,430
I've never been to fashion week.

578
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,740
I thought it'd be fun
to watch the show together.

579
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,550
Did my father put you up to this?

580
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
-No.
-I'm gonna kill him.

581
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,110
And how could he do that to Justin?
You know he was dying to come to this?

582
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,840
Actually, Justin's the one
who ga me his seat.

583
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,860
I guess your father's not the only one

584
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,400
who wants us to get along.

585
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,350
-Molly.
-Hi.

586
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,080
Hey. I've been calling and calling.

587
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,500
-I know. I'm..
-No, no, no, wait. I have been an idiot.

588
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,870
You don't need a makeover.

589
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,980
I'm the one who needs to change.

590
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,070
You are so different from everyone I know,

591
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,970
and you care about the things that matter,

592
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,040
you won't let met get away
with being shallow and stupid.

593
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,300
When I think about our future,
I'm not scared.

594
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,300
It's just..it's exciting.

595
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,840
And I've never been
that guy before.

596
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,170
I don't want to you to change.
Molly, I love you.

597
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,770
I love you, too.

598
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,750
It's just been an overwhelming week.

599
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,110
Yeah. No, I get that.
Fashion week is ridiculous,

600
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,620
and you have all that stuff
going on with your apartment.

601
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,570
How is that going?

602
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,330
Actually, it's more serious
than they thought.

603
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,330
But they're working on it.

604
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,140
Come on. Who's gonna wear that?

605
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,040
I got the same one in purple.

606
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,400
Christina!

607
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,090
I think it's going really well.

608
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,860
Oh, Mother of God. Pull up
your own nail boots next time.

609
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,070
Perfect.

610
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,410
The show is perfect.

611
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,140
Thank you.

612
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,560
I give you a dress to say thank you.

613
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,970
Your body will destroy the line.

614
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,900
I give you this instead.

615
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,910
Thank you.

616
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,490
Thank you.

617
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,820
Mine. Ow!

618
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,580
Oh, that hurts so good.

619
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,380
-Do you want to get a drink?
-Let's go.

620
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,950
I am this close to throwing a tantrum.

621
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,630
Why is spandex such a glamour don't?

622
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,510
It's the perfect fabric.
You can dress it up. You can dress it down.

623
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,250
Right? You put on a red belt,

624
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,970
some chunky jewelry, you're going out.

625
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,840
-What do you think about stirrup pants?
-You first.

626
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,790
-I love 'em.
-I know. Me, too. I love 'em.

627
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,780
I can't help it.

628
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,830
-You are so busted.
-What?

629
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,710
You're having a good time
with me. You like me.

630
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,650
Fine. I like you.

631
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,950
It's just... this thing with my father...

632
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,110
Look... maybe we could set
some ground rules.

633
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,750
Okay, I'm listening.

634
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,230
Ignacio and I could sit
a little further apart

635
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,590
during movie night,

636
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,160
and keep the P.D.A. to a minimum.

637
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,510
Oh, I don't know. It is kind of sweet..
you guys makingon each other...

638
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,690
Maybe you could go
to your place once in a while.

639
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,400
Done.

640
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,030
That model with the spikes is
a wee bit steady on her feet.

641
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,290
I think there might be an impaling.

642
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,100
I think I finally get it.

643
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,950
Fashion is art.

644
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,510
It's just another way
of taking what's on the inside

645
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,540
and putting it out there
for everyone else to experience it.

646
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,860
It's not shallow. It's courageous.

647
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,720
It's... it's beautiful.

648
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,600
Are you okay? Did you cut yourself
on a dress again?

649
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,300
No, no, no, no.
Well, no, not--not that. I just...

650
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,260
Are you going into labor?

651
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,490
Well, not exactly. I've..I've
sort of been in labor all day.

652
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,370
-What?!
-No, but I didn't want to go to the hospital

653
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,300
until the contractions got
a little bit closer together...

654
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,370
-Which is about now. Ooh! Ooh!
-Well, come on. Let's get you out of here.

655
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,840
Shoot!

656
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,410
The iron curtain is
blocking the back two exits.

657
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,280
Heinrich, I'm sorry.

658
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,550
Christina, let's go.

659
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,670
Oh, no, no, no, no, Betty.
Not the runway.

660
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,310
-Yes, the runway.
-I don't want to spoil the show.

661
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,350
We don't have any other option.

662
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,740
Oh, it is more pain than I could
ever dream of. It is perfect!

663
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,020
Excuse me. Here, just take my hand.

664
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,500
Now watch out
for the broken glass.

665
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,010
Just keep breathing.
Breathe. Breathe.

666
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,420
Daniel, call an ambulance!

667
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,470
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you a doctor.

668
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,300
Uh-huh. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Good. Good. No.Oh, no, Christina.

669
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,250
Go ahead. You go
without me. I'll be okay.

670
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,740
What are you talking about?

671
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,930
I have no idea.
I'm delirious.

672
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,310
But I think I'm gonna have
the baby here!

673
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,730
What?

674
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,170
Apparently, the back exits are blocked,

675
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,150
which is why betty and christina
decided to ruin the show.

676
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,940
Yes, I'll hold. Yeah, uh,
paramedics said with the crowds

677
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,670
and street closures it could
be tough to get through,

678
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,370
but I'm checking on a helicopter
right now. Yes. Daniel Meade.

679
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,630
So Christina can't get out,
and they can't come in.

680
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,550
It's a fashion disaster.

681
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,840
Or it could be an opportunity

682
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,800
for me to claw my way
back to the top.

683
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,330
People, she needs her privacy.

684
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,570
Models, come forward.

685
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,150
Let's go.

686
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,950
Now raise your wings.

687
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,640
This isn't quite
how I pictured it happening.

688
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,560
Um, could the models
please turn around?

689
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,200
Is there anyone here
qualified to deliver a baby?

690
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,980
My father's girlfriend is a nurse!

691
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,070
You called me his girlfriend.

692
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,630
-Yeah, I'm growing.
-Chop! Chop! Let's go!

693
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,530
Who's the pregnant lady wearing?

694
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,480
Herself. She's wearing herself..Christina Mckinney.

695
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,640
Yay! That was Isaac Mizrahi!

696
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,390
-You're gonna get really excited later.
-Yes.

697
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,120
Stand by, lights. Cue music.

698
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,790
This is Suzuki st. Pierre,
live from the "Mode" show,

699
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,000
where the child of Wilhelmina Slater
and the late Bradford Meade

700
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,900
is about to make
its first runway appearance.

701
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,720
With any luck, Wilhelmina's chromosomes

702
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,690
will drown bradford's in the gene pool,
and we'll end up with a looker.

703
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,770
I wish she would quit doing that.

704
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,470
I am not crying. I am..

705
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,130
Damn it. It's dan rather all over again.

706
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,180
Go, lights. Go, music.
Cue the hydraulic lift.

707
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,030
Cue the land mines.

708
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,930
Matt, hey.
What are you doing here?

709
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,390
Well, I-I wanted to see what
you did with the show, and wow.

710
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,630
And a live birth.

711
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,420
Heinrich gave you nothing,
and you made it amazing.

712
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,420
I mean, you were the one
who told me to dig deeper,

713
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,970
find my connection.

714
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,590
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

715
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,110
-For what?
-I don't know.

716
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,000
It's just an impulse I have
whenever someone says "thank you."

717
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,580
So, Matt, uh, we're gonna be
partners this year.

718
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,810
I get to learn all about sports,

719
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,860
and now that the fashion show is done,
I'll have time to show you

720
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,700
all the things you wanted
to learn about fashion.

721
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,830
To be honest, I wasn't really that interested
in learning about fashion.

722
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,540
I was more interested
in learning about you.

723
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:03,510
So... I will see you at Y.E.T.I.. partner.

724
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,710
It would have been so much better
if I had left before I did that.

725
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,050
So... what's it feel like
to have a half brother?

726
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,410
It's good.

727
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,090
Weird. It makes me miss my dad.

728
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:36,980
Yeah.

729
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,290
I didn't get a chance
to tell you. You put on quite a show

730
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,520
You found a way to make
unwearable clothes beautiful.

731
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,180
Oh, stop.

732
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,080
I learned from the best.

733
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,540
Seriously, you have this way
of connecting with people.

734
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,440
Like, you get beneath the surface.

735
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,870
You don't find that in this business.

736
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,530
I know it's not
what you want to be doing,

737
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,620
but I think you'd make
a great editor at "Mode"... someday.

738
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,030
Well, thank you for the compliment.

739
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,700
I'm just kind of embarrassed
it took me so long to figure it out.

740
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,210
Fashion has a lot more substance
than I thought.

741
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,540
-I'm certainly glad you think so.
-Me, too.

742
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,340
Of course... if you ever decide
to have a career in fashion,

743
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,460
we have to talk about
all the colors and patterns.

744
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,080
If I decide to have a career in fashion,

745
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,480
then I get to decide what looks good.

746
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,700
And if you don't watch it,
I'l make you wear Heinrich's hat.
