1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,690
What do you two think you are, a pair of queens?

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,360
Well, I'm king around here, so don't forget it!

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,430
Oh, my gosh! I'm sorry. are you guys okay?

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,960
That was so great!

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh, Justin! Your Stanley is perfect. Oh!

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,810
Betty, I'm not sure.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,810
You may have put the "blah" in Blanche.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,860
Well, you didn't exactly put the "stellar" in Stella.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,640
Ooh, mean!

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,680
You are so getting into Lena Korvavinky's class!

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,940
I can feel it.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,550
It's Lena Korvinka. How do you not know that?

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,510
She is only the most famous

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,610
living actress of our time.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,640
I think it is so cool

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,410
that you get to audition for her.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,200
- Her classes are legendary.  - I know!

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,300
She's probably seen it all.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,730
I wonder if "a streetcar named desire"

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,460
is a little too obvious.

21
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,970
I may need to rethink this.

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,940
I'm so nervous for him. I hope he gets this.

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,160
I know. High school hasn't exactly

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,800
been a picnic for him.

25
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,390
Mm. That's why Bobby and I are gonna wait

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,620
until this whole thing is over

27
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,380
until we tell him about...

28
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,660
The baby.

29
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,130
Wait. You guys are gonna tell him together?

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,950
- That sounds promising.  - I know!

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
Okay, I'm ready to go.

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,280
Wait. wait, you guys are leaving already?

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,200
I thought that maybe you could stay, hang out,

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,300
And we could have dinner or something.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh, I'm sorry. I made dinner plans with Bobby.

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah. and I have to decide on my comedic monologue.

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,370
It's between Mauriat and one of Brad's

38
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,560
breakdowns from "the Rachel Zoe Project."

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,020
Well, that's too bad 'cause I made too much pasta,

40
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,260
And I was hoping you guys

41
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
would help me eat the leftovers.

42
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,370
- Sorry, a.b.  - All right.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,940
Well, I guess I'm just used to

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,770
making enough for me and Matt.

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,850
Aw, you want me to cancel? I'll call Bobby.

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,310
No, no. Come on, don't be silly. Go!

47
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,590
It's not like I have nothing to do.

48
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,260
It's gonna be another cold one tomorrow,

49
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,850
so bundle up and watch out for the ice.

50
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,000
In other news, a woman in midtown was found dead

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,590
in her apartment yesterday after almost a month.

52
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,030
Sources say that

53
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,870
though the woman lived in the building for 12 years,

54
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,190
none of her more than 50 neighbors

55
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,420
really knew her or noticed her absence.

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,990
I saw her through the window once,

57
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,460
eating her pasta alone. Looked like she made too much.

58
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,690
How sad.

59
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,670
I guess the old saying is true--

60
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,600
You really can be alone in a crowd.

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,340
Hey, guys! I was just thinking, wouldn't it be fun

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,330
if the three of us walked to work together someday?

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,500
I mean, seeing as we do live

64
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,110
across the hall from each other and everything.

65
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,700
We live across the hall from each other?

66
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,560
Yeah. when I say, "don't go in the hall. It's there,"

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,030
That's what I mean.

68
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,030
Okay, so we're doing the mean thing.

69
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,190
I just think that it's weird

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,650
that I don't know anyone else in the building.

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,750
I mean, do either one of you

72
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,950
ever talk to anybody else?

73
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,580
Not directly, but we do leave nasty notes

74
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,240
on the bulletin board downstairs for some of them.

75
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,120
Synonymously, of course.

76
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
See, here's the problem

77
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,350
with living in an apartment complex.

78
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,820
People come home, they close their doors,

79
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,720
they shut out the rest of the world,

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,400
and no one takes any time

81
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,120
to even get to know their neighbors.

82
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,210
You should really do something about that, Betty.

83
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,380
You know what? I'm going to.

84
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,250
She's a real go-getter, isn't she?

85
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,650
If only she'd apply

86
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,580
some of that pluck to her chin hair.

87
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,100
- See you later.  - Good one.

88
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,110
Thank you.

89
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,110
Oh, and could you also make up some more media kits

90
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,730
when you get a chance?

91
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,860
I'm gonna need Marc for the rest of the day

92
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,820
to help organize the wild vest shoot. Marc.

93
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. wait a second.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
I can't spare Marc today.

95
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,340
Daniel, I am working

96
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,630
as both editor-in-chief and creative director.

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Until we hire a senior fashion editor,

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,190
I have to have Marc available to me. Marc.

99
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,360
Marc, stay. Look, I'm sorry you're so overwhelmed,

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,650
- but I need him, too. - To what, schedule your naps?

101
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,960
You know what? I've had just about enough out of you.

102
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,290
I've been more than kind in sharing Marc with you

103
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,250
Over the past few weeks, but that's it.

104
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,080
He is off-limits to you.

105
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,940
What? You can't cut me off from my own assistant.

106
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,590
He's not your assistant anymore. He's mine.

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,400
Let me get one thing through

108
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,320
that giant egg head of yours.

109
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,240
I will get Marc back. this is not over.

110
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,500
Hi! I'm Betty.

111
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,710
I just moved back into the building,

112
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,000
And I was wondering if maybe you--

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,490
Not interested.

114
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,080
Hi. Wanna come to a karaoke party in 5-g?

115
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,040
"I will hunt you down, 'o' magazine stealer."

116
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,100
"Stop letting your dog pee in the hallway, jackass."

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,260
That's not very nice.

118
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,910
Hey! Hey, could you let us in?

119
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,010
- Thank you so much!  - Thank you so much.

120
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,390
We were about to freeze out there.

121
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,220
Yeah, it looks like you were turning blue.

122
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,610
Oh, yeah.

123
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,880
Do you guys live in the building?

124
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,980
We're moving in today.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,190
Yeah, in all the craziness,

126
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,380
we managed to lock ourselves out.

127
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,100
Oh! that's awful. Oh, I'm Betty, by the way.

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,340
Hi. Hey. I'm Gus, and--and that's Vickie.

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,970
You know what? I just so happen to be throwing

130
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,770
a neighborly karaoke party

131
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,500
in my apartment tomorrow night.

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,000
Come. You don't have to sing if you don't want to.

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,390
I mean, I will, but...

134
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,370
My god, how nice! Thank you!

135
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,020
- Yeah! Great! See you tomorrow.  - Okay, bye.

136
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,240
I wanna kill myself.

137
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,930
Wilhelmina and Daniel will not stop fighting over me.

138
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,200
This "menage a moi" has got to stop.

139
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,540
I hate being in the middle.

140
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,470
I mean, unless there's a Gyllenhaal involved.

141
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,190
Oh, this totally reminds of me

142
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,580
of when I was 12 and my parents separated.

143
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,390
I got so good at manipulating them.

144
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,410
They even bought me a chimp. I named him rainbow.

145
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,240
Ohh, that's so cute.

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,230
But then I got bored of him and left him in a cab.

147
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,130
Not as cute.

148
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,070
Oh, I just can't take much more of this bickering.

149
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,630
Aww, you poor little gay-bee.

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,750
You know, as the child of an almost-broken home,

151
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,650
I totally know how you feel.

152
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,260
I just got an amaze-balls idea.

153
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,170
Why don't you let me work

154
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,400
some of my manipulative magic

155
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,060
On mommy and daddy "mode"?

156
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,800
Actually, you know what? Go ahead.

157
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,870
But I can't hear about anything

158
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,820
or be involved in any way.

159
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,870
Besides, I already have my own plan in motion

160
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,310
for how to get myself out of this mess.

161
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,400
- What is it?  - It's top secret

162
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,480
Don't screw up whatever you're gonna do, okay?

163
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,370
Excuse me. What happened?

164
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,060
Our building got broken into.

165
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,180
A whole bunch of the apartments were robbed.

166
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
Look, they even stole our planter.

167
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,130
- Oh, no!  - Oh, yeah.

168
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,700
But a neighbor saw what was happening,

169
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,090
So he called the police,

170
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,060
and now they're scanning through security footage

171
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,970
so see if they can find a positive i.d.

172
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,770
Oh, good.

173
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,820
That's them!

174
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,960
They're the ones I saw running off with our planter.

175
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,530
Hey, who's the dink letting 'em in?

176
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,420
Wait a minute.

177
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,240
You're the dink!

178
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,350
I mean, how was I supposed to know

179
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,520
that they were burglars?

180
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,170
Oh, it's always the fresh-faced ones that get ya.

181
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,550
All I can say is,

182
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,920
it's a good thing

183
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,830
they didn't get as high as our floor.

184
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,570
they did.

185
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,120
Amanda didn't tell you? they stole her silver bag.

186
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,970
You mean the silver bag with the huge gold skull

187
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,090
- That's either hideous or brilliant?  - Yeah.

188
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,400
I told her I would buy her a new one, but...

189
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,220
He runs so funny.

190
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,500
I feel awful. I just wish there was a way

191
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,710
I could make it up to the building.

192
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,990
All of my neighbors hate me now.

193
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,880
Someone actually wrote the word "die"

194
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,900
in huge letters across the party invitation I posted.

195
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,620
You do the red-lining on these

196
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,370
since you have the assistant.

197
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,580
Wow. it's been a real joy

198
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,810
to have her back in the office.

199
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,140
Is there anything I can do to help?

200
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,450
Yeah, you can get me

201
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,330
one of those electric dog fences for the doorway--

202
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,590
Something that will shock Wilhelmina

203
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,770
every time she comes in.

204
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,890
Daniel, I don't think that would even work on her.

205
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,670
But it might work in my building.

206
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,720
After careful thought,

207
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,660
I've decided to use

208
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,580
the classic "parent trap" technique

209
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,680
with Daniel and Wilhelmina.

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
Uh, great. Fine. Whatever.

211
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,300
Listen, remember yesterday

212
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,720
when you borrowed my laptop,

213
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,330
And before you left you put it into your silver bag?

214
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,450
The one you said was hideous?

215
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,030
Or brilliant.

216
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,760
You took my laptop out of the bag

217
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,150
Before it got stolen, right?

218
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,220
Please, please, please, please, please

219
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,470
- Please tell me that you did. - Okay, I did.

220
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,480
Oh! Thank God. Where is it?

221
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,370
- What? - My laptop.

222
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,930
Is this a trick question?

223
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,090
Oh, my god! Oh, god.

224
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,720
This is a disaster. My entire life was on that computer.

225
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,650
Marc, I know you're upset,

226
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,490
But it's not like "Hot Guys of the Israeli Army"

227
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,790
Can't be downloaded again.

228
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,650
I'm not talking about "oy, the boys."

229
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,080
There's stuff on that computer that is the key to my future,

230
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,440
And now it is gone... Forever.

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,780
I'm going to be sick.

232
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Okay, Marc, don't worry. I got you covered.

233
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,160
This Wilhelmina and Daniel thing is in the bag.

234
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm sorry. I...

235
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,680
Ay, Justin!

236
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,710
I wanna be supportive, but the pacing has to stop.

237
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,910
Okay, I'll just go upstairs.

238
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,100
Hey, I got us some scary movies.

239
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,660
The lady at the rental place said they were "campy fun."

240
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,580
I can't, grandpa.

241
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,070
No one likes campy fun as much as I do,

242
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,470
But I'm a little wound up right now.

243
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,420
Maybe I'll feel better

244
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,920
After my run-through at the audition space tonight.

245
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,840
Need a ride? I could take you.

246
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,570
Bobby and I already got it covered.

247
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,280
Fine.

248
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,010
Okay, this has to stop.

249
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,770
- What are you talking about? - You. This.

250
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,480
The way you act every time Bobby's name comes up.

251
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,330
Come on, I thought maybe you could come with me

252
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,590
To the doctor's appointment on Thursday...

253
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,770
See your new grandkid.

254
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,920
Is he gonna be there?

255
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,810
If by "he" you mean Bobby--

256
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,880
Yeah, the father of my child is gonna be there.

257
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,660
He wants to be there every step of the way.

258
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,250
You're deceiving yourself, mija.

259
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,020
Can't you see that this Bobby character Is not reliable?

260
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,980
You're wrong.

261
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,550
Bobby and I are gonna be a family.

262
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,740
So... you better get used to it.

263
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,970
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

264
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,120
Not as big a turnout as I hoped.

265
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,050
But one, two, three, four of us--that's not bad, right?

266
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,730
Oh, don't count me. I'm just gettin' my mail.

267
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,940
Okay.

268
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,350
So... after yesterday's unfortunate incident,

269
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,880
Which I feel partially responsible for--

270
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,860
Partially? It was your fault.

271
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,430
Okay, I mean, I didn't rob the building myself.

272
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,410
I made an innocent mistake.

273
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,830
Anyway, I spoke to our landlord--Mr. Z.--

274
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,490
And arranged for him to install

275
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,390
An electronic locking device on our doors.

276
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,890
See?

277
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,930
Now none of us will ever have to

278
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,700
Worry about "lost keys" again

279
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,300
Because we'll have the option of using a pass code,

280
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,910
Which I will now choose based

281
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,660
On your thoughtful suggestions.

282
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,690
The new building pass code

283
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,680
Is... "fart."

284
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,790
Okay.

285
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,340
I guess I'll just pick another one.

286
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,360
- Why?  - What's wrong with "fart"?

287
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,330
First you get us robbed

288
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,350
And now you won't even take our suggestions?

289
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,720
Fine.

290
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,450
The building has spoken.

291
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,880
I will have Mr. Z. notify everyone

292
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,070
That the new building pass code is "fart."

293
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,480
Okay, now...

294
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,840
For the cutting of the ribbon.

295
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,070
Marc!

296
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,570
You just ruined my ribbon!

297
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah? Well, you ruined my life, so... I guess we're even.

298
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,700
What are you talking about?

299
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,640
My laptop was in Amanda's silver bag.

300
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

301
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,820
I can call H.R. Maybe insurance will cover it.

302
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,690
Really? Will they also cover my lost submission material

303
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,610
For the new senior fashion editor's job?

304
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,160
Huh?! Will they?!

305
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,970
Wow. You were applying for that?

306
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,840
That's... ambitious.

307
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,060
Yeah, Betty. Newsflash--

308
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,600
You're not the only one with hopes and dreams.

309
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,070
So, uh, Marc went home sick, huh?

310
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,960
Mm-hmm. 'cause he has looked pretty tired lately.

311
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,950
Totally. So it looks like all you have left

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,540
- Is your 6:15 in the lounge. - Oh, great.

313
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,550
Oops. Strike that.

314
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,680
Forget I ever said anything or she'll kill me.

315
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,510
- What? who will kill you? - Wilhelmina.

316
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,380
I wasn't supposed to tell you about that meeting.

317
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,860
She said something about wanting to take it alone.

318
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,380
- She did, did she? - Yeah.

319
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,500
Well, I guess she's in for a very big surprise.

320
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,140
Marc went home sick?

321
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,170
He'd never have the nerve to do that on my watch.

322
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,990
Why are you still here?

323
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh! uh, Marc left your schedule with me.

324
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,850
I thought you might wanna go over it.

325
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,710
- No. - No?

326
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,690
Um, because you do have an appointment--

327
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,670
Go.

328
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,690
But, uh, don't you want me to tell you about

329
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,540
The 6:15 meeting that dad--

330
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,940
I mean, Daniel is running?

331
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,100
Did you just refer to Daniel as "dad"?

332
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,470
No, mom. I mean, Wilhel-mommy.

333
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,560
I mean, Daniel set up a meeting

334
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,430
That he doesn't want you to know about in the lounge.

335
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,530
Look, I don't know what kind of kinky relationship

336
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,080
You and Daniel have,

337
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,320
But "daddy" is not keeping me from any meeting.

338
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,490
I am so getting another chimp out of this.

339
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,880
Come on, Marc!

340
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,230
I'm not gonna leave till you open the door!

341
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,270
Talk fast.

342
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm in the middle of anger eating a 7-cheese lasagna.

343
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,690
I just want to apologize.

344
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,220
I think it's great

345
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,140
That you're applying for the senior editor position.

346
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,440
So you don't think it's out of my league?

347
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,230
I think it's a big step up,

348
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,130
But you're perfect for it.

349
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,530
Of course I am. But it doesn't matter.

350
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,620
Wilhelmina's gonna make a decision by tomorrow.

351
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,010
So all of the submission materials

352
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,230
Have to be on her desk by tonight.

353
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,720
And there is no way that I can recreate everything that I did

354
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,480
By myself by midnight.

355
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,050
- What--what--what if I helped you? - Forget it, Betty.

356
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,450
Yeah, let me do this.

357
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,660
Please. I would feel so awful

358
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,540
If you missed this opportunity because of me.

359
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,180
What do you have to lose?

360
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,920
- Can I have a piece of lasagna? - No.

361
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,690
I should've known you'd try and pull a stunt like this.

362
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,380
Well, I'm not the one booking secret meetings

363
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,360
And trying to get away with it, am i?

364
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Yes, you are. That's why I'm here.

365
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,280
What the hell are you talking about?

366
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,560
Wait.

367
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,800
If neither of us booked this meeting, who is this?

368
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,710
I'm your couples counselor.

369
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,460
And by the looks of it, I have my work cut out for me.

370
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,660
Couples counselor, is this some kinda joke?

371
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,900
Who would do this?

372
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,530
Oh, as if you didn't know, daddy-o.

373
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,680
This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.

374
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,250
Well, I've clearly identified the beta dog

375
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,480
In this relationship.

376
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,840
I hope for your sake

377
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,420
You didn't just use the words "dog" or "beta"

378
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,580
In relation to me.

379
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,040
Sorry. I was merely referencing

380
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,310
A common behavioral pattern.

381
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,000
The first person to leave a room

382
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,350
Tends to be the weaker one.

383
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,110
Is that so?

384
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,690
Yes, I found my fancy paper.

385
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,800
"Matt-less in Manhattan"?

386
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,440
You're not seriously thinking of using that

387
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,640
As a title for something, are you?

388
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,480
It's for my blog. I forgot it was up on the screen.

389
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,770
How do you want to do this?

390
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,260
You wanna dictate while I type?

391
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,180
I don't know.

392
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,180
I had all these mock-ups and customized layouts.

393
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,140
And it took me weeks to make all the decisions.

394
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,240
This is never gonna be as good.

395
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Yes, it will be, marc. you're great.

396
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,840
I have to be more than great.

397
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,570
This is a senior position. I have to wow them.

398
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,500
Okay, well, then we'll wow them.

399
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,120
got all night, and neither of us have anything else to do.

400
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,550
Hi. we're here for your party.

401
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,420
I assumed no one was coming

402
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,020
After the whole burglary thing.

403
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
What? so you don't want us here?

404
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,430
No, i--yes, i-i do.

405
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,060
I d--i did. it's just...

406
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,590
This last-minute project thing sort of came up,

407
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
And I'm a little-- what's going on?

408
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,130
She's canceling on us. what? now?

409
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,280
After everything she's put us through? she owes us.

410
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Mm-hmm. see, this is why

411
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,340
You should never get to know your neighbors.

412
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,960
And even though I spent years working my way to the top

413
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,610
While daniel here had the same job

414
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,640
Handed to him on a silver platter by his father,

415
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,040
- I've always treated him with respect. - that is such bull.

416
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,470
You've always been a bitch to me,

417
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,100
Only now she's being a super bitch. it's unbeliev--

418
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,080
You see what I have to deal with?

419
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,370
It's the name-calling

420
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,260
- That hurts the most. - okay, time-out.

421
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,120
She is totally faking right now. this is not her.

422
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,220
And p.s., she calls me names all the time.

423
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,440
This morning, she called me an egg head.

424
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,910
I was merely making an observation.

425
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,320
Can I help it if your head has a weird elliptical arc to it?

426
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,630
Do you see this? she's insulting me,

427
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,610
All because I wouldn't let her get way with marc.

428
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,220
As if you could ever keep me from having my way!

429
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,040
Oh, get over yourself already! come on.

430
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,070
I guess we're done here.

431
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,550
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

432
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,650
On the contrary. this has been very enlightening.

433
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,080
And I think I may have pinpointed

434
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,830
The source of your issue.

435
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,050
Sexual tension.

436
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,110
Uh... look, I'm sorry.

437
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,500
Wilhelmina is the last person I would ever be interested in.

438
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,250
Well, her body language would suggest

439
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,730
That she just might be interested in you.

440
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,910
Wait. her what seemed to suggest...

441
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,710
Please have a seat.

442
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,870
There are many nonverbal signals

443
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
To indicate desire.

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,760
For example, when someone steps into your space

445
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,270
And refuses to relinquish it,

446
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,350
Or if there is mirroring of speech or movement.

447
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,270
In the animal kingdom,

448
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,090
It can be as simple as a female presenting her backside.

449
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,660
My advice--if you want to stop the hostility,

450
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,920
You've got to find a way to diffuse the sexual tension.

451
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,060
- It's fine, betty. get over to your party. - I will in a minute.

452
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,010
oh! what about this image? it looks kind of flow-y.

453
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,920
Oh, my god! I just had a brilliant idea!

454
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,080
What if we layer real material over the images

455
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,350
To create a-a kind of 3-dimensional work of art?

456
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,140
Yeah, go with that. I'll be right back.

457
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,660
Sorry! sorry, everybody! I'm sorry!

458
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,550
We just have to try and keep the music low

459
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,800
- For a little bit longer. - spoilsport.

460
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,310
This sucks. betty, I am working my ass off here.

461
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,830
Please don't take away my music.

462
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,230
we'll be left with conversation,

463
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,650
And that is not gonna work with this house of trolls.

464
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,850
That helps. frank, you know mrs. varner, right?

465
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,700
I mean, have you two ever spoken?

466
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,420
You have so much in common.

467
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,920
You live in 2-c, and she lives in 3-c.

468
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,560
So you're above me? yeah.

469
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,340
-What do you wear, wooden shoes?  - I can hear you pee.

470
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,770
- great, we're talking. I'll be back. - no, don't go, betty.

471
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,010
Betty. I gotta drop these off. I'll be back in two seconds.

472
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,810
You don't have to. I finished.

473
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,090
What? wow. that's incredible.

474
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,580
I know, I'm a genius. now I just have to get it

475
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,800
Packed up and over there before the deadline.

476
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,400
Gee, I wonder what I'm gonna put it in.

477
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
If only I had that brilliant skull bag...

478
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,460
All right, let's not live in the past. just go! go!

479
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,430
And good luck. betty...

480
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,270
You know that I'm not one to get all gushy...

481
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,560
Oh, thank god you're here.

482
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,790
I'm running out of body parts to entertain people with.

483
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,740
Hey, can we turn on the music yet?

484
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,360
I can do better than that.

485
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,470
I can hook up the karaoke machine!

486
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,790
We're gonna party tonight!

487
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,360
That's right!

488
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,670
Wilhelmina.

489
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,350
I didn't, uh, realize you were still here.

490
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,280
Well, I am.

491
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,760
Can we be done with the small talk now?

492
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,220
Wait. she just folded her arms.

493
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,360
Is she mirroring me?

494
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,940
Ugh. damn it! what is this?

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,900
Oh, my god.

496
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,570
She's presenting.

497
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,430
Was that guy right?

498
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,760
This is ridiculous!

499
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,510
Whoo! all right!

500
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,360
Let's get this party started!

501
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,320
It's so horrible, but I can't look away.

502
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,880
Like a moth to a flame, burned by desire.

503
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,090
She's baring her teeth.

504
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,430
She totally wants to jump my bones.

505
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,080
Did I blow a fuse?

506
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,020
No, no!

507
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,170
I think you blew more than a fuse.

508
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,860
Oh, my god.

509
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,140
Betty's voice brought darkness to the land.

510
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,040
- is that you, amanda? - sorry, I thought that was my butt.

511
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,550
You know what's cool about blackouts?

512
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,120
They sort of bring everyone together.

513
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,760
Wait. where's everyone going?

514
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,760
Oh, uh, me and a bunch of neighbors

515
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,240
Are throwing a blackout party.

516
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,050
You don't mind if I take those, do you?

517
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,060
Well, why don't you guys just stay here?

518
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,110
No offense, betty, but your place is really dark.

519
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,490
it's a blackout.

520
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,990
It's dark everywhere.

521
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,720
Yeah, okay.

522
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,460
Outta my way, you freaks. I can't get out.

523
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
Yeah, well, apparently, none of us can

524
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,300
cause mr. fremont just said we're trapped in the building.

525
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,570
Oh, my god. the door.

526
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,690
Why, betty?

527
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,260
Why today of all days did you have to have

528
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,560
An electrical lock installed on our front door?

529
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,750
I had no idea something like this could happen.

531
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,080
It's like I'm destined for failure.

532
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,480
I just have to accept the fact

533
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,100
That I'm gonna be an assistant for the rest of my life.

534
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,170
Oh, come on, marc. don't talk like that.

535
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,630
Look...  wilhelmina has to make a concession.

536
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,650
It's a blackout!

537
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,800
No, she doesn't.

538
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,550
She loves working during natural disasters.

539
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,680
She's probably there

540
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,320
Going through submissions right now.

541
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,060
Remember the blizzard of 2003?

542
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,980
She closed an entire issue by herself.

543
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,560
We could take the fire escape.

544
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,430
It's pitch-black out there, betty,

545
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,600
And everything's covered in ice.

546
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,710
I will slip. I will break something.

547
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,020
I have the bones of a sparrow. Oh, forget it.

548
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,540
Oh, it's no use.

549
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,550
Well, I think if we put our minds together,

550
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,830
We could come up with a solution.

551
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,700
Just give it up, Betty.

552
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,160
You've done enough.

553
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,990
Hey! What's your problem?!

554
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
Really?

555
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,140
All right, thank you.

556
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,120
Apparently, there is a citywide blackout.

557
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,860
The maintenance guy said, uh,

558
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,500
We may be here a while, so...

559
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,640
I guess we should just sit tight, huh?

560
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,200
Only you would consider "Sitting tight" A plan.

561
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,070
A real man would find us a way

562
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,960
to get out of this damn thing.

563
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,380
I am a real man, okay?

564
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,730
Please.

565
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be.

566
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,140
Oh, yeah?

567
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,450
Yeah.

568
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,880
What the hell was that?

569
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,730
That was me

570
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,510
Trying to diffuse the sexual tension between us.

571
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,820
The what?

572
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,990
Oh, come on, Willie.

573
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,490
We both know the reason you're so hostile with me

574
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,960
Is that you secretly want me.

575
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,340
Now that that's out on the table,

576
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,620
Maybe you and I can handle this like two adults.

577
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,870
Can I put my head down yet?

578
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,780
No. I told you, you have to wait ten minutes.

579
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,530
The way you're acting,

580
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,370
You'd think that I was the one that attacked you.

581
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,780
Yeah? I had every right to attack you.

582
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,280
I was protecting my home from an intruder.

583
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,190
Intruder? Come on.

584
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,690
I wasn't intruding.

585
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,520
I was coming to check on Justin and Hilda,

586
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,150
Make sure they were all right during the blackout.

587
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,290
Oh, yeah?

588
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,460
And why weren't you with them?

589
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,880
Hilda said you were going together to take justin

590
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,940
for his walk-through.

591
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,120
I got stuck at work.

592
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,990
Oh. I didn't know being a thug

593
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,520
required such dedicated hours.

594
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,560
Hey, come on, man. It's so hard to believe

595
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,150
That I'm not the same person I was at 17?

596
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,700
I love your daughter.

597
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,840
I plan on being around for her and the new baby

598
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,610
And justin, too.

599
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,810
Please.

600
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,450
You may have my daughter and grandson fooled

601
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,910
With this, uh, good-guy routine,

602
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,510
But you're not fooling me.

603
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,790
Not for nothing,

604
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,400
you know what I think, Mr. Suarez?

605
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,350
I think that you're secretly worried that I am a good guy,

606
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,860
Because if that's the case,

607
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,290
Then they won't depend on only you anymore,

608
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,370
And you can't handle that.

609
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,890
Excuse me. I'm gonna go wait in the other room.

610
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,890
Here. You have some blood.

611
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,750
I'd offer to dab it for you,

612
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,310
But I'm afraid you'd start licking my fingers.

613
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,980
Okay, you made your point.

614
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,180
I misread the signs.

615
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
But if it's not sexual tension,

616
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,470
Then why the hell have you been so mean to me lately?

617
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,610
It can't just be about marc.

618
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,930
Actually, it is.

619
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,510
As hard as it is for me to admit,

620
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,050
Marc is the most important man in my life.

621
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,520
Oh, come on. Is that the same load of crap

622
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
You were trying to sell the couples' counselor?

623
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,690
Look.

624
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,290
I know marc might not walk like a man or talk like a man

625
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,730
And his features are vaguely lesbian,

626
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,030
But the truth is, he's been my one constant over the years.

627
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,920
If I were on my deathbed,

628
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,680
He'd be the person I'd call.

629
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,980
Clearly, we can't keep pulling marc

630
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,210
Back and forth between us.

631
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,220
It's not fair to us or him.

632
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,890
We have to figure something out.

633
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,390
Fine.

634
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,860
I'll do anything as long as you don't touch me again.

635
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,310
So, marc...

636
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,010
I took another look at the fire escape,

637
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,850
And it really doesn't look so bad.

638
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,310
I have a ton of salt in my apartment.

639
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,120
And in your diet.

640
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,000
Look, I understand that you're angry,

641
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,080
But I think it would be helpful

642
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,680
If we just tried to be in the solution.

643
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,250
- Dad?  - Mija, thank god you answered.

644
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,850
I just got a text from your sister.

645
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,590
She and Justin are fine.

646
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,150
How are you?

647
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,070
I'm fine. It's just, we have to get out of the building,

648
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,070
and the stupid electric door won't open.

649
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,670
Sweetie, wh-wh-wh-what can I do?

650
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,460
Nothing.

651
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,260
Unless you know someone who can pick a lock.

652
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,500
Okay, chipmunk...

653
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,350
You got a-a-a red wire, a yellow wire and a green wire.

654
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,700
All right, move 'em all to the left.

655
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Okay.

656
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,930
I'm gonna try and be really careful and not let them touch,

657
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,770
But my hands are a little shaky, though.

658
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,290
Sweetie, this isn't the "mission impossible", Okay?

659
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,740
There's no electricity.

660
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,100
Right. I just want you to be able to see the cylinder.

661
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,630
I see it!

662
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,280
Good.

663
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,710
Now go ahead and stick the screwdriver in the cylinder

664
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,330
And turn it clockwise

665
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,140
Till you hear a little click.

666
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,370
All right. Now you're gonna go counterclockwise

667
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,230
Until the dead bolt slides open.

668
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,150
That's it. It worked! It works!

669
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,600
Of course it did.

670
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
What do you think, I'm an amateur?

671
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,640
I'm not a professional, neither.

672
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,100
Oh, bobby, I owe you so big.

673
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,110
What is your favorite cologne?

674
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,440
Because sometimes at work we get free samp--

675
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,860
I gotta go! Marc!

676
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,630
I gotta say, I still can't believe

677
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,700
That you broke us out of our own apartment building.

678
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,300
It was bold, Suarez,

679
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,240
Even for someone who sometimes wears socks with heels.

680
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,650
I just hope the neighbors aren't too mad at me.

681
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,330
I really felt like I was making progress with them tonight,

682
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,020
Until they all left to go to amanda's party.

683
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,600
Why do you care what they think?

684
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,340
I don't know.

685
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,500
I was just trying to make connections with people.

686
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,040
I've had a really hard year, you know?

687
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,280
My best friend left to scotland,

688
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,370
Matt left,

689
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,790
And I moved away from my family.

690
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,200
Sometimes, I feel like I get home

691
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,890
And I could close the door and die,

692
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,890
And no one would know until

693
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,860
they smelled my rotting corpse.

694
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,930
Ugh.

695
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,620
I guess you never feel lonely, huh?

696
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,210
No. My life is way too fabulous.

697
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,480
Is that meade?

698
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,630
It looks so weird all dark.

699
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,450
Oh, my god.

700
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,580
How could we be so stupid?

701
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,030
Meade is, like, electric everything!

702
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,110
We're never gonna be able to get in.

703
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,430
Once again, life has pooped on the head of marc st. James.

704
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,700
This--I've had it.

705
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,170
Wait! Where are you going?

706
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,060
We just made it all the way here!

707
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,730
No, no! I don't want to hear it!

708
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,280
The only reason that I tried to reach above my means

709
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,460
Is because of you, because I thought,

710
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,930
"What would betty do if she were in my position?"

711
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,790
She'd be all like...

712
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,880
"Oh, reach for the stars

713
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,390
And unicorns and lollipops and sunflowers!"

714
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,420
So why can't I?

715
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,780
Well... look at me! This is why!

716
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,850
I have had it up to here with your sunny optimism.

717
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,290
Yeah?! Well, I've had it up to here with your negativity!

718
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,730
All you ever do is complain. "I'm Marc st. James.

719
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,870
"Everything bad happens to me!"

720
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,930
"I never get what I want!"

721
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,770
"I am always the bun!"

722
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,720
Have you ever tried, just once,

723
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,950
to think happy thoughts?

724
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,880
Oh, please.

725
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,430
What do you want me to do, clap if I believe in fairies?

726
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,110
- Yeah, I want you to clap! - Fine!

727
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,510
- I believe in fairies, Betty! - We believe!

728
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,080
Come on out! Don't forget your fairy dust!

729
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,090
- That's good! - Thank you. Thank you very much.

730
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,500
- You're welcome. - Excellent.

731
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,130
Oh! Oh, great, great!

732
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,920
- Come on, then. - Yay!

733
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,890
Come on!

734
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,180
Here you go, Bobby.

735
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,980
It's not poison, I promise. It's scotch.

736
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,760
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

737
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,210
Thank you for helping Betty.

738
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,010
Uh, listen, uh...

739
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,820
I'm sorry I blew up at you before, you know?

740
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,010
I, uh, I was talking out of my ass.

741
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,430
- I didn't mean any of it. - Yes, you did.

742
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,860
And you were right.

743
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,650
I was?

744
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,660
Well, partially.

745
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm not totally convinced that you're not still a thug.

746
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,920
But these last few weeks,

747
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,490
I've seen how great you've been with Hilda and Justin.

748
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,170
And, um...

749
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,950
It was hard to see myself replaced.

750
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,220
I guess I, uh, got a little jealous.

751
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,080
What, of me?

752
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,710
Mm, yeah.

753
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,200
- I could never take your place. - I know.

754
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,400
I really messed you up, didn't I?

755
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,470
I'm just gonna be two seconds.

756
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,730
I want to grab something here from my desk.

757
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,430
¸øÂí¿Ë  ÎªÐÂ¹ÍÔ±Çì×£  ¶©ÏãéÄ¾ÆÓë»¨  Íþ×Ö

758
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,510
I'm sorry, Marc.

759
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,160
Well, we tried.

760
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,900
Oh! Did you see her head?!

761
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,110
Oh, man! It rolled right off. Disgusting!

762
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,850
- Hey, you're back! - How was the walk-through?

763
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,210
We never made it.

764
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,870
We were stuck in the subway all night.

765
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,100
Wait. You--you texted me you were fine.

766
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,930
Yeah, well, I'm not stupid.

767
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,520
It was pitch-black and terrifying.

768
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,990
Should I have texted you that?

769
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,220
I learned today that mom is not good

770
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,980
in high-pressure situations,

771
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,960
so she's not coming to my audition tomorrow.

772
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,940
Baby! What happened to your face?

773
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,910
Your father attacked me with a pie pan.

774
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,990
Hey, you got off easy.

775
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,260
You're lucky I didn't use my steel casserole dish.

776
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,770
Okay, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I am so confused.

777
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,300
Let--let me clear something up.

778
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,370
Um, I've been a stubborn old man,

779
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,470
and I-I-I'm sorry for the way I've been acting.

780
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,460
Anyway...

781
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,700
If that offer's still good for me to see my grandkid tomorrow, I...

782
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,370
I'd like to go--

783
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,410
That is, if Bobby doesn't mind.

784
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,460
- I'd like that. - All right.

785
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,340
I'd like that a lot.

786
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,130
Okay.

787
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,040
Good morning, Willie.

788
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,200
Uh, I got that stuff you wanted.

789
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,970
Where would you like me to put it?

790
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,430
Next to me is fine.

791
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,010
So did you and Daniel decide which of you

792
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,010
I'd be working for yet?

793
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,790
Yes. you'll be working for me...

794
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,790
as my newest fashion editor.

795
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,310
Great. I'm glad that you g--

796
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,060
Wait. Did you just say...

797
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,420
Congratulations.

798
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,700
So you had me order champagne and flowers for me?

799
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,480
Well, you didn't honestly think I'd do it myself, did you?

800
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,590
Of course not.

801
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,710
So I'm the new senior fashion editor?

802
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,060
You're kidding. You're not qualified for that job.

803
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,830
I decided I didn't need one.

804
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,570
I'm gonna use the money for our new junior fashion editor.

805
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,350
Willie, is this promotion

806
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,960
just so you could keep Daniel from winning me?

807
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,470
Don't be ridiculous.

808
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,190
You think I'd give you a promotion if you didn't deserve it?

809
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,030
Willie, thank you. Thank you so much.

810
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,160
- I'm not the emotional type. - Right.

811
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,580
But, uh, you can write yourself a nice note from me.

812
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,950
Thank you.

813
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,840
Excuse me.

814
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,750
Sorry. I've never had so many people

815
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,890
crammed in here at one time.

816
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,720
- Well, we're a tight-knit family. - I can see that.

817
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,890
Yeah, that's how we do it.

818
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,160
Hey. Wow, look at that.

819
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,170
Hey. Hey, that little dot, that--that's him?

820
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,340
Or her.

821
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,800
Is something wrong?

822
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,850
I'm not seeing a heartbeat.

823
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,510
Are you sure?

824
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,970
I'm very sorry.

825
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,490
Can I get you anything?

826
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,020
No.

827
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,320
I'm just thinking,

828
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,090
I'd finally got my head around this baby and...

829
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,730
how it was gonna fit into our little family.

830
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,960
And now we won't even be one.

831
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,190
Hey.

832
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,550
Hey.

833
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,430
Listen to me. Baby or no baby,

834
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,610
we're gonna be a family.

835
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,530
I am not going anywhere.

836
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,240
Okay?

837
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,210
We thought you might want something.

838
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,470
Tea and cookies.

839
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,140
Oh, my god! I just got off the phone with Lena Korvinka.

840
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,960
She loved my audition,

841
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,850
and wants to formally invite me to join her class.

842
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,090
Can you believe it?!

843
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,420
- Congratulations! - That's great! Hey!

844
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,640
Oh, my god! Oh, honey. I'm so proud of you.

845
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,970
Congratulations.

846
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,120
Hey.

847
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Hey.

848
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,640
I was in the hallway and I thought I smelled something,

849
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,480
so I just came over to make sure you weren't dead.

850
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,960
Nope. Still here.

851
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,350
Oh, hey, I heard about your promotion.

852
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,320
Congratulations.

853
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah. It's pretty crazy, right?

854
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,310
No, I don't think that's crazy.

855
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,780
Uh, anyway, Amanda's not here and, uh,

856
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,000
I was just hanging out by myself over there.

857
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,000
So I was thinking maybe if you wanted to,

858
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,110
we could watch tv and make fun of people's clothes.

859
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,310
You might learn something.

860
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,650
I mean, if you want to. We don't have to.

861
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,440
No, no! That would be fun.

862
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,990
Okay.

863
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,380
Are you hungry? I have some leftover pasta.

864
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,690
No.

865
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,820
No?

866
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,780
No. I hate pasta.
