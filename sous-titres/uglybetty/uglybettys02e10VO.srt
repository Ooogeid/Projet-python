1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,590
Previously on "ugly betty"... excuse us.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,910
(Betty) mr. Meade? (Man) there's no pulse.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,400
Is this bradford meade's body?

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,810
I have a proposition you might be interested in.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,520
Motion to terminate wilhelmina slater.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,590
All those in favor. (Daniel and alexis) aye.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,520
Did you come to clean out your office,wilhelmina?

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,630
No,daniel. I came to clean out yours.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,340
"Slater." We're currently setting up our offices,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,320
And there are still positions available.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,920
All right. What is this guy's name? I don't know. Something lame,like gio.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,140
Tell me who you're dating. Henry from accounting. There.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,570
More. He got a girl pregnant.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,610
Wow. You are being stupid.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,100
I know you're leaving in five months,

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,540
And i know that i'm gonna get my heart broken,

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,450
But maybe it's worth it.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,430
So let me get this straight.

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,310
Our father left a video for us.

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,500
(Alexis) is this a new will?

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,480
No,no. It's simply a personal message

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,820
He recorded for the both of you

23
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,430
A few weeks before he died.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,890
I'll wait outside. Thank you.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,870
He must've known he was sick.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,570
Well,we'll never know.

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,280
Alexis,daniel,  i'm sick.

28
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,750
Who knows how much time  i have left?

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,690
Well,obviously,  if you're watching this,

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,300
I didn't have a lot.

31
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,190
Hopefully,you gave me  a proper send-Off.

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,830
I thought it was nice. Shh.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I didn't reveal  who i wanted

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,300
To run meade publications  in my will,

35
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,840
Because i wanted to explain  my decision to you.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,290
Is this thing on?

37
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,530
(Sighs) typical.

38
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,860
Yeah. (Coughs)

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,100
Running a company  like this

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,970
Requires a specific type  of leadership.

41
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,270
You have to have confidence,

42
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,530
Be able to smell blood  in the water.

43
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,020
You need to possess  a killer instinct.

44
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,430
So after long consideration,  i choose--

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,570
(Betty) mr. Meade--

46
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh,i'm sorry.

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,230
I didn't realize  you were in the m--

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,730
Oh! Ah,whoopsy-Daisy.  Sorry.

49
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,360
Daniel sent me  to deliver this thing...  (coughing)

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,500
And your assistant  wasn't there. I'm sorry. Come on,betty.

51
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,740
It's fine. It's fine. Just  set the camera up and leave.  Okay. Yep,that's right.

52
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,720
<Font color="#4096d1">本做浠仅供瘰锇交狩，耧禁筱篾殪虻筱砭</font>

53
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,590
Uh,can i get you  anything else?

54
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,780
No.  Okay.

55
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,070
(Coughs) come on.

56
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,240
It is my desire that one  of you become the president

57
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,970
And chief fiduciary officer  of meade publications.

58
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,560
So i hope  you'll both understand

59
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,310
When i tell you

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,540
That i choose my d--

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,420
Is this thing even on?

62
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,580
Yes,it's on. It's on.

63
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,780
There you go.

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,110
Wait,what-- What happened?

65
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,000
Dad. Oh,learn to work stuff.

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
It's pretty clear he was going to say,"my daughter." No,it's not.

67
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,260
He was gonna say, "i choose my daniel."

68
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,150
"My daniel?" Who says that? He did all the time.

69
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,130
"My daniel this... my daniel that..."

70
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,400
Obviously we're not going to be settling this right now.

71
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,550
Tomorrow morning we're gonna talk to mom about the trial,

72
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,210
Maybe she'll have an opinion on this.

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,170
Fine. Until then, no one sits behind his desk.

74
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,920
Agreed.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,650
Tell me again why we're stealing your father's chair.

76
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,360
We're not stealing it. We're guarding it.

77
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,010
Until we figure out who runs meade,

78
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,270
No one sits in it.

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
But couldn't alexis just get another chair

80
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,130
And put that behind the desk and sit in that?

81
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,160
No--She--That's not... whose side on you on? Yours. I'll guard the chair.

82
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,350
The chair is life. The chair is everything.

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,770
Look,i can run meade just as well as alexis.

84
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,470
I can smell blood in the water.

85
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,670
You know, i'm a good leader. Of course you are,daniel.

86
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,980
There it is! I knew you took it!

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,690
Run,betty. Come on. Run. Hurry!

88
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,590
I'm going. I'm going. Out of my way. Excuse me.

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,270
Protect that chair! Keep it--

90
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,410
Sorry.

91
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,520
Would you grow up,daniel? Hey.

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,320
Get out of there. That's notyours. You know it is. You get out of there.

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,230
You get out. You get out.

94
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,310
Why are you so strong?

95
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,070
What,did they give you super strength

96
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,220
When they installed your vagina?

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,580
Guys,everyone is watching.

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,310
Now i'm happy to guard the chair

99
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,390
Until you talk to your mother and figure it out.

100
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,720
Just so you know,

101
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,470
They did give me super strength.

102
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,060
Betty,you heard my dad call me "my daniel," right?

103
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,520
Sure.

104
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,390
Oh,the children are cranky today.

105
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,460
Did you give them both a time-Out?

106
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,360
Exhausting.

107
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,770
Milady. Thank you.

108
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,540
And mi-Other-Lady. Oh,thank you. Hmm.

109
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,730
I have a big surprise for our date tomorrow night.

110
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,740
Wear socks...

111
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,410
'Cause they're gonna get knocked off.

112
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,440
Oh,a surprise!

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,180
Oh,the last surprise i got on a date

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,010
Was the wife knocking on the motel door.

115
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,430
I know. He's so sweet. Every single saturday night

116
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,110
We make an ice cream sundae bar and we watch old movies.

117
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,960
Well,i can't tempt you and henry to come out

118
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,900
With stuart and i to this movie premiere

119
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,900
For which i have passes. (Gasps)

120
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,780
"27 dresses." Shut up!

121
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,040
I so want to see this movie. I love romantic comedies.

122
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,640
And i love james marsden.

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,500
I want to bake him naked and eat him for dessert.

124
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,680
Okay,you and i have very different points of view

125
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,520
Of romantic comedy. Yeah.

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,430
But we couldn't go anyway.

127
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
Henry and i are trying to do things

128
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
That are just the two of us.

129
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,630
He's leaving in 17 weeks and 4 days.

130
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait. Isn't this a leap year?

131
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
(Gasps) 17 weeks and 5 days!

132
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,750
I have to go tell him, give him a kiss! Go on. Go on.

133
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,210
Wait!

134
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,870
No,no,no. This is all wrong.

135
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,770
You call this a cover,kiki?

136
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,540
The goal is to make me look five years younger

137
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,310
Than i say i am.

138
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,120
Be prepared to work through lunch.

139
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,540
Why aren't they working?

140
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,850
Willie,a word.

141
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,930
It's not that anyone minds being abused.

142
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,640
It's just that they thought--

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,510
And i don't know where they got this--

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,350
That they were being paid to be abused.

145
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,040
So this is about money? Well...

146
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,820
In my day,we worked hard, and we were lucky if we got...

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,220
(Raises voice) a cheese sandwich
and a cup of bad coffee.

148
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,600
You were a senator's daughter

149
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,030
And went to boarding school in paris.

150
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,300
(Normal voice) i've never realized

151
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,200
What tiny features you have.

152
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,600
Oh.

153
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,450
People,i heard there's some grumblings about money.

154
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,230
Well,this afternoon, i'm meeting with our investors,

155
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,110
And i'm absolutely certain we will have our funding.

156
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,670
Then,"slater"... will be a go.

157
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,730
You didn't order enough paper clips.

158
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,890
Calm down. You're hysterical.

159
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,860
You're practically screaming like a woman.

160
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,790
Why are you in charge of anything?

161
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,950
There's,like, a thousands sticks

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,310
Of glitter glue and no paper clips. You're gay,right?

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,420
Only when it comes to you.

164
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,830
I shouldn't have to ask the receptionist

165
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,790
For a paper clip.

166
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,370
Okay,slow down there, spanky.

167
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,740
You,my friend, are not the only one

168
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,810
Who needs paper clips.

169
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,150
What? Metallics are back in this year.

170
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,550
That is a misuse of company property.

171
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,160
And that... is a misuse of hair gel.

172
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,450
How much are you wearing?

173
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,680
That's it.

174
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,510
You just pissed off the pep.

175
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,690
(Whimpers) no!

176
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,820
I'm sorry,ma'am,

177
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,360
But this thing is not allowed in the building.

178
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,850
You can pick it up in the lobby on your way out.

179
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,570
Will you walk him?

180
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,630
(Chuckles) no.

181
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,200
No!

182
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,870
You guys are out of paper clips,

183
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,470
But there's a butt-Load of glitter glue.

184
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,480
I took some for my son.

185
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,870
(Lowers voice) did that guy just check out my ass?

186
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
How much does he make? Ugh,not enough to be worth it,

187
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,410
But hey,you're starting to notice

188
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,480
Guys check out your ass again. I can't even focus on guys right now.

189
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,410
I gotta focus on opening up my salon. Hilda,i said you could make a few color copies,

190
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,630
Not ransack the office supplies. No,no,no, they factor that in.

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
Believe me, if i didn't take these,

192
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,330
The books wouldn't line up at the end of the year.

193
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,140
Look. Check it out. "Hilda's beautilities-- I give good hair."

194
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,840
Ooh,that's a little smutty.

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,470
You might get some of those guys in front of the liquor store. Hey,their money's good.

196
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,020
Ay, betty,i got such a good feeling about this salon.

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,410
When i heard that beauty school burned down

198
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,010
And was selling a slightly damaged shampoo sink,

199
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,320
I really felt like god was looking out for me. Well, you're gonna be amazing.

200
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,710
Oh,and henry's coming by tomorrow

201
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,860
With his "time life" books to install the sink.

202
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,180
Ay, i still gotta get that thing home.

203
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,220
Hey,do you think your little friend

204
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,610
With the van could do it?

205
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,260
Are you still hating him now or what? Who? Gio? No,we're fine. He'll be happy to do it.

206
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,380
Investors! How could they have turned me down? That's not what they said.

207
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,120
They just need a few days to think about it.

208
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,060
Oh,that means "no." Don't be stupid.

209
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,260
"Image problem." I don't have an image problem.

210
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,570
Well,you have had some pretty bad press lately.

211
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,550
Well,you were fired and pushed into your fianc?S grave.

212
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,750
I don't know how to put a positive spin on that.

213
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Well,then we're screwed,marc.

214
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,110
They're the only investors

215
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,460
Willing to launch a new magazine,

216
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,250
And they think i have an image problem. Well,then,we change your image. Come on.

217
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,740
It's the media age. We can do it overnight.

218
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,760
Britney spears shaves something or shows something

219
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,750
Or shows something shaved,

220
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,060
And it's around the world in seconds. Trust me,lady.

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,190
I can make you mother teresa with better boobs.

222
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,520
It's interesting.

223
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,500
You only call me when you need something.

224
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,010
When was the last time you went down

225
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,610
To my deli and bought a sandwich?

226
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,100
Well,gio,that's because every time i come in,you yell,

227
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,860
"There she is--The eater." It's cute. It's our thing.

228
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,860
Gio,you gotta let me pay you. I don't feel right. Just give my mom a haircut

229
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,800
And don't tell her about her bald spot.

230
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,020
Um,gio,you can just set the sink down over there.

231
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,340
Henry's coming to install it.

232
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,890
A man of many talents. Is there anything egg salad can't do?

233
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,540
Why is henry egg salad?

234
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,230
Because egg salad is a boring sandwich,

235
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,740
And gio thinks that henry is boring. Oh,no,henry's not boring.

236
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,360
No,look at all the cool stuff you guys do.

237
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,050
I mean,your,um, saturday night sundae night.

238
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,700
That sounds like fun. It is. It is so much fun.

239
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,520
Every weekend, we have a theme topping.

240
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,770
Like,last week,we were watching "walk the line"--

241
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,790
You know,about johnny cash-- So he chopped up cashews. (Laughs)

242
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,920
It was fun. It was fun.

243
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,360
And did you eat it with a reese witherspoon? (Laughs)

244
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,680
That's funny. He's funny. Yeah,he's a riot.

245
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,940
I'm just kidding, but come on.

246
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,920
You and henry,have,like, what,four months left,

247
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,780
And this is how you spend a saturday night?

248
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,500
Okay,gio, what would you do?

249
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,950
If i loved a girl,

250
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,700
And i knew i had so little time left with her,

251
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,740
Then every night would be a chance to make a memory.

252
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,160
Believe me,if there was any ice cream involved,

253
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
I would be eating it off her stomach.

254
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,080
Sexy. Gross.

255
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,060
And i'd take her out to montauk,

256
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,260
You know, with a bottle of wine,

257
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,160
And we'd build a fire and sleep on the beach.

258
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,190
Or maybe we'd climb the fire escape

259
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,820
To the rooftop of the blue note

260
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,560
And listen to music.

261
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,420
Maybe we'd just go out dancing.

262
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,700
'Cause,you know,you never feel closer to a woman

263
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,250
Than when you're holding her.

264
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,430
You know,like,mm,

265
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,750
So close that you could feel her breath on your neck.

266
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,990
Because love doesn't come around often,

267
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,930
And i'd want to make every second count.

268
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,250
Man,i love this song. Aw,whoo!

269
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,720
Come on,betty.

270
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,450
No. Gio.

271
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,140
I don't want to dance. Mmm.

272
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,500
We have to work. Hilda,we have to work. (Hilda) what?

273
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,690
Come on. A little bit of dancing.

274
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,510
Come on. Ready? One,two.

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,910
One,two,mm,mm.

276
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,360
There you go. You got it. You got it.

277
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,540
(Laughs) oh,hey, you guys are good together.

278
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,440
Yeah. Really good.

《丑瀹贝爹》 碟二季碟10集

281
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,460
Doesn't really match the figure "b."

282
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,900
You wanna take another look?

283
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,380
Why were you dancing with that guy? I don't know. He just grabbed me.

284
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,470
He was just showing us some dance moves.

285
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,700
(Clinks) damn it.

286
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,360
It's not that big a deal. What? No,it's this,like-- I can't get this pipe to fit.

287
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,840
Need some help there? What? No. I got it.

288
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,710
Yeah,i see you've got your,um,"time life" books.

289
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,110
Yep. Henry uses them all the time.

290
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,200
He says they were his best friends growing up.

291
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,490
I didn't say it like that.

292
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,610
You know,i think where you're going wrong

293
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,740
Is you didn't slip the trap nut and washer onto the tailpiece

294
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,320
Before you attached the p-Trap. Yes,thank you.

295
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,040
Henry,i think you should let gio do it.

296
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,960
That p-Trap thingy sounds hard. Hilda,he says he can do it.

297
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,510
Yes,i can.

298
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,910
There. It's done.

299
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,470
Okay.

300
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,390
Henry!

301
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,540
Uh,you okay?

302
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,310
No,no. It's supposed to do that.

303
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,200
It says so in the book.

304
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,980
Surprise,surprise.

305
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,060
The devil donates prada.

306
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,690
Wilhelmina slater  spent the day

307
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,310
Clothing the homeless,  making our city beautiful

308
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,050
And even comforting the sick.

309
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,410
* rise and shine and give god  your glory,glory *

310
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
* rise and shine and give  god your glory,glory *

311
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,930
* rise and shine and give god  your glory,glory *

312
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,790
* children of the lord *

313
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,390
It's like eleanor roosevelt  has come back to life

314
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,010
As a woman.

315
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,510
From the antichrist  to "auntie mame"...

316
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,530
"Slater." One moment.

317
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,660
It's the investors.

318
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,560
Paul,hello.

319
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,860
Oh,you saw that. Well,i'm mortified.

320
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,460
Y--They just showed up with cameras and ambushed me.

321
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,270
Well, what can i say?

322
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,640
Now everyone knows the real wilhelmina.

323
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,570
He turned off the video?

324
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,880
Oh,your father and cameras...

325
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,250
I remember when he set a camera up in the bedroom.

326
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,380
We got a half hour of a moaning lamp.

327
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,310
Yeah,mom. We found that tape.

328
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
So,mom, are you okay?

329
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,770
How are they treating you there? Oh,i'm fine. I think i have

330
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,000
A little more cache this time,being an escapee.

331
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
The bulls are giving me a wider berth.

332
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,780
Okay,mom,we're really happy you're top dog there,

333
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,700
But we really need to talk about your hearing.

334
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,970
We're thinking you should plead

335
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,830
T guilty by reason of insanity.

336
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,870
Wait,we said i was gonna tell her that.

337
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,250
Mom,hi. We need to sit down with the attorneys and--

338
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,100
Give me that. I'm talking to her.

339
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,110
Are we really doing this again? Yes,we are.

340
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,310
(Claire) kids-- Mom,didn't dad used to call me "my daniel"?

341
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,850
Kids-- Maybe he used to call you my dumb-Ass.

342
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,720
Children! Put me on the speakerphone.

343
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,540
There is a woman named hatchet in here

344
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,850
Who gets out tomorrow, and i swear to god,

345
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,110
If the two of you do not cut it out,

346
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,400
I will send her to get you.

347
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,880
Now your father is gone,

348
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,830
And i may be gone for a very long time.

349
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,080
You two are on your own now,

350
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,330
And it is time to grow up.

351
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,570
There is a business to be run.

352
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,240
This is not the tree house you fought over

353
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,800
When you were 12. Work it out.

354
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,470
Daniel, let's get real.

355
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,190
We both know who dad wanted.

356
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,430
(Scoffs) we don't know that.

357
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,980
The video got cut off. Then how do you propose we solve this?

358
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,130
Lawyers? Arbitrators? What about what mom said?

359
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Grow up? That won't work. No. The way we settled the tree house.

360
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,920
This is a billion-Dollar company,daniel.

361
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,170
We're not gonna choose a president

362
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,770
With a paintball war.

363
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,870
Well,dad wanted someone with a killer instinct.

364
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,950
Forget it.

365
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,570
Why? Are you afraid i might win again,

366
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,060
Like i did with the tree house?

367
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,970
You're on.

368
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,710
See what i did here?

369
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,440
I mixed a little bit of prep

370
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,920
With a little bit of gangsta,

371
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,790
And i found an edge where there was none.

372
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,810
I don't know. Can i really rock this look? Betty?

373
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,920
Um,i like the color.

374
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,110
Henry,your clothes will be dry in 20 minutes,

375
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,450
And,uh,you can just keep my boxers.

376
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,530
You guys are not gonna believe

377
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,810
What i just did.

378
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,310
I asked gio out. What?

379
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,800
Yeah,we're gonna go dancing.

380
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,360
Oh,henry. It's cute.

381
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,080
Really? Gio?

382
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,060
I mean,don't you find him a little annoying?

383
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,380
Oh,i think he's fun.

384
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,460
Besides,you're the one who keeps saying

385
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,740
That i should go out. Good move,mija.

386
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,790
It will be nice to have someone around the house who's so handy.

387
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,940
I mean,when we're not calling henry to--To fix things. Yeah.

388
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,740
I'm out.

389
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,400
I don't know,hilda.

390
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,120
I think he's a little bit of a know-It-All.

391
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,990
I think it's great,hilda. Eh,i'm on the fence.

392
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,450
All done.

393
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,660
Just be home by 11:00.

394
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,750
Ow! What?

395
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,870
So,hilda, you like reggaeton music?

396
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,950
Are you kidding? I love reggaeton.

397
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,100
Oh,man,i know this hot club with this amazing deejay.

398
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,920
It is off the hook. God,that sounds like so much fun.

399
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,290
Yeah,that does sound like fun. Hey,do you guys wanna come?

400
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,590
Um... we have plans.

401
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,520
Uh,we have plans. Uh,my boyfriend has

402
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,900
A really big surprise for me.

403
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,030
Yeah,it's off the hook,too. Really?

404
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,910
Tonight,instead of just  having ice cream...

405
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,520
We're gonna make it.

406
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,110
Cool.

407
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,140
* i'm your ice cream man *

408
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,060
* stop me when you're passin' by *

409
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,560
* see, now all my flavors *

410
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,900
* are guaranteed to satisfy *

411
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,110
Here you go.

412
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,480
One scoop of homemade "bananas for betty."

413
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,050
You named it after me?

414
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,900
Mm-Hmm. How sweet.

415
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,750
Mm,the movie.

416
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,340
I rented fassbinder's

417
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,030
"The bitter tears of petra von kant"

418
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,890
Because you are seriously lacking

419
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,930
In your knowledge of new german cinema.

420
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,540
And to go with it, bitter chocolate drops

421
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,510
To represent the bitter tears

422
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,250
Of our sad german heroine.

423
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,510
(Laughs) hey,you okay?

424
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah.

425
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,610
But you know what i was thinking?

426
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,480
What?

427
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,790
You know what would be really fun? Hmm?

428
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,130
If we climbed a fire escape. (Laughs)

429
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,570
Or--Or maybe we could go to the pier. Tonight?

430
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah. Why not?

431
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
Because it's supposed to rain and it's mov night.

432
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,670
What are you talking about?

433
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,450
I don't know. Never mind.

434
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,440
Um,forget it. You're right.

435
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,700
Let's,um,sit on the couch and eat our ice cream.

436
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,970
Good.

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,060
But maybe there's a more fun way to eat it.

438
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,440
The rules are simple--

439
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,060
We fight to the death.

440
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,660
The captain of the winning team takes control of meade.

441
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,600
Okay,peeps, as captain--

442
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,340
You're not captain.

443
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,850
As backup captain,

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,940
I wanna say that we are all brothers in this,

445
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,540
Even the chicks.

446
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,720
So,warriors, to your ducatis.

447
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,430
Yeah,we rented a bus to take us to the paintball field.

448
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Not as cool.

449
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,350
Let's go.

450
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,530
You wait,pepper.

451
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,530
You're gonna taste the wrath of my dog's vengeance.

452
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,310
You don't even know what "wrath" means.

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,530
So. I know you're gonna taste it.

454
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,080
You know,i think this is one of those things

455
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,130
That's better in theory,

456
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,300
Because they really don't tell you how cold it is.

457
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,010
Oh,okay. Well,i'll just eat it fast then.

458
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,370
Oh,god. Okay,um--

459
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,140
Okay, just do something,

460
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,860
Because my belly button is frozen.

461
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,310
All right,then maybe this will warm you up.

462
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,330
Ow! Oh!

463
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,580
Oh,no,it's hot! Hot fudge! Hot! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

464
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,470
Aah! (Muffled voice) it's hot. It's hot. (Groaning) this is...

465
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,480
I can't feel my tongue. This is crazy.

466
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,320
How is this better than the night that i planned? (Normal voice) i don't know.

467
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,820
I just wanted to try something different. Well,this is different.

468
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,240
Henry,it's just that we have

469
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,290
So ltle time left together,

470
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,650
And--And i--And i feel like we're not making the best of it.

471
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,500
It's like,why are we sitting at home

472
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,910
When we could be out there...

473
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,310
Dancing or something?

474
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,940
Dancing?

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,770
Like gio and hilda?

476
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,330
Well,why not?

477
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,760
Henry,i-I just-- I want us to have memories.

478
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,390
Okay.

479
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,810
If that's what you really want,

480
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,400
We'll go dancing.

481
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,480
All right,there's another rainstorm coming.

482
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,580
They closed the paintball field.

483
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,530
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to postpone this. No way.

484
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,220
I totally had my heart set on killing nick pepper.

485
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,030
Damn,dawg. Accounting was finally gonna represent.

486
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,920
Forget the rain. We're playing.

487
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,550
She's right.

488
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,950
She's alexis-- Big as texas.

489
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,060
She knows what it's like to be both sexes.

490
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,260
I can't listen to that for the next three hours.

491
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,080
Here's the deal-- We're playing.

492
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,780
Now! (Gunfire)

493
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,770
Aw 'em out! Shoot to kill!

494
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,500
Uh,do what she said, only for me. Come on.

495
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,520
What bar are we meeting up at later?

496
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,930
I'm very pleased,marc.

497
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,830
By this time next week,

498
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
"Slater" magazine will have its funding.

499
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,970
And i'll get paid. (Chuckles)

500
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,670
I think i'll start eating breakfast again. (Thunder rumbles)

501
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,670
Oh,damn,it looks like it's gonna rain.

502
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,700
Run up and get my umbrella.

503
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,030
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

504
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,570
You're not gonna wait?

505
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,650
No.

506
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,620
(Woman) taxi.

507
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,680
Excuse me. I was here first.

508
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,590
Midtown nobu,please. Well,you're very rude.

509
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,990
And you're wearing plastic. I'm gonna be late.

510
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,170
And i'm gonna get wet.

511
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,570
I'm wilhelmina slater. I don't get wet. Ow! Oh!

512
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,720
Oh. (Whimpers)

513
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,440
Oh. Ohh.

514
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,020
That should take care of it.

515
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,040
Oh,my god. It's betty white.

516
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,400
Yes,it's betty white, jackass.

517
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,530
I'm on the ground here. Call 9-1-1.

518
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,660
They're on their way,

519
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,370
And dot worry-- I got it all on my cell.

520
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,670
You know,you're our favorite golden girl.

521
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,770
Can we get aicture?

522
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,620
I'm in pain.

523
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,910
Come on,just one.

524
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,420
Hey.

525
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,990
(Betty) guys! Hey!

526
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,770
Oh,hey. You came! You came!

527
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,900
We thought we'd take you up on your offer.

528
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,990
Are you having fun? Hell,yeah.

529
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,990
The restaurant was amazing. I had four champagne cocktails,

530
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,520
And i don't even feel drunk. Let me get us a round of drinks.

531
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,660
No,no. I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em. I got it.

532
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,700
Somebody get 'em, because i don't feel anything.
A round of flaming pelicans,please.

533
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh,no. I don't want a flaming pelican.

534
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,100
Why--Why not? They sound fun. Have one.

535
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,870
It's okay. Um,i'm gonna have a club soda.

536
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,760
No,get him a flaming thing.

537
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,690
It'll loosen you up.

538
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,380
And then gio can show you some of those fancy dance moves.

539
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm good.

540
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,840
So,hilda, how about you let me

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,470
Throw you around the dance floor? Sure.

542
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,500
Hey,uh, are you guys coming?

543
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,100
Yes. Nah.

544
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,060
Um... you go.

545
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,910
Um,we'll-- We'll go on the next one.

546
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,170
We'll dance on the next one.

547
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,750
What?!

548
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,800
Okay,here's the plan--

549
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
Rudolph,i want you in the closet.

550
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,470
Stephani maya, cover reception.

551
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,380
Amanda,i want you to cover the bull pen.

552
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,090
I want the closet. No,you're gonna steal shoes.

553
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,560
Now,you guys, i'm really confident

554
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
We have a winning team.

555
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,390
Aah!

556
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,760
(Amanda) cover me!

557
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,950
(Daniel) find your cover! Come on.

558
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,230
Oh,i was hit. I'm out.

559
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,080
Oh,i'm out,too.

560
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
(Woman) now it's just daniel and amanda.

561
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,120
Oh,hello. What's with all the stalkerazzi?

562
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,430
Ah,the world in which we live in.

563
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,380
Guess they found out about the news about "slater."

564
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,510
How are my teeth? Sharp as ever.

565
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,920
All right. Uh, the official announcement

566
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,530
For "slater" won't be for a couple months,

567
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,190
But i'll be happy to answer any questions.

568
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,290
Wilhelmina,why do you hate betty white?

569
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm sorry?

570
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,240
The woman's a national treasure. What do you have against her?

571
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,250
Uh,i have nothing against her.

572
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,280
Then why did you viciously attack her?

573
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,500
Marc,they're yelling things at me

574
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,690
And getting-- Getting very close.

575
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,810
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet.

576
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,700
Tv legend betty white's  high five

577
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,120
Was reduced  to a high four

578
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,120
After fashion diva  wilhelmina slater

579
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,500
Slammed her hand  in a car door tonight. Ouch!

580
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,960
Willie,how could you?

581
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,950
Uh,well, obviously i didn't know

582
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,250
It was betty white.

583
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm not a monster.

584
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,830
I just thought it was some old woman in the rain.

585
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,220
By now you've all seen  the footage on youtube,

586
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,470
But i can't see it enough.  (Snorts) can you?

587
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,220
What in the world...

588
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,870
Oh,god.

589
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,770
This thing has had 50,000 hits in the last hour.

590
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,240
Some queen's even remixed it to a dance song.

591
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,790
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

592
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,390
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet.

593
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,410
I don't get wet.  Wilhelmina slater.

594
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,260
I don't get wet.  Ooh!

595
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,310
You're wearing plastic... funky.

596
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,830
Oh,this is bad,willie, really bad.

597
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,960
I'm wilhelmina slater.  I don't get wet...

598
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,300
This is a disaster. "Slater" is ruined,

599
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,520
And i may have spent an afternoon

600
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,190
Touching homeless people for nothing.

601
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,530
Well,maybe it's still okay.

602
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,970
Maybe the investors haven't seen it.

603
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,150
(Whimpers) oh,god.

604
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,770
No,no,no. It's me.

605
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,990
Oh.

606
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,020
It was an anna sui.

607
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,490
I know i should feel something, but i feel nothing.

608
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,370
War has changed me.

609
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,540
Hang in there. We're doing good.

610
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,150
I just shot stella in the ladies' room. And karen went home because she got bored.

611
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,350
See? That counts.

612
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,150
We only have alexis and nick left.

613
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,410
S with singsongy voice) danny,come out and play.

614
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,900
Daniel,this is out of control.

615
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,290
Maybe we should just give up.

616
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,600
Innocent clothes are getting hurt.

617
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,090
No. We're not going anywhere.

618
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,780
Alexis always wins everything.

619
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,610
You know,she even got to say good-Bye

620
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,050
To my father in the end, and i didn't.

621
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,690
She's not getting this.

622
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
Amanda,

623
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,030
Are you with me?

624
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,150
Yes,i am.

625
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,260
Eyes on the prize.

626
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,050
You take nick. I have alexis.

627
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,440
(Man) * back it up,  back it up *

628
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,740
* back it,back it up,  back it up *

629
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,870

630
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,150

631
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,920
* back it,back it up,  back it up *

632
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,830
Wow.

633
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,920
They look like they're having a lot of fun.

634
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah come on,henry, let's dance.

635
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,490
Betty, you've seen me dance.

636
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,810
I don't want to look like a fool. Oh,who cares?

637
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,960
Gio doesn't care what he looks like.

638
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
Come on. It'll be fun. Maybe i don't want to be fun.

639
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,080
Oh,my gosh,henry, your shirt!

640
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:29,840
Oh,my god. Uh,yes.

641
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,880
Somebody help him.

642
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
(Man) hey!

643
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,890
I'm sorry.

644
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,460
Did my catching on fire interrupt your date?

645
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,120
Are you okay?

646
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,070
Betty,what are we even doing here? I-I just wanted us to dance.

647
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,500
Well,if you want to dance so badly,

648
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,270
Then--Then go and dance with gio,

649
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,300
Because i'm never gonna be that guy.

650
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,640
Stop tormenting us!

651
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,600
Oh,just answer it. (Ring)

652
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,170
Let them pull the funding. I'm done.

653
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,270
I can't fight for "slater" any longer. (Ring)

654
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,130
"Slater."

655
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,070
Oh.

656
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,210
It's betty white's publicist.

657
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,280
Yes,she'll speak to betty.

658
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,580
At does she want? I don't know.

659
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,710
What do i say? I don't know.

660
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,690
How do i look? It's a phone.

661
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,360
Betty white, how are you?

662
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,730
Well,for someone who had to fight a rat

663
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,230
For her fingertip, surprisingly well.

664
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,980
Well,i didn't vote for giuliani,

665
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,380
But he did make the city cleaner.

666
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,680
Betty,i can't begin to tell you

667
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,820
How sorry i am.

668
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,450
Believe me,i-- I just thought

669
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,490
You were some old lady.

670
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,630
Oh,an honest mistake.

671
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,100
And i'll be fine.

672
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,030
I did lose a lot of blood, but it was my own fault.

673
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,520
I stopped to sign a few autographs

674
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,540
And almost bled out on the sidewalk.

675
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,350
Well,that's why you're beloved--

676
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,820
You're loyal to your fans.

677
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,790
Oh,well, i adore 'em...

678
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,330
Except for the few sickos

679
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,910
Who write lesbian fan fiction

680
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,940
About me and bea arthur.

681
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,720
Look,i know you must feel terrible.

682
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,730
That's why i'm calling you--

683
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,410
To tell you i forgive you.

684
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,610
Really? Well, that's wonderful.

685
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,780
Well,i feel better,

686
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,300
But you know how you can help heal the city?

687
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,850
You can forgive me on tv.

688
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,580
Looking for me?

689
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,390
(Grunts) damn it.

690
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,710
That was for halston.

691
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,490
Aah.

692
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,190
Ow! That hurts.

693
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,450
And that was for not holding the elevator.

694
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,770
(Grunts) and that is for not making the coffee.

695
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,560
And that is for wearing yellow spandex--

696
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,480
Okay,i'm dead. I'm dead.

697
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,570
I will tell you when you are dead.

698
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,460
(Grunts) you are a psycho.

699
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,880
And you are a dog hater!

700
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,960
God,you're hot when you're mad. And you're hot when you're dead

701
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh,amanda. (Gasps)

702
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,650
Eh.

703
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,180
(Amanda) mm. I hate you.

704
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,450
Mm. Mm. Oh!

705
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,240
And then there was one.

706
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,700
Henry,it's me.

707
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,740
Um,i know you're ignoring my calls right now,

708
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Because you're not so bananas for betty.

709
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,730
I mean,why would you be? I'm not either.

710
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,360
I just wanted to say...

711
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,470
Nted to say...

712
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,160
I gotta go. You're dancing right now.

713
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,410
(Harold melvin  & the blue notes) * if you *

714
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,610
* don't know me by now *

715
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,120
* if you don't  know me by now *

716
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,370
* you will never,never,  never know me *

717
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,660
* you'll never,  never,never know me *

718
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,340
* ooh,ooh,ooh *  * hey,hey *

719
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,830
* if you don't know me  by now *  * if you don't *

720
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,900
(Man) * oh *

721
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,110
Betty,i'm sorry.

722
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,530
I-I was acting like such a jerk.

723
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,880
I just got jealous.

724
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Look,i-I'm never gonna be like gio.

725
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,300
Gettin' my freak on doesn't come naturally.

726
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,900
Stop.

727
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,410
I don't want you to be like gio,

728
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,970
And i don't need to come to clubs

729
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,240
And i don't need to eat food off of you.

730
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,380
I just want to be with you.

731
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,070
I want to be with you.

732
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,550
I have 17 weeks and 3 days left

733
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,260
With the most amazing guy in the world,

734
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,050
And i'm happy eating ice cream on the couch

735
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,540
Out of a bowl.

736
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,350
Henry,wow. What can i say,man?

737
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,360
You have the moves of a jungle cat.

738
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,350
Yeah,henry,where have you been hiding that?

739
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,050
(Gio) well, so who's drinking?

740
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,590
I am!

741
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,380
You know,i think they water these down.

742
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,800
I'm just sayin'. (Gio laughs)

743
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,020
Oh,hey,uh, you guys comin'?

744
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,660
I think we're going home.

745
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,450
Later.

746
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,090
Owdamn it!

747
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,900
Alexis, are you all right?

748
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,960
Oh.

749
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,780
What areou waiting for?

750
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,470
Take the shot.

751
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,190
What are we doing?

752
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,520
Does it really matter who dad wanted to run meade?

753
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,260
Why don't we do it together?

754
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,370
I'm willing to if you are.

755
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,750
I'd like that.

756
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,060
(Panting) wh--

757
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,610
I let you win the tree house,daniel,

758
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
'Cause it didn't matter.

759
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,650
But i'm not letting you win is.

760
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,710
Maybe next saturday, i'll make the ice cream,

761
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,200
And i'll call it "hazelnuts for henry."

762
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,660
And when "27 dresses" comes out,

763
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,570
I'll make you "chick flick chicken,"

764
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,480
And we'll sit in the front row.

765
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
As long as it's you and me,

766
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,230
It's a date.

767
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,480
* it illuminates my soul,  is inspired *

768
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,890
* your eyes are wider  than before... *

769
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,160
Oh,shh. Shh.

770
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,440
Oh,shh. Shh. (Clears throat)

771
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,110
I think i had too much too drink.

772
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,300
Oh,you--You wanna go back to the club?

773
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,660
So...

774
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,480
So?

775
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,010
Hey,do you,um,wanna do this again sometime?

776
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,420
I don't think so.

777
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,240
Oh,i had so much fun tonight.

778
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,600
When henry caught on fire... (laughs) yeah.

779
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,770
And everything,but,um, you just really seem

780
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,070
To up your game when betty showed up.

781
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,760
What? What--What are you talking about?

782
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,820
I'm just saying...

783
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,630
I don't think i'm the suarez sister you like.

784
00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:00,510
* oh,so much more *

785
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,010
(Man) one minute to air.

786
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,230
Now this is gonna be picked up by every major station.

787
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,710
I can't thank you enough for doing this.

788
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,230
You're a class act,lady.

789
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,970
Oh,i just don't want to be part of the ugliness out there.

790
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,260
As gandhi said,"be the change you want to see in the world."

791
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh,terrific. I'm going on tv with whore eyes.

792
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,590
Okay,ladies. We're going live. Turn on that over-40 charm.

793
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,140
And five,four, three,two...

794
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,570
So much can change overnight.

795
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,050
This is suzuki st. Pierre from "fashion buzz,"

796
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,260
Here at the peace summit no one thought would ever happen.

797
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,610
Wilhelmina,what do you have to say to award-Winning actress,

798
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,400
Animal rights activist, friend to gays everywhere--

799
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,820
I love you-- Me,too.

800
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,990
Betty white.

801
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,580
As i saito her last night when i rushed to her side,i--

802
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,290
Oh! My hand! Oh,oh,it hurts. I barely--

803
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,910
Now she's going after my other hand. Betty,please.

804
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,250
Why do y hate me? What did i ever do to you? Please,betty.

805
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,790
Oh,god! Get the monster away from me.

806
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,680
Cut.

807
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,250
What the hell is going on here?

808
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,520
Have you lost your mind, old woman?

809
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,340
Did i not mention that "regis and kelly" called?

810
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,770
And "the view." They want me. They all want me.

811
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,470
Oh,i'm sorry,honey. This feud is huge,

812
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,920
And i'm gonna milk it till it's dry.

813
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,050
But you don't need this.

814
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,180
Are you kidding?

815
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,430
That "golden girls" money went right into the nickel slots.

816
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,950
Roll it,sweetheart.

817
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,680
Oh! Get her away from me! I think she's got a knife.

818
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,230
Oh,no!

819
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,850
My bunny got wounded.

820
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,070
It's collateral damage. I'm sorry,betty.

821
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,380
Ugh. So what does all of this mean?

822
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,670
Well,essentially, alexis is my boss.

823
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,630
I'm going up to my dad's office right now--

824
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,350
Uh,alexis' office-- To sign the contracts.

825
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,660
Oh,i'm so sorry,daniel, but you know what?

826
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,260
I think i remember your dad calling you "my daniel" once.

827
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,050
It was at the christmas party, and...

828
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,990
It's okay. No,it's just hard to admit he never trusted me.

829
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,960
I guess he knew only alexis had his killer instinct.

830
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,260
Oh,but you don't need a killer instinct to be a leader.

831
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,520
What about martin luther king or jesus?

832
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,030
I mean, you're not as good as them,

833
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,880
But you're at least as good as alexis.

834
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,720
Yeah,i bet i could run a fashion magazine

835
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,060
At least as good as martin luther king.

836
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,500
Probably not jesus.

837
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,060
Willie,disaster.

838
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,060
Jody called me this morning. No one's coming in.

839
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,000
They've mutinied. There's no way to replace them

840
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,810
Unless we hire children or use prison labor.

841
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,940
"Slater's"dead,marc.

842
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,830
Have a cup of tea.

843
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,500
Dead? No.

844
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,470
It's all i've got except for goohair

845
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,880
And good clothes,and actually, you know,i'm doing okay.

846
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,860
But what about you? How can you be so calm?

847
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,580
You've got nothing.

848
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,020
Because i've moved on to plan "b."

849
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,450
I've been saving it foa rainy day.

850
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,730
And by god,it's pouring.

851
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,270
(Gasps) what is that?

852
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,430
Do you remember after bradford died,

853
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,620
I went off to grieve privately?

854
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,210
Tell me,doctor, is it true what i' read,

855
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,320
That sperm can be removed from a body

856
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,960
Up to 48 hours after death and still be viable?

857
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,620
Um,that is correct. Yes.

858
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,270
Well,i wonder if there's a procedure

859
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,350
You'd be willing to do for me.

860
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,450
You mean that's... in your freezer?

861
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,930
I put a pinkberry in there.

862
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,700
It's our future,marc.

863
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,880
If i can't marry into the meade family,

864
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,570
I will give birth to an heir.

865
