00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:15,216
Hello, gorgeous.

2
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:19,054
Aw, thank you. not you! me! this!

3
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,755
My new title

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,058
And my new office.

5
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:25,060
It's perfect,

6
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:28,496
Except for one unsightly, little...

7
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,298
Marc. marc!

8
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:33,268
Ow!

9
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:35,837
Sorry. I will get used to my new glass door.

10
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,839
Welcome home, boys.

11
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:40,608
Marc, I'm really proud of your promotion,

12
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:44,245
And I'm really excited that we get to share an fice.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,781
But since it is a professional space,

14
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,854
If we can try and keep the space professional?

15
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:51,119
Okay, sure, I'll get rid of the titans of sport,

16
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:55,256
As soon as you take down your ethnic bric-a-brac.

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,425
And while we're at it, please refrain

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,995
From carrying on in your overly exuberant latina ways.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,932
Marc, I do not carry on in an overly exuberant--

20
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,100
Aah!

21
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:07,902
Oh, my god! aah!

22
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:11,139
I won a blobby!

23
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,640
What happened? are you okay?

24
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:15,643
No! I'm sharing an office with a chunky, cheering charo.

25
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:17,078
I won a blobby!

26
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:19,948
That's great! a blobby!

27
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:21,883
What is a-a blobby?

28
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,819
I don't know. it's a, um...

29
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:26,821
Black and latina organization of bloggers,

30
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,990
And they would like to award betty suarez

31
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,126
For the best new blog.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,431
I didn't even know anyone knew about my blog. congratulations.

33
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,396
That is amazing.

34
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,932
Did anybody hear that I'm a junior fashion editor?

35
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,468
This is crazy. they want to send someone over

36
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,304
To interview me today, and I have to find my own person

37
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:46,508
To present me with the award at the ceremony. will you do it?

38
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,444
Oh, you want me to? who else would I want more?

39
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:51,780
No, I'd love to. I mean, this is huge.

40
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:55,383
Well, I don't know if it's huge. it's being held at...

41
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,685
"the place near wendy's that has the cupcakes."

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,621
I'm guessing it's a little low-rent.

43
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,956
Who cares? an award is an award.

44
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:05,527
And you deserve it. your blog is terrific. really? you read it?

45
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,329
Uh... not yet.

46
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:11,299
I have it bookmarked, and I'm really psyched

47
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,302
To get around to it. well, please do it quick because the sooner you do,

48
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:17,305
It'll put me that much closer to hitting my 75-readersark.

49
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,174
Well, it is only the beginning.

50
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,209
I know you don't have a very large readership,

51
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:24,145
But pretty soon, people will be stopping you on the street.

52
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,817
Oh, my god! oh, my god! I love you!

53
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,019
It's you! I love your show.

54
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,822
I love when you're all, "marc!"

55
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,291
What the hell are you talking about?

56
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,293
Wow. you're always on, huh?

57
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,961
Genius.

58
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,633
It's not fair.

59
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,135
You, betty--

60
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,137
Everyone who was everdat

61
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,638
Got promoted but me.

62
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:52,140
I want to get promoted.

63
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,142
I'm sick of being a receptionist,

64
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:56,144
Always being at everyone's beck and victoria.

65
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,179
Well, daniel needs someone.

66
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,648
Why don't you ask him for the job again?

67
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:02,483
Maybe you'll be next.

68
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:04,319
Oh, mandy, it's so good.

69
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:07,322
It's like--it's like I'm finally my own man around here.

70
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,823
It's really liberating.

71
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,025
Marc! gotta go.

72
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,698
What could that simpering fool have been talking about?

73
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:19,200
I have no ide-- ohh.

74
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,768
What is it?

75
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:23,771
"mean queens of fashion

76
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:26,774
"in new york city's finest drag bar,

77
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,177
"double bill featuring

78
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,845
"manna wintour

79
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,948
And wilhdiva hater"?!

80
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,918
That is so fun-- offensive!

81
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:40,788
Oh! I will not be mocked by some low-rent drag queen.

82
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:42,757
It's insulting. it's inexcusable.

83
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,960
It's delicious. what's that web address?

84
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,963
Uh, yeah, I'll write it down-- oh! don't even bother.

85
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,466
I'll have my lawyers draw up a cease and desist order

86
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,767
Immediately.

87
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,869
As if I didn't have enough queens

88
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,871
To shut down right here at "mode."

89
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:01,476
Congratulations, betty. aw.

90
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,511
Oh, you must be so excited to be honored

91
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,513
By the big lesbian order of bloggers.

92
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,315
Amanda, I alady told you,

93
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,317
That's not what "blob" stands for.

94
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,986
It stands for "big, lumpy, obese bloggers."

95
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:15,590
Those ams might hurt if they were coming from award winners.

96
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,828
It'll be like watching a five year old

97
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,902
Pretend to drive the car.

98
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,499
Thank you, willie, for that resounding vote of bitchiness,

99
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,501
But I am nonetheless very excited

100
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:28,736
To announce that I've landed us

101
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:30,672
An exclusive fashion shoot and interview

102
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,141
With diego martinez and victoria velez.

103
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,545
I have to deal with that all day.

104
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,314
I love them!

105
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,282
I've seen every single one of his movies,

106
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,951
From "dawn of shame,"

107
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,519
Where victoria plays a disgraced prostitute,

108
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,187
To "tides of regret,"

109
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,456
Where she plays a disgraced traffic cop. must she get so worked up?

110
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,391
And overseeing the fashion shoot

111
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,660
Is our newest junior fashion editor--

112
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:55,496
Marc st. james. oh!

113
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:56,831
Ahem. mm.

114
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:59,400
And covering the interview component...

115
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:00,588
Please be me. please be me.

116
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,937
Is this a creative meeting or "the price is right"?

117
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:05,073
Actually, I was planning on doing it myself.

118
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:07,075
Well, by "it," do you mean the interview

119
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,610
Or victoria velez? no, willie.

120
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,913
I assure you, my interest in the interview

121
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,093
Is purely professional.

122
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,217
And how many diego martinez movies have you actually seen?

123
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,521
You know what?

124
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,825
It would be fun for us to do it together, betty.

125
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,060
Yes! oh, I'm so excited! I have so many questions.

126
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:29,130
I'm gonna start by re-watching all of their movies. whoa, whoa, whoa.

127
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:32,000
Slow down, betty there's plenty of time. oh, I don't know, daniel.

128
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:35,103
Should she slow down or you speed up?

129
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:38,639
I mean, I would hate to see the assistant exceed the master.

130
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:41,576
Oh, who am I kidding? I'd love to see that.

131
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,786
Hey, guess what.

132
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,323
I found the perfect new assistant for you--me.

133
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,559
Wouldn't that be weird, now that we're fun buddies again?

134
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:01,362
Ooh, fun buddies. there are cameras everywhere.

135
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,864
Oh, hey.

136
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,133
Look, daniel, I know you. if you hire some new hottie,

137
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,135
You're gonna spend half your day wondering,

138
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,871
"will we sleep together? when will we sleep together?

139
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:12,340
Will she get all crazy or will it be casual?"

140
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,342
With me, you already know we're sleeping together,

141
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,412
I am all crazy and it's casual! total time-saver.

142
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,881
I guess I can't argue with that.

143
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:23,384
Um, but I will need you to find a new receptionist. aah!

144
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,286
Thank you, daniel! thank you, thank you!

145
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,624
Lots of shrieking today.

146
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,559
Aah!

147
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,660
Aah!

148
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,162
Aah!

149
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:37,398
Wow, you're excited. it's just 'cause, like,

150
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,501
I'm the biggest bettyhead out there. bettyhead?

151
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,537
It's what we call the core 22 of us.

152
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,372
We should get started,

153
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,944
'cause if I'm not back to work in 20 minutes, I'm so fired.

154
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:47,775
Yeah, okay, fine.

155
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,478
Do I have anything in my teeth? uh, no. okay.

156
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,515
So the tone of your blog is normally really positive,

157
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,719
But what I think your readers really want to know is...

158
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,155
Who are you dying to bitch out?

159
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,991
What? no. no.

160
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,293
No one.

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,929
Um, I know a lot of people use their blogs

162
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:11,866
As a place to vent petty frustrations,

163
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,301
But, um, not that--

164
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,303
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

165
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:18,072
I mean, that's cool, too-- hey, how's it going in here?

166
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,408
Hey, daniel. this is wendy. wendy, this is daniel meade--

167
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,009
Editor-in-chief of "mode" magazine.

168
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:24,879
He's also going to present me with my award. oh. that's cool.

169
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:28,149
But just so you know,

170
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:31,085
The blobbies are about celebrating minority writers

171
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,456
In new media-- not celebrity presenters.

172
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,091
Okay.

173
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,861
That soundlike a fun night.

174
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,029
Uh, I should probably get going.

175
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:44,532
No, wait. daniel, why don't you stay?

176
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,968
Hang out, you-- I could use your help.

177
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,903
Uh, wendy wants something dishy,

178
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,771
And I think I'm disappointing her.

179
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,174
Oh, my god! never.

180
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,675
A little.

181
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,644
Well, good luck getting any dish

182
00:07:56,678 --> 00:08:00,314
Out of our resident pollyanna here.

183
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,218
Has she always been this way? oh, god, no. she was way worse.

184
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,786
You know the first day,

185
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,556
She showed up in this insane poncho,

186
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,525
And her--and her hair-- do you remember that?

187
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,793
It was--it was-- it was crazy, right? yeah, crazy.

188
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,463
Oh, and, uh, so there's this glass window...

189
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:18,432
I mean, no one thought she would last the day, seriously.

190
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:21,369
If you had told me three years later she'd be an editor,

191
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,504
I would've laughed you out of the room.

192
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,175
Our betty, she's really come a long way. thanks, daniel.

193
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,877
But to me, she'll always be my sweet...

194
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:32,880
Little assistant, always on hand to...

195
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,882
Get me my... bagel.

196
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,884
Could you hand me the water?

197
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:43,391
Okay, that's all we have time for.

198
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,026
So how was that?

199
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,894
Perfect.

200
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:19,273
Marc?

201
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:21,742
What are you doing here? oh... i...

202
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,244
I couldn't allow

203
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,080
This affront to your dignity go on uninvestigated.

204
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:28,716
Marc! I found us a table!

205
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,253
You and claire?

206
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,555
We found a common interest.

207
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,125
All right, y'all. it is showtime!

208
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,761
Ladies and ladylike gentlemen,

209
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:44,632
Boys and boy-girls,

210
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,400
Without further ado,

211
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,869
And because we lose the place at 10:00...

212
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:54,608
I present to you the queen of mean,

213
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,478
Who always serves her cruelty...

214
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:00,247
ÃÃ la mode.

215
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,983
Wilheldiva hater!

216
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,159
Good evening. is it fashion week already?

217
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,128
Because I've never seen such weak fashion.

218
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,767
Now who here's from jersey?

219
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,769
Good. you're learning.

220
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,405
Who here is wearing jersey?

221
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:29,109
Oh, I've never seen such gorgeous leather--

222
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:32,046
But enough about your face.

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,082
Ha! finally, some decent material.

224
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:37,218
It's hardly a skilled impression, though.

225
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:39,153
She sounds nothing like me. marc!

226
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:44,458
Ii>â?/i>

227
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,264
Congratulations... aah!

228
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,700
Blobby winner! hilda, you scared me.

229
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,301
Champagne?

230
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,270
Yeah! aw, thank you!

231
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,938
I'm sorry, hilda.

232
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,908
I wish I was a little bit more in the mood to celebrate,

233
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:03,077
But this really weird thing

234
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,280
Happened with daniel today at work. he became a woman like his brother?

235
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:08,182
No, not that weird.

236
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:11,018
This woman came from the blobbies to interview me,

237
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,953
And he sat in, you know,

238
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,623
To tell funny stories about me or whatever,

239
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:18,459
And all he could talk about was how I never fit in

240
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:20,828
When I first got there, how badly I dressed,

241
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,130
How I was his good little assistant.

242
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:26,233
Well, all of those things are kind of true.

243
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,169
Yeah, but my readers don't know that.

244
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:32,039
I mean, maybe it's just 22 girls readinaloud to their cats,

245
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,508
But they think of me as this, you know,

246
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,077
Put together, polished professional,

247
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:40,381
And now that's ruined. you think daniel was trying to make you look bad?

248
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,013
'cause I don't think he would do that.

249
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,784
I guess he is giving me the opportunity

250
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:46,120
To interview two of my idols tomorrow. yeah.

251
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,989
You know, he probably didn't even know what he was saying,

252
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,191
And maybe you're just being a little sensitive.

253
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:53,761
Mm. you're probably right. all right, cheers!

254
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,330
To the blobbies! to the blobbies.

255
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,167
Ay! that's cheap.

256
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,552
Whoo!

257
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,089
So what did you think? ugh!

258
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,325
Wilhelmina!

259
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,094
Oh, my god, you came! I can't believe it! I love you!

260
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:29,863
What did you think of the show? I adored it.

261
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:33,867
Do it one more time, and I will sue your fake ass off!

262
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:35,869
Marc!

263
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,877
Hey, amanda? will you hold all my calls?

264
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:46,847
Diego and victoria are gonna be here in 42 minutes,

265
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,130
And I need every last second to prepare for the interview.

266
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,117
Okay, calm down, betty.

267
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,586
Good things come to those who weigh less.

268
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,588
Besides, I'm officially daniel's assistant now,

269
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:57,491
So if you need anyone to not take your messages,

270
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,493
You'll have to talk to my replacement.

271
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,795
Helen! helen?

272
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,665
Okay, who wants to party? me, me! I want to party! me!

273
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,601
Hey, you look good, too. did you get dermabrasion?

274
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,770
Oh, no. I'm just wearing pants today.

275
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,739
Ooh.

276
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:14,675
What is that? what is the little lady doing?

277
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,677
Oh, um, no, that's just betty.

278
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:19,258
She's always forgetting the english word for things. oh, right.

279
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,080
The cleaning lady.

280
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,815
>>sÃ­.<

281
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,283
Gesundheit.

282
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,252
Did you guys widen those elevators,

283
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,255
Or did that stupid doctor pull my eyes too tight?

284
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:31,358
Don't laugh. it'll happen to you.

285
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,327
And so, diego, victoria,

286
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,329
Since your relationship

287
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,331
As director and actress

288
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:40,334
Is all about working in harmony together,

289
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:44,905
I thought, what better theme for our photo shoot than...

290
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,306
Symbiosis?

291
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,846
I see you as the anemone

292
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:55,048
And you as the clown fish,

293
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,785
Harmoniously intertwined, offering each other

294
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,622
The sustenance and protection needed to survive...

295
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:04,625
In... this...

296
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,027
Harsh creative climate.

297
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:10,898
Plus, your body is gonna look smokin' hot in this dress.

298
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,135
The idea is odd. the clothes are strange.

299
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,305
I love it!

300
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,606
Great.

301
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,208
I am so excited.

302
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,210
I spent all night reviewing every interview

303
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:25,179
They've given in the last five years,

304
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:28,148
Because I want to make sure that we don't come away

305
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:29,491
With the same old stuff, you know? oh.

306
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,118
I spent most of my prep time doing pull-ups.

307
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,619
What? victoria's intimidating.

308
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,621
Her bodyin "nights of t.

309
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,623
What about her monologue?

310
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,592
When she breaks down and she admits

311
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,094
That she's the one who killed the other nun?

312
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,298
Oh! broke my heart. yeah, I watched her nude scenes on youtube.

313
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,867
And here come our own anemone and clown fish--

314
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,368
Daniel and betty.

315
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:51,572
Oh, hi!  I'm betty. it's so nice to meet you.

316
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:54,374
I'm your biggest fan. hi. daniel meade.

317
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,077
I've really been looking forward to this interview.

318
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:00,848
Then why is she the only one who looks prepared?

319
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:04,885
Oh, betty, thank you so much for holding that for me.

320
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,020
Okay! ow!

321
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:08,956
Mm. why don't we get started?

322
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,725
You two can go change.

323
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,861
And you two, change.

324
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,599
Can I really get away with this?

325
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,534
Oh, of course you can.

326
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,969
I mean, you're the woman

327
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,904
Who made a nun's habit look sexy.

328
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,240
You saw "nights of torment"?

329
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,509
I loved every single minute.

330
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,165
Perfect. that's great I think we have all we need.

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,434
Thank you so much!

332
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:55,869
That was amazing.

333
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,804
You ready to knock out the interview?

334
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,440
I have a million questions. betty, I am editor-in-chief.

335
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,510
Why don't you let me take the lead on this?

336
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,703
So I have a million questions for you.

337
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,079
Oh, well, if you have a million questions,

338
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:09,016
Then you probably don't need this, right? well, I have a question, too.

339
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,984
Um, is that really your folder,

340
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,527
Or were you just trying to impress me?

341
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:14,321
Well, he was definitely trying to do that.

342
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,923
This is my research.

343
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:19,693
All he did to prepare for the meeting were... pull-ups?

344
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,428
Is that true?

345
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:22,963
Not exactly. yes.

346
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:26,199
But, I mean, he's so much better than when I first got to "mode."

347
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,102
You don't even want to know how he used to prepare meetings. betty.

348
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,538
Really? uh, well, it was only because

349
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,974
You looked so incredible in "nights of torment."

350
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,576
It's four and a half hours.

351
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,711
You really make it through the whole thing?

352
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:41,214
Well, not ex-- well, he made it through the nude scenes.

353
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,318
He's a big fan of the nude scenes.

354
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:46,853
Huh?

355
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,991
Bye-bye. thank you so much.

356
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,526
What was that?

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,494
What? what?

358
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,331
You emassed me in front of victoria. oh, come on, daniel.

359
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:00,334
I was just teasing. I mean, it's not like I said anything worse

360
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:03,070
Than any of the things you said about me yesterday.

361
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,872
You said them to a major international film star

362
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:08,442
Who might go blabbing them all er cannes next year.

363
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,229
I said mine on a tiny web site

364
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,221
To a band of 20 cat-loving weirdos.

365
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,371
It's a little different, don't you think?

366
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,966
I'm mad because you totally hit on that guy

367
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,368
I was trying to stalk.

368
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,704
Why does your face look familiar?

369
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:28,205
Oh, it shouldn't.

370
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,708
I had it totally redone since the last time I was here.

371
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:33,811
Ooh, here's the name of that place where I got my jacket.

372
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,946
Why would I care where you got your jacket?

373
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,715
'cause you asked.

374
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:55,766
Please, ms. slater, don't shut down my show.

375
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,236
It's my only livelihood, and I can't afford a lawsuit.

376
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,205
Or a decent dress, it seems.

377
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,640
Now get out. rayon hurts my eyes.

378
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,610
Oh, hey, willie.

379
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,812
Uh, callie from long lash is coming tomorrow.

380
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:12,516
She wants to do a breast cancer fund-raising tie-in with us.

381
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,518
Look, I know the only thing you hate

382
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,920
More than corporate altruism drugstore makeup,

383
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,456
But she really wants to meet you. fine.

384
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,326
Thank you.

385
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,029
Oh, by the way, you look nice. I like you in white.

386
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,731
Thank you.

387
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:33,070
Wait. come back tomorrow.

388
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,072
Since you're no longer performing,

389
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:38,509
I may have a new job for you.

390
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:45,682
Mandy, what were you thinking

391
00:18:45,717 --> 00:18:47,551
Bringing her back here?

392
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:51,221
That giant girl is a giant mess. marc, I couldn't help it.

393
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,757
She's like my ghost of lonely christmas future.

394
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,827
Besides, she's changed. she has totally gotten it together.

395
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,195
"hold" magazine. please mode.

396
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,464
Oh, you're absolutely right. yeah.

397
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:03,200
Hi, sweetie. hey.

398
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,235
Thanksor hooking me up with this job.

399
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,871
You know, I've had some hard times in my life,

400
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,374
But last week when I hit the big 3-0,

401
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,609
Everything started to come together.

402
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,845
And then you hooking me up with this job--

403
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,047
It's like the cherry on top of the pill bottle.

404
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:19,383
I'm so glad. I need a town car.

405
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:23,387
Ooh, don't we all, honey?

406
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,856
Your friend seems happy here. doesn't she?

407
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,691
Fire her immediately.

408
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:39,703
And that is enough of that.

409
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,471
But I still feel bad.

410
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:44,608
Weird. I got this mass e-mail from claire meade

411
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,477
Inviting me to a drag show. better steer clear, papi.

412
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:50,080
We know what happens when you get around drag queens.

413
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,982
Hey, I was not fooled.

414
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:55,185
It was betty's party. I was just trying to be polite. okay.

415
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,354
It's not funny.

416
00:19:57,388 --> 00:20:00,224
God, daniel was so mean to me today.

417
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,959
Do you know what he called my bettyheads?

418
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,461
He said they were a tiny band of cat-loving weirdos.

419
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,831
That's kind of what you called them yourself.

420
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,334
Ohh. it made me so mad. but you know what?

421
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,502
I'm gonna go into work tomorrow,

422
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,128
And I'm gonna tell him exactly how he made me feel.

423
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,305
Mija, I would not be mad at daniel.

424
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,575
As close as you are, you still work for him.

425
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,078
If you want to say something, say it to your family,

426
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,080
Not your boss.

427
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:48,272
"dear betty, I love your blog.

428
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,140
"you're always so positive and inspiring.

429
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,509
"doesn't anything ever get you mad?

430
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,745
Fiona 21."

431
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:04,187
"you know what, fiona? yes, sometimes something does.

432
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,124
"i know I don't usually use this space to vent,

433
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:09,126
"but since there are only a handful of you out there,

434
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,261
"what the hell?

435
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:14,164
Heck?"

436
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:20,737
"hell?" "today a really good friend was insensitive...

437
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,639
"well, I thought he was a friend..."

438
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,975
"he humiliated me... "he was being a totally jerk...

439
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,476
"downright cruel to me...

440
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:29,279
"and after I've spent the past three years

441
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,214
"making him look good, he trashes me,

442
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,550
"my blog and all of you.

443
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,919
"that jerk has everything.

444
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:39,222
Why would he put down the one thing that's mine?"

445
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,649
Why is she still here? didn't willie tell you to fire her?

446
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,517
She did, and I tried,

447
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:09,453
But I couldn't bring myself to do it, marc.

448
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:12,389
This means so much to her. ohh. really?

449
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:15,325
Yeah. what does your job mean to you?

450
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,228
If willie comes in here and sees her

451
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:20,530
Hastily stitched-together head sitting behind that desk,

452
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,500
Helen's not the only one who's gonna be out of a job. ooh, who else?

453
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,469
Bring it. what did you hear?

454
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:27,871
Y--just fire her. you have no choice.

455
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:32,876
Hey, amanda, could you help me with something on the computer? um...

456
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,911
Sure.

457
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:38,315
I'll do it later!

458
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,850
Hi, foxy.

459
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:41,585
Betty suarez.

460
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,720
Mija, have you checked your blog today?

461
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,822
No. I just got in.

462
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,924
Ah! 500 hits!

463
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,243
Look at all these comments!

464
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,762
Yeah, they're all about how your "jackass friend"

465
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,497
Is really daniel meade. oh, my god.

466
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,899
And it's linked to, like, a hundred web sites.

467
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,734
How did this happen?

468
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:00,237
Why did you write about that? I told you not to.

469
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:03,540
I know, papi. I know. what do I do? all right, just calm down.

470
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:10,614
And he's not usually that into the web, so maybe he didn't.

471
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:13,116
So any time your name appears in the media,

472
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,119
You'll hear a little bing! and receive a google alert. cool.

473
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:20,123
Oh.

474
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:25,529
Nope.

475
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,275
He definitely saw it.

476
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,991
Betty, what were you thinking

477
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,060
Posting a rant like that about me?

478
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,495
It was thoughtless

479
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,597
And inappropriate and--and just stupid.

480
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,299
You know whenever the media sees my name, it's a feeding frenzy.

481
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,268
I didn't even use your name, daniel.

482
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,171
Someone else figured it out. well, you didn't make it hard.

483
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,573
Oh, my god! the new proofs just came in,

484
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:52,675
And--hi. awkward.

485
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,512
Look, daniel, I'm sorry,

486
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,480
But this is all gonna blow over fast.

487
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:59,649
You've had way worse written about you,

488
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:02,152
About how you were a womanizer--

489
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah, but when they call me a womanizer,

490
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,989
At least it sounds sexy. you just made me sound like a jerk.

491
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:07,891
Daniel, suzuki, tmz

492
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:10,660
And something called "the new york times"

493
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:12,896
Are all on the line for you. what should I do?

494
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,298
I'll deal with it. thanks a lot, betty.

495
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:21,538
Hey.

496
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:25,074
Oh, I'm--i was just practicing my moves. there's a contest.

497
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,343
Can I talk to you?

498
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,246
Oh, my god. you know I lied.

499
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,451
The truth is...

500
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:37,420
My mom kicked me out.

501
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:40,223
I've been living under a turntable at butter.

502
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:41,758
My new eyes stink.

503
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,494
I can only see out of the left corner of the right eye.

504
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,229
And I'm--i'm not 30.

505
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:49,265
I'm 31.

506
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,267
I just didn't want to tell you,

507
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:54,704
'cause I didn't want you to feel bad for me.

508
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:56,739
That's not what you wanted

509
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:00,009
To talk to me about, is it?

510
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:02,212
What is it?

511
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,614
It's okay.

512
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,750
I just wanted to tell you that, um...

513
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:16,893
You got oted to...

514
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:20,496
Overseer of the closet? that sounds major.

515
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:24,701
So major, which is why I need you to always be in here

516
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:28,037
And never be seen anywhere else in the office. okay.

517
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,774
Okay. so your first assignment... okay.

518
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,810
Is, um...

519
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:37,614
To read this cover to cover.

520
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,149
Yet other incentive to get my eyes redone.

521
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:44,053
Okay.

522
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,589
Oh!

523
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:53,930
Mm. hi, everybody.

524
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:56,199
Ms. slater, i-i didn't expect you to be

525
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:59,102
Such a strong supporter of breast cancer awareness.

526
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,571
We girls have to stick together.

527
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,773
Now I must be going, so ta-ta.

528
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:07,277
Or should I say, ta-tas?

529
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,945
Oh, my.

530
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:13,383
That will bring the house down at my office. thanks again.

531
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,952
Safe travels.

532
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:17,954
Nicely done.

533
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:20,323
At 3:00, you'll be giving an empowering speech

534
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:21,925
To that girls troop--

535
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,227
Another legion of fools I'd rather not suffer.

536
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,897
Wow. you're meaner than any version of you I could ever do.

537
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:30,166
Well, I could make an effort to be liked,

538
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,002
But I'd rather be hated than inconvenienced.

539
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:35,471
However, if you stick around and shave again,

540
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,740
Seems I could have it all.

541
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:40,276
No, no, no, no, no. perez, listen to me--

542
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,679
N--l--

543
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:48,985
Hey. look, I know I can't take back what I did,

544
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,788
But I wrote a retraction, and-- really?

545
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:54,724
Does it include an explanation as twhy you did all this?

546
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:57,660
Because that's the one part I really don't get, betty.

547
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:00,730
Look, I know you're mad, and I'm sorry,

548
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,166
But there is a reason that I did it.

549
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,535
You really hurt my feelings.

550
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:08,738
Your feelings? betty, this isn't about your feelings.

551
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:11,374
This is about you doing serious damage to my reputation

552
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,476
As the head of meade publications.

553
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,145
I know you think you and your award

554
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,349
Are the center of the universe, but you have to wake up.

555
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,718
It's not a big deal.

556
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:23,720
Forget it.

557
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,322
Forget my retraction. forget my apology.

558
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:28,891
Forget I ever asked you to present the award,

559
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:29,664
'cause if that's how you feel,

560
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,176
I really don't want you there anyway. 

561
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:34,929
fine. That's the last place I'd ever want to be.

562
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,017
Betty, you're blowing up! it's awesome.

563
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:47,720
With all this extra press, the blobbies are gonna be huge.

564
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,689
And we have the greatest thing planned.

565
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,659
When daniel gets on stage-- daniel's not coming.

566
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,827
B-but he has to. we planned a protest.

567
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:56,863
When daniel gets up to present the award,

568
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:59,332
We're gonna pelt him with pairs of red glasses and burritos.

569
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,734
I know it sounds a little bit offensive,

570
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,937
But only the latinas will throw the burritos,

571
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:05,939
So it's totally p.c. daniel's not coming.

572
00:28:05,973 --> 00:28:08,374
I'll find someone else to present the award.

573
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,866
Really? you can find another celebrity at the last minute?

574
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,245
Well, I don't know about that.

575
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,540
But you said the blobbies weren't about celebrities.

576
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,782
Yeah, but I just said that

577
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:18,184
To sound cool when I thought we had one.

578
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:20,420
We need a celebrity, betty.

579
00:28:20,454 --> 00:28:22,355
Isn't there somebody you can get?

580
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:23,823
"mode" magazine. please hold.

581
00:28:23,857 --> 00:28:26,292
"mode" mag--no. you hold. oh, okay, sorry.

582
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:29,295
Hi. daniel, sorry. okay, I'm coming right now. okay.

583
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,497
Mandy, why did I just see helen in the closet

584
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:33,433
Reading a 4-year-old "marie claire"

585
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,568
And wiping cheeto dust off of her fingers

586
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:38,538
With a vintage prada shift? marc, I tried to fire her, but I couldn't.

587
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,144
And I knew if willie saw her-- what 

588
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:41,941
Happens when she asks about a paycheck?

589
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:44,243
Oh, I give her meade money.

590
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:47,780
Mandy, a fake job and a fake paycheck

591
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:49,682
Aren't helping helen any.

592
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:52,018
And trust me, no good ever came

593
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:54,587
From keeping someone in the closet.

594
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:57,190
Okay, you just got really deep. I know, and now I have a headache.

595
00:28:57,224 --> 00:28:59,826
Oh, it's willie. look busy.

596
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,761
I had such a good time with you girls.

597
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,564
Next time we'll make macadamia nut brownies.

598
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,034
Nice seeing you, girls!

599
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:11,771
Bye, wilhelmina!

600
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:14,073
Oh, that was nice,

601
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:17,844
Watching me bring a smile to all those little faces.

602
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:21,414
Oh! oh, damn my cha-cha heel.

603
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:24,117
Mm.

604
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:26,519
Maybe jlo is good?

605
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:30,657
Ooh! ask wilhelmina. she'd be perfect.!

606
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:33,359
I can't ask her. she doesn't do anything for anybody.

607
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:37,397
We can at least ask. she's gonna crush you.

608
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,832
Ms. slater? what is it, betty?

609
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,835
Um, I'm not betty. of course you aren't. what is it?

610
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,738
My organization--blob-- is honoring betty

611
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:48,641
With a blobby award tonight, and it would mean so much to us

612
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:51,411
If you would present it to her.

613
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:55,314
I'd be delighted.

614
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,949
Really?

615
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:59,452
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

616
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:02,121
See? I told you. thank you.

617
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,090
She's really nice.

618
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:06,292
Why would you agree to that?

619
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,695
Because it's more fun to watch you do it for me.

620
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:10,096
Tonight? I can't.

621
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,031
Why not? I pay you.

622
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,967
And you don't have a show to perform anymore, do you?

623
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,043
So I don't have a super secret job?

624
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:27,547
And these...

625
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:30,483
The supermarket won't take these daniel dollars?

626
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,585
I'm so sorry, helen.

627
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:36,889
It's okay. you've been a good friend, amanda.

628
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,958
And sleeping at butter isn't so bad.

629
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:43,496
Sometimes d.j. omar puts a pillow out for me.

630
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,240
Ah.

631
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:57,176
Is it just me, or does a cold gust of wind

632
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,612
Actually pk up when you approach?

633
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,062
Hey, what are you still doing here?

634
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:18,931
You're gonna be late for betty's big, fat, mexican awards show.

635
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,567
I'm not going. oh, why? because betty didn't want you?

636
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:23,569
No, because I don't want to behere,

637
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:26,839
Not after she humiliated me. only after you humiliated her.

638
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:28,875
Amanda, I wasn't trying to humiliate her.

639
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,977
Besides, it doesn't matter. I'm her boss.

640
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:33,646
It isn't her place to challenge my behavior.

641
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,649
Oh, my god, daniel. you sound like such a douche.

642
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:39,252
Okay, I'm not saying that as your employee.

643
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:42,221
I'm saying it as your fun buddy. and I'm also gonna say that

644
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,223
I think you were trying to humiliate betty,

645
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:47,827
Because you're threatened by her success. I'm threatened by betty?

646
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,829
Yeah. that's crazy.

647
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:52,565
I'm the editor-in-chief of a major fa--

648
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:57,703
Oh, god.

649
00:31:57,738 --> 00:32:00,373
See? I can be very perceptive sometimes.

650
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:02,375
Call me a car.

651
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,377
Sure. where you going?

652
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,787
Thank you so much for inviting me here.

653
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:11,490
It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you all tonight

654
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,993
In celebration of this little lady right here.

655
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:17,663
I love betty suarez...

656
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,631
Who the hell is that? I don't know,

657
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,566
But if you don't talk to grandpa,

658
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,502
She's gonna be your new stepmom.

659
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,104
Because we're all people, aren't we? I give up. I don't care anymore.

660
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,273
This thing has turned into such a train wreck.

661
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:30,208
She thinks it's a train wreck?

662
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:32,644
We're the ones who bought all these burritos for nothing!

663
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,714
I don't even think that's wilhelmina slater. shut up, dawn.

664
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:38,250
Which is why I'm thrilled to be presenting her

665
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:40,252
With this award tonight. excuse me.

666
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:42,120
I think I'm supposed to be presenting this award.

667
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,622
Oh, my god. it's daniel.

668
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:45,524
Yes!

669
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:46,992
He actually showed.

670
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,361
Go for it, honey. I have a show to go to.

671
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,296
She runs a magazine, does a show

672
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:54,232
And still has time to look like that.

673
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,968
Ay, chihuahua.

674
00:32:57,036 --> 00:33:00,172
Don't stress-eat those burritos just yet, you guys.

675
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:03,475
It's about to get really fun.

676
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:09,948
Hey.

677
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:12,584
Hey. how'd it go?

678
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,053
Well, the bad news is, she was crushed. ohh.

679
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:17,656
The good news is, we've got a new roomie.

680
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,991
Hi, doll.

681
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:25,897
Boy, I can't wait to spoon with you tonight.

682
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:29,134
Oh, I'm just kidding. I'm not kidding.

683
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:31,470
Mm. what is that--apricot?

684
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:34,873
Oh, it's--it--it--ohh! huh! mmm.

685
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:37,142
I gotta pee. ohh!

686
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,080
Good evening.

687
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:45,150
Boo! boo!

688
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:46,685
Boo! jerk!

689
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:49,321
I always say, never follow a drag act.

690
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:51,123
I almost didn't come here tonight...

691
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:52,758
We don't want you! yeah, get out of here.

692
00:33:57,463 --> 00:33:59,698
I respect and admire and adore--

693
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:02,434
Also happens to intimidate the hell out of me.

694
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:04,836
This may come as a surprise to her,

695
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:07,806
But it shouldn't have come as a surprise to me.

696
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,377
Betty suarez has done more in three and a half years

697
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:14,746
Than I've done in my entire life,

698
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,649
Which is why I couldn't help but feel a little thatened.

699
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:21,019
Betty is a force of nature--

700
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:24,456
A positive one, like sunshine, but a force nonetheless.

701
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,592
I think we're all very lucky to have her shining on us.

702
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:33,899
Okay, that hurt.

703
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:37,169
Quiet, lady, no one talks over manna wintour.

704
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:46,077
That's right, you bitches better have seen it--

705
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:50,816
AandrÃ© leon talley calls me the biggest woman in fashion.

706
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,553
Obviously, he's taken himself out of the running.

707
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:57,522
I'm sick of your excuses, wilheldiva.

708
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:00,792
If you're not here now, don't bother coming in at all.

709
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:02,427
I'll be there in a second.

710
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:04,763
Oh, give me that phone.

711
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:06,565
Whoa! that was fast.

712
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,167
Oh! thank you, good night!

713
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:11,002
All right!

714
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:13,205
What are you doing? give it up, y'all...

715
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:16,441
I told you never to perform your show again. ms. slater?

716
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,077
I was only gonna do it one more time.

717
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:22,848
Please. this is my life. oh, what do I care about your life?

718
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:26,318
Wilheldiva hater!

719
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,153
Enough with you.

720
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:31,857
Oh, get that thing off me!

721
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:35,126
Get it off! what's going on? is this part of the show?

722
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:37,896
There is no show, honey. I'm no drag queen.

723
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,600
Then why can I see your package from here?

724
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,769
Oh, shut up, claire.

725
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:47,105
We want a show! what?

726
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:49,040
Move it, buddy! get off me!

727
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:50,642
Come on! marc!

728
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:53,178
Oh, come on! get up there. damn! that girl lost weight.

729
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:58,984
Ah, hell.

730
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:01,620
So... go home, loser!

731
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:06,191
It is my great pleasure to present this award

732
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:07,726
To betty suarez.

733
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,362
Go, betty!

734
00:36:10,396 --> 00:36:13,398
Yay, betty! whoo!

735
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:17,569
ââ?oh, here she comes â?

736
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:19,838
ââ?watch out, boy, she'll chew you up â?

737
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:22,107
ââ?oh, here she comes â?

738
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,076
ââ?she's a maneater â?

739
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:27,178
ââ?oh, here she comes â?

740
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:30,415
ââ?watch out, boy, she'll chew you â?

741
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,450
ââ?oh, here she comes â?

742
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:34,052
ââ?she's a maneater â?

743
00:36:34,086 --> 00:36:36,621
ââ?maneater â?

744
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,875
Thank you, daniel.

745
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:54,612
And thank you to everyone

746
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:57,515
At the black and latina organization of bloggers.

747
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,351
Latina? I thought the "l" stood for lesbian.

748
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,254
That's what I thought. as proud as I am to be here today,

749
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,189
I just want to say

750
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,825
That we're not here celebrating me tonight

751
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,662
As much as we're here celebrating what blogs can do.

752
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:15,600
Sure, they can be used to thoughtlessly attack people

753
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:20,605
From a seemingly safe vantage point,

754
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,074
Which is very regrettable.

755
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,979
But they can also make it possible

756
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:31,148
For someone who has something to say

757
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:35,319
But doesn't have a tv station or a major magazine

758
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:38,256
To still make their voice be heard,

759
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,558
And I think that's really important,

760
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,427
Even if it is just 71 people listening.

761
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:46,063
Actually, it's 72.i .

762
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,533
Let her talk, jerk! please don't be mad at daniel.

763
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:53,104
All he did in his interview

764
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,740
Was remind me of who I used to be,

765
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,643
And that was really embarrassing.

766
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:03,714
But now I realize that I have to love that girl that I was

767
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:07,351
Because she made me who I am now.

768
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:11,656
That's why none of you should be ashamed of who you are.

769
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,693
Because the misfits and the weirdos of today

770
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:19,330
Are the world changers of tomorrow. who says we're weirdos?

771
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah! oh, that's not what I meant.

772
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,168
Homophobe! get her! I didn't--aah! aah!

773
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,237
Betty, get down. run!

774
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:34,445
ââ?and as years go passing by â?

775
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,783
ââ?if I still can catch his eye â?

776
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,686
ââ?and his love runs deeper â?

777
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,924
ââ?than he thought he could â?

778
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:50,461
ââ?then I'll act like a woman â?

779
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:54,899
ââ?and he's got a woman â?

780
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,968
ââ?who acts â?

781
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,537
ââ?like â?

782
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:03,207
ââ?a woman â?

783
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:07,712
ââ?should â?

784
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,792
She's magnificent.

785
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,495
Mm. she seems a little off to me.

786
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,298
Really?

787
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:40,978
I just came by to say thank you.

788
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,514
I've been getting calls all day

789
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,484
Saying that I gave the performance of a lifetime.

790
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,819
Ah.

791
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,888
Is that so?

792
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:55,259
Apparently, I got offstage, demanded and got a raise,

793
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,629
Two additional nights per week and top billing.

794
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,498
Well, you're a very talented performer

795
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:03,401
And a shrewd negotiator.

796
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,003
But why? I thought you didn't want--

797
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,874
Oh, go ahead and do your little show...

798
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,611
On one condition--

799
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,147
That you let me give you a new wardrobe.

800
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:20,651
Wilheldiva hater would never be performing in tatty knockoffs.

801
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,320
I can live with that.

802
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,589
And, uh,

803
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:29,293
I may take one of those nights now and then.

804
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,167
...like her good side and her evil side. she played twin nuns?

805
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,836
Yeah. hey. finished up the interview.

806
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,447
Oh! I thought we were doing that together.

807
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,640
Yeah, well, you inspired me to take my game up a notch.

808
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,975
Besides, I thought you might be able to edit it,

809
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,977
Since you are the editor-in-chief

810
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,247
Of an award-winning blog. I'm gonna go and let you two make love

811
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,917
Or whatever it is you do.

812
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:57,555
It's great. I'm sure it's perfect.

813
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,123
Really?

814
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,359
Um... I would make a few changes.

815
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:04,562
Of course you would.

816
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,031
But not a lot. just a few things,

817
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,999
Like you sort of overwrote the intro.

818
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,503
Uh, is this gonna take a while? no, it's gonna be very quick.

819
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,639
Just small changes like, um...

820
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,576
I don't think you need the intro at all...

821
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,576
