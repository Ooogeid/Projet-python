1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:01,806
Genuine prada.
Ooh.

2
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:04,779
Oh, my god.
$2 a pair in chinatown.

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:05,817
Can you believe it?

4
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:08,325
Hilda, that says "plada."

5
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:09,546
What?

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,573
Eh. Well, my customers
won't know the difference.

7
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:16,858
And since i'm turning my salon
into a salon/boutique,

8
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,111
I gotta sell something.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,301
You know, i thought that
two people living together

10
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,358
Was supposed to be cheaper
than one person,

11
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,949
But how come ever since
amanda's moved in,

12
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,992
I'm paying twice as much? So don't let
her eat your stuff. Put your name on it.

13
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,322
I feel like all i do is work.
I can barely pay my rent.

14
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:41,461
Oh! Which is due tomorrow.
I almost forgot.

15
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,679
Hmm. Is juice moocher
pitching in?

16
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,073
Well, i've been dropping hints
all week.

17
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:48,810
Yeah? Have you tried,
"where's my rent, bitch?"

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,009
No.

19
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:54,270
Look, amanda has been through
some really tough times lately.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,884
She made some bad decisions,
yes,

21
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:59,650
And she got herself
into a lot of debt,

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,055
But i really do think, like,

23
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,619
She's trying
to turn her life around.

24
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:08,684
You will not believe
how much money i saved today.

25
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:12,916
Huge sale.

26
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,842
I had to get up crazy early to
beat the crowds. That's a lie.

27
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,577
I was actually out clubbing,
and i figured, what the hell?

28
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,649
I'll just stay up all night.
It was totally worth it.

29
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:25,025
Um, amanda,
buying stuff on sale-

30
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:28,092
That's not exactly saving money.

31
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:29,934
Isn't it?
No.

32
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:31,581
Isn't it?

33
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:35,235
No, it isn't.
And if you don't mind me asking,

34
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:37,530
Um, how did you pay
for all of this?

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,301
Well, i've been saving so much
money since i moved in with you

36
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,727
That i actually paid off
one credit card.

37
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,444
So i figured i might as well
just treat myself

38
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:48,921
And splurge a little.
Where's the rent, bitch?

39
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,333
Okay.
Amanda-

40
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,169
I gotta go.
And, betty, do not worry.

41
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,154
I'm gonna catch up on my sleep
at work, per yooz.

42
00:01:58,058 --> 00:01:58,944
Bye.

43
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,450
But-

44
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:04,762
Amanda! Amanda.

45
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:07,528
Look, the rent is due tomorrow,
and i need your half.

46
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,393
Okay, and i would love
to give it to you-I would-

47
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,997
But i'm a little bit short. Well,
then why don't you just return

48
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:15,575
All that stuff you bought? Yeah, the
thing is there's no return on sale items.

49
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:16,791
Could you just cover me
this month?

50
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,949
You know i'm good for it.
Amanda, you are not good for it.

51
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,455
Look, it's bad enough i have
to go all the way downtown

52
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:25,112
And pay that creepy,
gross landlord

53
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,538
Who's weird
and leers at me,

54
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,504
But if i have to give him
your half,

55
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,504
Then i'm gonna be
completely wiped out.

56
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,038
Look...

57
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,038
If you want
to keep living with me,

58
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,369
Then you're gonna have
to chip something in.

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,504
I totally get it.

60
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,237
Could you spot me
a subway ride?

61
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,219
What's he doing now?
Talking to some intern,

62
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,571
The one that you made cry. Well,
i can't hide in here all day.

63
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,771
How much longer is
he gonna stand there?

64
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:57,267
I don't know.
What is he saying?

65
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,872
They're too far away.

66
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,547
Well, read their lips.

67
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:03,304
Hang on. Uh...

68
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:07,608
Okay, they're laughing.
Ha ha ha.

69
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh. Laughing at me,
i know it.

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,306
He's telling her

71
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,137
How that remarkably
well-Preserved editor-In-Chief

72
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,137
Tried to get him in the sack.

73
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,404
God, marc.
I feel like such a fool.

74
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:20,202
Willie, wouldn't it be easier
if you just talked to him?

75
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:24,147
Oh! Wait! Wait! Oh! He's on
the move. Now's your chance.

76
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:26,998
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go go.

77
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,705
Hi, wilhelmina.
Shut up!

78
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,542
Wait. He's coming back.

79
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,129
Abort. Abort!
Repeat-Abort!

80
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,677
For god sakes, willie,
get out of there.

81
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:47,994
Wilhelmina, morning.

82
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:50,337
Top o' the morning to ya.

83
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,018
Top o' the morning to ya?

84
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:58,775
I actually said "top o' the morning" to
the man, marc. Oh, don't blame yourself.

85
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:00,193
You should
hear some of the things

86
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:03,986
That come out of my mouth when i'm around
him. And why do i even care what he thinks?

87
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,695
He's just a man...

88
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,617
A man with the most
ruthlessly sharp business mind

89
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,210
I've ever seen,

90
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,085
Impeccable fashion sense...

91
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,304
Tantalizingly large hands.

92
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,113
Excuse me. Wilhelmina?

93
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,118
Oh, dear god.
Is it-Is it time? Marc.

94
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:23,279
It's not in my calendar. Oh,
relax. It's just the baby kicking.

95
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,210
I'm not due
for another couple of months.

96
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,077
Oh.
That's a relief.

97
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:31,293
So, uh, why are you here?

98
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,136
I got my 7-Month checkup
this afternoon.

99
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,021
I just wondered

100
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:37,026
If you might want to make
a surprise appearance.

101
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,119
Christina, i've got a lot
on my mind at the moment.

102
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,374
And one of the reasons
i hired you as my surrogate

103
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:44,012
Was for the fierce independence
of the scottish people.

104
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,693
Your entire country
would be insulted

105
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,350
If i held your hand
at the doctor's office.

106
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:51,236
You're our braveheart.
Our brave uterus.

107
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:55,966
Wilhelmina, one thing
i wanted to mention... oh.

108
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,655
Is this a good time?

109
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:02,641
Connor, it's always a good time
to discuss, uh, business-

110
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,889
Um, "mode" business,
meade business,

111
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,605
Suit business-
Ahem. Shh. Shh.

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,387
I have a marketing presentation
this afternoon at ralph lauren.

113
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,341
It'd be great
if we could do it together.

114
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,818
Darn it all. I have an
important appointment... ooh.

115
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,095
With my surrogate
that i have to attend.

116
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:22,509
Oh, well, that's obviously
much more important.

117
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,336
I'll fill you in
when i get back.

118
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,529
Well, you know where
to find me... mate.

119
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:37,687
Good morning, daniel.

120
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,464
I just want to remind you
that there's only a week left

121
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,730
Till my young editors'
training begins.

122
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,057
Betty, how could i forget?

123
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,196
Betty starts yeti

124
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,684
Oh, well,

125
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:50,477
I want you to know that
my being a part of y.E.T.I.

126
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:53,270
Will not interrupt
my work here at all.

127
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,932
In fact, i am available
for any possible overtime.

128
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,231
Okay, well...

129
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,859
I have some good news
and some bad news.

130
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,335
The bad news is
we're eliminating overtime.

131
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:08,946
Budget cuts. What? Oh, no, no, no,
no, no. Daniel, i need my overtime.

132
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:12,880
The good news is we're looking
for pitches for modeny.Com.

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
Pitches?

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,733
As in, like, articles?

135
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,974
Yep. We're expanding
our digital footprint.

136
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,079
We're gonna need lots
of new content. You're creative.

137
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,502
You'd be perfect. Yes! Yes,
i would. I would be perfect.

138
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,051
I mean, the pay is not that
great. Standard freelance fee.

139
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,547
Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. Fine.
It's fine. I'm fine with that.

140
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,161
Knock knock.
Am i interrupting?

141
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,128
No, we were
just finishing up here.

142
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,728
Hi. I'm molly.

143
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, hi. You must be
connor's fianc?E. Mm-Hmm.

144
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,831
This is, uh, betty,
my assistant.

145
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,803
So we have
that pitch meeting at 3:00.

146
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,969
You better get crackin'.
We'll see ya. Nice to meet you.

147
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,314
Hey.

148
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,461
What's up? I'm having
lunch with connor today,

149
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,185
And it seemed like
the perfect opportunity

150
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:57,766
To hit up all the rich jerks
he works with.

151
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,828
That didn't come out right.

152
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,828
Since i work at a public school,
we're always short of funds,

153
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,828
So every year,
i host a charity auction

154
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,461
To raise money
for school programs.

155
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,095
And you thought you'd hit up
connor's rich jerk friends

156
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,786
For donations? It's a
column "a," column "b" thing.

157
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:16,627
You're not a jerk, but you are
rich, so you qualify.

158
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,861
I would love to help.

159
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:20,861
That's awesome.
Anyhow, it's tonight,

160
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:23,188
And connor can't make it-
Work as usual-

161
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,323
So i was hoping
you could step in.

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,497
Oh. Y-You want me to go?

163
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,527
Well, yeah.

164
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,150
I just thought-You were
so great with my kids at school,

165
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,751
I thought-
I thought you'd have fun.

166
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:37,915
Unless...
you don't want to go.

167
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,491
No, no, no. I was just, uh, i
- I know. It's late notice.

168
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:42,092
I just thought, we'd gotten to be friends
- No, i'd love to.

169
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,492
Okay.

170
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,936
I'll see you tonight.

171
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,394
Great.

172
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,083
Okay.

173
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,368
Oh. Hi.

174
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,385
Hello, dear.

175
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,132
Ooh! There he goes again.

176
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:11,301
Little bugger's
a bloody acrobat.

177
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,910
Though sometimes i think i would
rather keep him in there

178
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,989
Than let wilhelmina
look after him.

179
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,133
You should have seen her
this morning.

180
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:20,573
I swear she is going daft.
I bet.

181
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,933
Oh, look.
Is that those little crackers?

182
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,397
I love these, the little
sesame ones. Mm-Hmm.

183
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,778
Do you mind?

184
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,612
No. Sure.

185
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,397
I haven't eaten since yesterday,
but whatever.

186
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:38,777
What are you talking about?
Money's gotten really tight.

187
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,939
I warned you that that place
was too expensive, didn't i?

188
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,818
You just said
you'd have to eat ramen.

189
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,205
Which would have worked

190
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:48,010
If amanda wasn't eating
all my ramen. And she denies it.

191
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,797
She says there's an old, crazy
man who lives inside my walls

192
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,722
And comes out at night
to eat my food.

193
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,998
She calls him "bad ronald." I've seen
your apartment. She might be right.

194
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,516
I don't know, christina.

195
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:02,483
Moving into that building was
supposed to be like a dream-

196
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,783
My first apartment
in manhattan.

197
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,050
Well, stop fretting.
Live your dream.

198
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,249
Go have a bit of fun.
Enjoy yourself.

199
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,449
I would love to,
but fun costs money.

200
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,449
Ah. It doesn't have to. See,
when i first came to new york,

201
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,420
I didn't have two dimes
to rub together.

202
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,269
But i didn't care.
There i was-Young, free,

203
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,554
Living in the most exciting city
in the world.

204
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:23,701
Oh, i had
a grand old time, eh,

205
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,902
And it usually
didn't cost me a cent.

206
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,540
We really want modeny.Com
to be different.

207
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,491
We're looking for ideas that are
edgy, ahead of the curve-

208
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,920
"Mode" magazine
for the digital age.

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,422
Now the sky is the limit,

210
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:40,326
Which is why i opened up this
meeting to the entire staff.

211
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:42,255
And betty has something.

212
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,756
Thank you, daniel.

213
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:46,622
As we all know, living
in manhattan can be expensive.

214
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,548
Really? I hadn't noticed.

215
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,902
There's no need
to be sarcastic, wilhelmina.

216
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:54,522
No, i honestly never noticed.
Well, it is,

217
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,483
For most of us, so i've come up
with a super fun list

218
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,690
Of things to do in new york
for no money.

219
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,230
I'm calling it "a day
in manhattan on zero dollars."

220
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:05,283
Well, that sounds promising.
What have you come up with?

221
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,414
Well, most museums have
one day a week

222
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:08,603
Where you can go for free,

223
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:13,088
But the national american indian
museum is free every day.

224
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:16,155
Its culturally sensitive
and thought-Provoking exhibits

225
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,417
Include pottery, basketry...

226
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,589
Oh. I thought your pitch was
how to have fun in the city,

227
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:27,489
Not put yourself into a coma.

228
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,164
It is a little dry, betty.

229
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:34,322
Oh, uh, right. Okay, uh,
well, you can, um,

230
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:37,086
Uh, feed the squirrels
in madison square park.

231
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,506
Or you could feed my brain
a bullet.

232
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,988
Okay, well,

233
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:47,086
Maybe marc
and amanda have better ideas.

234
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,304
Uh, for free?
Um, let's see.

235
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:51,496
Oh, i crashed the red carpet
at that tom cruise movie.

236
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,020
He is super short.

237
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,869
But the food at the after party was
beyond. But the average "mode" reader

238
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:01,044
Doesn't really have access to tom cruise. Oh, no.
You would be surprised what you can get away with.

239
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:04,914
Like what? Like i haven't paid
for a drink or a meal in years.

240
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,434
I have a bar tab
of, like, 10 grand.

241
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,491
Now that's an article
for our web site.

242
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:10,626
I love it.

243
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:13,789
"How i blew 10 grand without
actually spending a dime."

244
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,108
Congratulations.

245
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,496
You and amanda just sold
the first article to modeny.Com.

246
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:20,816
Ow! My first sale at "mode."

247
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,580
That was easy.

248

251
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,546
You're not gonna believe this.

252
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:43,393
So we have this huge
pitch meeting today,

253
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:47,552
And they want to use one of my ideas for an
article. Oh, my god! Papi, pick up the phone!

254
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,971
Betty sold a story! No. No. Sort of.
You see, i had this really great idea-

255
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,588
You sold a story? Amazing.
W- W-What is it about?

256
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,794
Well, it was
supposed to be about

257
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:58,174
How to have fun in new york
without spending any money.

258
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,599
Well, you got that
"no money" part down.

259
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,160
Yeah, but the problem is
that amanda glomped on,

260
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:05,018
And now she's got
these crazy ideas

261
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:09,310
About crashing tom cruise's premiere.
You're meeting tomkat? You have to get me in.

262
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,661
No, justin. I'm not meeting
tomkat. Look, the point is,

263
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,426
Amanda wants to turn my idea

264
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,738
Into some wild,
crazy night on the town,

265
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,226
Spending thousands of dollars
of other people's money.

266
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,760
And that's a problem?

267
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:23,268
Well, yes.
"A," it's not my idea,

268
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,800
And "b," she's just
being a mooch again.

269
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,893
Sounds like it might be fun.
Yeah.

270
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:31,401
Yeah. Aunt betty, you gotta go for
it. Okay, let's grip it and rip it.

271
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,973
I gotta go.

272
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,326
Look, if we are
going to do this,

273
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,605
Then there need to be
some ground rules.

274
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,860
One-Nothing illegal,

275
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,770
Two-We can only do things

276
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,827
That normal "mode" readers
can do.

277
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,259
Got it.
No crimes. Real peeps.

278
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,185
Saddle up.

279
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,660
Hello, daniel.

280
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,554
Oh, hey.

281
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:58,664
Hey, which one of these
brings out my eyes?

282
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,696
Oh, big plans?

283
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,460
Oh, no. I'm just helping molly
out with some charity thing.

284
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,393
Oh. Molly.

285
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,393
Shouldn't connor
be doing that?

286
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:09,393
Oh, he's busy.
It's no big deal.

287
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:10,893
Are you sure?

288
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:14,335
A lot of other people she could
have invited instead of you.

289
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,560
I think she likes you.

290
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,580
No.

291
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:21,493
Really?

292
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:24,359
Mm-Hmm. And if i know my son,

293
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:27,373
It's pretty obvious
that you like her, too.

294
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:32,127
Well, i m-There is something
about her that's-

295
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,199
Ow! What the hell, mom?

296
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,822
She's engaged, daniel,
and not just to any man,

297
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:38,816
To your friend

298
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:41,146
And a senior financial officer
at this company.

299
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,997
There is nothing going on
between molly and me.

300
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:47,426
Ow! Stop that.
I am not blind, daniel,

301
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,094
Or stupid.

302
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,264
I...

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,393
Know a thing or two
about infidelity.

304
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:58,016
Don't go down that road.

305
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,194
Okay, this is a fund-Raiser,
not a date.

306
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,736
There's gonna be a lot
of other people around, mom.

307
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:05,919
Mm-Hmm.
And she'll look stunning,

308
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,173
And the booze will be flowing,
and given your weakness

309
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,454
For having sex
in public places...

310
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:13,897
That was only once, and it
wasn't a public place, mom...

311
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,966
Until they moved the truck.

312
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,726
Darling, i'm trying to save you
from a world of heartache.

313
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:23,276
A nothing moment
can turn into something huge.

314
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,309
Just-Just stay away.

315
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,680
Write her a big check.

316
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,893
Okay.

317
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,881
Oh, look at the size
of the feet on that.

318
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,040
Hey, no wonder it feels like

319
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,779
There's a rugby match going on down
there. Look. Oh, yes, yes. I saw it inside.

320
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,086
You didn't even look. I can't
believe you don't want to know

321
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:01,522
If it's a girl or a boy. Call me
old-Fashioned. I want to be surprised.

322
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,010
Yes?

323
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,041
The thunder from down under
keeps asking

324
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,202
When you'll be back. What should
i tell him? Uh, i don't care, marc.

325
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:10,622
Tell him i'm tied up
at the doctor's,

326
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:14,263
Tell him i got hit by a cab,
just tell me when he goes home.

327
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,253
What was all that about?

328
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,584
Nothing.

329
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:23,481
You know, i was thinking,
why rush back to the office?

330
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:25,179
We should talk.

331
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:26,944
Let's, um, grab a drink.

332
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm seven months pregnant
with your child.

333
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,041
Well, you can watch.

334
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,151
I'll drink for all three of us.
Come on.

335
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,674
What was that moisturizer again?

336
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,901
Kanebo sensal.
Isn't it heaven?

337
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,141
Meh. I'm on the fence.
Can i get a few samples?

338
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:49,244
Of course. And the guerlain
lipstick, too. And the h. Couture.

339
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:51,873
How are we doing?

340
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,090
Almost $800.

341
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:55,041
Ooh. It's a start.
Amanda, i know

342
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,757
We're not supposed to be
spending any money,

343
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,667
But doesn't this make you
feel a little bit guilty,

344
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,941
Just walking away with all this
free stuff? Betty, it's fine.

345
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,993
Don't you ever get free samples of ice
cream? Yeah, but then i buy an ice cream cone.

346
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,824
Hmm. Of course you do.

347
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:09,917
There you go.
Thank you.

348
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,791
Time for some new rags.

349
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,690
Thanks.

350
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,852
What do you think?

351
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,960
Well, how much is it?

352
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,990
$2,000?

353
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:33,046
All right, miss plan,

354
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:37,386
How are we gonna pay for this one? Fun
fact-Most stores have a 30-Day return policy.

355
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,357
So you tuck the tag,
wear 'em once, bring it back.

356
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,768
Ah, amanda. That's illegal.

357
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,467
It's immoral,
but mainly it's illegal,

358
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,065
Which violates rule number one.

359
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:49,193
Remember number two?
Real "mode" readers.

360
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:51,015
Is it fair
that only ivanka trump

361
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,933
Gets to wear
dresses like this? No.

362
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,493
Shouldn't frumpy girls
from queens

363
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,897
Get to feel glamorous, too?

364
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:58,023
Isn't that what this article
is all about?

365
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,027
Well, yeah, but...

366
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:03,396
Oh... my... god.

367
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,570
Feel this.
Stop.

368
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,265
Just feel it. It's so soft.
Stop. Stop. Ooh. That is soft.

369
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,604
I know, right?

370
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,638
Wouldn't you love
to wear it... just once?

371
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:14,857
* ain't gonna need
your gloss, gloss *

372
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:18,257
* never gonna need
that cash, cash *

373
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,257
* it's the ride of your life

374
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,495
Every week,
the "village voice"

375
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,582
Lists all the gallery openings
in chelsea.

376
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,780
I always pick the ones
with the ugliest art. Why?

377
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,792
They have the best booze.

378
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,020
They figure
the drunker you are,

379
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,301
The more likely you are to actually buy all
this crap. I actually think this is really neat.

380
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,752
Mnh-Mnh.
Okay, now i'm cutting you off.

381
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,690
* don't even need your friends

382
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:41,790
Are you hungry?

383
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,513
Yeah, actually,
i am, a little. I-

384
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,374
'Cause i just spotted dinner.

385
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,251
* but are we ladies...

386
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:51,149
Oh. No, no, no, no.

387
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,375
Tuck your tag.
What?

388
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,495
Tuck it!
Oh.

389
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:58,629
Hi.

390
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,818
Ciao.
Ciao.

391
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,364
I couldn't help but notice
you looking at us,

392
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,111
And by "us," i mean me.

393
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,836
Were we that obvious?

394
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,724
I apologize.

395
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,397
Are you enjoying the opening?

396
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:11,737
Well, i wasn't...

397
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,432
Until i spotted the two
best-Looking pieces here.

398
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,296
Okay.

399
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,489
A- And, you,

400
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,784
What is, uh,
your favorite piece?

401
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,637
Oh, well, i'm not really
an art kinda...

402
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,650
I mean, i-I like that one.

403
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,508
This? What a coincidence.
I just buy this one.

404
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,118
Really?

405
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,884
We were about to go out and
celebrate his bad taste. Shh.

406
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,684
Would you like to join us?

407
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:37,146
No, thank you.
Absolutely.

408
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,884
Would you mind excusing us
just for one second?

409
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,251
Yeah, of course.

410
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,051
* don't even need a drink

411
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:45,017
Amanda-
Betty, what are you doing?

412
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:48,219
Are you crazy? We don't even
know them. They're strangers.

413
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,496
They could kill us.

414
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,078
Betty, if we're gonna write this
article, we have to live it.

415
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:55,817
That means everything-
Fun, art, fashion...

416
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,051
Sex.

417
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,585
There isn't gonna be any sex.
Isn't there?

418
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:02,130
No, there isn't. Okay,
fine. Then scratch the sex.

419
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,318
But, betty,
i can't do this by myself.

420
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,791
You're the writer.

421
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,797
I thought we were
in this together, partners.

422
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,060
Uh, ladies?

423
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,650
Okay. Yeah.

424
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,650
Let's... grip it
and rip it.

425
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,435
?

426
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:33,594
Ooh. The sound
of clinking ice cubes-

427
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:35,256
It's like a scottish lullaby.

428
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:40,836
Well, here's to
the bundle of, uh,

429
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,531
What's the expression, joy?

430
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:43,998
Oh, cut the crap, wilhelmina.

431
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,960
You haven't even given
a second's thought

432
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,207
To raising this baby

433
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:49,574
Other than its stake
in the meade empire.

434
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:52,694
Oh, that's outrageous.
How can you say such a thing?

435
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,417
Oh, i-I don't know.
I mean, look at this place.

436
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:57,132
It's not even been
baby-Proofed. Dead baby.

437
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:59,584
Dead baby. Dead baby.

438
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,142
Sometimes i wonder if you even
want this child or not.

439
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:06,065
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Is it? Really?

440
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,888
I mean, you weren't even
gonna come with me today

441
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:10,381
Until connor asked you
to go to that meeting.

442
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,527
What exactly is going on
with you two anyway?

443
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,164
You babbled like an idiot
when he walked in.

444
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,499
I do not babble.
Oh, you babbled.

445
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,359
And you've been avoiding him

446
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,785
Ever since you got back
from key largo.

447
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,365
Did something happen?

448
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,098
No.

449
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:29,698
Oh, my god.

450
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:31,098
He didn't-

451
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,731
No, he didn't,
unfortunately.

452
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,998
You like him.

453
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:40,731
So is that so strange,
that a woman like me

454
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,574
Wants someone to spend
the rest of her life with,

455
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,765
Someone
to help raise her child,

456
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,515
Do it right this time?

457
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:51,522
I finally meet the perfect man,
and i can't have him.

458
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:53,351
I may as well
just resign myself

459
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,401
To never having a man around.

460
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,090
Oh, well, i wouldn't do that,

461
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,668
'Cause, uh...

462
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,942
You're having a boy.

463
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:04,300
Really?

464
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,653
Yes, wilhelmina,

465
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:08,286
You are having
a little baby boy.

466
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,865
A boy?
Mm-Hmm.

467
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,874
And then betty rode her
motorcycle into a vat of jell-O.

468
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,688
No. I can't believe you didn't see it.

469
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:25,640
It was all over the internet. It
did get, like, over a million hits.

470
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:32,540
This champagne tastes
so expensive.

471
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,893
Life's too short
to drink cheap champagne.

472
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:39,106
That is so true, claudio.

473
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:41,440
So true.

474
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,605
Did you enjoy your food?

475
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,532
Yes, i did. It was wonderful.
Thank you.

476
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,051
Is something wrong?

477
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:56,124
No. No. Uh, uh, would you
excuse me for just a second?

478
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,545
S.
S.

479
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,949
Oh, no, no. Don't get up.
Please don't do that.

480
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:02,378
Thank you.

481
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:07,883
I'm having a crisis.

482
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:10,945
What's wrong? What happened?
Well, i'm working on my article,

483
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:13,545
And i've been drinking
the most incredible champagne,

484
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:16,139
And i can't enjoy it.
All i'm thinking about

485
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,471
Is how much claudio and luka
spent on it.

486
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,665
Who are claudio and luka?

487
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:22,550
They're the guys
who are buying us dinner.

488
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,170
Oh, and the food, hilda.
You wouldn't even believe it.

489
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,711
And i know we're trying
to spend $10,000,

490
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:31,321
But i just feel so guilty.

491
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:34,042
Well, are claudio and luka
having a good time?

492
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,568
Yeah, i think so. Uh-Huh.
And they're not expecting

493
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:39,807
Some sort of, you know,
payment for dinner?

494
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,011
What?

495
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:42,915
Oh, no. No.

496
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:45,412
If they are, then they're
gonna be disappointed.

497
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,225
Well,
at least one of them will.

498
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,637
So these two guys with money

499
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,099
Take you out
to a fabulous dinner,

500
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,709
Everybody's
having a great time,

501
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:54,619
And you're feeling guilty
because?

502
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:59,693
I don't know. Betty, you deserve to
have fun more than anybody i know.

503
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,469
You spend every dime you make
to live in the city,

504
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:04,294
But you don't live
in the city.

505
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,972
Trust me. All your problems
are gonna be there tomorrow.

506
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:10,160
So will you
please go have some fun?

507
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:11,993
Just be careful, okay?

508
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,693
Okay.

509
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,127
Okay, i will.
Thank you, hilda.

510
00:23:21,554 --> 00:23:24,361
So where are
luka and claudio?

511
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,036
They had to go make
some business calls. Oh.

512
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:29,112
I got us another bottle.
They won't mind.

513
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,858
They're, like, international
financiers or something.

514
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,066
You know, amanda,

515
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,410
I have to admit, when daniel
teamed us up on this,

516
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,117
I was a little upset
and a lot skeptical,

517
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,925
But everything's
really turned out okay.

518
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,415
Thank you.

519
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:49,158
To spending 10 grand.
And to my roommate.

520
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,035
If nothing else,

521
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:53,347
You make my life
very interesting.

522
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,127
Of course i do.

523
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,860
The gentlemen said
you would take care of this.

524
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:01,260
Um, what?

525
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,960
Oh, my god.

526
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:12,517
They stuck us with the bill.

527
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,513
They stiffed us.

528
00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:21,903
And i never even
saw it coming.

529
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,566
They're good.

530
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,678
Oh, my god.
Amanda, we can't pay this.

531
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,501
Oh, well, at least we hit
our target number. High-Five.

532
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,672
What are we going to do?

533
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:34,286
The final option-
Dine and dash.

534
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:38,030
No. You can't just walk out
on the bill. That's illegal.

535
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,817
Is it?
Yes.

536
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,913
Is it really? Yes. Stop doing
that. All right, i gotta think.

537
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:44,799
Gotta think.
Think, betty, think.

538
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:47,053
There's gotta be
something i can do.

539
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:51,791
Whenever you're ready.

540
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,988
Oh, excuse me?

541
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,562
Can i talk to your manager?

542
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,070
I got your message.
You got a check for me?

543
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,136
Uh, yeah. Uh, right here.

544
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:11,393
Is that sweet and sour?
Can i? Sure. Help yourself.

545
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:13,858
They feed you these tiny
hors d'oeuvres at this thing.

546
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:16,524
I always end up starved.
Uh, so here you go.

547
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:19,947
I just-I feel really terrible
about canceling on you tonight.

548
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:22,243
Mm-Hmm.
Honestly.

549
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,613
Really terrible?

550
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:24,896
Really terrible.

551
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:28,304
Write me a bigger check.
What?

552
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,683
I find a little guilt
is always good

553
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:33,860
For squeezing a little extra
cash out of you rich jerks.

554
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,699
There's a fork here,
if you need it.

555
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,527
Please.
I'm a master with these things.

556
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,295
Damn.

557
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:44,536
There is no shame
in using a fork.

558
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,966
At least you have time to go
home and change. Oh, forget it.

559
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,169
Are you kidding?
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

560
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:54,261
I'm always covered in paint,
paste and puke anyway.

561
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,221
Come on.

562
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,649
What?

563
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:00,352
Come with me. I'm not letting
you go out looking like that.

564
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,999
Is there a problem?

565
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:05,999
No. Actually, um,
quite the contrary.

566
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,098
I'm betty suarez,
"mode" magazine.

567
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:11,331
This is my colleague,
amanda tanen-Sommers.

568
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,465
Hi.

569
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:14,698
We're doing a profile
on your restaurant

570
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:16,933
For our new web site
modeny.Com.

571
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,732
Really? You work at "mode"?

572
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:22,353
Oh, she's in disguise.
It helps us keep a low profile.

573
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:25,941
Anyway, modeny.Com is
dedicated to celebrating

574
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:28,231
The most hip, edgy,

575
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:30,568
Ahead-Of-The curve things
in new york city,

576
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:34,262
And we'll be featuring you
prominently this month.

577
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,572
Why don't i
take care of this?

578
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:00,179
Oh, my god.

579
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,368
I can't believe
you pulled that off.

580
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:05,233
I know! Me neither!
Oh, gosh.

581
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:07,079
We are going to promote
the heck out of them

582
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,087
In our article.

583
00:27:08,087 --> 00:27:12,064
Whatevs. The point is,
you kicked ass, betty suarez.

584
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,455
I kinda did. I'm tired.
Can we go home?

585
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:17,507
Oh, yeah. We might as well.
We can't top that. Wait.

586
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,016
Wait. That's weird.

587
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:22,447
What? Nothing. I can't find my wallet.

588
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,192
I think those guys
stole my wallet.

589
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,320
No! Those jerks!

590
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,886
What-
Should i call the police?

591
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:30,409
Ths e's one more thing.

592
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,765
What? You know how you
hate paying the landlord

593
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:35,398
Because he creeps you out?

594
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:37,885
Uh-Huh. This morning i f-I felt
bad because i didn't have my half,

595
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:40,841
So i thought i would jus do you a favor
and drop it off. Aat are you saying?

596
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,091
Thd than daniel
gave this assignment,

597
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:43,229
And i never had time to go-

598
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,984
?

599
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:50,149
No. No, no. It's got to beinhe??

600
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:53,686
Oh my god

601
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:57,739
It's not in there oh my god

602
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,894
Oh. ??

603
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:02,306
Well,
we'll jul go to an a.T.M.T.

604
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,842
No, you don't understand.
That was all i had.

605
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,163
That was everything.

606
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,004
I can't pay my rent
this month.

607
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,039
We'll pay the rent next month.

608
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,100
What are they gonna do, kick
us out? Yes. Yes, amanda.

609
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,188
That's what happens
when you don't pay the rent.

610
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:19,678
What planet do you live on?
I knew this was a bad idea.

611
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:22,246
Wait. This wasn't
all my idea, partner.

612
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:25,438
It's not just tonight, amanda.
It's everything.

613
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:28,391
You really don't take
responsibility for anything,

614
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:29,617
Do you...

615
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,590
Not when you run up my bills

616
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,304
Or let your dog pee on my clothes or eat all my food
- That was bad ronald.

617
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,865
There is no bad ronald!

618
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:42,199
It's you, bad amanda!

619
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,700
Wait, betty.

620
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:11,037
Now i'm gonna lose
my apartment.

621
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:13,243
I'm gonna be homeless.

622
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,534
Mija, you'll always
have a home here.

623
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:18,681
I know. I just...
i don't know how i let myself

624
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:22,458
Get sucked into amanda's
black hole of irresponsibility.

625
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:24,553
So stupid.

626
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,933
Don't be so hard
on yourself...

627
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,497
Or her.

628
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,516
She didn't mean
for the money to be stolen.

629
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:34,097
Of course she didn't mean
for the money to get stolen.

630
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:37,895
It's just typical amanda.
She doesn't care about anything

631
00:29:37,895 --> 00:29:39,857
'Cause she's never had to
work hard for anything.

632
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:42,848
She thinks life is one big night
on the town, but it's not.

633
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,369
Life is hard.

634
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:47,699
Betty, your mother and i
worked very hard

635
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,703
To raise you to be responsible.

636
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:53,149
Sometimes i think
we did too good a job.

637
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:56,091
What do you mean?

638
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:58,804
Sweetie, i know
you're angry at amanda,

639
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:03,889
But i think there's something
that you can learn from her.

640
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,545
Let me make you
something to go.

641
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,410
I was thinking about
naming him abelard.

642
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,929
Oh, my god.
I hope you're joking.

643
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:30,352
Well,
what would you suggest?

644
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,758
I've always been quite fond
of hamish.

645
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:35,109
Lovely. Why not angus?

646
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,169
Nothing wrong with angus.

647
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,865
I had a lovely tussle in the hay
with an angus once.

648
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,182
I'm having a son.

649
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,379
Sorry i spilled the beans.

650
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:48,706
I know you wanted
to be surprised.

651
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,690
That's not it. It's...
i just didn't want to know.

652
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,792
It's easier to think of him
as an "it"

653
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,767
Than a-
As a little boy or girl

654
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,599
Whose life i can screw up

655
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,988
Like i did my daughter's.

656
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,759
Well, hey, you've been given
another chance.

657
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,354
Just don't do anything stupid,

658
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:08,463
Like naming him abelard.

659
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,009
Daniel.

660
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,439
A size 6?

661
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,542
All right.
All right. Not a problem.

662
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,653
Well, just look on the rack
on the right.

663
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,544
Okay. Bye.

664
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,718
Uh, what was that about?

665
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,524
Uh, daniel just wanted
to get into the closet.

666
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:36,833
Well,
daniel is not a size 6.

667
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,301
No, he's not.

668
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:40,352
Had to get a dress
for connor's fianc?E molly.

669
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:42,752
She's going
to some charity-Do.

670
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:45,158
And daniel is helping her?

671
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,718
I guess so.

672
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:50,928
Interesting.

673
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:53,555
Take your pick.

674
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:54,905
Seriously?

675
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,728
What are you,
my fairy godmother?

676
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,910
Nope. Just the boss.

677
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,592
Oh, my god.

678
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,735
What do you think?

679
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:08,926
I think you have good taste.

680
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:11,766
Turn around.

681
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:18,326
Just don't let the paparazzi

682
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,973
Take photos of you
in that dress.

683
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,326
That's supposed to be
our march cover.

684
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:26,218
Do i even want to know
how much this thing costs?

685
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,012
Depends.

686
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:31,560
You plan on using chopsticks
tonight?

687
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:34,226
Forget i asked.

688
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,423
Okay.

689
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,909
What do you think?

690
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:54,624
Um, that works.

691
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:57,608
It's not too much? I don't
usually wear things like this.

692
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:02,536
No, it's, uh, it's amazing.

693
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,816
Oh. Can you...

694
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,692
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

695
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,326
I need to go.

696
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,282
Thank you for the dress.

697
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:10,023
What if the restaurant manager
hadn't comped your meal?

698
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,844
Then i guess
she would have realized

699
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:15,139
I was trying to pay with
my queens college student i.D.

700
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,112
It's great, betty.

701
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:23,794
It's exactly the kind of piece
we need for the web site. Really?

702
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:25,138
People are gonna eat that up.

703
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:27,776
It's so much more than
just a list of things to do.

704
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:29,551
It's got a moral.
It goes a lot deeper.

705
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:33,662
You guys seem like you had
a blast. We did. We did...

706
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:36,641
In a sleazy,
scammy sort of way.

707
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:38,890
I guess i have amanda
to thank for that.

708
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,429
So i guess you wouldn't mind
working with her again?

709
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:44,670
Oh. Um...
i don't know about that.

710
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,760
Because i gotta tell you,
this story is gonna make

711
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,587
An excellent regular feature
on our web site. Seriously?

712
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:51,805
Sure. Think about it-

713
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:54,161
You and amanda out on the town
every week,

714
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:57,250
Having some
new kind of crazy adventure.

715
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,804
You have a great dynamic.
The budget's pretty tight,

716
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,932
But i could probably
float you an advance

717
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:04,336
If it sweetens the deal
and helps pay your rent.

718
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:06,860
Oh, it would. It would.

719
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,453
Oh, god. Thank you, daniel.

720
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,828
You know, you should have fun.

721
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:13,599
Just, um, make sure
to stay out of trouble.

722
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,311
Got it.

723
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:17,478
On second thought,

724
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:20,683
I guess a little trouble's
not too bad, huh?

725
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,293
Where's amanda?

726
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:56,438
I don't know.
She left early.

727
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,835
I'm just covering
the phones.

728
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:02,271
Amanda!
Gotta go, betty.

729
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,304
Amanda,
i have to talk to you.

730
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,870
Sorry, i have no time.
What?

731
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,475
Oh, my god.
Why are you in such a rush?

732
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,719
Let go!

733
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,588
No. Give it back.

734
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:19,904
What are you wearing?

735
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,449
Don't look at me.
I'm a freak.

736
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:26,505
Amanda,
you got a second job?

737
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:33,571
Betty, last night
wasn't all your fault.

738
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:36,571
Well, it was a little bit
your fault,

739
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:38,571
But it was mostly my fault.

740
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,071
I don't know.

741
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:42,171
I would say it was
more like 70-40, me.

742
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,571
The thing is, you're right.

743
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:49,561
I should care more about
what's important to you...

744
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:53,474
Like paying
my half of the rent.

745
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:56,528
I gotta go.

746
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,702
I had fun.

747
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,285
What?

748
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:02,031
Last night, i had fun.

749
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,465
I've been working so hard

750
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:06,909
To pay for my fabulous
single life in manhattan,

751
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:09,505
I haven't really lived it...

752
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,783
Until you forced me to go out
last night and have fun,

753
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,605
And i did, so...

754
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,904
Thank you.

755
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:18,706
Sure.

756
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,270
I had fun, too.

757
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,549
So... that happened.

758
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,872
Oh, by the way,
daniel loved our article.

759
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,872
So... there's
a little extra cash in it,

760
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:32,905
And we're not gonna lose
our apartment.

761
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:35,375
So i can quit my job
in clown hell?

762
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,971
No.

763
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:45,965
You do not want to know
what i had to do to get this.

764
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,933
Okay, i'll tell you.
No, no.

765
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:49,822
Oh, but i had
a really good quip.

766
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:54,598
Damn.
I was hoping for some skin

767
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,215
Fr-You know, from daniel.

768
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:59,297
No, this is better than i
could ever have imagined.

769
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,816
You don't even have them doing
the nasty. Uh, no. Stop it. Freeze.

770
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,606
You see the way
daniel's looking at her?

771
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:07,452
The way betty looks
at a cheeseburger.

772
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:08,891
I've been looking
for the wedge

773
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,845
To drive between connor and that
sweet little schoolmarm,

774
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,899
And daniel has
just given it to me.

775
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:18,651
He's falling in love with her.
And i'm back in the game.

776
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,257
What's all this business?

777
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:47,796
Well, i figured after
a long day of hard work,

778
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:51,034
You might be tired
and a little hungry.

779
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,551
Oh, also...

780
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,848
A gift?

781
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:01,666
For me?

782
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:07,755
You know,
'cause yours got stolen,

783
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,074
And you need somewhere
to keep your rent money.

784
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:14,022
Betty, this is prada.

785
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:17,190
Actually, it's plada.

786
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,565
Thank you.

787
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:27,168
Can we eat?

788
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:28,538
Yes

789
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,098
How is work?

790
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:40,648
