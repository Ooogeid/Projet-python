Guys!Anyone home?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,440
I could use a little help

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,450
betty?

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,210
You all right?

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,400
It's okay if you're not.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,260
-We have a nurse now.
-What?

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,670
Betty,meet elena.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,170
Oh,hi!

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,950
It's nice to meet you.

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,040
so nice to meet you,too.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,740
well,we're happy to have you here.

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,110
The lady at the medicaid office said you were the best nurse in all of queens.

17
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,240
That's my cousin stella.She exaggerates.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,970
I'm not the best.

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,550
Maybe top five.

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,180
just two boxes,mija?

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,050
Papi!Papi,I will get it done.

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,220
It's just gonna take some time.

23
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,200
And besides,I can't really move out of my apartment

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,540
until I find seone to sublet it,and it's not easy to find someone you trust.

25
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,710
I'll move in with amanda.

26
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,850
No!

27
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,730
Can wet least talk about it?

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,970
no!

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,140
Well,you better choose carefully.

30
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,860
You don't want a crazy person living in there.

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,480
You mean another crazy person?

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,650
See,amanda just bought her dog a watch because she says he's always late.

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,930
Oh,elena,I just got this new conditioner in.

34
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,590
Do you like your hair to smell like fruit?

35
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,420
Mija,you've been taking a long time with this move.

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,600
Are you sure you're okay with coming home?

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,120
Yes,I want to be here.

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,720
I want to be close to you guys.

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,840
And,you know,with all the money I'm saving,

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,040
it's really gonna help around here.

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,870
That's the water for my tea.

42
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,370
-No!
-Papi,sit down,please.

43
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,710
Betty,I got it.

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,000
You go finish what you gotta do.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,880
Really?

46
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,860
Okay,well,then I'm just gonna he back into the city

47
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,110
'cause amanda and i are interviewing roommates.

48
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,880
I'll see you tomorrow.

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
Elena,we're so glad you're here.

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,440
Thank you.Bye,papi.

51
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,070
-Bye!
-Bye!

52
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,420
You got great kids.

53
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,540
I do,thank you.

54
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,780
Dameeso.

55
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay,here's the deal--

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,970
They all worry about me too much.

57
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,340
That's the real reason why you're here.

58
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,770
I,um,don't need any help.

59
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,540
yeah,I can see that.

60
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh,I barely use this stuff.

61
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,690
Trust me...

62
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,840
this'll be the easiest job you've ever had.

63
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,410
here you go.

64
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,590
hanks.

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,700
excuse me!

66
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,630
Did you just toss your change in the garbage?

67
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,640
No.

68
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,520
Liar,you totally did.

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
What?It was 7 cents.I hate pennies.

70
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,780
Do you hate nickels,too,rich jerk?

71
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,630
come on!

72
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,410
Rich jerk is cute.

73
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,800
How about "R.J." For short?

74
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,990
Okay,I'm gonna come up with a nickname for you.

75
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,380
I'll let you know what I come up with.

76
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,070
have a seat for a second.

77
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,520
Look,I...

78
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,100
I don't want there to be any secrets between us.

79
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,820
Tone change.

80
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,250
You're-- you're getting serious?

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,520
Connor has started seeing wilhelmina.

82
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,410
He doesn't know I know.

83
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,650
Are you okay?

84
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,900
You know what?

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,790
I am.

86
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,880
In fact,I hope they're happy.

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,540
So does this mean we can tell connor about you and me?

88
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,140
We should.

89
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,650
I think I should be the one to tell him.

90
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,690
And I think it should be soon.

91
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,320
Better than him finding out some other way.

92
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,910
I mean,can you imagine how awful it would be

93
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,530
if he saw that photo of us on "page six"?

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,090
Darling,great news.

95
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,070
Just got off the phone with graydon.

96
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,980
He got us our favorite table at the waverly inn.

97
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,440
That's great.

98
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,400
Well,they bumped jennifer aniston.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
She always cries at that table.

100
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,600
Everything okay?You...

101
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
seem a bit distracted.

102
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,480
No.

103
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,070
Thonly thing distracting me tonight is you.

104
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,320
and that budget report I forgot to review.

105
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,220
Well,you can do it tomorrow.

106
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,040
It's my first meeting of the morning.

107
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,910
And it's getting late.

108
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,070
I've gotta go.

109
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,830
But I-I just made reservations.

110
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,310
I'm sorry,willie.

111
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,800
I tell you what,I'll book a table for tomorrow night.

112
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,970
I'll see you at work.

113
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,420
you're perfect.

114
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,050
And I love what you're wearing.

115
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,180
I'm gonna borrow it tomorrow when you move in,okay?

116
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,840
uh,just real quick.

117
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,460
It says here you've lived in five different places in two years?

118
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,330
Yeah,e,we're looking for someone a little bit more stable,

119
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,070
but thanks for stopping by.

120
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,520
Couh,okie to go?

121
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,220
not a problem!

122
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,200
I like to walk around naked,too.

123
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,920
Yeah,but,see,I own the furniture,and I'm not really down with that.

124
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,500
So...

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,110
cookie?

126
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,280
Smile!

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,300
you're perfect.

128
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,880
-No,you're not.
-You're perfect!

129
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,670
Cookie?

130
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,910
she is missing her 2006 tax return.

131
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,120
That's a security risk.

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,220
But she is so pretty.

133
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,370
But yet not pretty enough for me to feel threatened by her.

134
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,360
You know what?I don't think I'm interested anymore.

135
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,810
Halston,ew.

136
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,750
Ew.

137
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,200
Betty,why are you being so picky?

138
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,510
Except for tiny-baby-teeth girl,I could've lived with any of these people.

139
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,570
Amanda,my name is still on the lease.

140
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,830
We have to find someone who's responsible,you know,

141
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,520
who can pay the rent on time,that sort of thing.

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,270
You were always good at boring stuff like that.

143
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,160
Oh,man...

144
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,660
I am really gonna miss this place.

145
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,350
It's like I had this fantasy of what my life would be like here.

146
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,290
Now it's ending before it even started.

147
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,040
speaking of things that never started...

148
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,320
move.

149
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,910
jesse.

150
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,390
I'd bet you'd like to smash that guitar over his bedhead.

151
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,980
No,I don't hate him.

152
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,490
Well,you should.He totally led you on.

153
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,650
Did he?

154
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,730
I mean,it's not like he knew that I threw that party on the roof just so that his band could play.

155
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,360
And to be fair,I never even told him that I liked him.

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,990
So then why have you been acting all weird and avoid-y for the last month?

157
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,680
I don't know.

158
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,960
You should go talk to him right now.

159
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,530
I can't do that.

160
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,630
Yes,you can.

161
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,710
Well...

162
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,390
I mean,I guess I should talk to him,you know?

163
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,420
Just--before I leave,to clear the air.

164
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,180
Totally.

165
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,590
Okay,yeah.Closure.

166
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,110
okay,I gotta run.

167
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,780
Betty,this is very big of you.

168
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,350
And unlike in the past,I mean that as a compliment.

169
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,100
Jesse!

170
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,790
Betty,hey,how are you?

171
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,920
Good,good.

172
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,370
why are you practicing in the hallway?

173
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,950
Well,I just repainted my kitchen.

174
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,500
There was a grease fire gone wild,so...

175
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,540
don't ask.

176
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,360
Lots of people coming in and out of yr apartment.

177
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
Yeah,we're looking for a subletter.

178
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,410
I'm moving out.

179
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,990
Wha--why?

180
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,230
Well,my dad had a heart attack,and...

181
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,940
oh,my god.Is he okay?

182
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,720
Y-yeah,he's better now.

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,450
And I'm just moving back to help out.

184
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,260
You're such a good person.

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,620
Wow,I cannot believe you're leaving.

186
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,440
I feel like we haven't seen each other in forever.

187
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,690
I know.

188
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,020
A-and I was,uh,just thinking,you know,we should talk about--

189
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,030
we definitely need to have a farewell drink.

190
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,840
-A drink?
-Sure.

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,110
Yeah,I'd invite you to my place,but,you know,fumes...death.

192
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,260
Yeah,well,we can hang in my place if you'd like.

193
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,570
Perfect.Yes.

194
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,590
-All right.
-Cool.

195
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,530
you can call my mom if you don't believe me.

196
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,550
I went to ballet camp two summers in a row.

197
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,600
Okay,okay,I believe you.

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,850
I missed you,betty rocker.

199
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,820
Where you been?

200
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,020
Well,about that,um...

201
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,670
so remember that night on the roof?

202
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,500
Of course you remember it.

203
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,460
that was kind of an awkward night for me.

204
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,450
what?

205
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,330
No,no,I think sometimes,you and I,we share a brain.

206
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,850
'Cause I totally--I have a song called "awkward night.

207
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,720
" Oh,you do?

208
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,500
Let me...

209
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,570
it's,like,uh...

210
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,540
*it was an awkward night we had that crazy fight *

211
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,620
* I want to make things right *

212
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:50,140
* gonna call you tonight hello,it's me...*

213
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,540
wow,it's like your lips aren't even moving.

214
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,120
Oh,that...

215
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
yeah,that's my ringtone.

216
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,780
Slow down,betty.

217
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,630
There.

218
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,300
That's you!

219
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,730
do you have to get that?

220
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,570
Uh,nope.

221
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,770
It's someone I'm avoiding.

222
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry,you-- you were saying something

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,830
before I interrupted you with that stupid song,so...please.

224
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,240
it's all very embarrassing for me,but before I leave--

225
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,020
I-I hate that you're not gonna be here anymore.

226
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,020
You know,your family is so lucky to have you.

227
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,690
Okay,stop.

228
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,660
No,no,I mean it.

229
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,160
I-I-I-I know I feel better when you're around.

230
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
I can't believe iw latet got.

231
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,290
-I should--I should-- I gotta get going,so...
-yeah,definitely.

234
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,110
good morning,sunshine.

235
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,300
Amanda...

236
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,170
what happened?

237
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,410
I fell asleep on the couch?

238
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,650
I guess so.

239
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,690
I'm just getting home myself.

240
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,250
How was your talk with jesse last night?

241
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,400
it was good.

242
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
It was...really good.

243
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,930
Um,we were talking,and,y know,everything was going great,and then...

244
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,240
he kissed .

245
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
what?

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,070
Okay.

247
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,850
Where is he?How is he?What's he packing?

248
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,200
No,no,he left after we kissed.

249
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,750
Wait,betty,what happened?

250
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,680
Was it your breath again?

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,390
No,I told him I had to get up early to go to work.

252
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,020
It was all very confusing.

253
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,690
Why?

254
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,180
You had the kind of date any fourth grader would die for.

255
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,870
Look,thought he didn't like me after all that "mode" after party stuff.

256
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,540
And then he kisses me?

257
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,520
What is that?

258
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,710
Okay,squeaky,this one is a toughie.

259
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,790
But before we go any further,we need a male point of view.

260
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,210
Okay,so I couldn't find a male point of view,but I did find marc.

261
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,830
First question-- where did jee kiss you?

262
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,390
On my couch.

263
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,530
And that's not a euphemism for,uh...

264
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,990
No!Oh,good.Move on.

265
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,870
Is it possible that he was just licking guacamole off our chin?

266
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,140
You are known to have food situations.

267
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,630
Nope,I wasn't even eating.

268
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,580
Not eating?

269
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,260
This story is getting more and more preposterous.

270
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,570
Okay,next question-- number of drinks consumed.

271
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,830
three?

272
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,060
I'm having a little trouble visualizing.

273
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,330
We need to recreate the scene.

274
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,770
The scene of the crime.

275
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,420
Okay,betty,pretend I'm jesse.

276
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,520
Come here and sit on daddy's lap.

277
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,960
-No.
-Okay,I'll be betty.

278
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Guys,I wasn't sitting on his lap.

279
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
hola,jesse.

280
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,280
Hey,betty,I'm such a sensitive singer/songwriter.

281
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,850
I'm awesome.

282
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,140
You wanna watch me...

283
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,060
play my guitar?

284
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,390
I'd rather make out with you.

285
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,160
Well,I have had a few drinks.

286
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay.

287
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,270
okay,I've reached a conclusion.

288
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,820
as have I.

289
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,780
If jesse was able to get past all of this...

290
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,880
then...

291
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,360
maybe there's something between you!

292
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,530
-Agreed.
-Really?

293
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,260
Or he could've just been drunk off his ass.

294
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,350
Agreed.

295
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,660
okay,it's 9:00 A.M.You know what that means.

296
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,470
Yeah,time for my morning nap.

297
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,420
Nope.Your morning walk.

298
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,850
Morning walk?It's 30 degrees outside.

299
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,010
Not up for discussion.

300
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,010
-What?
-Come on.Get up.

301
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,550
Now wait a minute.Come on.Hilda!

302
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,640
What?

303
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,100
-Elena wants me to go for a walk.Do you realize how cold it is outside?30 degrees,mama!
-I just want to take him for a little walk.He needs the fresh air!

304
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,530
Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey,hey,hey!

305
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,730
Papi,it's just a walk,right?

306
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,940
We'll all go!

307
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,080
Justin,we're going for a walk!

308
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,190
So jesse kissed you,huh?

309
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,900
Big wow.

310
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,640
And,I mean,I was trying to close that door,but then he went and opened it all back up.

311
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,530
And that's just gonna make it harder for me to leave my apartment.

312
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,010
What do you thin the kiss meant?

313
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,170
What,honestly?

314
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,560
Mm-hmm,yeah,honestly.

315
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,440
Well...

316
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,460
in my experice,a drunken kiss is just that...

317
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,680
a drunken kiss.

318
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,210
Guys are dogs.

319
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,720
Cold night,warm girl,a couple of drinks...

320
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,240
yeah,I get it.

321
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,420
But,you kno maybe...

322
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,620
he's not like you.

323
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,730
Maybe he's aice guy.

324
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,370
Sorry.That came out wrong.

325
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,280
I know what you mean.

326
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,240
Look,the only way you're gonna find out is if you ask him.

327
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,950
Well,I guess I can do that.

328
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,170
I'm an adult,and you know what?

329
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,620
Either way,I'm fine with it.

330
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm gonna talk to him.

331
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,430
"To my rich jerk.

332
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,480
" It's from molly.

333
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,290
"rich jerk.

334
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,240
cute.

335
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,170
And...

336
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,320
a little insulting?

337
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,530
No,she's just teasing.

338
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,390
Hey,will you do me a favor?

339
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,980
I want to nd some flowers to her as a thank-you,but,mm,make sure they're not too nice.

340
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,620
I don't want her to think I'm a rich jerk.

341
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,770
So...

342
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,790
things between the two of you,they're good?

343
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,700
They're going great.

344
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,450
I just really have to figure out the right time to tell--

345
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,880
connor,hey.

346
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,430
Mate,you up for hitting the gym after work?

347
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,210
Sounds great.

348
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,880
Let's do it,mate.

349
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,670
Was I overly enthusiastic?

350
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,870
You said "mate.

351
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,670
" dinner for two from the waverly inn has been ordered,

352
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,620
dropped off at your place at 8:00 and--

353
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,280
stop.Stay.

354
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,730
Good boy.

355
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,380
Oh,connor.

356
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,970
Connor,I was thinking,um,why don't we order in tonight?

357
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,270
Tempting.

358
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,460
Um,but I've already made plans with daniel.

359
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,820
I'll see you tomorrow,love.

360
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,570
Ma.

361
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,310
Was I just...

362
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,990
-dissed?
-No,no.Yes.

363
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,040
Something's changed,marc.

364
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,390
Feel him slipping away.

365
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,940
cancel whatever parade you're going to and...

366
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,370
I need you to find out what the hell is going on here.

367
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,950
go get 'em,boy.

368
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,250
Why don't we go get a beer?Maybe just...

369
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,760
talk?

370
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,260
Mate,I know what you want to say.

371
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,790
You've just been looking for the right time to say it.

372
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,710
Well,I-I don't ally know if now is the right time.

373
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,150
All right.

374
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,860
If you don't want to say it,I will.

375
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,560
I've been distracted.

376
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,420
My performance has been suffering,and I'm sorry.

377
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,140
It's molly.

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
Connor,I know breakups can be really hard...

379
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,510
yeah,true,but,uh...

380
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,460
it's something I found that's been bothering me.

381
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,540
Look at that.

382
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,050
Uh,what is that?It's,um...

383
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,310
it's molly in st.Bahs.

384
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,570
And--and look at the hand she's holding.

385
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,860
She's with a man.

386
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,760
Are you sure?

387
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,550
Well,the fingers are feminine,but it's definitely a man's hand.

388
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,830
Well,they're not feminine.

389
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,800
Um,well-manicured maybe,but not feminine.

390
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,950
Have you figured out who it might--might be?

391
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,030
No.

392
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,930
No.But she's already vacationing with another man?

393
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,620
It doesn't feel right.

394
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,520
Mate,ifashe w seeing somebody before we broke up,that would royally...

395
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,910
piss me off.

396
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,480
Okay,all right.Somebody definitely needs a drink.Come on.

397
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,040
Right.

398
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,030
right.

399
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,390
Do you mind if we stop somewhere on the way?

400
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,360
Uh,sure.

401
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,290
Where?

402
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh,I just need to check sometng.

403
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,830
uh,I was gonna do this by myself.

404
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,560
Right.Right.

405
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,470
I'll just listen from inside the apartment.

406
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,400
Go get him!

407
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,170
all right.All right,stay cool.

408
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,630
No drool.

409
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,180
Jesse?

410
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:33,770
hello,it's me hel-- hey,it's jesse.Leave a message.

411
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,040
jesse just sent me to voice mail.

412
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,250
He's avoiding me.

413
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,090
 Jesse blew you off le that.

414
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,300
That is so rude!

415
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,210
I know!

416
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,780
And he is the one who kissed me,not the other way around.

417
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,220
I remember that specifically.

418
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,130
That was not in my head.

419
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,560
I know,and it's not like you called him 20 times today

420
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,320
or climbed up his fire escape to look in his window

421
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,000
or tapped his phones or sent him flowers.

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,930
flowers!

423
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,520
No,betty,you did not send him flowers.

424
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
That is a rookie mistake.

425
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,180
No,no,I promised daniel I would send flowers,and I totally forgot.

426
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,450
It's too late to get 'em delivered.

427
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,520
I'll have to take 'em myself.I'll talk to you later.Bye!

428
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
Uh,what are we doing here?

429
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,950
that is molly's building.

430
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,550
I want to see if we can get a look at this guy.

431
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,910
Co nnor,this is crazy.

432
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,280
You're spying on your ex?

433
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,420
I need to know who this bastard is.

434
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,800
Okay,look,I know you're upset,but if molly's moved on,what can you do?

435
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,150
look,maybe you should start seeing someone.

436
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,050
I could set you up with some great women.

437
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,110
or maybe you're seeing someone?

438
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,450
Actually,yes.

439
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,810
Wilhelmina.

440
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,630
Look,I'm sorry.I should've told you earlier.

441
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,700
I just didn't want to complicate things at work.

442
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,270
No,no,no,I mean,that's great.

443
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,660
It means,you know,you're--you're moving on.

444
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,620
But what does wilhelmina think about all this?

445
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,030
Oh,god.She doesn't know.

446
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,050
I'm not an idiot.

447
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,030
-what an idiot.
-I know.

448
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,840
Parked under a streetlight,completely exposed,untinted windows...

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,820
-amateurs.
-Not that.

450
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,770
He gave up a romantic evening with me to trade punes with danny meade

451
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,380
and hang out in a parked car?

452
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,620
If it's any comfort,you and connor do share a love of fine dining,

453
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,540
capitalism and covert,late-night surveillances.

454
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,320
Yes,yes,yes,yes,but who are they waiting for?

455
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,640
Hi,uh,jesse,um,it's betty.

456
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,480
But you already know that because you just screened this call and you're avoiding me,

457
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,710
which is cool,'cause I don't care.

458
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,120
What's black and white and brown all under?

459
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,580
Betty?

460
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,530
oh,boy.It's getting late.

461
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,780
Gettin' pretty tired.

462
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,630
Coffee?

463
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,800
No,no,I'm--I'm-- I'm--I'm okay.

464
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,330
you know what?

465
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,940
Uh,actually,I could use that coffee.

466
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,380
There's gotta be a place down at the end of the block.

467
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,360
Sure,yeah.

468
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,730
-Ack,cream,sugar?
-That's perfect.Everything.

469
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,970
Great.Yeah.Thanks!

470
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,720
betty.

471
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,840
Oh,daniel,hey,I forgot to send the flowers,

472
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,640
so I thought I would just bring them over.

473
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,400
-Sorry,I didn't--
-you have to get out of here.

474
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,350
What?Why?

475
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,560
Well,we're stalng molly.

476
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,470
Well,I'm not.Connor is.

477
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm just kinda helping him.

478
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,710
Actually,I'm not really helping him.

479
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,820
You know what?It's just a little too complicated right now.

480
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,530
Why would you be stalking molly?

481
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,140
Look,this--you gotta trust me.

482
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,990
This is not the right time.

483
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,050
You just gotta get out of here.

484
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,380
Please go,now.

485
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,780
Run.

486
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,200
No,no,no,not that way,the other way.Come on.

487
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,080
daniel!

488
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,100
They were all closed.

489
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,370
Flowers?

490
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,840
Uh,yeah,well,um,the delivery boy tried to drop 'em off at molly's apartment,

491
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,710
-so I stopped him and--
-well,who are they from?

492
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,440
No,no,don't do that.

493
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
Don't torture yourself,connor.

494
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,550
Con--

495
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,300
"to molly,from R.J." R.J.

496
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,630
Who's R.J.?

497
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,580
I don't know.

498
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,040
And what kind of a jerk sends crappy carnations?

499
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,230
Yeah!

500
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,580
Well,I mean,carnations aren'.that bad.

501
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,930
Where did that delivery boy go?

502
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,020
connorhe's gone.

503
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,620
Look,you're with wilhelmina now,and you're happy,right?

504
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,680
Then what are you doing?

505
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,080
Well,I have to know.

506
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,930
No,no,no.

507
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,630
If wilhelmina found out what you were doing,how would this make her feel?

508
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,710
Come on,look.

509
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,840
Buddy,why are you risking your future on the past?

510
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,750
I don't know.

511
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,940
I don't know.

512
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,820
Let's call it a night,huh?

513
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,480
ooh,looks like they're leaving.

514
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,590
None of this makes any sense.

515
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,860
molly?

516
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,350
This is her block.

517
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,280
now it all makes perfect sense.

518
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,870
Wait,so you were on a stakeout with connor who was waiting

519
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,530
to find out who molly's new boyfriend is.

520
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,460
Yes.

521
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,160
-Who is you.
-Right.

522
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,750
Okay,that's just dumb.

523
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,850
Um,why--why can't you tell him the truth?

524
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,200
Because,betty,it's just not that easy.

525
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,000
Well,it's easier than lying and ending up on a stakeout for yourself.

526
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,710
you know,can I ask you a question?

527
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,620
Why do guys play games?

528
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,710
I mean,why are they such cowards?

529
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,330
Why are they so,you know,brave when they want to kiss you or something,

530
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,960
but try to get 'em on the phone and actually talk to you,and...

531
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,820
well...

532
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,500
okay,um,we're not talking about me and connor anymore.

533
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,060
Sorry.

534
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,600
I tried to talk to jesse,and he ignored me-- wouldn't even answer his door.

535
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,040
Betty,I'm sorry.

536
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,990
Oh,it's just gonna make it that much harder for me to leave my apartment.

537
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,360
Why?

538
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,390
'Cause there's unfinished business between us.

539
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,340
Betty,are you really sure you want to move back home?

540
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,890
Of course.I love my family.

541
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,040
No,no,I'm not saying you doT.

542
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,890
It's just that you can't leave when jesse kisses you,

543
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,530
you can't leave when he ignores you.

544
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,270
Maybe moving back to queens is harder than you're admitting?

545
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,870
Well,I guess I-- I had this stupid fantasy...

546
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,700
about being in love in the city and...

547
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,940
being that girl who hangs out in cafИs and has a cute boyfriend and holds his hand

548
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,800
and just kisses him right there and then and...

549
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,400
and jesse was the guy.

550
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Well,I just thought that when he kissed me that maybe it would happen.

551
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,470
Look,don't think you're gonna get that fantasy with jesse,

552
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,830
but at the very least,

553
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,600
you have to tell him that nobody treats betty suarez like that.

554
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,590
That's how you close the door.

555
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,430
How?

556
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,340
He won't answer my calls.

557
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,170
Well,I seem to recall you did stalk him once.

558
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,430
Go find him.

559
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,610
hello.

560
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,570
You wanted to see me?

561
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,200
Look,uh,I know you're ill hung up on molly.

562
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,510
Don't bother denying it.

563
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,180
I learnt that molly is seeing someone,

564
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,190
and,yes,it bothered me.

565
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,080
But I've moved on.

566
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,450
-Have you?
-It's over.

567
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,250
You can say that.You might even believe it.

568
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,130
But deep down,I know you're just like me.

569
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,170
You don't want to lose.

570
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:23,270
-Willie--
-connor,I want you-- all of you or nothing.

571
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,620
Wilhelmina slater does not play second fiddle to anyone.

572
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,510
And she doesn't beg...

573
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,600
for anyone.

574
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,580
excuse me,I-I was cooking.

575
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,220
Not with that much butter you're not.

576
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,050
That's half the amount I used to use.

577
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,110
That's still half too much.

578
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,870
try again.

579
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,520
Look,I've been good all week-- drinking your protein shakes,

580
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,700
snacking on your carrot sticks.

581
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,370
I just want to make a spanish omelet.

582
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,260
You can still make your spanish omelet.

583
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,210
All right.

584
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,930
Just no butter,no salt,no yolk.

585
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,100
You take all that away,what is left?

586
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,060
A healthy meal.

587
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,260
Okay,that's enough.

588
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,410
This is my house.

589
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,770
I set the rules.

590
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,470
If I want to make myself a meal,I'm damn well gonna do it.

591
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,580
hello.

592
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,390
Hey,connor.

593
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,610
I just wanted to say thanks for talking me down from the ledge last night.

594
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh,come on,it's no problem.

595
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,730
You know what?

596
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,790
why don't we get that beer tonight?

597
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,420
How about we hit the gym first?

598
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,890
Sure,yep,that sounds great.

599
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,540
Okay,then.

600
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,110
* and I think I'm fallin' for her and you *

601
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,290
n I help you?

602
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm here to talk to jesse.

603
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,870
Oh,yeah,isn't he the best?

604
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,760
It's,like,his songs,like,capture exactly what's going on in my mind.

605
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,570
It's crazy.

606
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,810
You know what else is crazy?

607
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,200
He can't answer his cell phone,'cause he's a gutless,pathetic weasel.

608
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,530
Excuse me.

609
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,200
We need to talk.

610
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,880
*********

611
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,770
what?

612
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,890
I'm sorry I've been avoiding you.

613
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,140
I just--I'm a horrible,terrible person.

614
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,890
No.

615
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,430
You're not--you're not horrible and terrible.

616
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,020
I mean,maybe one of those things.

617
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,860
Well,I was gonna come find you tonight.

618
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,910
I...

619
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,780
betty,I don't know what happened.

620
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,940
I mean,I had so much fun hanging out with you.

621
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,850
And then when we kissed,everything got confusing.

622
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,690
Yeah,for me,too.

623
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,750
Let me make it up to you.

624
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,010
Do you--do you want to go out?

625
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,760
What?What--what do you mean?

626
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,160
I mean a date.

627
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,590
Or we could have dinner.

628
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,520
Here.Tonight.

629
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,420
You know,I know you probably hate me,

630
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,480
and I totally understand if you say no,

631
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,970
but I just--I wanna spend some time with you.

632
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,250
I don't know.

633
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,290
Oh,come on.

634
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:41,470
it'll be fun,it'll be great come out with me on a date that's terrible,right?

635
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,170
If you don't say yes,I'm gonna have to sing another verse.

636
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,930
-it'll be fun,it'll be great--
-okay,okay,okay.

637
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes,fine,I will go on a date with you.

638
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,990
Okay.Awesome.All right.

639
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,020
I gotta get back to work.

640
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,480
okay,do not order anything over $15,or you have to do anything jesse says.

641
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,250
It used to be more,but we are in a recession.

642
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,990
So what's going on with the roommate sitch?

643
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,640
I vote for carl.He says he can bounce his pecs.

644
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,610
Ooh,that could come in handy.

645
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,440
Guys,you can't just rush into these things,you know?

646
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,700
Look,if worse comes to worse,I'll just stay here a little longer.

647
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,000
But won't your family mind?

648
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,880
They'll understand.

649
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,050
Okay,I'm ready for my date.

650
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,650
Interesting.Now...

651
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,120
how can you tell?

652
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,280
You can't tell?

653
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,640
Unless there's anything else,I'm heading out.

654
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,060
How long is this silent treatment gonna last?

655
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,550
I discovered talking to you raises my blood pressure.

656
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,030
I don't want to have another heart attack.

657
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,060
I'm sorry,did you just say that I'm gonna cause you another heart attack?

658
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,240
Me?Not your horrible diet,not your sedentary lifestyle?Me?

659
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,690
Ela,you can't come into my home and start changing all the rules.

660
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,810
No,no,no...

661
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,650
you may have set the rules here for the last 20 years,

662
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,830
but you know what's really gonna help your family?

663
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,930
If you're not dead in two.

664
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,710
Please.

665
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,980
No,this isn't about eating healthy food or getting some exercise.

666
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,580
It's about the people who love you and will do anythingfor you.

667
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,170
You think they like going for walks in 30-degree weather?

668
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,420
You think they like fat-free nacho night?

669
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,400
They don'T.They do it f you.

670
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,850
And look at how you repay them.

671
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,760
I love my family.

672
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,580
They're all I could think about when I was sick.

673
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,290
Then think about this.

674
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,590
You almost died.

675
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,930
I've seen this before.

676
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,440
You're a lovely man,ignacio,with a wderful family.

677
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,070
What if next time you're not so lucky?

678
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,620
I've never eaten here before.

679
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,810
It's a cute place.

680
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,120
You gotta try the meat loaf.

681
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,260
Promise me that you will try the meat loaf.

682
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,970
okay,yeah.

683
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,850
So,uh,how was your week?

684
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,960
Probably the worst ever.

685
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,810
First,I write a song,and I realize I basically ripped off "closing time.

686
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,690
" And then my drummer announces at practice that he's gonna move to prague.

687
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,600
And now I-I think we have to change the band name because "journey" could be copyrighted.

688
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,720
So "dark sexual journey" becomes...

689
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,640
"dark sexual.

690
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,420
It's awful.

691
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,220
Oh,well,that's not so bad.

692
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,370
-You know,actually,it reminds me of this "mode" headline that we had--
-headline!

693
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh,I forgot to tell you the worst thing.

694
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,060
So we were supposed to headline this show,

695
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,080
and-- let me start from the beginning.

696
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,360
There's this little club in brooklyn,and I know the manager.

697
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,080
So he tells me that they need a house band for thursday nights...

698
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,490
connor,I am so glad you're more relaxed.

699
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,030
getting there.

700
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,910
so where did you go on holidays?

701
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,300
Willie and I are thinking about traveling this spring.

702
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,420
- Uh,anguilla.
- Nice.

703
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,100
what have you been up to lately?

704
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,580
You been dating anyone recently?

705
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,870
No,just,you know,kinda

706
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,880
too busy with work.

707
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,930
hold on.
Wait a second.

708
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,650
I wanna just...

709
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,180
take a break and talk,okay?

710
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,510
sorry about that,R.J.

711
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,470
you know,it wasn't that hard to put the pieces together.

712
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,040
<i>Rich Jerk</i>

713
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,310
<i>To Molly, From RJ</i>

714
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,630
Connor,I--

715
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,030
you were my friend,daniel,

716
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,250
and you lied to my face.

717
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,560
***** And I walk offstage,

718
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,190
and I realize my fly had been down the whole time.

719
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,380
Can you believe that happened to me?

720
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,220
Yeah,wow,a lot has happened to you.

721
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,910
Actually--yeah.

722
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,400
Actually,I wrote a song about all that.

723
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,180
I'm--I'm not finished,but the chorus goes...

724
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,960
* headache,heartache depression,rejection *

725
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:35,590
* if there's one thing I can count on  *

726
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:45,890
* yeah, it's me,me,me,me me,e,me,me me,me,me,me,me *

727
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,540
* not you,just me yes,me,not you *

728
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,990
* what rhymes with me? *

729
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,590
* I know,it's me *

730
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,590
* yours truly,me,myself and I  *

731
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,070
* if there's one thing I can count on *

732
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,680
* yeah,yeah,it's me *

733
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,240
you know what I realed tonight,betty?

734
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,620
You're really good for me.

735
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
- I am?
- Yeah,you're--

736
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,450
you're smart,you're a good listener.

737
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm just really glad we did this.
I feel so much better.

738
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,200
That's good,'cause,you know,I think...

739
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,480
that's probably what this was all about--

740
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,450
making yourself feel better.

741
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,300
- What? No--no,no--
- and that's okay.

742
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
It's fine,because you know what?

743
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,940
I think maybe...

744
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,200
I kinda used you,too,

745
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,540
for some fantasy I had.

746
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,270
But I-I don't think this is what either one of us want.

747
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,920
But thank you,jesse,for everything,

748
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,630
for--for the drinks and the dinner.

749
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,310
Bye.

750
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,700
more ice?

751
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,240
No,actually,it...

752
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,880
starting to feel better.

753
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,890
Oh.

754
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,480
But not looking better?

755
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,980
I'll get more ice.

756
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,640
So...

757
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,850
- your big move is today?
- Yep.

758
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,130
I can't say that I'm looking forward to fighting for hot water,

759
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,650
but I'm okay with it.

760
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,480
You know,it's the right thing to do.

761
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,020
And besides,it's not like this city's going anywhere,right?I'll be back.

762
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,340
And you're okay with having to give up your whole manhattan fantasy?

763
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm not giving it up.
Just...

764
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,440
taking it with me.

765
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,600
niel?

766
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,400
- Oh,excuse me.
- No,it's okay,betty.

767
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,850
I just wanted to check with daniel,

768
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,990
make sure we're still on for our budget meeting tonight.

769
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,180
yep,sure.

770
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,490
Listen,connor...

771
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,370
we need to talk.

772
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,030
I said everything I needed to in the ring.

773
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,910
We're good.

774
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,690
I'll see you tonight.

775
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,620
Seems like things between the two of you won't be as hard as you thought.

776
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,270
No,I guess not.

777
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,430
yeah,well,I don't know.

778
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,690
Uh,I'll-- I'll call you back.

779
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,780
you were right.

780
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,840
I hate to lose.

781
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,450
And the thought of molly with another man...

782
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,980
drives me crazy.

783
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I see.

784
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,210
But the thought of losing you is unbeablE.

785
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,890
So I'm putting all that behind me.

786
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm all yours...

787
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,000
that is,if you'll still have me.

788
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,210
Do you want me to beg?

789
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,340
Because i will beg.

790
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,070
Well...

791
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,290
maybe after...

792
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,410
dinner?

793
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,290
hello?
good morning.

794
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,420
In the dining room!

795
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,050
Hi!

796
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,710
Take your coat off,stay awhile.

797
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,160
Well...

798
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,570
- look,I'm not sure your father--
- who wants breakfast?

799
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

800
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,260
Omelet?

801
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,250
No butter,no salt,no yolks.

802
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,540
I know.
Can you believe it?

803
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,430
Here,take a seat.
He made smoothies,too.

804
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,780
Thank you...

805
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,950
for being so honest with me.

806
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,200
Sorry I've been such A...

807
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,000
sourpuss.

808
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
Un idiota.

809
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,770
It's okay.

810
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,990
I'm glad to help.

811
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,230
And maybe after,uh,breakfast...

812
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,140
we can take another walk?

813
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,160
okay...
I guess I'm off.

814
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,010
Okay.
Oh,I'll miss you.

815
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,980
You'll see me at work.

816
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,230
Yeah,but I probably won't be as nice.

817
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,870
Probably not.

818
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,060
hey,so about the roommate thing,

819
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,140
I'm sorry that I've been dragging my feet.

820
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,600
I just wasn't ready to go.

821
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,400
But the good news is I have found you a roommate.

822
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,840
someone who is responsible,

823
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,050
has a stable job and good references.

824
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,250
Hmm,sounds great.

825
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,950
Well,actually,it is great because...

826
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,080
your new roommate is...

827
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,560
- ta-da!
- Ta-da!

828
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,060
Okay,I let you do that once.

829
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,490
From now on,I orchestrate my own entrances.

830
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,790
Marky-marc!

831
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,330
oh,my god!
Wait,what about your place?

832
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,410
Oh,they raised my rent again.

833
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,480
Plus,jake gyllenhaal runs shirtless in the park across the street.

834
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,120
- I know.
- Take that,restraining order!

835
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,640
Um,the rent is due on the 15th of every month.

836
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
I didn't know about the nosy landlady.

837
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,130
okay,I want to change everything,and I mean everything!

838
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,410
I am talking "extreme makeover: Homo edition."

839
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,340
Yes.We have to get rid of a lot of betty's stuff.

840
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,090
A lot of this stuff.

841
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,500
I mean,did she forget to pack things?
Let's make a pile.

842
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,630
You know what?

843
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,500
I think she's in love with that guy with long hair.

844
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,870
the city's beautif at night...isn't it?

845
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,860
Yeah.

846
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,290
It really is.

847
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,420
hello!
