1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,242
Good morning, everyone!

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:05,994
Somebody didn't get home
until 10.30 last night, huh?

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:07,528
Some of the editors wanted to go out,

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,055
So I went with them, and I got a tattoo!

5
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:12,228
- What?  
- Who is "stu"?

6
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:13,580
Stu?

7
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:18,795
It's supposed to say "hot stuff."

8
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:20,116
I sweat it off. It was hot in the club.

9
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:22,183
Ay, gracias a dios. Your
mother would kill me.

10
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,027
Mija, it's not like you
to go out on a work night.

11
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:27,027
So? Maybe I want to mix it up.

12
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,062
Matt's moving on. He's
dating someone new.

13
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:31,933
I think it's time for me
to get back on the market.

14
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,511
Hey, what about that nice guy

15
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,328
- Who does the bookkeeping for Archie? 
- Larry?

16
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,767
Yeah. I don't know.

17
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,495
When he gets nervous, he
does this sniffing thing.

18
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:41,840
I don't think betty wants a sniffer.

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,391
Aunt Betty

20
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:43,554
Did marc say when the cheerleader

21
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,731
uniforms will be ready?

22
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,895
Yes, he's gonna drop them
off on his way to work.

23
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,048
Oh, thank god.

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,695
Those hems have not been
brought up since 2003.

25
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:52,878
They might as well just
be cheering in burkas.

26
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,909
Who roped you into
helping the cheerleaders?

27
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:55,925
It was marc's idea.

28
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,167
He said if I'm gonna make
it through high school,

29
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,713
I have to be friends with
the popular/mean girls.

30
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:01,969
That's his advice?

31
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,006
What does it matter?

32
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,364
The point is, he's having
a better time at school.

33
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay, so whoever's free this morning,

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,141
We need help decorating
the gym for homecoming.

35
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:13,554
What?

36
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:16,052
Why do I feel like I should
be hearing scary music?

37
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:20,683
Your mother doesn't have the
best association with homecoming.

38
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,083
Do you want to know why?

39
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,347
Because the year that I was
nominated homecoming queen,

40
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,784
My father told me I could
not attend the ceremony.

41
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,807
Mija, I was protecting you.

42
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,155
- You were ashamed of me! 
- guys!

43
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,267
- Never! 
- Papi.

44
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,521
Justin, your mom was six
months pregnant with you,

45
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,287
So grandpa didn't think it
was a good idea for her to go.

46
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:42,174
Because he was ashamed of me.

47
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:42,947
I was protecting you!

48
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:43,573
Lies!

49
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,263
but you know

50
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:47,538
that you are a blessing
in my life, honey, right?

51
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,507
That is true, but
eso-- eso is a lie.

52
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:54,335
We'll come and help.

53
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,888
I could have been queen, Betty.

54
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:58,302
I could have ruled all of this.

55
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,235
I really think all you got
was a bunch of carnations

56
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,302
And a ride on a golf cart.

57
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,240
Yeah, to wave to my subjects

58
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:07,381
Oh, my god!

59
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,278
Is that Bobby Talercio?

60
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,793
Bobby Talercio was
the most dangerous guy

61
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:17,735
I ever went out with.

62
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,185
One time, this guy called me a whore,

63
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:21,006
And Bobby slammed his
head against the wall

64
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:22,385
And made him apologize.

65
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,470
I felt like such a princess.

66
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,346
- Hilda? 
- Hi!

67
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:33,027
Get out here! no way! oh, my god.

68
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:33,938
I know, right?

69
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,878
-You look great. 
- Oh, thank you.

70
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,112
Jeez, don't tell me
this is little chipmunk.

71
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,145
This is little chipmunk? Oh, man! it is.

72
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,022
- "little chipmunk." 
- your face! oh!

73
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,668
look, I'd love to stay and talk,

74
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,685
But I gotta start a lesson.

75
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,881
Oh, you're teaching driver's ed.

76
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,958
Yeah, part-time. You know,

77
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,134
the family's got the car dealership,

78
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,527
- So I volunteer a few of the cars. 
- Nice.

79
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:55,774
Look, I'll, uh,

80
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,074
- I'll see you around, all right? 
- Okay. See you later.

81
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,974
My god, he has still got it.

82
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,755
I used to have such a crush on him.

83
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:05,668
- No kidding. 
- You knew?

84
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,436
Please! if it weren't for
you hanging around so much,

85
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,735
Bobby would have been Justin's father.

86
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,568
Remember the summer
he worked at Asadero's?

87
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:15,336
You came by three times
a day for freeze-atas.

88
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,699
Yeah, I gained 9 pounds that summer.

89
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,004
But you lost it.

90
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:22,102
Remember how you guys used
to sit on the hood of his car?

91
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,269
I used to always wish that would be me.

92
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,520
- That would have been funny. 
- Why?

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,083
'cause you could never go
out with a guy like Bobby.

94
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,075
Why not?

95
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,665
Because you're a good girl,

96
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,634
and he is a very bad boy.

97
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:36,926
So? You don't know me. Maybe I could.

98
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,904
Oh, please. Bobby smoked.

99
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,128
Okay, here you
go-- top and skirt.

100
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,874
For you. Hey, thank you.

101
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,841
See, ava? If the skirt doesn't hit you

102
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:52,207
In the exact right place,

103
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,868
It could make your leg look chunky.

104
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,743
Oh, my god. You saved my life.

105
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,039
Hey, Justin, where's your skirt, huh?

106
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,924
Shut up, Kevin!

107
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,841
Okay, so let's talk
about what just happened.

108
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:11,287
A lump of boy made fun of
you, and you did nothing.

109
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:14,713
What am I supposed to do?
Get ahead of the joke, son.

110
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:16,943
If he asks where your skirt is,

111
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:19,298
Say it's at the dry cleaner
with your opera cape.

112
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,465
If you show them that
you're in on the joke,

113
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,858
Then they'll think
they're not getting to you,

114
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,768
And they'll stop making fun of you.

115
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,540
Okay, Miss woman

116
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,231
Are we all happy now?

117
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:31,533
Is there anything else my
friend Justin can do for you?

118
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,081
Uh, not unless he knows any routines.

119
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,024
We need fresh moves for homecoming.

120
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:36,926
Well, you're in luck.

121
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,214
It just so happens that Justin here

122
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,713
Has the moves of a
young, Mexican Beyonc.

123
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,772
I,
uh--

124
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,682
And he would be happy to
choreograph it for you.

125
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:47,635
Cool. See you at practice.

126
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:49,248
Okay.

127
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,483
What did you do?

128
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,580
I mean, I helped out in junior high,

129
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:56,462
But this is homecoming.

130
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,407
This is like the broadway of school.

131
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,407
Worry not, youngling.

132
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,905
It just so happens,

133
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:02,549
I was head cheerleader in college,

134
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,308
And I happen to know a move or two.

135
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,750
So this water

136
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,515
Is from the community of the phoenix?

137
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,060
Yeah, it's full of vitamins, and look,

138
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,758
The cups have inspirational
sayings on them from Bennett.

139
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,991
"If it's a mess, it's a message."

140
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,952
I think I get it.

141
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:21,826
You know, the community's
really changed my life, Betty.

142
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:22,913
I just--I
feel better

143
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:23,699
You know, more energy.

144
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,885
Natalie's got me on this great diet.

145
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,703
It's raw food, phoenix
water and that's it.

146
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,234
You don't think you need more than that?

147
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:30,287
You want half my muffin?

148
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,694
Muffin... Or poison?

149
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:33,843
Come on.

150
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,415
Um, I thought that was a muffin.

151
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,349
You know, cleansing is so important.

152
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:38,999
Once you get rid of all those toxins,

153
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,935
It's just amazing the clarity you have.

154
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,594
It's also amazing how much
you have to pee. Excuse me.

155
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,756
Should I be worried about my son?

156
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,290
I'd ask him myself,

157
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,290
But we're not really
in that place right now.

158
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:52,224
Well, he is acting a little loopy,

159
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,756
But if this community

160
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,856
Is helping him deal with Molly's death,

161
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,823
Then I'm trying to keep
an open mind about it.

162
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,447
I do like his new necklace.

163
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,698
Ah, just the girl I wanted to see.

164
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:03,580
I was talking to Betty, Mrs. Meade.

165
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,080
You're not a girl.

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,094
I would never call you a girl.

167
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,547
Well, I'm glad that's cleared up.

168
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,218
Now I won't spend the afternoon texting

169
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,810
and worrying about boys.

170
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,524
- I should talk less. 
- Matt?

171
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:16,278
Oh, um, your assignment
for the "fearless" issue.

172
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:17,245
Oh, thank you.

173
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,594
Wait

174
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,488
Matt, horoscopes and
cosmetic of the month?

175
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm not getting a features article?

176
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Look, I really wanted to give you one,

177
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,312
But once the senior editors
picked what they wanted,

178
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,987
All that was left
was a P.O.V. Piece--

179
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:31,778
You know, an editor's
personal story of fearlessness.

180
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:33,759
I just thought that Megan
would be better for that.

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,532
Can you sign this?

182
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,121
W-why?

183
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,341
I'm--i'm just as
fearless as Megan.

184
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:41,023
What, are--are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?

185
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:41,845
-No, I'm not. 
-Thank you.

186
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:42,508
Okay, I am

187
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:44,276
But it's just, look,

188
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:46,126
Don't get mad, but when I think of you,

189
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,070
I think of someone

190
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,418
Who's a little, I don't know, cautious.

191
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,563
Maybe you're thinking of the old Betty,

192
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,305
'cause the new Betty is fearless.

193
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,537
Uh, look, no bangs!

194
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:59,404
Okay, look, nothing is set in stone.

195
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:00,998
Give me some pitches.
I'd love to hear them.

196
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:01,928
Okay.

197
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,038
But something a little
bit more dangerous

198
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,671
Than turning in a story
without proofreading it.

199
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:07,610
I would never do that.

200
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,270
I do not appreciate blackmail calls

201
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,312
In the middle of a workday.

202
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:18,219
Detective, you will have the
money when I get the money.

203
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,549
Never cover up a murder
for your daughter.

204
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:24,743
Well, if you have one fault

205
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,599
It's that you love too much.

206
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,683
Willie, I'm really
starting to get worried.

207
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,247
If you can't come up with the money,

208
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,152
You and Nico will go to jail.

209
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,770
I'm aware of that, Marc.

210
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,280
Get on the phone.

211
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,005
I want you to call
"Vogue," "EllE," "Bazaar."

212
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,570
Tell them that Wilhelmina Slater

213
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,887
is available for modeling,

214
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,930
Willing to do a cover.

215
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,525
- What? 
- It's just...

216
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,209
Models today tend to be...

217
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,342
Um, they often, and
this is a terrible thing,

218
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,154
But usually what they're looking for...

219
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,958
Yes, I know I'm not 19, but
there are plenty of models

220
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,569
That are in their late 30s.

221
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,320
They can do wonders
with airbrushing. Yes.

222
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,585
A Wilhelmina Slater
cover will sell magazines.

223
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,835
So unless you can come up
with another way to get money,

224
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:19,546
Start calling.

225
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,786
Daniel, you think of
me as fearless, right?

226
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,822
I mean, someone who takes risks?

227
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,618
Sure. I mean, look at
you. No bangs, right?

228
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,580
Yeah.

229
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,847
Okay.

230
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,469
It just seems like everyone thinks of me

231
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:36,626
As this cautious person,

232
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,770
And maybe I was in the past.

233
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,224
But now I want to be fearless.

234
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,864
- Well, you can be. 
- How?

235
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,319
Well...

236
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,958
"do the thing you never do."

237
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,617
Bobby!

238
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,162
Hey, what's up, chipmunk?

239
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:07,536
Well, it's not "chipmunk"
anymore. It's Betty.

240
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,654
And this bad girl wants to date you.

241
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,890
Hey, sweetie, what's up?

242
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,347
- Hey, you okay? 
- Yeah, I'm fine.

243
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:23,040
Okay.

244
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,311
Um, uh, sorry.

245
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,094
I wanted to ask you something.

246
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:29,624
Yeah, anything.

247
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:33,334
I was wondering if...

248
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,383
I mean, only if you have time...

249
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,066
- If maybe... 
- What do you need, chipmunk?

250
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,068
If you would want to, um...

251
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:45,994
Teach me how to drive?

252
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,153
Yeah, of course!

253
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:52,565
Is that all you wanted? I
mean, you seem a little nervous.

254
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,552
Well... I also wanted this.

255
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:03,017
Is that all you wanted? I
mean, you seem a little nervous.

256
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,643
Yep. That's it.

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
- Hey! 
-Hi!

258
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,699
Hey! how did cheerleading practice go?

259
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,733
This kid is a star.

260
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,367
Honestly, it was like he
was born to yell at girls.

261
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,133
Yay!

262
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,728
Oh, Marc showed me this routine.

263
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:35,066
It got them going crazy.

264
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,567
One, two, three, four

265
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,233
- Ready? 
- Okay.

266
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,467
I know you want me, you know I want ya

267
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,066
I know you want me, you know I want ya

268
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,177
Bravo!

269
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,267
It kind of put me on the map in college.

270
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,467
Oh, and we got invited
to homecoming tomorrow.

271
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:55,733
- Whoo! that's...that's so great! 
- Oh, that's wonderful, mijo.

272
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,498
Ay, there's Archie. Marc,
thank you so, so much.

273
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,000
- Yeah. 
- Gracias, Marc.

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,933
Oh, maybe this time, I get to go.

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,267
- I was protecting you! 
-Ashamed!

276
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,366
Okay, a glass of water and two saltines,

277
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,700
And I'm out of here. Now look at me.

278
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:13,533
Everything is gonna be great,
and I will tell you why.

279
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,738
If anybody gives you any crap,

280
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:19,838
You know that you are
smarter and funnier.

281
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,871
It's just the truth.

282
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,274
I thought being the
girlfriend of a politician

283
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,468
Would be glamorous.

284
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,369
I didn't think I would spend my saturday

285
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:34,135
Dressed like Barbara Bush,
watching him plant a tree

286
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,469
- In front of the Shalom retirement home. 
- That's not Archie.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,166
What?

288
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:41,522
What is Bobby Talercio doing here?

289
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,091
He's here for me! He's
gonna teach me how to drive.

290
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:46,525
Uh, you already know how to drive.

291
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,324
- Not a stick shift. 
- Why do you need to learn that?

292
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:51,425
Automatics are safer, mija.

293
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,380
I know,papi. Exactly
why I want to learn.

294
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,150
I think it would make a great article

295
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,144
For the "fearless" issue.

296
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:58,044
What's scarier than
driving a stick in the city?

297
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:00,398
All the teachers in
Queens, and you pick bobby?

298
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:05,243
Betty, I don't like that
guy. He...He's a thug.

299
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,170
I'm sure he's the one
who stole our baby jesus.

300
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,586
Papi, come on. He's a nice guy.

301
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:10,795
Oh! Hilda, Archie's here.

302
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,751
That is wonderful, Marc.

303
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,198
And you didn't think
I could get a cover.

304
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,999
Now tell me, where am I going?

305
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:30,866
"Hot Flash" would be thrilled
to have you on its cover.

306
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,465
In fact, as soon as I heard,

307
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:36,595
I did a mock-up of what I
thought it should look like.

308
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,958
Cackle all you want, claire.

309
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,290
But if I agree to do this,

310
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:47,123
I want final approval on all the photos,

311
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,090
And, of course, my usual fee.

312
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,705
The fee is $500

313
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:56,106
And a liter of diet ginger ale,

314
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:58,306
And I'd take it.

315
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:00,500
Where else are you going to
find a magazine willing to put

316
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,106
Women of our age on the cover?

317
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:08,106
How dare you even suggest
we're near the same age?

318
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:10,639
And I won't agree to such a small fee.

319
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,873
Well, it's the best I can do, willie.

320
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:14,971
Now "Hot Flash" is just an insert,

321
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:17,384
So you might have some
staples in your face.

322
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,951
Oh! but you've had that before.

323
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,784
Okay, okay, easy on the clutch.

324
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,485
- You wanna be in third. 
- I think I am in third.

325
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,485
No, you're in second.

326
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,070
So this is for an article, huh?

327
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:39,720
Yep.

328
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,754
Am I gonna be in it?

329
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,887
Maybe.

330
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,287
Ah, jeez, I can't believe
little betty's all grown up.

331
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,287
You know, a big shot at "mode."

332
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,000
I still think of you in footie pajamas.

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,293
Oh, god. Please don't
think of me that way.

334
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,621
I wear regular nightgowns now.

335
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,434
Like...Like you can see my feet.

336
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,700
I get it. You're all
grown-up. Yeah, I know.

337
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,401
Yep.

338
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,401
I've traveled, had my own apartment,

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Boyfriends.

340
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,967
Actually, I just got out
of a relationship, so...

341
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:10,934
I guess I'm back on the market.

342
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,034
Oh, okay, okay. E-ease
up. Press in the clutch.

343
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,800
Press...there you go.

344
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay now. Now look, you don't
wanna grip it too hard, okay?

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,226
You just wanna gently ease it,

346
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:25,932
Guide it to right
where you want it to go.

347
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,851
Hey! watch what you're doin', dumb-ass!

348
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,450
- I'm sorry! 
- You park the car, not the road!

349
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:35,843
Hey, sweetie, don't worry about it.

350
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,016
- Put the car in neutral. 
- I'm walkin' over here!

351
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,283
- Good job. Pull up the emergency brake. 
- I'll be right back.

352
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:43,111
You gotta watch what you're doin',

353
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:44,484
- Four eyes! 
-Hey, come here.

354
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,173
Now you were jaywalkin'

355
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,858
When there's a clearly marked crosswalk!

356
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,872
And worse than that, you
were rude to this young lady!

357
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,238
- Now apologize! 
- I'm sorry.

358
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:55,072
- It's fine.
-That's better. Go. Go cross at the light.

359
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,371
It's the law, ya bum.

360
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,258
Oh, baby, watch your step

361
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,832
You gonna dress like that

362
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,401
Amanda.

363
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,212
What are you doing here on a saturday?

364
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,522
Well, I'm not here because Matt came in

365
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,904
The last two out of four saturdays,

366
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:19,000
If that's what you're implying.
But since you brought it up,

367
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,813
- Do you see Matt and I as a couple? 
- Look, amanda,

368
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,231
You can't force someone
to have feelings for you.

369
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,631
I mean, you tried that
with me, and it didn't work.

370
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,131
I gave you nothing.

371
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,198
Honestly, I kinda used you.

372
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,131
Thanks. I feel better.

373
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,664
And at least I'll always
have that cold sore.

374
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:39,365
Look, all I'm saying is,
you can change that pattern.

375
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:40,587
I don't know if it's all
the herbs I've been taking

376
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,000
Or the fact that I
haven't eaten in four days,

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,398
But I feel like I'm seeing
you for the first time.

378
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:49,830
It's like I can see what's
missing in your life.

379
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,210
- Matt.  -
Self-esteem.

380
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,653
Amanda, I think you should
attend these workshops

381
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,023
We're having here this weekend. Oh,

382
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,448
You mean the dead people thing?

383
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,881
No. Look, the community's
about so much more than that.

384
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,581
It's about finding your self-worth,

385
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,649
Reaching your potential.
Look, you're always saying

386
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,000
You wanna move forward
in your life, right?

387
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,972
I really think this
might help you get there.

388
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:10,035
Okay, I'll stay.

389
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,803
If Matt sees me here, he'll
think I'm super complicated.

390
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,010
Listen, you did a great
job today, chipmunk.

391
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:27,809
- Yeah? You did good.

392
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:30,007
Hey, you only hit one pedestrian, huh?

393
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,310
All right.

394
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,343
Oh! uh, yeah. Sorry.

395
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,343
Um... Thanks.

396
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:42,310
I was just thinking, you
know, um, saturday night...

397
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,343
You've probably got big plans, right?

398
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,343
Nah, I'm just gonna do what I always do.

399
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,056
I go down to Mad Dog's and shoot pool.

400
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,031
Oh, yeah, I...I know the place.

401
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,398
The one with the sign--
uh, "warm beer, lousy food."

402
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,231
My dad says that place
is run by the mob.

403
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,424
My uncle runs it.

404
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,906
Oh.

405
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,394
It's not so bad.

406
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,384
I've always wanted to check it out.

407
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:07,571
You should. Come by
anytime. Come tonight.

408
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,743
Really?

409
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,613
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

410
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,970
Oh, okay. Maybe.

411
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,940
May--yeah, you
know, if I have time.

412
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,780
Papi! I'm gonna be out late tonight!

413
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,157
I have plans!

414
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,056
Well, now you have other plans!

415
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:24,240
Betty, meet my bookkeeper Larry.

416
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,482
He's here for you! we're
all gonna have a double date.

417
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,540
Won't that be fun?

418
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:37,741
So that turned out
to be a pretty big war

419
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,152
Between me and that squirrel.

420
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,372
I was pretty sure he was
the one stealing my carrots.

421
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,500
So you know what I did?

422
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,242


424
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,747
I got it from that catalog
they give you on the plane

425
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,691
When I was visiting my mom in Syracuse.

426
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,545
She just redid the roof,

427
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,738
But... That's another story.

428
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,900
I forgot what I was saying.

429
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,581
The squirrel, man.

430
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:05,855
Oh right, you will never guess

431
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,435
Who turned out to be the carrot thief.

432
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:09,080
The squirrel.

433
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,106
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

434
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:15,366
It was the squirrel.

435
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,623
Man, I'm so surprised
at how late it got.

436
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:22,913
What are you talking about? It's 9:00.

437
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:25,496
Why don't we all play
a game or something?

438
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,697
Since when do you like games?

439
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:29,018
I love games.

440
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:31,486
I have so... Much work

441
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,820
That I have to do in the morning.

442
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,213
And I really should just hit the hay.

443
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,721
But, Larry, it was
really nice to meet you.

444
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:39,920
Oh, you, too. Have a good night.

445
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,983
- Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,648
Good night.

447
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,063
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

448
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:25,120
I don't know about you, but
I am stoked for this weekend.

449
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,275
And, yes, I just said "stoked."

450
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,739
Hey, Natalie!

451
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,350
I'm doing it, too. I'm
gonna get cured or whatever.

452
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,585
Yes, Daniel brought a friend
to join us this weekend.

453
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,241
I've started recruiting for you already.

454
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,663
Maybe I'll earn something free.

455
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,563
So far, I am loving everything
except for these beads.

456
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,411
I don't love the way they
frame my "chesticals."

457
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,793
They'll look better
when we shave your head.

458
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,863
- What? 
- Kidding.

459
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,487
We always say that to the newcomers.

460
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:53,487
We like to have fun.

461
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:56,355
So are you doing the whole weekend?

462
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,601
I hope so. Oh, that reminds me.

463
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,997
There's this literature on phasing

464
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,225
I really want to show you. Come on. Oh,

465
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:03,026
You did not tell me I had to read.

466
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,410
She is gonna ruin this.

467
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,934
I need him to get to level five.

468
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:09,654
Pull it together, Natalie.
There's still time. Hmm?

469
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:10,989
But we're running out of time!

470
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,717
Isn't there another
way you can get money?

471
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,492
Oh, for god sake,
Nico. Lower your voice.

472
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,016
Angela Landsbury lives next door,

473
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,718
And she'd love to rat me
out to the co-op board.

474
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,217
Okay, why am I the
only one freaking out?

475
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,492
Because I took two of
my "headache" pills.

476
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:25,785
And...

477
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:28,770
There is one other option.

478
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,559
Well, then do it.

479
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,695
It's not that simple.

480
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,329
It would mean giving
up everything--

481
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:37,103
My career, my life here...

482
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,979
Everything.

483
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:39,745
What is it?

484
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:43,771
It's not "what." it's... "who."

485
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,722
Connor Owens.

486
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:00,356
How was your night?

487
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:04,388
Hi! I went out.

488
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:06,254
Yeah, I got that.

489
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:09,887
Hey. I was just, uh, making
sure Betty got in all right.

490
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:12,455
There were always a lot of
rough guys in this neighborhood.

491
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,221
I guess that was me.

492
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:19,517
You look good, Hilda.

493
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,298
Oh, I-I usually look a lot better.

494
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,963
I threw on this robe by accident.

495
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,456
Okay.

496
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:26,584
I'll see you tomorrow, chipmunk.

497
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,827
Okay.

498
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,295
You are really something.

499
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,361
You blow off a perfectly
nice guy like Larry

500
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,953
To sneak around with Bobby?

501
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,361
Oh, come on, Hilda.

502
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,428
You said it yourself. Larry's a sniffer.

503
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:43,329
Well, so what? You're
a chewer. I'm a yeller.

504
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:44,332
We all got something.

505
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,828
Look, I just wanted to go
out and have some fun, okay?

506
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:47,751
Is that so bad?

507
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,528
Well, you are not gonna
have fun with that one.

508
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:52,150
Trust me. He is exactly the
wrong kind of guy for you.

509
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,051
Oh, and what makes larry the right guy,

510
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,246
That he's boring and nerdy?

511
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:57,280
Yeah, well,

512
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,817
That boring and nerdy
guy has feelings, okay?

513
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,906
And let me tell you, you
were really mean tonight.

514
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,424
What do you mean?

515
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,687
He heard you, Betty!

516
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:07,154
He heard you leave.

517
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:10,985
"oh, god, I'm so tired!

518
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:13,292
I'm gonna go to bed!"

519
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,659
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

520
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,747
I didn't mean for him to hear me.

521
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:19,791
Well--I could call
him. I can apologize.

522
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,007
Well, he wanted to come
to homecoming with us,

523
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,480
But since you hate him...

524
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,405
I didn't say that I hate him.

525
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:29,479
Well, maybe we could all go together,

526
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:33,730
Get something to eat after...

527
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,522
Yeah.

528
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,500
I guess I could do that.

529
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,120
With the money connor stole,

530
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,916
He practically wiped
out Meade publications.

531
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,856
How much money was there?

532
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,020
Enough to pay off the detective,

533
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,953
And to live very well
for the rest of our lives.

534
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,953
But... I mean, you said
he could be anywhere.

535
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,138
How could you ever find him?

536
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,287
I won't. He'll find me.

537
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:58,529
Come away with me.

538
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:02,261
Wilhelmina, you have always
lived your life a certain way.

539
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:06,062
But when you're ready to
pursue another option with me...

540
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:08,775
Just put it out there.
I'll find you again.

541
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:13,237
Could you do that? I
mean, give up everything?

542
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:15,241
God, Nico, I don't know.

543
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,237
Mom...

544
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:20,448
Do you still love him?

545
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay, then...

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,861
You have to do this.

547
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:28,414
Not for me.

548
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:31,013
Do this for yourself.

549
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,109
I must admit, I am intrigued

550
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,104
By this emergency sunday meeting.

551
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:40,751
What is it now?

552
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,355
You're dropping modeling to
start a line of skateboards?

553
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm afraid it's nothing
quite so colorful, Claire.

554
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,571
I wanted to give you plenty of time

555
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,636
To find my replacement.

556
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,284
Excuse me?

557
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:57,270
I quit.

558
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:08,407
Didn't stall once.

559
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:10,951
Damn! You know, there's nothing sexier

560
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,985
Than a woman that can shift like a pro.

561
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,584
- And you were scared to drive a stick.
- I know!

562
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:18,123
You were fearless. Fearless.

563
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,484
That's great.

564
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:23,410
- Oh, god.
- What? What's the matter?

565
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,439
I sort of have a date with that guy.

566
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,213
- Which one?
- The guy in the dad jeans.

567
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,551
- You don't seem like you wanna go.
- Not really.

568
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,443
I mean, he is a nice guy, but...

569
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:35,418
Then blow him off. Let's
go get a Freeze-ata.

570
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:37,528
Are you crazy? I could never do that.

571
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:39,703
I'd say that's a good
enough reason to do it.

572
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,281
Easy on the clutch.

573
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,471
Sorry, Larry!

574
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:57,902
Betty!

575
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,015
Okay, kids, it's "get real" time.

576
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,163
We just spent two hours

577
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:10,325
With fat chick telling
us how to breathe.

578
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,641
Didn't we learn that
when we were, like, 5?

579
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,154
Hey, you just gotta give it time.

580
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,132
Right, Natalie?

581
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,949
Or it's just not for
her and she goes home.

582
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:20,298
Good thing she doesn't
work at the welcome table.

583
00:25:20,298 --> 00:25:22,598
Look, I'm sorry, but we've
wasted half the weekend.

584
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,565
Daniel, we have to get to level five.

585
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:26,565
Yeah, or we just do it another time.

586
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:27,546
Wait, what's level five?

587
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:28,986
Is that where you
touch each other's junk

588
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,715
And call it a massage? I wanna do it.

589
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:33,365
No, it's not! Look,
why is she even here?

590
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,481
She's not even in our energy group.

591
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,378
Did you just really say that?

592
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,271
Natalie...

593
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,965
Amanda, we take this
stuff pretty seriously.

594
00:25:45,965 --> 00:25:47,957
Daniel, I know, and
that's what scares me.

595
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:50,677
I think all this cleansing and vitamins

596
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:52,551
Isn't just giving you bad breath.

597
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,830
It's giving you bad judgment.

598
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,879
Why can't you see that all this is crap?

599
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:59,113
Look, just because you don't
get it doesn't mean it's crap.

600
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:02,777
Daniel, I know you miss Molly, but...

601
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:06,195
You have no idea what I'm going through.

602
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,721
You know what? This was
a mistake. You should go.

603
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,215
Daniel...

604
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,672
I can't believe I did that.

605
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:20,245
- That is so not me.
- Don't feel bad, chipmunk.

606
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,455
The guy is not right for you. That's it.

607
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,665
That's what I said.

608
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,294
But everyone else thinks
he's perfect for me.

609
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,157
Hmm. Why do people think
they know me so well?

610
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:30,407
Ah, people like to do that.

611
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,988
You know, they like to put you in a box.

612
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:34,309
It makes it easier for them.

613
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,928
Listen to me. Don't let
them do that, all right?

614
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,782
You're pretty. You're a smart girl.

615
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:40,191
You can date anybody you want.

616
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,300
You gotta try this.

617
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,624
I mixed the cherry with the
blue one and the root beer.

618
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:50,515
It's disgusting and
delicious. You gotta try it.

619
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:58,888
Look, Bobby, this is how I see it.

620
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:02,122
You get me. I get you.

621
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,055
Let's make it work.

622
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:10,289
Hey, put your tongue to
the roof of your mouth.

623
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:10,817
There you go.

624
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,020
You all right?

625
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:21,089
You know, it's so
crazy seeing you again.

626
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:22,645
Yeah.

627
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,155
A lot has changed.

628
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:27,719
I can't even remember why
Hilda and I ever broke up.

629
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,568
Oh, I know. I went to jail.

630
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:34,718
Ah, anyway, I think about Hilda a lot.

631
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,984
It kills me to think I ever let her go.

632
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,796
She seeing anyone?

633
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,315
Yeah.

634
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:43,710
She is.

635
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:48,331
I guess we always want
what we can't have, right?

636
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,253
Yeah.

637
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,904
I should probably get to homecoming now.

638
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,630
I heard your friend left.

639
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:10,398
Uh, y-you got the beads, didn't you?

640
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,348
So hard, isn't it?

641
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:19,745
The decision to let go of
the people holding us back.

642
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,421
But it means you know
what you want, Daniel.

643
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,695
And it means I was right.

644
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:28,087
It's time for you to go to level five.

645
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,883
Bennett, what is level five?

646
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,683
It's where you're reunited with Molly.

647
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,249
You mean in like a-a spiritual,

648
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,821
"She's all around me" kinda way?

649
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,214
No, I mean actually be with her.

650
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:44,984
Feel her.

651
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,383
Touch her.

652
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,850
Your relationship with Molly
doesn't have to be over.

653
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:53,084
I'm...

654
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,950
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,278
You have to know

656
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,244
- That sounds...
- Crazy?

657
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,178
- Yeah.
- Well, maybe it is.

658
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:02,542
Maybe your friend is right.

659
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:05,410
And you're certainly free to leave.

660
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,011
But tonight,

661
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:10,789
When you lay in bed missing Molly,

662
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,111
I hope you don't regret

663
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:16,077
Having given up the
possibility of seeing her again.

664
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:45,135
Papi! I'm sorry I'm
late. Is Larry upset?

665
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:48,332
No. Actually, I think he was relieved.

666
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:50,564
He was worried he wasn't
wearing enough layers.

667
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:52,104
Archie drove him home.

668
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:55,599
Well, why aren't you inside?

669
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:58,868
I needed a few minutes
away from your sister.

670
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:01,310
Yeah, I think I need a
few minutes to myself, too.

671
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,530
She's been in such a mood.
She won't stop with the...

672
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,986
I know, I know. You were ashamed of her.

673
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,320
I was protecting her!

674
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,463
What did I say?

675
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:15,707
After much consideration,
I must announce

676
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:17,879
That the "Fearless" shoot in the Bahamas

677
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,864
Will be my last.

678
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:21,982
I'm resigning from "Mode"...

679
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:24,518
To pursue other options.

680
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,639
Now I know that over the years,

681
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,157
The press has had a lot
of fun at my expense.

682
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:32,136
You've called me the "Meaner Hitler."

683
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:34,434
You've said that I was completely bald

684
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,556
And my wigs were made from orphan hair.

685
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:38,359
You've had me sleeping with everyone

686
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,343
From Madonna to J.F.K...

687
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:42,436
Only one of which is true.

688
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,920
Yes, we've had our fun over the years.

689
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,435
But I ask for one thing in return...

690
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:53,421
That you quote me exactly as I say.

691
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:58,272
"wilhelmina Slater is leaving
to pursue other options."

692
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,439
Wilhelmina, what other options?

693
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,027
So... Betty, I hear from
some of the cheerleaders

694
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,664
That we're dating. How serious are we?

695
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:10,308
I need to introduce you to my mother?

696
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:15,002
Oh, my god. I did not say that, I swear.

697
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:18,136
I mean, I didn't not say that.

698
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:19,902
This is really embarrassing.

699
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,039
Come on, chipmunk. Don't worry about it.

700
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,707
Kids say stuff. So what?

701
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,856
Look, when's our next lesson?

702
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:27,202
Bobby, I don't...

703
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:29,311
I don't think we should
do any more lessons.

704
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,287
Why? Sweetie, you need more practice.

705
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:36,756
Yeah... It wasn't really
ever about the driving.

706
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,742
I just wanted an excuse
to hang out with you.

707
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,826
Get out of here. What do you mean?

708
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:48,640
I guess I just wanted to...

709
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,867
Be the kind of girl who
could date a guy like you.

710
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:52,800
What do you mean, a guy like me?

711
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,284
I don't even know what that means.

712
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:55,991
In my family, you know, I'm a wuss.

713
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,841
No! come on, you're cool!

714
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,419
I had the biggest crush
on you when I was a kid.

715
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,358
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

716
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,730
- Wait, you knew?
- Yeah, I knew. I mean,

717
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:09,207
Come on, you were always around.

718
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,959
If you'd have given Hilda
and me five minutes alone,

719
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,352
- I'd have been Justin's father.
- Yeah, that's what Hilda said.

720
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:16,066
I just remember,

721
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:19,712
All I ever wanted was to
kiss you in the hallway,

722
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,704
Like you kissed all your girlfriends.

723
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,100
We're in a hallway...

724
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,001
No.

725
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,768
Thank you, but...

726
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,063
I'm okay.

727
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:31,948
All right.

728
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:34,444
I'll see you around, Betty.

729
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:40,278
Wait.

730
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,258
That was sweet.

731
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,162
Listen to me,

732
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:01,218
Don't worry about anybody
putting you in a box.

733
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:04,052
You were the weirdest kid I knew, ever.

734
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:06,588
Okay, and you still are a little bit.

735
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:08,351
And that's a good thing.

736
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:11,403
You understand?

737
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:29,074
Shamans in south America have
used this tea for centuries.

738
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,774
It enables them to become intermediaries

739
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:35,674
Between the spirit world and our world.

740
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,860
Oh, that's nasty.

741
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:46,226
Try it with a squeeze of
lemon. It really helps.

742
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,219
Hilda, what's wrong?

743
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,831
Nothing's wrong, Betty.

744
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,850
You wanna make out with bobby
in the hallway, go ahead.

745
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,390
- Guess that's who you are now, right?
- Don't worry, Hilda.

746
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,091
I'm still exactly who you want me to be.

747
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,229
I will always be your
less attractive, less cool,

748
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:09,398
Geeky little sister, so
no need to get jealous.

749
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:11,424
What are you talking
about? I'm not jealous.

750
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,424
Well, you're certainly acting
that way, which is stupid,

751
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,761
Because I may have just kissed Bobby,

752
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:18,122
But all he ever talks about is you.

753
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:23,986
I gotta get inside.

754
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:26,080
The--the ceremony's
about to start.

755
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,288
Ooh, I'm sensing tension
between the sisters Suarez.

756
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:32,488
Or as your people call it, la pasion.

757
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,038
- It's nothing.
- Ava?

758
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,478
Why aren't you practicing?

759
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:38,664
Your high vs are too low,
and your low vs are too high.

760
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:40,687
And I won't even bring
up your "candlestick."

761
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:44,400
- I feel bad about Justin.
- Justin? Why?

762
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,404
I really like him. It wasn't my idea.

763
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:50,288
What? What wasn't your idea?

764
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:58,860
And this year's homecoming king is...

765
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,784
Brandon Floyd!

766
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:04,962
Yeah, Brandon!

767
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,217
We're leaving? Why?
We gotta go right now.

768
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:14,716
I'll explain later.
We just gotta go now.

769
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:17,916
And this year's homecoming queen

770
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,749
Is...

771
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:24,116
Justin Suarez!

772
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:30,111
- I'm gonna sue this school.
- Come on,

773
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:30,921
Son. Let's go home. Come on.

774
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,310
Justin, let's just go. Come on.

775
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:33,888
Come on, sweetie pie. Get over there.

776
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:36,188
Justin, you can't go up there.

777
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,088
It's okay.

778
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,688
Oh, my god. He's gonna go for it.

779
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,480
What am I gonna do?
I gotta do something.

780
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,820
You can't always protect him, mija.

781
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:01,679
Oh, my god!

782
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,045
Thank you so much. I'm so honored.

783
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,646
Nothing can ruin this day,

784
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:09,646
Even this tacky baby's breath.

785
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:10,582
But, I mean, come on, guys.

786
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:14,779
I think you can do a little
bit better for your queen.

787
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,073
I'd say, "off with your heads!"

788
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,646
But for some of you,
that might not matter.

789
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:26,032
As much as I hate
giving up an accessory,

790
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:28,135
I think there's someone
who deserves this

791
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,395
A little bit
more than I do--

792
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,865
My mom.

793
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:35,274
She's an amazing person

794
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:38,753
And should've gotten this 15 years ago.

795
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:41,834
But that's kind of my fault.

796
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,805
She's with me every step of the way,

797
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:49,699
And that's pretty hard 'cause
I'm a high maintenance kid.

798
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:52,582
So... Thank you.

799
00:37:27,652 --> 00:37:29,860
Justin, you were
amazing! You were smart...

800
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,340
- So handsome and so cool!
- And sassy and fresh.

801
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,360
And in ten years, you're gonna
be at the top of your game,

802
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,474
And that guy is gonna be bald,

803
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:37,026
And he won't even be
able to see his feet.

804
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:39,411
Yeah! What you did up there took guts.

805
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:43,132
Honey, you know I love you,
right? No matter who you are.

806
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:46,562
- So what those kids were saying about you...
- Mom, it's a joke.

807
00:37:46,562 --> 00:37:49,947
I'm just playing along. I'm not gay.

808
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,718
Then he's not.

809
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:11,067
- I can't sleep.
- Me neither.

810
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:24,234
I don't want you to be
anybody but who you want to be.

811
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:27,229
I know.

812
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,628
I guess now

813
00:38:30,694 --> 00:38:33,961
I'm a woman who knows
how to drive stick shift.

814
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:38,294
Oh, hell, yeah!

815
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:40,943
So I figured out what I'm gonna

816
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,697
pitch for the "fearless" issue.

817
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:45,144
You making out with
Bobby in the hallway?

818
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:47,742
No.

819
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,094
You.

820
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,024
Yeah, right.

821
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:53,742
I'm serious.

822
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:58,293
Hilda, you're the bravest person I know.

823
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,260
You dated guys like Bobby.

824
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:05,573
You went to school
when you were pregnant.

825
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,487
And you held your head up high

826
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:10,040
No matter what anybody said about you.

827
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:16,786
And you raised the bravest
kid in the whole world.

828
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:20,362
I did, didn't I?

829
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,240
Thanks. That's sweet.

830
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:27,630
Don't forget to mention the salon.

831
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:32,349
It's actually really funny
that you were jealous of me.

832
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,446
What?! I was not jealous of you.

833
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:39,371
I wasn't! I was jealous of me.

834
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,204
I mean...

835
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,862
You know, the person that I was.

836
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:47,261
When did I get so boring?

837
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:52,666
Are you not happy with Archie?

838
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,836
No. No, no, no. No.

839
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,064
Archie's great. I'm just...

840
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,253
I'm just talking. I don't know.

841
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:12,052
Did you know that "Archie"
is short for "Archibald"?

842
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,119
Hilda and archibald.

843
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,201
Given the situation,

844
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:31,440
It's going to be a lot harder
to track the stolen money.

845
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,853
- What's going on?
- Excuse me.

846
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,520
It's about Connor Owens.

847
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,876
They found his body washed
up on a beach in panama.

848
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,489
He's dead.

849
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm so sorry, Wilhelmina.

850
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:53,186
Thank you for telling me.
