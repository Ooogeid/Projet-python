1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:04,496
<i>Previously on "ugly betty"...
That's lindsay dunne.</i>

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:06,966
He's the most powerful
publisher in all of britain.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,102
Please don't tell anyone.
It's just between us.

4
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:14,039
It's not the right time. No,
we'll still see each other. Long distance?

5
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,141
I guess I was destined
to be an alcoholic.

6
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:17,643
Consider willie your sponsor.

7
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:21,313
I think claire might have lied
to me about who my father is.

8
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:23,916
Henry, what we had was amazing,

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,051
And I'm always gonna be a
little bit in love with you.

10
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:29,722
That's okay, as long as it
doesn't keep us from moving on.

11
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,964
oh, how can
you drink that stuff?

12
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,767
It tastes like bad breath. Oh, no, I don't
drink that. But I hear it's good for you.

13
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,669
You know, you don't have
to fill in for amanda.

14
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,572
I can get a temp, really. It's fine.
I can totally do my own work here.

15
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:50,675
And it's kind of fun being
back at my old desk.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,878
Speaking of what a
great friend I am...

17
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:54,980
Were we? We are now.

18
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,583
I was wondering if you'd want to
come with me to hilda's wedding.

19
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:02,287
Are you asking mto be... Your date?

20
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,890
I mean, if you're free.
It's on Saturday.

21
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:07,259
Never mind. You probably
have something better to do.

22
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,394
No, it sounds like fun.

23
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,863
Oh. I was supposed to see
trista on Saturday, but...

24
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:15,233
What? What's with the face?
Why are you so down on her?

25
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,836
I'm sorry. She seems very sweet.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,672
It's just--
she sorta makes you dumb.

27
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,508
What? Wait.
I don't see that at all.

28
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,976
You know what?

29
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,912
It's none of my business.

30
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,748
I will stay out of it.

31
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:33,184
Why does amanda have a picture
of me sleeping in here?

32
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,886
It's not weird, right?

33
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,955
I mean, we lived
together for a year.

34
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:38,623
You don't have braces.

35
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:41,459
Oh, my god. This is recent.

36
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:45,897
You know, I am gonna
miss having her around.

37
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:48,833
Good morning, gentlemen. Mm.

38
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,305
Hello. Oh, good.

39
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:55,807
Ugh. Um, you don't work
here anymore. Remember?

40
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,809
You had that big dramatic exit

41
00:01:57,843 --> 00:01:59,911
Where you tried to tip
over the reception desk

42
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,347
And shouted out, "I'm a stylist now,
circus freaks.

43
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:04,516
<i>Take one last look at my
tight bee-hind."</i>

44
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,518
Yeah, but I needed some pencils.

45
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:09,654
Plus, how can I set up shop
without my sleeping betty?

46
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,723
Oh, that's nice. Is this new?

47
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,225
No, I'm just working with
a faster shutter spee

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,295
Oh, I got my first stylist referral--
spencer cannon.

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,297
He's one of those soap opera actors

50
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,299
Who's been on it 20 years. Oh.

51
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,702
He plays twins--an evil doctor
and a really evil doctor.

52
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:26,738
I'm gonna take him to the closet so we
can get ideas. You mean steal clothes?

53
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,406
Yeah. Uh-huh.

54
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,375
hey, marc. Hey, troy.

55
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:34,179
Oh, wow. Nice jeans.
They really make your package pop.

56
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,514
Oh. Thanks.

57
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,083
mm.

58
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,320
marc, stop it.
You have small shoulders.

59
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,955
You can't be desperate, too.

60
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,726
How could he leave me for
that poindexter? I loved troy.

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,761
really? Yeah,
in my own standoffish way.

62
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,296
Mm.

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,566
Hey, your ward's here.

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,736
Oh! Hey. What's up, junior?

65
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,306
Could I talk to you?
It's really important.

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,375
Okay. Come on.

67
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,554
So that really important thing

68
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,657
You had to talk to me about--

69
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:20,458
Did it involve words?

70
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:23,695
You want to do this later?
Can you please just give me a second?

71
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,032
Yes. Of course. Of course.
I'm sorry. Take your time.

72
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,702
Bobby's gonna say something,
and everyone's gonna find out.

73
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:33,371
I'm not sure I know what you--

74
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:35,340
He walked in on me and austin.

75
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:37,175
He saw us kissing.

76
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:42,013
Um, so...

77
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,049
Is austin your...

78
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,583
boyfriend?

79
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,185
I don't know.

80
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,219
Maybe.

81
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:51,122
But why does anyone have to know?

82
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,026
W... Um, okay.

83
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,761
First of all,

84
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:59,531
You have a boyfriend. Yay for you.

85
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,600
I don't.

86
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,402
Um, but also,

87
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:07,539
If you don't want anyoneto know,

88
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,541
They don't have to know.

89
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,144
A really great guy.

90
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,647
He's not gonna say anything.

91
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,983
And as far as your mom goes...

92
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,220
She's pretty cool.

93
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:25,123
Well, what happened
when you told your mom?

94
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:26,458
well.

95
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,961
My experience was not
necessarily the norm.

96
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,563
It was bad, right?

97
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,565
Your family is
completely different.

98
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,567
I don't want them to know.

99
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:37,702
O-okay. Okay. Breathe.

100
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,739
You don't have to say a
word until you're ready.

101
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,711
<i>...So stop by the art department,
and I'll have the--</i>

102
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,913
delete. Pause.
Okay, here are the earrings

103
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:51,249
That I promised hilda
for her wedding. Oh.

104
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,217
And here are the diet pills.

105
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,353
I want her skinny as
a beautiful corpse

106
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,523
<i>When your papi helps her down the aisle.
Thank you. And since you've been so helpful,</i>

107
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,159
Hilda says you should
bring a plus one.

108
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:03,428
Some of our family can't come.
They got deported?

109
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,897
<i>hey, betty.
It's me.</i>

110
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,267
<i>Henry? Got your message about coming
to hilda's wedding on Saturday.</i>

111
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:12,770
<i>What? Your timing couldn't be better.
I'll be in new york anyway.</i>

112
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,839
<i>We're actually about to
get on the plane.</i>

113
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:17,341
It sounds like he put
on a few pounds. Shh.

114
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,777
<i>So... Yeah, I'd love to
be your date. Okay.</i>

115
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:21,712
<i>What? I'll see you when I get in.</i>

116
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,582
<i>How is that possible?
I never invited him. Bye.</i>

117
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,350
Yeah, you did.

118
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:28,219
<i>sorry.</i>

119
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,388
<i>That was a hiccup, not a burp.</i>

120
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,890
<i>Hilda's getting married,
and I was wondering</i>

121
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:36,527
<i>If you'd like to come to the
wedding as my date.</i>

122
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,996
Oh, my god.

123
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,832
Oh, my god. I did.

124
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,733
Ugh! I remember now.

125
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,902
Why would I do that?

126
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,838
Who knows why you
do anything, lady?

127
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,873
That's why we love
you justs you are--

128
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,942
Brown and complicated.

129
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,112
my first client's here.
Kiss for good luck? Mnh-mnh.

130
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,347
You're so withholding.

131
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,219
Good news.

132
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,254
Your mother loves the
crochet kit I sent.

133
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,356
She's making me a sweater...

134
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,326
And it'll be perfect for
the fall. Mm, thanks.

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,663
I'm going to "mode" today.
I'm gonna tell claire meade

136
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,932
That I want my shares
of that company.

137
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,869
When I think of the
poverty you grew up in,

138
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,238
It just--it breaks my heart.

139
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,740
But, tyler,
can--can I say something?

140
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,142
A-anything.

141
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,078
Wilhelmina, you're the on
person I trust anymore.

142
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,646
Oh.

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,283
Well, tyler,
that means the world to me.

144
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,385
It's just th--

145
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,188
Being around the meades
cost you your sobriety.

146
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:40,057
And, uh,ith the shares,

147
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,326
You will be tied to
them indefinitely.

148
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,328
Well, can't I sell them?

149
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,064
Well, I-I assume so,
but in--in this climate,

150
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,467
It's gonna be hard to find a buyer.
Well, I don't want that!

151
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:54,005
I just wanna get my
money and go home.

152
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,607
Okay, okay. Well,
let's think about this.

153
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:58,442
There's always a solution.

154
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,981
I suppose I could buy your shares.

155
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:07,552
I mean, I'm--I'm used to dealing
with the meades. You'd do that?

156
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:08,920
Why not?

157
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,722
A few more shares doesn't
mean a thing to me.

158
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:18,396
Oh, uh, and I want a
commitment not to drink today.

159
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,264
I won't.

160
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,466
Good.

161
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,836
I'm taking temptation away.

162
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,988
So you drunk dialed henry?
Why would you do that?

163
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,590
I don't know.

164
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:48,125
Well, it must mean something
if you drunk dialed him.

165
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,895
Well, come on. I mean,
you've drunk dialed me before.

166
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,965
"betty, I'm locked out.
" "betty, I can't find my phone."

167
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,400
"betty, is my hair thinning?" okay,
that never happened,

168
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:01,606
Because my hair is
not getting thin.

169
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,608
<i>Is that henry is on a plane,</i>

170
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:07,011
And he thinks that he's coming
to hilda's wedding with me.

171
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,281
Are you uninviting me?

172
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,650
Because I canceled plans.

173
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:15,152
No, no. No. Hilda
wants you to be there.

174
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:18,089
You could bring trista.

175
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,992
I thought, uh, trista made me dumb.
But you like that.

176
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:25,596
Come on, daniel.
Why are you being like this?

177
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,598
I'll just make sure
and powder my head.

178
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:32,003
I wouldn't want the pictures
to blind anyone. Thank you.

179
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,705
Okay, hilda, so it's settled.

180
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,074
I am going to the
wedding with henry,

181
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,609
Which is really weird,

182
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,145
And daniel is going
with trista, which is...

183
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,148
Well, it is what it is.
Anyway, call me when you get this.

184
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,051
God, I don't know how this day
could get any more complicated.

185
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,654
Aah! Oh.

186
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,423
Sorry. Mr. Dunne. Hi.
What are you doing here?

187
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,358
And why aren't you in london?

188
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,926
I'm here to see you.

189
00:08:55,961 --> 00:09:00,064
You have exactly the right voice
for a new magazine I'm starting,

190
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:03,668
A sort of younger person's "
new yorker."

191
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:06,037
Oh, my god.

192
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,272
Really?

193
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:11,709
I think my
voice would be perfect for that.

194
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:14,779
yes, I love your
shrill american enthusiasm.

195
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:16,714
so,
uh, what, you, um,

196
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,216
You want me to contribute
to your new magazine?

197
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,420
No. I want you to help me run it...

198
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:24,255
Ah!

199
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,923
In london.

200
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:30,594

202
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:43,735
He's leaving on Sunday,

203
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,837
And he wants an answer by then.

204
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,106
Wow. Henry's in town...

205
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,744
You got a new job offer-
you're having quite a day.

206
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,146
I am getting
married in three days.

207
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:57,482
I swear to god, if you upstage me,

208
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,385
I will stab you in the heart.
Hilda, comon.

209
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,954
Eat something already, please.
You're scaring me.

210
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,390
Besides, I know I'm
not taking the job.

211
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:07,258
It's less money,
and it's in london.

212
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:10,095
Whatever makes you happy.
I gotta go.

213
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:13,031
I got a thousand things to do,
and justin is no help.

214
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,233
He's always off with
that austin kid.

215
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,969
Well, you know, he's got a
new friend and... (gasps

216
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,751
Okay, I just want to get
a feel for your colors

217
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,219
Before we hit the store

218
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,187
And start racking
up credit card debt.

219
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,656
I love shopping more than my
own grandmother. Oh, please.

220
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:41,826
I skipped my nana's funeral
to go to the mall. Okay.

221
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:44,696
I can see
that we need to stay away

222
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,564
From anything in the salmon family,

223
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,768
Mostly because I hate salmon.
I hate salmon, too. I hate all fish colors.

224
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,771
me, too. You know,
there was something about you

225
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,707
That I automatically liked,
and that is not a come-on,

226
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,637
Because you are just too old
and too gay for me.

227
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,292
There's nothing I like more than a
backhanded compliment.

228
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:01,780
Me, too.

229
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:04,115
Okay, we are, like, the same woman.

230
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,084
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

231
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:08,686
I'm totally setting you up
with my best friend marc.

232
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,656
Well, I wasn't thinking that,
but I totally am now.

233
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,625
How weird is that? It's eerie.

234
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:21,499
I'm not surprised you
got offered that job in london.

235
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,601
Your blog is amazing. Thanks.

236
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,036
and it doesn't hurt

237
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:27,005
That you have a slight
british accent now.

238
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,774
I do not. There it is.
I do not.

239
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,510
say "crumpet.
" say "crumpet." stop. No. No!

240
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:35,413
Come on. You had it on the message that
you left me. vroom. Vroom. Vroom.

241
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,548
Yeah.

242
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,349
Oh, about that message,

243
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:40,685
Um, I'm sorry.

244
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,521
I am really glad you're
coming to hilda's wedding.

245
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:45,623
I was just...

246
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:49,194
A little nervous about what
you might read into it.

247
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,762
Right. That...

248
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:53,431
That you might be opening
something back up?

249
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,200
Yeah.

250
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,734
Exactly.

251
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,703
It's just--it was so
complicated before

252
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:01,272
And had so many obstacles and...

253
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,841
Yeah.

254
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,776
I need to tell you something.

255
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,612
Uh, the reason that I'm here...

256
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:09,547
I have a job interview tomorrow.

257
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:12,684
Head of accounting at
a very big law firm,

258
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,619
And, uh, they're-
they're telling me

259
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,088
That essentially,
the job's mine, so...

260
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:18,456
Wow.

261
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,160
Um, so you're moving
back to new york?

262
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:24,028
Yeah.

263
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:26,164
Charlie's gonna go
to school at parsons,

264
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,534
And little nate's gonna
spend half his time with her

265
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:31,636
And half his time with me,
so I'll be here.

266
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,571
Maybe it's not such a bad thing

267
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:36,374
That you're not taking  that jo.

268
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,745
I don't know what to say.

269
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,448
That's--that's huge.

270
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,350
Yeah.

271
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,285
Let's make it a little smaller.

272
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,387
Uh, do you wanna have
breakfast tomorrow?

273
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,325
Yeah.

274
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,863
Great.

275
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,298
Hey, daniel.

276
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:02,000
Look who's here.

277
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,269
Hey. Hey, little guy.

278
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:05,904
I mean him.

279
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,439
It's great to see you, man.

280
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,576
Betty said you're back in town for a
bit? Yeah, hopefully longer than a bit.

281
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,312
I'm, uh, interviewing for a job tomorrow,
so...

282
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:17,749
Hey, Nate, where did you
get that shoe? It's mine.

283
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,284
no, honey. Sorry.

284
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:22,120
I'll find the real owner. Okay.
Well, it was good to see you.

285
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,056
I'll see you tomorrow for breakfast.
It a date. Bye, nate.

286
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,058
Okay. Say bye. Attaboy.
See you tomorrow.

287
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,060
okay. Good-bye.

288
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:30,995
So what's going on?

289
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,498
He's back, and "it's a date"?

290
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:36,434
No, it's not a date.
It's a breakfast.

291
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,837
I don't know why you wanna
go down this road again.

292
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:43,675
I don't want to see you get hurt. That's
very sweet, daniel, but I'm not on that road.

293
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,944
I don't know what road I'm on,

294
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:50,014
But whatever it is,
it's totally new.

295
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,786
Here you go, bobby.

296
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,354
Oh, justin, hold on.

297
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:59,490
Have you decided on the long tie,
the bow tie

298
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,526
Or the open collar, which I hate,

299
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,129
But you said you can pull off? Um,
you decide. I'm going to meet austin.

300
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,365
Where are you going? Nowhere.
Just hanging out.

301
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:14,639
Why is everything with austin
always such a big secret?

302
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:16,908
No secret. What?
Austin's a good kid.

303
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:20,011
They're both good kids.
Everything's cool, you know.

304
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,713
What's going on?

305
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,147
Do you know something?

306
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,149
No! I don't know anything.

307
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:28,186
What... What would I know?

308
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,822
<i>You do know something.</i>

309
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:33,191
I swear to god, bobby,
you beer tell me.

310
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,560
No, I can't.

311
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:37,562
I promised I wouldn't say anything.

312
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,431
I'm not gonna break that promise.
He's on drugs.

313
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:43,334
Oh, my god. That austin kid has
got my baby hooked on drugs!

314
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,503
It's not drugs.

315
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,072
Well, then what is it, bobby?

316
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,842
Because I cannot tnk
of another reason

317
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:53,344
Why my son is always
spending time with austin.

318
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:55,346
Oh, suddenly, he's
sneaking off all the time

319
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:58,182
Or he's up in the
room with the door...

320
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,586
Oh.

321
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,088
Look, you didn't hear
that from me, all right?

322
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,900
Oh, thank god. Where have you been?

323
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,569
You lied to me.

324
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:21,739
You told me that
my father was dead.

325
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:24,642
I'm sorry you had to
find out that way,

326
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:27,111
And I want to talk to you about it,

327
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,480
But not while you've been drinking.

328
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:34,018
We need to get you some help. No. The only
thing I want for you is shares of your
company.

329
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:36,921
You don't mean that.
How do you know what I mean?

330
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:39,223
Tyler! Stop it!

331
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,259
You don't know anything about me.

332
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,760
You got rid of me.

333
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,862
Oh. Oh, my god. Honey, I'm sorry.

334
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:48,232
No! No, you just figure out
a way to make it happen,

335
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:51,035
Or I go to cal hartley,

336
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,706
And I know that that's the
last thing that you want.

337
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,740
*

338
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,476
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

339
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,079
Hi. Oh! You brought nate.

340
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,915
Yeah, we had a change of schedules.
Is that okay?

341
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,384
Of course. Hi, nate.

342
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,487
Wow. hey. Sorry.
He hasn't had his coffee.

343
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,957
That's okay. Oh, hey.
I, uh, I found this in my suitcase.

344
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,993
I wanted to show you.
A picture of...

345
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,463
Oh, wow. Can I see?

346
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:27,265
Oh, my god. I was so different.

347
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,368
yeah.

348
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,737
this feels great.

349
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,840
Yeah, this is nice.

350
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,275
Oh, I am so sorry. Mine! No!

351
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,743
You okay? I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh.

352
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:40,445
Can you please keep your kid quiet?

353
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,615
I'm sorry, he's not my kid. Ow!

354
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,785
Um... Sorry. That was...

355
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,688
It's okay. Let me get him. Sorry.
I didn't mean that. That sounded terrible.

356
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,057
I love kids. I-I do want kids.

357
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,326
You know I want, like, 20... Yeah.

358
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,762
Just one day, you know,
not now. It's okay.

359
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:01,466
there you go, sweetie.
Okay? That's good. Just...

360
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:04,069
Um, hey, I-I wanted to tell you.

361
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,104
Uh, that piece that
you did in your blog

362
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,773
About the female guard at
buckingham palace was amazing.

363
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,276
Ohh. Thank you. Thank you so much.

364
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,446
oh. That was--that was-
-I was just so inspired ilondon,

365
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,048
And it would have been
such a perfect piece

366
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,951
For this new magazine. No, honey.
I'm sorry. You know what, sweetie?

367
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:23,722
Maybe I could find a way to get... Come on.
Remember? Doughnuts are dead food. Okay?

368
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:26,658
get
it to work for "mode."

369
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,027
I'm sorry. I'm listening.
You know what? It's fine.

370
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,897
I have to get to work
anyway. But this has been really fun.

371
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,632
sure.

372
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,334
Thank you. Ooh. Have a good day, guys.
Hi, hilda. Okay, you, too.

373
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,572
Betty, justin's got a boyfriend!
Meet me at your place at 1:00.

374
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,676
Wow. Pretty good arm.

375
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,679
Although, I probably could
have done the same thing,

376
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,781
You know, if I warmed up a little.

377
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,816
He is not in his right mind.

378
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,219
This is not the boy
I've gotten to know.

379
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:57,155
Mom, you've known him
a couple of weeks.

380
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,256
You sound pretty naive. I mean, even
wilhelmina saw this coming.

381
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,673
Wilhelmina?
What did she say?

382
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,727
She said it was gonna
come to money, whichs

383
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,430
Why I offered him a check
when we were at the club.

384
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,432
You offered him money?

385
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,368
Yeah. Apparently, not enough.
And you're taking advice from wilhelmina?

386
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,271
Doesn't that seem like a dumb
thing to do?

387
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,207
No, it doesn't,
not when she's right.

388
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,842
Uh, it's trista. Sorry,
I gotta take this. Hey.

389
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,547
Marc, just give spencer
a chance.

390
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:24,082
You will love him.

391
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,718
He's like me, but with junk.

392
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,621
I can't, mandy.
I am still grieving over troy.

393
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,691
I don't think I'll ever be able
to be in a relationship again.

394
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:36,361
He's like me with big junk.

395
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,431
Why am I getting an e-mail
from ignacio suarez?

396
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,201
Oh, my god.

397
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:46,938
Ah.

398
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:48,873
Well...

399
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:51,076
I like the enthusiasm,

400
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,511
But... Is this all a
little bit too much?

401
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,480
Yeah, it is. Listen to her.

402
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,316
Come on. Can't we wait until
after the wedding at least?

403
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,252
This is one of the
most important things

404
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,254
That will ever happen to justin,

405
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:05,156
And he needs to know that we accept him.
We told him to come here after class,

406
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,459
And when he walks in,
we're all gonna shout...

407
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:10,295
we're know
you're gay, and that's okay!

408
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,766
Okay, so maybe we put
that in the card.

409
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,369
Well, justin does like a good party

410
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,271
And... Colorful things.

411
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,772
That's the gay flag.

412
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,675
Gays do not have a favorite color.
They like 'em all.

413
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,878
<i>Mija, look at all these
groups they have--</i>

414
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,346
P.F.L.A.G., g.L.S.E.N.

415
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,982
And everything came in
this fun starter kit.

416
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,951
And look, a strawberry lip balm.

417
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:36,655
<i>Oh. This is so gonna bite me in the ass.
Ay, please.</i>

418
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,623
Stop. Stop this right now.

419
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:41,326
they like
to make entrances.

420
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,295
Have you people lost your minds?

421
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:46,064
You cannot do this.
Why not? We're fine with it.

422
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:48,533
It's not about you
being fine with it.

423
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,935
It's about justin
being fine with it.

424
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,371
Really, you know, I expected you to know
better. Well...

425
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,954
why do I always
have to know better?

426
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,575
Thanks. Thank you.
You saved my life.

427
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,112
Would you listen to the man? Come on. He's...
He's an expert. What is with this family?

428
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,415
I mean, it is one thing
to be accepting...

429
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:05,350
We're just trying to help.

430
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:07,319
If justin is ever gonna have

431
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,820
Loving and sustaining
relationships,

432
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:12,524
It is important for him to feel
the acceptance of his family.

433
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,726
Th-that's a pretty big statement.

434
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,629
No, it is true. It is in
everything that we have read.

435
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,898
Just because your mother doesn't
accept your homosexuality

436
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,900
Does not mean that
I won't have a la--

437
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,569
Does not mean that one won't
have a lasting relationship.

438
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,906
But I do accept it. Yeah.
Marc, who are we talking about?

439
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,177
Uh, it's right here.

440
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:35,146
Oh, just...

441
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,148
Don't believe everything
you read, okay?

442
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:40,085
Justin will come out when
justin wants to come out,

443
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,087
And then you will
all act surprised,

444
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:45,590
And you will never ever
mention this hideous idea.

445
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:47,959
Oh! Oh!

446
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:49,561
They like their exits, too.

447
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:54,332
I'll go out with spencer.

448
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:57,102
really? Yeah. Who says I
can't have a healthy relationship?

449
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,471
Oh. Uh, he might have just
been thinking casual sex,

450
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,073
But he's coming to the wedding,

451
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:05,143
So you guys can totally
figure it out.

452
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:10,815
*

453
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,619
* I'm a fashion film *

454
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,188
* 'cause I want it all *

455
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:22,427
Higher. Nice. Chin up. Chin up.

456
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:25,029
Make sure you get them here,
from here up--

457
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,965
I don't know how,

458
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,933
And I don't know why,

459
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,369
But I know you got to tyler.

460
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:33,838
This has your stink all over it.

461
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,408
Oh, claire, have you escaped
from your handlers again

462
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,977
Or have they allowed
you a senior outing?

463
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:42,280
This boy is an alcoholic.

464
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:43,982
He is troubled.

465
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,851
Isn't that the pickled lush
calling the kettle black?

466
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,187
You bitch!

467
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,256
Hey. Ow!

468
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,458
wha--you rotten...

469
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:56,094
God, you--you-- get-
-you get over here!

470
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,129
You crazy-- aah!

471
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,131
Aah! Aah!

472
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,970
Oh, no, you don't! Aah!

473
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,773
pull 'em apart!

474
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:10,575
aah!

475
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:14,612
You see that,
everyone? She attacked me!

476
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,948
Stay away from my son!

477
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:24,589
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was just about to leave.

478
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,058
Is everything okay?
I'm not getting that job.

479
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:29,394
What? Yeah, apparently
my old boss called

480
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:32,263
Angave me a bad recommendation.
Wilhelmina?

481
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:33,531
Nope.

482
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,900
Daniel, you cost him his job!

483
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:43,107
When I see you making such a big mistake?
No, you don't! And who said it was a
mistake?

484
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:45,567
You are moving backwards. You have so much
ahead of you. Oh, my god!

485
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,159
Talk about moving
backwards.

486
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,215
What are you doing with trista?
Aren't you past that?

487
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,885
That is so completely different.
You know what? Let's just make a deal.

488
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,387
I will stay out of
your personal life,

489
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,790
And you stay out of mine!

490
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:18,007
I have
some nail polish remover

491
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,809
In the bathroom.

492
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,245
I heard you can get
a buzz off that.

493
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,113
Don't go through my things.

494
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,215
Claire's not gonna
give me anything.

495
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,051
be patient.
She will.

496
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,486
Yeah, well, why should she?
I'm nothing to her.

497
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:33,423
I'm just some stupid
piece of white trash

498
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,391
That's here ruining
her perfect life.

499
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,860
Tyler, pull it together.

500
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:41,497
I know you're angry.
You have every right to be.

501
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:43,933
But don't take it out
on yourself. Channel it!

502
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,502
Channel it towards claire meade.

503
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,704
Ugh, what a crap day!

504
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:15,264
So we both have the same one.
That's cool, right?

505
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,200
Totally. Yeah. Um, I love it.

506
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:18,701
Me, too.

507
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:20,903
Uh, my mom won't really let up

508
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,839
About, uh, you coming
to the wedding.

509
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:25,007
Well, I will, if you want me to.

510
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,943
It's okay if you don't.

511
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,245
I-I do. I do. I just--

512
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,215
I feel like I'm gonna be under
some sort of microscope.

513
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:35,251
I get it. 's okay, but,
you know, if I do go,

514
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:37,153
No one would have to know anything.

515
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,956
I just like hanging out with you.

516
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,558
you know what?
You should come. You sure?

517
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,527
Yeah. Cool.

518
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,263
I-is it dumb to have
the same bracelet?

519
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:50,032
Yes, I totally hate the color.
Wanna take it back?

520
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:53,336
Yeah. Let's do it.

521
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,938
You know, my face isn't
actually perfect.

522
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:57,874
But it works on me.

523
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,375
Do you know,

524
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,178
If I hadn't spilled my drink
on you at the revlon party,

525
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:05,581
We wouldn't have met? Yeah, I know.
It was a real blessing in the skies.

526
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:10,853
Wait. "blessing in the skies.
" does that sound weird?

527
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:13,256
No, no. That's right.
"bleing in the skies."

528
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,424
The party was outside.
right.

529
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:18,861
I wonder what you would
say if we met inside?

530
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:21,564
'cause, you know,
there'no sky.

531
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,000
irregardless, trista,
we should probably get going.

532
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:26,936
Wait, did I just say "irregardless"?
Is that a word?

533
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,905
I don't know.
Do you like my earrings?

534
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:30,273
Yeah.

535
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:56,832
Great news! I got the job.

536
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,268
Daniel must have called them back.

537
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:01,837
Oh, good. I ew he would
do the right thing.

538
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:03,739
Yeah, well, thank you.

539
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:05,775
Come in.

540
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,243
Great.

541
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:09,245
Wow, betty, this place is amazing.

542
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,214
Hey, do you wanna go celebrate?

543
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:13,883
I thought maybe we could go

544
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:17,353
To that thai restaurant we used to love.
Oh, it's not there anymore.

545
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:19,789
Oh. Well. Henry, can we talk a--

546
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,290
"affordable london apartments."

547
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:23,659
Are you thinking
about taking the job?

548
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:26,128
No. No, no. I was just curious.

549
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:29,265
I w--no. yeah, well, I mean,
if you're thinking about taking it,

550
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,935
I'd just kinda like to know. No, I'm not.
I'm not. I-I was just looking.

551
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,104
It's just a really
great opportunity.

552
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,007
It's sort of hard
to let go of, so...

553
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,076
Well, why are you letting it go?

554
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:42,011
It's not 'cause of me, is it?

555
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:44,447
No. Because I do not
want to be the one

556
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,415
That keeps you from
living your life.

557
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,784
If you want to take that job,
then you should.

558
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,640
You should take it. You should travel the
world if you want to.

559
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,835
Henry it's not you. It's...

560
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:54,857
<i>My sister's getting married,
and papi's gonna be alone,</i>

561
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:56,826
And there's all this
stuff with justin.

562
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,062
It's just-
it isn't the right time.

563
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,166
And...

564
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,902
It's not the right
time for us, either.

565
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,971
You feel that way, too?

566
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,308
Yes.

567
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,946
It would've been nice,
though, right?

568
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,448
To have what we had
three years ago?

569
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,484
Yeah.

570
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:24,287
But it's not three years ago.

571
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:27,156
It definitely isn't.

572
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,659
I have a wet rice
cake in my pocket.

573
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,127
Ew.

574
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:35,965
Uh, listen, you still
like thai food, right?

575
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,500
Yeah.

576
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:41,337
See, that's one thing
that hasn't changed.

577
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:43,339
No, that will never change.

578
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,841
okay.
You know a new place?

579
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:48,344
Yeah, but you're paying
this time, right?

580
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:50,780
yes, absolutely.

581
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:04,622
Hi. Hi. Wow.

582
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:07,058
You ready? Is bobby out there?

583
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:09,294
Oh, his parents have
him in the back.

584
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:11,796
He was nervous, so they gave
him some sacramental wine. Oh.

585
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:14,065
I had some, too.

586
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,434
God, hilda, you look so beautiful.

587
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:18,536
Doesn't she? Oh.

588
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,439
Oh, my god. I just wanna eat something.
Mama, the second this thing is over,

589
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:23,608
You can eat your face off. Yeah.

590
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,544
Over? This is the happiest
day of my life. Ohh.

591
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,380
ohh. All right.
Let's do this bitch.

592
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:34,953
Hey.

593
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:42,160
You look great.

594
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:44,028
Thank you.

595
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:49,501
So, um, thanks for helping
henry get his job back.

596
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:50,969
Betty, I'm really sorry.

597
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,971
I should probably go
say something to him.

598
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:56,174
He's not coming. You were right.

599
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,576
I was going backwards.

600
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,779
You okay?

601
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:02,247
Yeah.

602
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:06,151
We're just in two
very different places.

603
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:09,154
I guess you know me
better than I thought.

604
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:11,589
Well, you know me pretty well, too.

605
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,459
Trista definitely brings
out the dumb in me.

606
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:17,061
"irregardless" isn't a word, is it?

607
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:18,463
No.

608
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:25,703
* I can tell *

609
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:29,574
* by the way you look at me *

610
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:33,444
* you need to be mine *

611
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,848
* we could sit,
watch the stars all night *

612
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:41,786
* till they disappear
into the sky *

613
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,288
I do.

614
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,223
I do.

615
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,459
* be my only, be my only *

616
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,864
* good, bad *

617
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:56,835
* I take it all *

618
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:00,338
* love's wrecking ball *

619
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:04,275
<i>* since the first time
that I ever saw you *</i>

620
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,847
<i>* you've been with me *</i>

621
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,748
<i>* hanging 'rod every day *</i>

622
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,217
<i>Oh, mami, please.</i>

623
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:14,452
I'm just gonna welcome
him to the family.

624
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:18,022
I love him, but he's
gonna say something stupid. Oh! Oh!

625
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:19,891
<i>* l-o-v-e *</i>

626
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,993
<i>* I love you *</i>

627
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,429
Hey.

628
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:26,297
And we're circulating
and mingling...

629
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,299
"oh, thank you for coming.

630
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:31,336
<i>Hello, aunt spanish,
you look bonita."</i>

631
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,304
I'm gonna get us some sodas.

632
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:35,807
Okay.

633
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,076
He seems nice.

634
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,510
Are you okay?

635
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,413
I don't know.
I-I hate having a secret.

636
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:44,582
I just--I feel so
far away from them.

637
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:47,151
Does it help that I know?

638
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:49,120
Yeah. Even bobby, sort of.

639
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:51,522
Well, that, my friend,
is what it feels like

640
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:54,259
When you don't have to
keep a secret anymore--

641
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,227
Relief.

642
00:30:56,262 --> 00:31:00,231
I just feel like
everything's gonna change.

643
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:02,300
It will.

644
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,569
But... For the better.

645
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:06,971
<i>But it's up to you.</i>

646
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,940
Only you will kn when
the time is right.

647
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:10,575
marc, he's here!

648
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:14,078
Hi! Okay. Spencer, marc.

649
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:16,347
Silver fox, purple ferret. Hello.

650
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:18,716
yeah, hi. See,
you two are totally hitting it off already.

651
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,051
Yeah, um-- kiss.

652
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,486
No--ooh! hello.
Oh.

653
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,987
<i>Salud! Whoo-hoo!</i>

654
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:25,189
<i>Cheers! Salud! Amor. Dinero.</i>

655
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:28,126
um, can I have the mic,
please? Thank you so much.

656
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,062
Oh, boy. it is my party.
I just want to talk.

657
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:33,464
I think your days of talking are over,
right?

658
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,167
You're a married woman now.
Sit down.

659
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,670
Oh, my god.
Are you done? Okay, good.

660
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:42,140
I just want to say that
I'm so freaking hap!3.

661
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:44,208
I just married my best friend.

662
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:45,710
ohh.

663
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:47,378
I knew that I loved bobby...

664
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,747
Well, when he told me
that I did.

665
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,351
But he was right.

666
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,820
I just needed
some time to figure it out.

667
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:57,922
<i>But I knew that bobby loved me...</i>

668
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,724
when he told me

669
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:02,493
That he would throw himself
under a bus for me.

670
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:03,995
Ohh.

671
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:05,930
I know, right?

672
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,932
I would do that,oo, baby,

673
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,401
Because... That's love, right?

674
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:13,237
When you know somebody
better than they do...

675
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:14,739
And...

676
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:17,308
When you would do anything...

677
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:19,777
In the world to protect them.

678
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,280
I love you, baby.

679
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:30,321
Tyler, this is the third
message I've left.

680
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:33,791
Dick cheney returns my
calls after one. Call me.

681
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,268
dancing
for the very first time,

682
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:56,671

Hard to know when to
take that next step.

698
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,782
Yeah.

699
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:44,218

Sometimes I feel like I have

00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,205
But look at them.

752
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,441

That you have the mouth
of a silent movie st?

767
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,611
Sexy and cruel.

768
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:32,947
Of course.

769
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:34,215
Spencer...

770
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,951
Hmm?

771
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,120
I get that you like me,

772
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:42,790
And I like that you like me,

773
00:37:42,824 --> 00:37:45,659
But let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

774
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:47,595
Um, re gonna pursue me,

775
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,396
And I'm gonna...

776
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:51,465
Take advantage of that.

777
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,568
It's kind of a pattern with me.

778
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:56,637
I think...

779
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,572
<i>*</i>

780
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:01,408
It probably has to do with
my mother rejecting me,

781
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:02,876
Blah, blah, blah.

782
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,879
Anyway...

783
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:08,949
I want to break that pattern.

784
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:11,051
I want to have a real relationship

785
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:14,588
<i>With someone that I
really care about.</i>

786
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:16,023

787
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:19,193
I get it.

788
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:21,996
So... You just want to fool
around in the bushes?

789
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:25,699
Kidding.

790
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,368
Well, it's--it's probably better.

791
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,637
Honestly, I-I only said
I would go out with you

792
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,406
Because amanda wanted me to. Mm.

793
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,509
I would do anything
for that girl. Yeah.

794
00:38:35,543 --> 00:38:37,544
I'm--I'm sorry.

795
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:39,013
It's scratching.

796
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,981
I--amanda left the tag in

797
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:42,916
In case we wanted to return it.

798
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:49,657
<i>my real father has
that bird tattoo.</i>

799
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,827

Um, I know that you're

802
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:03,871
So I wanted to make sure

803
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:05,639
Um...

804
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:08,942
I have decided that I would
like to accept your offer.

805
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:11,545
Um, I would like the job,

806
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,248
So... Yeah.

807
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:16,483
Um, okay.

Cheerio!

00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:26,927
claire,
we need to talk about tyler.

810
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:28,896
I think I've made a
terrible mistake,

811
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,931
But you're gonna pay the price.

812
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:33,867
wilhelmina, I'm way too busy
for your bull. Oh, for god sakes,

813
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:36,003
Put your hearing aid
in and listen to me!

814
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:39,940
I'm trying to warn you.
That boy is dangerous.

815
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:42,576
she's right.

816
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:51,352
Tyler, what are you doing?

817
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:54,388
Why did you have to find me?

818
00:39:54,422 --> 00:39:59,059
<i>Everything was better without you.</i>

819
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:00,828
And now...

820
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:03,330
It's all falling apart.

821
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,133
Honey... Let me help you.

822
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,969
<i>No.</i>

823
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:13,674
I don't want anything from you.

824
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:16,477
Tyler...

825
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:18,379
If...

826
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:20,681
I could go back

827
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:24,418
And change everything I did,

828
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:26,053
I would.

829
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:28,021
But I can't.

830
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,491
You're my son.

831
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:36,196
I know you don't want to do this.

832
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:44,905
Tyler, listen to me.

833
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:46,874
I know you're hurting,

834
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:50,210
But claire has nothing
to do with this.

835
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:53,046
You're confused, and it's my fault.

836
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,282
I'm the one who made feel this way.

837
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:56,784
And I'm sorry, so...

838
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:58,886
Give me the gun,

839
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,457
And I will try to
make things right.

840
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,492
Claire loves you,

841
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:10,397
And I think somewhere,
you know that.

842
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,901
Oh, baby, it's all right.

843
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,136
I'm sorry.

844
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,372
Why don't you give me...

845
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,873
The gun?
