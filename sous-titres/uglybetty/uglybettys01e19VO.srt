00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,420
Previously on "ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,980
Why are you stalking me?

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,550
Excuse me? 
I am not stalking you.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,270
I am monitoring an illegal Immigrant 
who is a flight risk.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,130
What is this?

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,500
A tracki device.

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,470
I'm not one of your Flying monkeys,lhelmina.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,250
Don't cross Me,sweetheart,
'cause you'll lose.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,830
You're here because of Me,
because of what i did.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,510
I'm turning myself in.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,040
Listen to me,wilhelmina.

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,360
You are not getting your Hands on this company.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,230
The only person running this 
Magazine will be a meade.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,140
- Alex won.
 - I'm sorry.

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,510
If alex wants toake over,then let him.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,660
I got lots of partying to catch up on.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,340
Good morning,amanda.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,530
Oh,hey,betty. I was Just thinking about you.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,890
- Really?
 - Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,050
Hmm. That's nice.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,910
Wow. They're even Bigger than i remember.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,070
Daniel meade's office.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,070
Oh,no,i'm sorry.
 He's Not here right now.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,010
He's,um,in a breakfast meeting.

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,320
Daniel meade's office.

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,940
Oh,no,um,i'm sorry.
He's all tied up.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,630
Daniel,it's me.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,760
You've got to get over here.
 Alexis is totally taking over.

29
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,940
Um,hi. Can i help you?

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,250
Just admiring the inner Sanctum of 
the feckless prince.

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,060
As the empire dissolves,
even the cushion on the bone-white chaise

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,140
Sags with defeat.

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,860
Wait a minute. I know that hat.

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,300
You're quincy combs.

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,370
You're writing that Sleazy bk about the meades.

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,310
Oh,it's a critic,too.

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Tell me,would this blind item about
 a certain magazine editor

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,880
Seen humping under The peter pan statue-

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,310
It wasn't him! Time for you to go.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,680
- Oh,my,you are feisty.
- And i bite,too.

41
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,410
Do not underestimate me.

42
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,360
You may be the beast that guards the gates

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,800
But i've taken down kings,presidents,
the electric car.

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,600
Daniel meade does not stand a chance against me.

45
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,720
Go.

46
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,050
Higher.
I said higher.

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,420
Any higher,and i'll be giving you a pelvic exam.

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,840
Just pin it.

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,590
Well,fill my bucket with nothing but thighs.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,010
Relax,colonel. We all Know you prefer nuggets.

51
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,100
Ew. That'll be chicken ruined for me.

52
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,950
I'll get you some shoes.

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,950
Bradford meade won't be able 
To keep his hands off you.

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,970
That's the idea.

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,870
In six months,you'll be 
Running meade publications.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,040
In a year,a small latin american country.

57
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,100
Here. These should work.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,650
You got invited to prague?

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Ugh. I would kill to go to this club.

60
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,240
How did "c" get on the a-list?

61
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,070
Well,i guess when you're one of
 The top ten designers to watch,

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,460
People in the city want to get to know you.

63
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,550
You have a hard time saying "thank you," don't you

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,270
- Not when i mean it,no.
- Listen,mcmartyr

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,640
You knew exactly what
 you Were getting yourself into

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,970
So spare me the conscience
 And enjoy the spotlight,

67
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,480
'Cause it can all go away...

68
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,520
Just like that.

69
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,170
Hold still,nacho.

70
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,680
Ooh,looks like somebody's 
Got a little boo-boo there.

71
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,700
I tried wearing it under my socks.

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,790
My idea. It was ruining his pant line.

73
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,810
Good news is i'm free.

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,880
Bad news is now i gotta take out the garbage.

75
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm sorry,nacho. 
I Was just doing my job.

76
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,750
I didn't realize your job included torturing me.

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,350
I thought you were a flight risk.

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,450
I was doing it for your own good.

79
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,390
Now i will always go the extra
 Mile to make sure my clients

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,630
Become citizens of the u.s. of a.

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,100
Is she gonna give us another flag?

82
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,340
When do i get to meet my lawyer? 
My court date's a month away.

83
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,800
- You haven't heard from him yet?
- No.

84
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,350
I'll call jerry to see if he could swing 
By my place tonight so you can meet him.

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Your place?

86
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,560
Um,look,um,constance,i - i'd just...

87
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,690
- Feel better if-
- If what?You don't trust me?

88
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,460
Of course i trust you.

89
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,440
Listen,ignacio,
I admit i had a thing for you.

90
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,980
I don't go blonde for just anyone,
but that's over.

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,190
Here's my address.

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,300
Make sure you bring some flowers.
It's a joke.

93
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,460
Honey,you must think you're 
The only chip in the bag.

94
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,950
- Bye,hilda.
- Bye,constance.

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,620
I love her.

96
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,820
Okay,there is no way you're going to her house.

97
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,960
Hilda,i need to meet the lawyer.

98
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,920
Yeah,in an office with 
Fluorescent lights and witnesses

99
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,320
Look,i'm not making any waves.
I'm too close to getting my green card.

100
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,620
- Papi!
- Hilda! I can handle my own affairs.

101
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,360
Daniel,where have you Been?
 It's almost 2:00.

102
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,470
Already? Whoo! Got any messages for me?

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,110
Yes. Becks called to say,

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,670
"congratulations on getting
 Into tabitha's gift bag."

105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,300
Ew. I just got that.

106
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,800
Have you,by any chance,
taken A look at page six today?

107
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,170
That's the peter pan statue.

108
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,490
I just thought it was some creepy kid watching us.

109
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,870
Daniel,there are people following you.

110
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Just earlier today,

111
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,050
I caught quincy combs snooping in your office.

112
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,850
Quincy combs? Rapper?

113
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,030
No. Celebrity trasher.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,510
He's the guy who wrote those books 
on kathie lee,kobe,whoopi.

115
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,720
Whoopi? What did she do?

116
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,940
It's not out yet,but apparently,it's shocking.

117
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,330
The meades are next.
 He Wants to destroy your family.

118
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,650
A little late for that,huh?

119
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,010
Not for you. Open up.

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,230
Daniel,if he finds out

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,510
Just how out of control you've gotten,

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,990
You're gonna be the first five chapters 
of that book.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Won't be my first time in print.

124
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,720
Things are different now.

125
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,410
You've actually earned some Respect
 in this business.

126
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,090
Betty,you worry too much.

127
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,130
Well,somebody has to Worry! 
You are never here.

128
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,420
Look,i'm sure alexis is Handling 
everything just fine.

129
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,830
Oh,okay,so that's it?
You're just gonna hand everything over to her?

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,170
You've worked so hard for the last six months.

131
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah,and it was taken away from me in a minute.

132
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,700
Don't you get it?

133
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,490
I'm being exactly the way my family 
expects me to be.

134
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,070
You know what?
I'm having a blast.

135
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm actually good at this.

136
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,760
Those aren't my shoes.

137
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,670
- You have models coming in at 4:00.
- Nice.

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Girl models,though,right?

139
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,080
I'll be there.

140
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,250
- Is that a problem,dick?
 - It's nick.

141
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,700
When i give a message to alexis,
the Person needs a last name. Get it?

142
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,740
Mm-hmm,and what if madonna calls?

143
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,920
Ciccone,penn,ritchie
 - Pick one.

144
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,420
Snap! She read you.

145
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,430
Why didn't anyone tell me Alexis 
needed an assistant?

146
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I left daniel's desk because i thought
 I had a shot at moving up.

147
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,480
You got a new headset.

148
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,110
I'm talking. I want a career i can be proud of

149
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,710
And a door i can close when want to take a nap.

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,070
It's not too late.

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
He hasn't even been here long enough for us 
to figure out why we hate him.

152
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,000
I know why.

153
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,530
Because he's a suck-up... 
And he won't sleep with me.

154
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,500
Me neither.

155
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,520
Mandy,if you want alexis 
To see you as a contender,

156
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,140
You need to be here 24/7 and be willing 
To do ridiculous and demoralizing things

157
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,340
For somebody who's Too freakin' lazy to-

158
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,990
Hello,willie. Lick that for you?

159
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,570
Quincy combs?

160
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,660
How did that inky snake get in the building?

161
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,610
I thought there was a gag order against him.

162
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,830
There should be. A red hat With his skin tone?
 I'm gagging.

163
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,460
Alexis is meeting with him.

164
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,920
Let's put it this way - 
if my father were drowning,

165
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,790
I would pull up a lawn chair and watch.

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,370
- My,such candor.
- Why not?

167
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,500
You're writing a trashy book,
and i'm dying to trash him.

168
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,800
My father told me i was dead to him.

169
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,650
He tormented my mother by 
Flaunting his affair with fey.

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,560
Flaunted? Fey's diaries made 
it sound so discreet.

171
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,100
Diaries? Who gave you her diaries?

172
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,470
Fey's maid and i go back a long way.

173
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,200
Is there anything about my mother in them?

174
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,260
Oh,yes. When fey writes about your mother,

175
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,430
Her pen drips with more venom than 
A cobra squaring off with a mongoose.

176
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,750
- Just get to the point. - 
She thought she was a bitch.

177
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,450
Mr. Combs,i have been meeting 
With my mother's lawyers,

178
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,180
Trying to build a defense.

179
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,980
If there's anything in those diaries that could-

180
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,240
Nothing i've read could spring 
Your mama from the big house.

181
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,450
However,the diaries for the last
 six months of her life

182
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,280
Are unaccounted for. 
Might Be something in there.

183
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,350
Then i need them.

184
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,130
Unfortunately nobody knows where they are.

185
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,420
I suspect they may be locked up
 in fey's secret room.

186
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,650
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,000
Apparently,your father and Ms.Sommers...

188
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,100
Had daily trysts...

189
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,170
Right here in the "mode" office.

190
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,860
Fey refers to it as their..."love dungeon."

191
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,050
Can i get you girls some coffee?

192
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,180
Ahem. I'm sorry for the interruption,

193
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,260
But you have a 5:00 P.m. circulation meeting.

194
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,670
Is there something wrong with your circulation?

195
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,510
Mm,do you need me to rub something?

196
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,450
My sister can cover for me.

197
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,760
My sister covers for me all the time.

198
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,110
So you two do everything together?

199
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,110
We have to. This is our first trip to new york,

200
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,450
And i promised our mama i would
 keep an eye on this one.

201
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,660
Like i'm going to rip off my clothes 
and jump into a fountain.

202
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,690
Oh,so you do have plans for tonight.

203
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,040
That depends on yo

204
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,080
You can't follow him around with a stun gun,love.

205
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,820
So i'm supposed to sit around and-and 
watch a friend fall apart?

206
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,830
He's not a friend. 
He's your boss.

207
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,810
He's both. I mean -

208
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,320
Uh,,hey,don't cross that line.

209
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,750
This building is not the place to 
look for friends.

210
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
You don't want to get in too deep
 with these people.

211
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,090
Trust me. Everyone around here 
has got a hidden agenda.

212
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,530
Well,not daniel,and He needs me right now.

213
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,460
He's only acting out to punish his family.

214
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,880
You know,he hasn't changed
 his socks since tuesday?

215
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,320
His socks? Next you'll be packing 
his lunch for him.

216
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,390
Oh,betty,you didn't.

217
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,540
Well,he can't drink like that on an empty stomach.

218
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,940
Ever since henry got back with his girlfriend,

219
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,500
You have bome obsessed with taking care of daniel.

220
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,520
That's crazy.

221
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,400
When was the last time you had a meade-free night?

222
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,840
Well,i just went on that date 
with my orthodontist,

223
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,950
And we spent the entire night 
with daniel's mother.

224
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
And last friday?

225
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,500
I had marc over for dinner. 
I left...

226
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,400
And ran off to the printer...
With daniel.

227
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,040
Oh,my god.You're right.

228
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,620
My whole life is daniel.
 What do i do?

229
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,420
You can start by leaving this building 
at a decent hour.

230
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,850
You up for a little bit of fun in the city?

231
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,690
Yes. Yes! Right now.

Now you promise me

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,730
That you won't even think about this 
place for the whole night.

234
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,020
I promise. No daniel.

235
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,590

You would understand if you had something to do
 besides putting on lipstick.

270
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,250
Oh,and some of us should look into
 powdering our brown nose.

I don't keep menus here.

Oh,did you see christina's designs?
 They were grea weren't they?

338
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,350
"New york" magazine says that
 Hers were the st impressive.

339
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,740
Oh,they don't wanna hear about that.

340
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,560
Oh,i love this song. Oh,let's dance.

341
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,730
Yeah.

342
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,640
- Oh,come on.

343
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,510

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,430

345
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,150
Oh,you know what? Actually,
daniel Went to tennis camp there.

346
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,910
He still gets the newsletter.

347
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,750
- Who's daniel? 
- Oh,he's my-

348
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,920

 We're Not talking about him.

349
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,270
- Do you wanna dance?
- I can't dance.

350
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,780
We could both try. It might be fun.

351
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,830
Okay.

352
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,180
Oh. Hey!

353
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,880
- Sorry. 
- Hold on there,turbo.

354
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,340
My bad.

355
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,800
Gosh! Hey,come on,man!

356
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,090
Maybe we should find a corner with 
a little bit more space.

357
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,400
Yeah,me,too.

358
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,950
Yeah! Let's g find ourselves a table.

359
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,380
Something wrong?

360
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,860
Um,no. Uh,you know What?
 I'll be right back.

361
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,730
Uh,don't move.
Or move,but maybe not your arms.

362
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,450
Does this meeting include dinner?

363
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,340
Well,honey,i gotta eat.
 This Tank doesn't run on empty.

364
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,560
Sit down. I'll bring out the dip.

365
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,660
Does jerry live around here?

366
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,820
- Who? 
- Jerry,my lawyer.

367
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,920
Oh,uh... He lives in sheepshead bay,

368
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,250
But he's always running late,
so come on,dig in.

369
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,290
We don't need him to start our party-meeting.

370
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,440
He patted my hand.

371
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,870
Hmm,maybe that's foreplay.

372
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,240
In a nursing home!

373
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,320
Oh,my god. Have i still got it?

374
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,360
You're totally hot,especially for a woman of your-

375
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,840
Height.

376
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,460
How'd she do it?

377
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,940
How did fey get that old sack in the sack?

378
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,260
Maybe something in one of Fey's 
diaries can help you.

379
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,630
Diaries?
What diaries?

380
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,270
I heard from amanda,
who Ovheard nick talking to alexis,

381
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,390
About a meeting that She had with quincy.

382
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,030
Fey kept diaries.

383
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,110
Get that fruity pebble on the phone.

384
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,250
I need to know what's in those pages.

1
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,020
kevin's bought usanother round.

2
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,760
Where's ben?

3
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,410
oh,bloody hell.

4
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,570
Come on,let's go somewhere else.

5
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,620
No,no,no,no,no.

6
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,370
No,I wanna stay,christina,I do.

7
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,480
I just...

8
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,840
I-I needto tell him one thing.

9
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,100
Betty,he's a big boy.

10
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,000
-He can look after himself.
-I know.

11
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,400
I know that,but quincy combs is looking for him.

12
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,320
and look at that.

13
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,690
That could be the cover of his book.

14
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,040
Betty,you're addicted.

15
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,620
If he was crack,you would sellyour 
nephew for a bag of him.

16
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,630
-What exactlyare you looking for?
-Insight.

17
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,610
Fey keptthat romance alive for years.

18
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,140
She must have writtensomething in those diaries.

19
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,530
Interesting.

20
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,550
You don'treturn my calls,and now-- 

21
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,260
I didn't come empty-handed.

22
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,510
Oh,wilhelmina,cash is so crude.

23
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,520
It's not money.
It's photographs.

24
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,340
Unless you'renot interested in seeing 

25
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,240
the gradual transformationof alex 
meade into alexis meade.

26
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,600
Where on earthdid you get these?

27
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,190
Oh,now,before I lose youcompletely
tell me

28
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,160
what did fey dothat turned him on?

29
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,400
From what I can gather,fey kept her 
feetas soft as a baby's bottom.

30
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,900
Daily pedicures,dead sea salts,
paraffin treatments.

31
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,250
Apparently,her velvety insteprattled his cage.

32
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,220
bradford is into feet?

33
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,720
She must have beenquite facile.

34
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,580
She describesfeeding him cherries that 

35
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,430
she could pick upwith her toes.

36
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh,my.

37
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,050
Now you see it,
and now you don'T.

38
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,980
All these peoplewere 
assigned to you?

39
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,670
I've helped a whole 
lotof folks become citizens.

40
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,560
How come you're notin 
any of the pictures?

41
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,990
I'm always the oneholding the camera.

42
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Hungry?Time for pork roast.

43
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,400
Wait,what about jerry?

44
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,400
Ignacio,jerry isn't coming.

45
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,870
He calledright before you got here.

46
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,460
He's not taking your case.

47
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,260
What?

48
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,490
Look,we knewit wasn't a slam-dunk.

49
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,060
You worked illegally,used a false 
social security number.

50
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,040
But you told me that--

51
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,730
I would help you,
and I planon keeping my word.

52
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,360
You deserveto be a citizen,ignacio.

53
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,560
And as soonas we finish eating
we'll get in the car

54
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,670
drive to atlantic city,
have dessert and get married.

55
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,660
What?

56
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,940
I booked usthe bridal suite at bally'S.

57
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,990
Tomorrow morning,
you're gonna wake up 


58
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,390
and strut down that 
boardwalka legal man.

59
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,920
Want some wine to celebrate?

60
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,140
Constance,you can't be serious.

61
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,040
Oh,that's right.

62
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,440
You got that funky heart.

63
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,930
I'll pour yousome grape juice.

64
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,630
you're not toointo this place,are you?

65
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,870
No,it's great.

66
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,400
I saw that on dancing with the stars.

67
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,290
I always wanted to do that.

68
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,620
You can dip melike leeza gibbons.

69
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,550
I'm gonna spin you now.

70
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,750
-Can you handle it?
-Can you?

71
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,460
oh,no.It's quincy!

72
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,600
What?What's wrong?

73
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,120
-Did I break something?
-No,no.

74
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,510
Um,lift me again.

75
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,730
Like wow a little to the left.
Your left.

76
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,530
No,back a little bit more.

77
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,800
Back,back,back,back.

78
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,870
Go to the right.

79
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,470
-Betty,what's going on?
-Nothing.

80
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,770
We're having fun.
Aren't you having fun?

81
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,300
-Lift me again.
-No.

82
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,920
I can't believethis is happening.

83
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,750
I thought maybeyou were different,

84
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,930
but you're just likeevery 
other girl in this city,

85
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,640
always scanning the room 
and lookingfor something better.

86
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,750
No,no!

87
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,200
Yeah,though you'rethe first one 
that's ever made mehelp her look.

88
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,520
What--no.Wait,ben...

89
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,140
my father's not here right now.

90
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,130
What's this all about?

91
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,090
The message you leftwas passed on to me.

92
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,160
I searched my files,and Mr.Suarez 
is not in the system.

93
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,050
He has to be.
His court date is in a month.

94
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,130
I bought him a tie.

95
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,790
Prussian blue,very neutral.

96
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,410
Who scheduledthe date again?

97
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,360
His caseworker--constance grady.

98
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,420
I took overall of miss grady's cases.

99
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,480
Your father was noton her list.

100
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,870
Why did youtake over her cases?

101
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,210
Well,somebody had to.

102
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,230
She was fired two months ago.

103
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,990
Ci sit your rump down,
cause this rump is ready,baby.

104
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,010
constance,please.

105
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,370
Just give me the numberand 
I'll call the lawyer myself.

106
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,150
You wanna ruin your appetiteafter 
I been cooking all day?

107
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,060
hello?

108
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,200
Papi,you need to get out of there.

109
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,700
Hilda?My daughter--
some problem at home.

110
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,170
No,no,no,the problem is over there.

111
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,980
Your caseworkerwas fired two months ago.

112
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,830
-What?
-Yeah,you heard me.

113
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,900
She lied.Bitch crazy!

114
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,430
Now,listen.
The womanhad a breakdown.

115
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,630
She's unstable,
so don't makeany quick moves.

116
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,760
Just--just politelyexcuse 
yourself and get out!

117
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,750
Okay,turn off the main waterpipe.

118
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,030
I'll call you right back.

119
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,910
Dinner's ready.

120
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,510
What took you so long?

121
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,190
Believe it or not,they only sell these 
crittersin one pet shop in jersey city.

122
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,040
Well,hurry up.
I don't have all night.

123
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,100
Willie,you know that I believein 
suffering for our beauty,

124
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,340
but I don't thinkI can watch this.

125
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,250
Get a grip,mary.

126
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,480
We did anarticle on this two months ago.

127
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,640
If housewives in singaporecan 
handle it,so can I.

128
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,160
They're just little 
fishnibbling off dead skin.

129
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,320
Couldn't we just usea really strong loofah?

130
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,260
Dump 'em!

131
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,330
oh,my,they're hungry.

132
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,280
I'm just,uh...feeling the walls.

133
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,590
Well,I just wantedto let 
you know that nick left.

134
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,880
Something about cheerleadingfinals
 on cable and cocaine.

135
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,880
Anyway,I am hereas long as you need me.

136
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,900
I don'T.Thanks.Good night.

137
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,500
Can I ask you a question?

138
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,870
Did you even think of hiring 
meto be your assistant?

139
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,530
Everyone knowsI wouldn't mind 
getting a leg upin this company.

140
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,660
Yes,but apparently you've 
hadboth legs up with my brother.

141
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,900
That's ancient history.

142
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,460
Amanda,I just don't see usas a good fit.

143
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,040
Well,I'm sorryyou feel that way

144
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,850
but I could've beena real asset to you.

145
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,940
I know this placeinside and out.

146
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,900
I know who stole what.
I know who slept with who.

147
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,510
I knew janie in styleswas 
pregnant before she did.

148
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,590
And F.Y.I.

149
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,420
It's not herhusband's 
or her boyfriend'S.

150
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,300
You do know a lot.

151
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,090
Look,I'm tryingto find something 
that might helpwith my mother's defense.

152
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,850
Have you ever heard anythingabout 
a secret room?

153
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,760
You mean the love dungeon?

154
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,950
do you knowwhere it is?

155
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,250
Sure,in never-never-land.

156
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,620
It doesn't exist.

157
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,310
It was fey's way of saying
I'm hung overand I wanna go home.

158
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,980
If you'd hired me,
you'd already know that.

159
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,980
Maybe I made a mistake.

160
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,340
If anything should ever happento nick
you're next in line.

161
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,510
You mean,like,if he falls down the stairs?

162
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,810
Actually,I was thinkingmore like 
if he got married 

163
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,740
and moved away,
but I like your ambition.

164
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,000
For now,let's forget you eversaw me 
in daniel's office.

165
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,860
Why don't you go pick outsomething nice 
for yourself in the closet?

166
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:18,050
daniel!Daniel!

167
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,160
daniel!

168
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,260
daniel!

169
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,340
Back away.

170
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,690
daniel,this is betty.

171
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,410
If you hear me,quincy combs 
is in the house!

172
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,920
save yourself!
Go out the back door!

173
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,940
-Quincy combs..
-betty?

174
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,630
Is looking...

175
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,000
For you.

176
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,070
Is that girlstalking you?

177
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Sorry,but,uh,my daughter saysthe 
whole basement is flooded.

178
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,690
Must be a broken pipe.

179
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,510
-But I made dinner.
-It looks great.

180
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,170
Maybe you could wrap it up,
and we could do thislater in the week.

181
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,050
Pork lasts forever.

182
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,080
Dios.

183
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,490
Could you open this,please?

184
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,110
I don't like leftovers.

185
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,750
and I don't like to beinterrupted 
on my wedding night.

186
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,890
Please,give me my phone
 backand let me go.

187
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,940
My family needs me.

188
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,390
So do I.

189
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,220
Now try this on.

190
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,700
-What,did you follow me here?
-No!

191
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,140
Daniel,I was here before you.

192
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,770
I was enjoyinga filthy cub scout.

193
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,230
Betty,what were you thinking?

194
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
I didn't know what else to do.

195
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,970
I saw you acting crazy,
and I saw quincy combs' hat!

196
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,620
-I was just trying to-- 
-no!

197
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,230
No,we arenot doing this here.

198
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,800
I--no.

199
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,500
-But,daniel,I was just trying to--
-betty,stop!

200
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,980
We're not at the office.

201
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,640
I don't need a chaperoneor 
a bodyguard or a babysitter.

202
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,990
When we leave that building,
your day is over.

203
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,090
Do you understand?
just let me live my life!

204
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,400
Punch out!

205
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,950
Daniel,you promised meand 
my sister you'd come dance.

206
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,940
Come on.

207
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,740
Oh,you're still here?

208
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,440
And I thought I was 
burningthe midnight oil.

209
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,350
What's that?

210
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,370
I forgot to include itwith 
the earlier package.

211
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,540
Mind if I..
.sit for a moment?

212
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,930
It's been a crazy day,and...

213
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,170
my shoesare killing me.

214
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,660
I know you never expectto 
hear this from me,but...

215
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,650
sometimes it's criminalwhat 
we do for fashion.

216
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,840
Any chance we canhave a drink,bradford?

217
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,520
-What?
-Drink?

218
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,850
Oh,yeah.

219
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,720
what would you like?

220
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,510
Uh,I'll havewhatever you're having.

221
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,950
I don't like being played.

222
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,060
You gave me hope that I could 
find some evidenceto help my mother.

223
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,470
There is no "love dungeon,"quincy
,and no diaries either,I'm guessing.

224
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,160
Go find some other chump,
because you just lostyour best source.

225
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,200
So the besieged queen needsto 
see a little evidence?

226
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,290
Well,I have it right here.

227
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,810
"September 9,2005--don't knowwhat 
I can say to comfort B.

228
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,190
We met in the love dungeon.

229
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,220
See?Right here--
fey's handwriting.

230
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,140
It goes on.

231
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,820
Our afternoon delighthas been replaced 
by talk,talk,talk of alex,

232
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,670
and how badly BE Feels for the way 
he treated his son.

233
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,130
-This part is not important.
-Give me that.

234
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,610
Alex took off for europe,and now BE 
Wants to followand beg him to come home.

235
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,110
Try the pants on,too.
I want to take a picture.

236
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
Constance,don'T.

237
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,620
You mind wearinga little heel?

238
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,480
I don't want to tower over yousince 
I'm wearing my hair up.

239
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,900
We are not getting married!

240
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,770
I am trying to help you,nacho!

241
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,340
You can't help me.

242
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,410
You don't evenwork there anymore!

243
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,580
The game is over,constance.
Now please,let me go.

244
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,180
So you're gonna be likeall 
the rest of 'em,huh?

245
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,670
I help youput your life together.

246
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,870
I hold your hand when you walkinto 
that big,scary courthouse.

247
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,440
I get you to the finish line,
and then I neverhear from you again.

248
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,460
-That is not true.
-Yes,it is.

249
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,590
There are over 200 peoplein that book alone.

250
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,490
Where are they now?

251
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,320
Constance,every one of those people 
remembers you and are grateful,believe me,

252
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,900
but you can't expect themto come back
 Bcause they still need youto hold their hands.

253
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,210
They have to go forward,
and so do you.

254
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,950
constance,open up!

255
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,730
Papi,are you in there?

256
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,080
Papi!

257
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,050
constance,I couldstand out here all night!

258
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,750
what the hell is going on?

259
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,490
-We were just talking.
-In costume?

260
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,820
You are in a lot of trouble,lady!

261
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,540
No,she's not.

262
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,910
Can I have my phone,please?

263
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,480
Here.

264
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,370
What is this for?

265
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,990
I'd like you to take a picture
before we leave.

266
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,200
Take...

267
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,120
I'm sorry.
I shouldn'thave made you come here.

268
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,620
No,you were right.

269
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,100
I get too involved.
What's wrong with me?

270
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,720
Why can't ijust be more like you 
and stay out of the drama?

271
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,850
-Betty!
-I mean,look what it's done for you.-

272
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,200
You should totally go backin there.

273
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,690
People know your name.
You're gonna be huge.

274
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,530
Yeah,well,everything comes at a price.

275
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,700
What is going on with you?

276
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,730
Because I don't deserveany of it.

277
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,970
I didn't get into fashion weekbecause of my talent.

278
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,510
I made a deal with wilhelmina.

279
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,290
A deal?

280
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,520
I agreed to do things for her-- 

281
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,600
certain favors,supplying information.

282
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,270
What kind of information?

283
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,350
Oh,everything--gossip,
who's loyal,who's not.

284
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,630
I think I evenhad something to do 
with putting daniel's father 

285
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,490
and mother behind bars.

286
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,010
Wait.

287
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,470
Why would you ever agreeto help wilhelmina?

288
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,440
Because...

289
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,880
I just wanted someone to see my designs that 
wasn't just my motheror my bloody cat.

290
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,270
So every conversation we've had
everything I've told you

291
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,990
you've taken backand you've reported?

292
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,580
Betty,if someone came to you and offered you help 
just to getcloser to your dream,you-- 

293
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,750
no,I wouldn'T.

294
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,850
I have dreams,too,but I would never 
do something to hurt you like this.

295
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,320
I didn't do this to hurt you.

296
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,000
Can we just--please,
can we talk about it?

297
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,020
No,I don't think that we can.

298
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,490
Christina,you're right.

299
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,000
That building is the wrong place 
to look for friends.

300
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,070
so you plan on workinglate 
again this week?

301
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,190
My schedule is wide open.

302
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,190
it's alexis.

303
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,630
Could you pleasegive me 
a call when you can?

304
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,910

305
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,830

306
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,250
Might be my sister.

307
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,200
Answer,will you?
I need to goto the bathroom.

308
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,510
You weren't sleeping,were you?

309
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,610
I didn't think so.

310
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,080
where is,um,where's becks?

311
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,360
I thought it would be more 
funto end the night here.

312
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,220
Okay.

313
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,470
There's,um,still some more champagne.

314
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,450
I've had plenty.

315
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,770
So are you giving petrathe
 may cover or the june?

316
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,820
We didn't talk about any covers.

317
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,320
I would prefer may.

318
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,420
It'll give us a better shot at 
doing "harper's bazaar" in july.

319
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,850
What,are youalso her manager?

320
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,310
No.

321
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm her mother,and my daughteris
 a month shy of 17

322
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,280
so either you give her this cover 

323
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,720
or you might find yourself in 
a bit of trouble,Mr.Meade.

324
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,200
Petra is 16?

325
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,240
You didn't ask to see I.D.,Did you?

326
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,490
You naughty,naughty boy.

327
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,380
so what does this mean?
You have to start all over again?

328
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,790
The guy who's got my casesays
 he'll do what he can 

329
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,910
to get me the earliest possiblecourt date.

330
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,080
We'll see.

331
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,500
So she's just been lying 
to you this whole time?

332
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,500
Why didn't you let hildacall the police?

333
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,320
I think she's been punished enough.

334
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,240
So how was your night?

335
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,250
Did you go to thatbig,fancy club?

336
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,150
Was it fun?

337
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,880
That much,huh?

338
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,210
It's just been a very long day.

339
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,690
Yeah,tell me about it.

340
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,020
You know,dad,people can 
really surprise you.

341
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,040
Yes,they can,but it's not always bad.

342
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,300
Like when you think you're going 
to yankee stadium

343
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,260
and you end upat a mets game.

344
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,540
They won their division.

345
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,250
Maybe we're just too trusting.

346
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,760
You know what,mija?

347
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,630
Maybe that's notsuch a bad thing.

348
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,540
-hello?
-Hi.

349
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,550
Uh,Mr.Suarez,it's daniel.

350
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,100
-Sorry to call so late.
-That's fine.

351
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,370
Is everything okay?

352
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,300
Uh,no,not really

353
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,700
I've been trying to 
reach betty on her cell

354
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,070
but it's gone straight to voice mail.

355
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,630
Is she there?

356
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,960
it's daniel.
He wants to speak to you.

357
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,080
It sounds like he might be in trouble.

358
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,430
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.

359
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,120
I've punched out.
