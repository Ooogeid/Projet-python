1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,017
Od times are finally back
at meade publishing.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,021
Cal hartley,
eccentric gazillionaire--

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,123
And my future sugar daddy--
mwah!--

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,124
Saved the company from famine

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,544
With a generous infusion
of cash.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,346
Yes, the seemingly preposterous
rumors are true--

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,116
People are actually eating
at "mode."

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,584
Yikes.

9
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,353
(mouth full)
what? i like doughnuts.

10
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,125
Mmm... chocolate.

11
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,277
(hilda) ugh. please don't
be one of those

12
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,796
"kiss with food in the mouth"
couples. that's just gross.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,582
It's such a relief that things
are finally better at meade.

14
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,934
(betty) also, today is
our annual performance review.

15
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,454
And i think i'm gonna ask
for a promotion...

16
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:40,938
To editor.

17
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:42,757
(gasps)
all right!

18
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,826
Bravo, mija. bravo!
plus, you still have
your y.e.t.i. final project,

19
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:48,146
So you'll get some
job interviews from that, too.
so will you.

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,532
I know, but we were
talking about you.
wait. you're not leaving
"mode," are you?

21
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,052
Because that's the only reason
why popular girls invite me

22
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:56,854
To get manicures with them.
i'm not leaving.

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,506
It's just good
to have options.

24
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,592
I mean, she's like
manny ramirez last winter.

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,278
Yeah, i don't know
what that means.

26
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,781
A free agent? you know,
she can leverage offers

27
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,966
Against each other,
try to get the best--

28
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,602
Yeah, i should really
know my audience.
welcome to my world.

29
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,654
Thanks, ignacio.
(chuckles)

30
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,446
Oops.

31
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,959
Good morning, boss.

32
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,278
I'm here
for my performance review.

33
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,763
Good morning.

34
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,248
Right on time, employee,

35
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,819
Which leads nicely into...
punctuality--excellent.

36
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:46,954
Attitude--excellent.

37
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:50,541
It kills me to say this,
but across the board,

38
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,994
You... are adequate.

39
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,780
(sighs) oh, willie!

40
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:58,132
You have never said that
to me before.

41
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,518
I want to hug you.
dial it back, sister,

42
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,121
Or i'll drop you
right back down to "subpar."
of course.

43
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:06,591
Excellent. initiative--
oh, speaking of,
i booked you ten tans

44
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:09,310
To get ready
for the summer.

45
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:11,979
We don't want the "post"
calling you pasty again.
oh. when did they
call me pasty?

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,464
Oh, last june.

47
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,067
But you didn't see it
because i threw it away.

48
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,119
Oh! another example
of initiative.

49
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:21,322
I was hoping, in light
of my recent adequacy,

50
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:24,809
That we might talk
about my... future here.

51
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,361
Well, uh, actually,

52
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:30,331
There is something
you need to know.

53
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,167
A hiring freeze?
what does that mean?

54
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,686
It was part of the deal
we made with hartley.

55
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,356
We got to hire back
everyone we let go,

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,241
But until someone leaves...

57
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:43,311
(clears throat)
there are no new positions.

58
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,264
And everyone
just got hired back,

59
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:48,299
So why would they want
to leave?

60
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,635
I'm so sorry, betty.

61
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,237
Look, the thought of losing you
absolutely kills me,

62
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,223
But i know you have
bigger aspirations than...

63
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,191
(scoffs) booking my tans.

64
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,077
But if an opportunity
arises at y.e.t.i.,

65
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:03,581
No one will sing your praises
louder than i will.

66
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,265
(sighs)

67
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:39,264
Thanks so much for helping me
with my hair.

68
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:42,518
I'm meeting your father later,
and i want to look good.

69
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:45,287
Why? so he can feel worse
when you break his heart?

70
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,556
I found this.

71
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:50,359
What are you doing
going through my mail?

72
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,345
What are you doing looking
for "nurse educator" positions

73
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,847
In chula vista--

74
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,815
A country
i've never even heard of?!

75
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,917
Chula vista's
in california.

76
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,203
And i wasn't looking
for anything.

77
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,288
I just took
an informational meeting

78
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,240
When i was visiting family.
(paper rustles)

79
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,493
I never thought anythi
would come of it.

80
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:11,280
So you're just gonna, what,
you're just gonna leave?
no.

81
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:14,366
Ay! come on, i don't know.

82
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,769
It's a really good job.

83
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:19,705
It'd be a new challenge,
a raise.

84
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:23,625
Ignacio's
a really great guy.

85
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,095
Well, you gotta tell him
what's going on.

86
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,963
He deserves to know.

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,915
You're right.

88
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:32,634
Plus, i have
a really big mouth.

89
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,620
So if you don't tell him,

90
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,389
He might
just find out, anyway.
(sighs)

91
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,858
(wilhelmina) okay, let's run
through the bridal issue

92
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,343
One last time.

93
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,762
If anyone has any notes,
i don't care.

94
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:46,098
Oh, cal,
what are you doing back?

95
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,667
I thought
you were in siberia.
oh, they had
a damn earthquake.

96
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,320
As soon as they clear
the bodies, i'll be back.

97
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,405
Well, if you need
any work space,

98
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:57,743
Marc will set you up.
actually, i'd rather see
what you're doing here.

99
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,561
No pressure.

100
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,648
Hmm.
just looking for something
to make me smile.

101
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,249
I'm not smiling.

102
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,718
Now i'm not saying

103
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,238
That you have to change
your whole concept,

104
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:13,242
But the wedding dresses
aren't popping.

105
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,494
Now what if we put...
(both mouth words)

106
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:18,714
The cherry 7up antioxidant ad...

107
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:22,584
Between these photos?

108
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,687
There. very nice.
breathe. i have pictures of
all of this. we will rebuild.

109
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,256
"cherry pick
your antioxidants."

110
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,541
See? now that's clever.
(chuckles)

111
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,994
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

112
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:35,247
(french accent) uh, i would
like a cherry 7up antioxidant.

113
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,750
Well, in america,
we just say "7up."

114
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:40,068
But it contains vitamin e,
a powerful antioxidant.

115
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:43,856
Oh, for god sake, will you talk
like a normal person? sit down.

116
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:47,309
Yeah, see, my eye still isn't
being drawn to the clothes.

117
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,112
I don't know.
maybe we have to reshoot.

118
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,064
(chuckles) if i may...
what?

119
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,365
Uh, marc?
yes.

120
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,317
It--it's not that simple.

121
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,786
We've been working
on this concept for months.

122
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:59,506
This is a little
black wedding dress.

123
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,392
My dear friend, reem acra,
designed some things personally,

124
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,927
As a huge favor.

125
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,763
I think it is our best
wedding issue as of yet.

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,300
All right, you don't have
to take my ideas.

127
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,820
Of course,
you did takey money.
(claire) are you going
to be much longer?

128
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:17,557
I booked this conference room
for a "hot flash" meeting.
yes, yes, yes,
your irritable bowel issue.

129
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah, claire, come here.
we need another opinion.

130
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:24,481
Now tell me, what do you
think of this concept?

131
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,750
I like the idea
of doing something

132
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:29,719
Other than a white wedding,

133
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:31,938
But black in fashion
is just as cliché.

134
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:35,024
In--in europe, they're showing
color in their bridal gowns.

135
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:38,044
Maybe we could try that.
see, that makes me smile.

136
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:41,381
You know, maybe you can help
wilhelmina work up some...

137
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,900
New version
of this spread, huh?
what?

138
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:46,052
I'll clear my calendar.

139
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,589
(gasps)

140
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:58,612
Oh, there's something i want
to show you on the light board.

141
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,031
I think you'll get
a kick out of it.
okay.

142
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,416
Daniel, hey, since i don't have
a direct supervisor,

143
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,452
I wrote
my own performance review.

144
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:08,538
I am "super excellent"
in every category.

145
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,223
Would you just sign here?
oh!

146
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,626
Oh, my god.
i can't believe this.

147
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,462
(romantic instrumental music
playing)
yes!

148
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,480
Oh, i love you.

149
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,499
(kisses)
i love you so much.

150
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,968
Wow... it's just paula abdul
yelling at a mailbox.

151
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:24,938
I was hoping for maybe
a little chuckle or something.

152
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:28,308
(music warbles and fades)

153
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:31,394
Oh, no, molly.
you thought i was...

154
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:33,830
(sighs)
i'm sor--i'm sorry.
no.

155
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,800
It's for
the wedding issue, obviously.

156
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:39,302
Oh, no. she definitely
thought you were proposing.

157
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:43,557
Yikes. that is
really embarrassing.

158
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:47,644
(jodie)
and tom, carson and rita

159
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,746
Are team three.
(laughs)

160
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:53,617
Three! also the number
of martinis i had last night

161
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:56,753
After my boyfriend dumped me,
but i digress.

162
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:01,557
And team four
is marc, betty...

163
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,760
And chair.

164
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,779
Oh. "chair" is matt.

165
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,264
He's not here.
he's coming.

166
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,449
But he's very invested
in all of this.

167
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,635
Uh-huh. they say
they're invested,

168
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:13,904
And then they go back
to their wife.

169
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,523
Ugh. can i get
a new team?

170
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:19,092
If you like,
i could be your partner.

171
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:22,195
Give you a taste of someone
with experience.

172
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,614
Uh, i'm good with betty
and "chair."

173
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:26,182
(chuckles)

174
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,068
(door opens and closes)

175
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,103
Hey, sorry.

176
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,772
She's assigning final projects.
where were you?

177
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,241
There was this amazing exhibit
at the whitney.

178
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,277
I just lost track of time.

179
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,362
In this bag is the key
to your future.

180
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,831
Your final assignment
is to do a photo shoot

181
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,316
And feature article

182
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,252
For whatever type of magazine
you draw.

183
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,641
"music."

184
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,828
Hey, you didn't
screw it up.
cool!

185
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,381
Draw again.

186
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,349
(paper rustles)

187
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,785
"physical sciences."
ugh.

188
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,487
Which one's our topic?

189
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,490
Both. you didn't think
i'd make this easy, did you?

190
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:11,642
I like to spice things up.

191
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:16,914
Now... i have some bad news.

192
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,518
Due to the number
of hiring freezes

193
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,904
In the industry this year,

194
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,790
Y.e.t.i. will only be able
to set up job interviews

195
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,275
For three people.

196
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,928
That means...
only the winning team

197
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,032
Will be getting interviews.
(people groan)

198
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,701
What?
that was our only chance
of moving up.

199
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,153
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,922
This is just the reality
you have to deal with.

201
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,941
And sometimes reality sucks.

202
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:46,111
Okay. .

203
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,913
All right, well, then we're
just gonna have to make

204
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:51,048
The best music/physical science
magazine ever.

205
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,851
Group hug?

206
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:55,386
Oh.
ooh! aah!

207
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:01,142
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com
Thx to YYeTs.net for the transcripts.

208
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:10,143
Alright, the physical science and music.
Piece of cake.

209
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,179
Easy-squeezy.
okay, but let's start
with the visuals.

210
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,647
Because words--
who cares?

211
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,666
Well, uh, hmm, astronomy
is a physical science.

212
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,185
And there's a jazz club
not too far from here.

213
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,621
We could shoot the musicians
playing, uh, telescopes

214
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,622
Instead of instruments.
okay, yeah,
that's something.

215
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,092
(snores) that's nothing.

216
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,195
We have to do something
amazing, like, eye-popping.

217
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,364
Oh! u2 on a space shuttle.
that definitely doesn't
sound easy-squeezy.

218
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,850
(gasps) oh, my god, you guys
have to come check out

219
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,752
This youtube video.
some lady called 9-1-1

220
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,006
Because they ran out
of chicken nuggets.
ooh, i heard
about that.

221
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,959
Oh, what if we did something
at the planetarium?

222
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,578
Ooh, and maybe use
their laser light show?

223
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,046
But how about,

224
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,348
Instead of pink floyd,
we use somebody current

225
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,335
And then we style them
'70s glam rock?
and--and the article
could be about

226
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,754
How we search to be connected
in this vast universe

227
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:59,341
And music unites us.
i have no idea what that
means, but it sounded great.

228
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,310
You write it.
great. and i'll also start
working on the logistics.

229
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,329
You know,
booking a photographer,

230
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,732
Getting a caterer,
that sort of stuff.
and i'll get the band.
it's only five degrees

231
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,935
Of gay separation
from anyone good.
(amanda and matt laughing)

232
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:12,770
I'm worried that
mr. "short attention span"

233
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,623
Over there
isn't focused.

234
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,775
Oh, don't worry.
he heard everything.

235
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,995
Is there something
you'd like to oversee?
sure, sure, i know somebody
at the planetarium.

236
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:24,015
I can give her a call.
see? all righty,
let's talk specifics.

237
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,084
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

238
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,253
We're about to watch a gopher
make a dramatic face.
(gasps)

239
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,940
(dramatic music plays)

240
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,842
Great. talk soon.

241
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,777
(telephone rings)

242
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,629
(betty) i got james boyd
to do our shoot.

243
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,964
And also, my dad's gonna
do our catering.
and i can get us

244
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:42,450
The new york hall of science,
but only if i act fast.

245
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,253
So i'm just gonna go aad
and book it, okay? bye.
no, wait, marc!

246
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,672
But matt has a contact
at the planetarium.
i know, but--

247
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,624
(telephone rings)
oh, hold on.
i have another call.

248
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,643
Hey.
uh, i'm on the phone
with betty.

249
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,412
Oh, good, so we can play that
game where we forget about her

250
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,381
And see how long
she stays on?
(click)

251
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,349
Okay, you may not be able
to see this

252
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,335
Because you've got
your love-blinders on,

253
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,553
But i don't think
we can count on matt.
what?

254
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,956
Well, one, he's been showing up
late to y.e.t.i., and two,

255
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,259
He spent last night watching
a man build a nest on youtube.

256
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,228
We only have four days
to put this together,

257
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,196
And we can't afford to have
anything bringing us down.

258
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,982
Marc, that's ridic--
(telephone rings)

259
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,985
Oh, hold on.
daniel meade's office.
hey.

260
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,004
(click)
look, i know
he was acting

261
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,940
A little weird last night,
but he is just as committed

262
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,243
To this as we are.
okay, but the "fine dining
and autos" group

263
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:30,382
Already had to kick out
one of their slackers.
what is that
supposed to mean?

264
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,684
I'm saying it's a dog eat dog world
and matt's looking a lot like lunch.

265
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,756
I don't know. i-i can't
decide on a ring.

266
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:42,259
Molly's not one
for something showy,

267
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,744
But i cat exactly get her
something cheap, right?

268
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:48,198
I don't know. am i crazy
for even talking about this?

269
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,500
As a mother,
i think so, yes.

270
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:53,136
Seeing a son getting ready
to marry a dying woman--

271
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:56,472
I just hate to see you
in that much pain.

272
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,709
Come on, it's gonna be painful
whether we get married or not.

273
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,245
If i can make one of molly's
biggest dreams come true,

274
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,881
I-i can't think of anything
better than that.

275
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,185
You're absolutely right.

276
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:14,407
Whatever ups and downs
your father and i had,

277
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:18,695
And we had
an awful lot of both...
(chuckles)

278
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:22,949
I always loved him.

279
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:34,778
When the time is right,
you give that to molly.

280
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,552
(speaking indistinctly)

281
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,537
I think
the time is right.

282
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,072
(betty) daniel...

283
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,058
What? why did he just
give me the--i hate the--

284
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,127
You, too?
(door opens)

285
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:55,131
(speaking indistinctly)

286
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,634
Oh, my god, is he...

287
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,725
(sighs)

288
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,327
Oh.

289
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,513
(laughs)

290
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:14,584
(people cheering
and applauding)

291
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:18,655
Oh, it's so romantic,
right?

292
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:21,457
Now when molly
is all losing her hair,

293
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:24,110
Daniel has no choice
but to stay by her side.

294
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:25,729
Hilda.

295
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:28,448
What? i wish i had somebody
who would love me

296
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,517
If i was all bald.
hmm.

297
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,670
Well, i need to do my e-mail
when you're done.
y.

298
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,455
Hi...
hi, papi.

299
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,190
Aw, the sympathy "hi."

300
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,943
I take it you all know
about elena.

301
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:42,412
Has she made up her mind
about the job yet?

302
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,881
No.

303
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:48,068
I really
don't want her to go.

304
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,520
Papi, you just have
to let her know

305
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,256
That she has something
worth staying for.
yeah.

306
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:55,325
What do you mean?

307
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:58,528
If you like it, then you
shoulda put a ring on it.

308
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,414
Beyoncé knows.
he is right. you have got
to step up your game.

309
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,400
(ignacio) i want
to step up my game.

310
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,986
I ju thought you guys wod
have a problem with that.

311
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:10,306
You ren't exactly on board
with her in the beginning.

312
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,225
Well, we are now.
yeah.

313
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,261
So... what are we saying?

314
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,381
That we want a future
with elena?

315
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,549
Uh... yeah.

316
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:21,735
Duh.
hello.

317
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:23,670
Gracias.

318
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:27,440
Oh, my god.
we're getting engaged!

319
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,026
(squeals) yay!
(ignacio) whoo!

320
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:31,894
(hilda laughs)

321
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:39,350
Oh, my god,
you're not gonna believe it!

322
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,419
2-time grammy-award-winning
english songbird adele

323
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:44,806
Agreed to do our shoot!
oh, my god!
that's amazing!

324
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,891
You got adele?
i love her!

325
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,694
I was able to secure it
in five degrees.

326
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,996
The cute guy
from my cardio strip class

327
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,981
Was a mall elf
with david sedaris,

328
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,951
Who lives in the same building
as kevin bacon--not gay,

329
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:59,337
But you always need him--
who was playing tennis

330
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,322
With rachel maddow--
i hate to admit it,

331
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,292
But the lesbians count--
la maddow is a huge adele fan.

332
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,995
Voilá, winning y.e.t.i. project!
doo doo doo doo doo!
yay!

333
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,014
Okay, i told adele's people
that we were shooting

334
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,984
At the planetarium,
so don't let me down.
actually, uh,
it--itell through.

335
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,469
What?
what?

336
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:16,237
When i called this afternoon,

337
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:18,539
They said they'd booked it
for something else.
you! (grunts)

338
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,608
Marc!
you waited
until this afternoon?

339
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:23,077
You should've left
a message last night,

340
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,463
Followed up this morning,
sent flowers and then waited

341
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,349
Outside their office until they
either gave you the planetarium

342
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,851
Or had you arrested
for stalking!
look, i'm--
i'm really sorry.

343
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:33,671
Sidebar!

344
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:40,661
Look, we'll figure
something out.
it is too late.
lives are at stake.

345
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:42,914
We are voting him
off the island.

346
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,882
He is the weakest link!
shh!

347
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,468
Auf wiedersehen! that's it!
good-bye! he's fired.

348
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:49,704
Um, i-i can hear you,
you know.
that was the point!

349
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,722
This was just
for dramatic effect.

350
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,976
Do, uh, do you want
to fire me, too?

351
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,961
No.

352
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,964
But, matt, this is
really important to us,

353
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,483
And i know how capable
you are.

354
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:04,452
But for whatever reason,

355
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,888
It just seems like
you don't care.

356
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:09,190
You're right.

357
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,375
You're, uh,
absolutely right.

358
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,145
I'm gonna, uh...
get out of your way.

359
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:16,731
Bye!
wait, no, matt!

360
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,949
No!

361
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,970
Matt, don't go!

362
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:24,306
What's going on?

363
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,392
(sighs) i didn't know
how to tell you.

364
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:29,445
I've been wanting to tell you
for a while now.

365
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:32,414
It's been killing me.
but i just feel like...

366
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:35,634
I'm losing my passion
for publishing.
what?

367
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,987
I think i should
leave y.e.t.i.

368
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,955
Wait,
hold on, what happened?

369
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,824
You're really good at this,
and i thout you loved it.

370
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,777
I did, i did.

371
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:48,297
I've just been feeling...
drawn to something else.

372
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:50,132
Oh.

373
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:51,951
Uh, well, like what?

374
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,870
Art.
art?

375
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:57,306
Specifically, i-i want
to paint. oil paint.

376
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:00,693
Oh, well, that's sort of
out of left field.

377
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,078
Actually, i've always been
terested in painting.

378
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,080
And i just
can't stop feeling

379
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,883
That maybe i got on
the wrong path.

380
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,286
There are some night classes
i want to take.

381
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,921
They start next week.
are you freaked out?

382
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,975
You seem freaked out.
no, no. no, i'm not.
i'm fine. it just--

383
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,527
It's just a lot to process,
but, you know,

384
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,996
If you're passionate
about art, then... great.

385
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,148
I support you 100%.

386
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,583
(chuckles softly)

387
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,435
Wow.

388
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,671
That is so nice to hear.

389
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:32,040
My family doesn't t-tend
to see things the same way.

390
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,393
So... we're okay?

391
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:38,063
Yes, of course we're okay.

392
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,866
(betty) it's just
a little bit confusing.

393
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,935
(daniel) publishing can't be
the only thing

394
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,388
You like about him.
no, of course not.
i mean, he's sweet and--

395
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,991
And goofy, and his bad jokes
make me laugh.

396
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,460
And things are just better
when he's there.

397
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,645
Yeah, well,
none of that's changed.

398
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,281
Even though he doesn't do
the same thing as you,

399
00:18:56,366 --> 00:19:00,252
He's still the guy you
fell in love with, right?
wow, you've gotten all wise
since you've been engaged.

400
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,721
(laughs) yeah.
kinda weird, right?

401
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:05,691
The new york hall of science
is now saying no,

402
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,710
And judging
by the restraining order

403
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:10,462
They sent me this morning,
they mean it.
well, what are we
gonna do?

404
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:13,465
(sighs)
we can't just paint stars
in your apartment

405
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,284
And call it the planetarium.

406
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,452
I mean, this is adele,
not amy winehouse.
(cell phone rings)

407
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:20,723
Wow, betty,
that was really funny.
thank you. betty suarez.

408
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:23,359
We're never
gonna be editors.
yeah, of course
i can be there today.

409
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,729
I'm gonna go
kill myself now.
thank you.
we got the planetaum!

410
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:29,498
Oh, my god,
that is great!
i just have to go down
and sign the contract.

411
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:33,034
Okayi'll--
i'll go with you
(wilhelmina)
are you out of your mind?!

412
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,187
Maybe not.
go. go, go.

413
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:37,823
(wilhelmina) oh, her bust
looks nonexistent.

414
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,375
For god sake, claire,

415
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:42,511
Put your bifocals on.
she looks hideous.
how insensitive of me.

416
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:44,746
The love of your life
stole all your money

417
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,083
And fled the continent
just to get away from you.

418
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:51,553
So no wonder you don't like
a happy wedding dress.
she looks like
a baboon's ass.

419
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,406
She didn't mean that.
oh, stop talking
to the props, amateur.

420
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:57,409
Would anyone like
a nice, warm scone?
you might not remember
your wedding

421
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:59,428
Because it was
5,000 years ago,

422
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:01,764
But when i married your husband,
it was all about class.

423
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:04,450
And this dress
has none of it.
well, no wonder

424
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,635
You prefer to put brides
in black dresses,

425
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,804
Since you killed your groom
at the altar.

426
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:10,722
(whispering) we're gonna
get you out of here.

427
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,708
Just wait for my cue.
(sighs) take off
the dress.

428
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,409
Don't touch that dress.

429
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,529
Don't touch my model.
you let go
of my model.

430
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:20,866
All right! all right! now!
move! move! move!

431
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,651
Serpentine, serpentine!
you let go!

432
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,137
Just get over here!
(grunts)

433
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:27,156
(whimpers)

434
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,191
Such a shame.

435
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,413
Yeah, my goal is to give you
the perfect wedding,

436
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,097
And, groom, little hint--

437
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,400
"perfect" means
whatever she wants. yeah.

438
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:43,920
Understood.
what kind of venue
did you have in mind?

439
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,723
Hotel bora bora, on the beach
under the stars.
"stars."

440
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,575
Outside?
what if it rains?
groom.

441
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,427
Ouide's perfect.

442
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,345
Right.
and i want it
to be like a party.

443
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,848
Tacos and margaritas instead
of lobster and champagne.

444
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,850
And a band
with everyone dancing.

445
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:00,403
Is this too much?
no. i want you to have
whatever you want.

446
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,789
Well, it all looks
very doable.

447
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,925
So what date
did you have in mind?

448
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,127
We were kind of thinking
as soon as possible.

449
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:09,079
Like--like the end
of the month.

450
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:10,747
This month?
mm-hmm.

451
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,732
Mr. meade,
a-a wedding like this

452
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,285
Would normally take at least
eight or nine months.

453
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,238
But it is what she wants.

454
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,557
Let's just make it happen.

455
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,843
Okay. a-absolutely.

456
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:38,058
Hello?

457
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:42,028
Hello?

458
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,130
Hello?

459
00:21:44,198 --> 00:21:47,717
(richard strauss' "also sprach
zarathustra" playing)

460
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:51,137
Hello, betty.

461
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,178
Mrs. hartley.

462
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,163
What are you doing here?

463
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:02,916
I'm here to see you.

464
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,272
So when i heard
you needed this space

465
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:11,742
For your y.e.t.i. project,
i called my friend bitsy,

466
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,560
Who's on the board
of the planetarium,

467
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,579
Reminded her
of a few things i saw

468
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:17,631
At last year's
christmas party...

469
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:19,899
(chuckles)
and it's yours.
wow, um...

470
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:22,368
Why are you doing this
for me?

471
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,672
I mean, we didn't exactly
get off to a great start.

472
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,140
Excellent observation.

473
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,393
Now don't choke
on your adult braces.

474
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:31,728
I'm dimming the lights.

475
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:34,247
We put this together
last year...

476
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:36,967
For an intervention
the family did for matt.

477
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,119
An intervention?
(projector clicks)

478
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:42,656
Here's matt at mile 25 of
the new york city marathon.

479
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,891
Wow. i didn't even know
he ran a marathon.

480
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:48,678
He didn't.
a marathon is 26.2 miles.

481
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:50,731
Mile 25 is when matt
developed a new passion...

482
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:52,282
(click)
for karate.

483
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,918
Here's matt getting
his brown belt.
(click)

484
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,921
And here he is on his way
to develop his new passion...

485
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,056
Pottery.

486
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,458
(click)
and here--

487
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,211
Oh, that's your mushroom cap
on my painting.

488
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:06,847
How did that get in there?
(click)

489
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:10,016
Ah. here is matt
with a cow.
i don't get it.

490
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,586
He was studying to be
a large-animal vet.

491
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:16,039
His dream was to heal
an elephant. his dream died.

492
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,024
So did tiny.
(click)

493
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,793
Why are you
showing me these?

494
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,145
Well, it does seem odd, given
th i don't care for you,

495
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,448
But in this case,
your plucky immigrant zeal

496
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,433
Could be a good thing.

497
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,301
I want matt back
in y.e.t.i.

498
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,621
Well, he's pretty passionate
about art now.

499
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:34,240
He always starts
that way.

500
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:37,511
I don't want matt to be one
of those incredibly rich men

501
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:40,213
Who never accomplish
anything.

502
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,832
I think if he finishes
this program,

503
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,850
He'll stick with publishing.

504
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:47,036
Of course,
i can't tell him that.

505
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:50,506
It has to come
from you.

506
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,108
Uh, mrs. hartley,

507
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,211
I-i really don't feel
comfortable doing that.

508
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,513
I understand.

509
00:23:57,581 --> 00:24:00,349
Well,
enjoy the planetarium.

510
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,985
I know how important
this project is for you

511
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:04,554
And your career.

512
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:09,974
It'd be such a shame
if anything went wrong.

513
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,095
(marc) wake up and smell
the quid pro quo.

514
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,047
Of course she's gonna
take it away

515
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,017
If we don't get matt
back in.
well, i don't know
what to do.

516
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,485
On one hand, it seems
like i'm using matt

517
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,471
To finish the project.
not seeing the problem.

518
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,473
And then on the other hand,

519
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,425
I really do want to
help matt finish something.

520
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,393
We all do. we want
to help him commit.

521
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:31,412
But then on the other hand,

522
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,881
I'm only hearing his
mother's side of the story.

523
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:37,184
Maybe matt has
a whole different story.
and now you got
three hands,

524
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,604
Which in a weird way,
balances out your two heads.
marc, help me.

525
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,158
Okay, look. i don't care
about your relationship.

526
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,127
What i care about
is my future,

527
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,112
And if we don't have matt
in the group,

528
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,531
Then we don't get
the planetarium,

529
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:52,633
And then our entire
final project is dead.

530
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,702
Look, we're out of options
at "mode."

531
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,838
Just make it work.

532
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,307
(elena) it's so nice of you
to make me lunch.

533
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,510
What's the occasion?
since when do i need an occasion
to make my girlfriend a meal?

534
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:06,280
Oh! oh, i'm so sorry.
it's okay.

535
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,382
Oh! smooth, 'nacio.

536
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,052
Let me get that.
no, it's o--
i'll get it.

537
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:13,587
Are you okay?

538
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:16,140
(sighs) no.

539
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,026
I know you're considering
that job, but...

540
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,494
I love you, elena.

541
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:22,796
And i think we have
a future together.

542
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:27,651
At least,
i hope we do.

543
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,187
(sighs)

544
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:32,323
Will you marry me?

545
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,613
Oh, my god.

546
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,266
You're leaving me
hanging here.

547
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,152
If--if it's about the ring,
i promise, it's coming.

548
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,939
Shut up and kiss me.

549
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:52,793
Is that a "yes"?

550
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,912
Yes.
(laughs)

551
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:56,997
Yes.

552
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:59,366
Yes, yes.

553
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,635
(both laugh)

554
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:05,055
Art books.

555
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,024
Wow.

556
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,059
Matt, i've been thinking--

557
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,061
And don't hate me
for saying this--

558
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:14,314
But do you think maybe it would
be worth it to finish y.e.t.i.

559
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,667
Before moving on
to the next thing?
oh, boy.

560
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,736
I mean, there's only
one week left,

561
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,704
And i really miss
having you there.

562
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,222
And besides, your art class

563
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,124
Doesn't even start
till next week,

564
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:26,944
So i just
don't see a downside.
wow, you sound
like my mother.

565
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,947
Oh, no, no,
i'm--i'm sorry.
no, it's okay, it's okay.
somehow, coming from you,

566
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,900
It doesn't make me
want to break things.

567
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,553
And maybe i was
a little... selfish,

568
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,738
Leaving you guys
in the lurch like that.

569
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,941
So... you'll come back?

570
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:44,528
Well, when you do that cute
squinty thing with your eyes,

571
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:47,665
How could i say no?
yay!

572
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:50,634
And don't worry.
you're nothing like my mother.

573
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:58,280
A little, uh,
a little less bouffant.

574
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,265
We're going more, um,
'70s and '60s,

575
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,251
And, you know, some of
the aliens are sweating.

576
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:04,553
Can you, uh, take a look
before we shoot?
uh-huh.

577
00:27:04,637 --> 00:27:07,022
Hi. you ready to go?
you're really good at this.
i'm glad you're back.

578
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,541
Me, too. oh, uh, you know,
we need to test those lights.

579
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,344
I don't want them to interfere.
i think they're strobing.

580
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:15,681
Betty, this is dave sheehan,
adele's manager.
(gasps)
oh, my god. hi.

581
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:17,766
I am such a huge fan
of adele.

582
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,018
We are so happy that
she's doing our shoot.

583
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,321
Yeah. no. me, too.
real happy. whoo.

584
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:25,190
So what is this--some kind
of, uh, school project?

585
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:28,159
It's y.e.t.i.,
the young editors--
whatever. you know, i could
kill her for doing this.

586
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,112
Okay.

587
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:32,080
Maybe you're getting
some lens glare.

588
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:34,232
We're gonna be taking shots
from this side of the--
hi.

589
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:36,335
Mom, um, what--
what are you doing here?

590
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,437
Well, i just had lunch
with bitsy.

591
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:40,822
As usual, hers was liquid.
(chuckles)

592
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:43,875
But she said you were here,
finishing your y.e.t.i. project.

593
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:46,962
I was sure it was
drunken ramblings, but...

594
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,897
Here you are.

595
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,333
I'm proud of you.

596
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,068
I'm just glad that you're--

597
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:55,821
That you're
seeing something through.

598
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:59,174
Now i'm gonna go before i ruin
our little mother-son moment.

599
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:03,495
(indistinct conversations)

600
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,430
(speaking inaudibly)

601
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,532
(whispers) thank you.

602
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,736
(indistinct conversations)

603
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,270
Betty...

604
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:14,623
Did my mother
put you up to this?

605
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:20,529
Wow.

606
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:22,531
(chuckles) hey,
you ready for lunch?

607
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,566
Hey, perfect timing.

608
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,803
Brent was just walking me
through the wedding gift guide.

609
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,489
Maybe he can give us
a few ideas.
you guys
are getting married?

610
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,458
Mm-hmm.
that is so great... that
you're allowed to do that.

611
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:37,279
You should totally register
for this copper-lined cookware.

612
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:42,150
You two will be cooking with
these for the next 50 years.

613
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:49,041
That's a long time.
oh, please. the first year
of marriage flies by...

614
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:50,909
Or so i hear.

615
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,994
Anyway, then you'll be
having babies.

616
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,980
So look at this.

617
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:59,785
Jeanette valois is
the "it" artist for nurseries.

618
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,220
If you're even thinking
about having kids,

619
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,906
You should book her
right now.

620
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:07,859
This is a mistake.
i can't get married.
molly.

621
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,095
I'm just gonna
go grab lunch.

622
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:12,898
Hey...
oh, my god. i can't
believe i let myself

623
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:16,268
Get caught up
in all this.
stop. hey.

624
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,053
We can do this.

625
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:21,189
Look...

626
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:25,043
You've been able to give me
a lot of things,

627
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:28,280
But you can't give me
more time.

628
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:35,968
(telephone rings)

629
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,236
(sighs)

630
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,604
(ring)

631
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,206
Hello.

632
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,341
No. elena doesn't
work here anymore.

633
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,877
But i can give her
a message.

634
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:46,245
Hang on.

635
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,831
(opens drawer
and pulls out objects)

636
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:50,383
Okay.

637
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:56,322
Well...

638
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:59,759
I'll be sure to ask her.

639
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:01,761
(hangs up receiver)

640
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:03,746
I can't work like this.

641
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:06,682
I run the top fashion magazine
in the world,

642
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,651
And claire meade
does a dinky insert

643
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,419
For menopausal old ladies.

644
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,855
My dinky little insert
improves "mode's" circulation

645
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:14,924
Every time it runs,
and--
shh!

646
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,476
Cal, you kept me
because i'm the best

647
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:19,462
In the business,
and as the best,

648
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:21,714
There are three c's
that i avoid...
(sighs)

649
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:24,183
Collaborion, compromise
and claire.

650
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:26,819
And trust me, i chose
the nice "c" there.

651
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:29,672
And what do you have
to say?

652
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,974
She's absolutely right.

653
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,876
And while i think
i actually did fix

654
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:36,212
Her bizarr little
black wedding dress concept,

655
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,197
The spread
is never going to get done

656
00:30:38,282 --> 00:30:41,167
With both of us working on it,
so for the sake of "mode,"

657
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:43,552
I'd like to take myself
off this project.

658
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,938
What game
are you playing?

659
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:47,406
No game.

660
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,992
Life's too short.

661
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:53,728
So i guess
you're offhe project.

662
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,131
Well, thank you.

663
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:59,334
Claire, i'd like to have
a word with you.

664
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:04,907
I just--i-i-i can't believe
that you went behind my back

665
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,309
And met with my mother.
matt, it wasn't
li that.

666
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,828
Because it seems to me like
you got me to rejoin y.e.t.i.

667
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:12,831
Just so you could have
this stupid planetarium.
no, matt, i thought that
i was helping you.

668
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh, wait, let me guess,
let me guess.

669
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:17,603
She show you
the slide show?
well, yes.

670
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,221
Look,
tiny didn't die, okay?

671
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:21,690
My mother was manipulating you.
that's what she does.

672
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,675
How could you
believe her?
matt, i'm sorry,

673
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,178
But some of what she said
actually made sense.

674
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:28,480
You are passionate about
a lot of different things.

675
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,450
Uh-huh, and maybe i'm that way
because i like a challenge.

676
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:34,035
Did that even occur to you?
look, i'm not just
gonna keep quiet

677
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:36,939
If i think you're making
a mistake.
god. betty, do you
even hear yourself?

678
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:39,374
Not everybody has
their life planned out

679
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,209
The way that you do.
that's not the point!

680
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:45,097
You start things
that you d't finish.
oh, what,
like a y.e.t.i. project?

681
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,699
Don't say it like that. you know
that this is important to me.

682
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:50,285
And it was important to you
until it wasn't.

683
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:53,088
Yeahwell, so i changed
my mind. so what?
so what?

684
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:55,557
So how's that supposed
to make me feel about us?

685
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:57,960
Are you just gonna
change your mind someday?

686
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:00,062
Hey! we lost adele.

687
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:02,364
What?
her manager heard you
two fighting

688
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:04,883
And called this amateur hour.
i agreed with him

689
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,502
And then offered to give adele
a foot massage,

690
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,439
Which didn't work, either,
so she's gone.
well, who are you calling?

691
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,374
Jodie.
she's my only hope.

692
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:13,625
Hey, jodie...

693
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,460
(deepens voice) this is,
uh, marc st. james.

694
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:17,579
I was wondering
if you wanted to grab a beer

695
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,264
And watch straight porn.

696
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,234
So you're just gonna leave?
yeah, well, i might as well

697
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:25,187
Live up to my reputation
for not finishing things.

698
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:27,172
(indistinct conversations)

699
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:28,991
(sighs)

700
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,808
Hey, i thought i'd come by
to support you, but...

701
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,661
It looks like i'm too late.
what happened?

702
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:43,746
We lost adele,
marc stormed off,

703
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,415
And i got into a fight
with matt,

704
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,901
So there goes
my y.e.i. project,

705
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:50,836
My professional future

706
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,055
And my rationship.

707
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:56,425
Wow. it actually sounds
like you might've had

708
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,561
A worse day than i did.

709
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,763
Molly canceled our wedding.

710
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,281
What?

711
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:06,385
It was too much to get done
and not enough time.

712
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,471
Oh, betty.

713
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:11,440
I mean,
the wedding planner quit.

714
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:13,642
The hotel was booked
until the winter.

715
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,579
I just--i wanted it to be
perfect for her, but...

716
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,581
God, if it was up to me,

717
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,716
I would just forget about
all this stuff

718
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,519
And marry her right now.
really?

719
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,405
Well, why don't you?
right here.
(laughs) yeah.

720
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,074
No, i'm serious.

721
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,359
Daniel, we have
this ven all night.

722
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,562
There's a photographer,
wedding gowns at "mode."

723
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,464
And tacos are coming.

724
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,017
You said molly wanted tacos...
and stars.

725
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,437
I mean, maybe it's not
perfect, but...

726
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:43,856
Maybe "perfect" just looks
a little different

727
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,659
Than you imagined.
what about your
y.e.t.i. project?

728
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:49,261
Uh, i don't have
a y.e.t.i. project.

729
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:51,514
And this is
way more important.

730
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:53,766
I don't know. really?

731
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,085
Yes. go. get molly.

732
00:33:56,136 --> 00:34:00,322
I can take care
of everything else.
okay, all right.

733
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:09,614
(woman) do you, molly,
take daniel

734
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:11,833
To be your
lawfully wedded husband,

735
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,119
For richer, for poorer,

736
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,204
In sickness
and in health,

737
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,973
For as long
as you both shall live?

738
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,475
I do.

739
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:22,877
And do you, daniel,
take molly...

740
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,346
I don't mean to cast doubt
on this lovely ceremony,

741
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:28,666
But is this
legally binding?
oh, yeah, she was
an ordained minister

742
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:31,302
Before she decided to become
an actress/model.

743
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:33,037
How perfect is that?

744
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,356
(woman) for richer,
for poorer...
a mother's dream.

745
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,308
In sickness
and in health,

746
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,461
For as long
as you both shall live?

747
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:42,630
I do.

748
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:47,135
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of new york

749
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,604
And the supreme ministry
of exlon-4...

750
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,272
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

751
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,709
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

752
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,095
(mendelshn's "wedding march

753
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,863
From "midsummer night's dream'"
playing)

754
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,166
(cheers and whistles)

755
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:04,919
(music continues)

756
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:11,776
(yeah yeah yeahs)
? shake it ?

757
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:14,612
? like a ladder
to the sun ?

758
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:16,564
(indistinct conversations)

759
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,016
Hello.

760
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,735
Mm.
isn't this
a wonderful night?

761
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:24,138
Yes, yes, yes, you're finally
marrying off your man-whore.

762
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:25,757
(chuckles)

763
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,459
Oh... you haven't heard.

764
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,428
Cal liked
my creative instincts.
(sighs)

765
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:33,164
He also liked
that i put the magazine

766
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:36,317
Ahead of my own ego.
isn't there
anmpty shot glass

767
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:40,238
You could be
blathering into?
so he made me senior
vice president of meade.

768
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,373
I report only to him.

769
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:45,960
I also have a say in all
of meade publications,

770
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,495
Including "mode."

771
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,998
So try and clear some time
on monday

772
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,800
To pitch me your ideas.

773
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:56,221
This really is
a wonderful night.

774
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:05,146
Out of my way, alien!

775
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,703
(screaming inaudibly)

776
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,505
(big band music playing)

777
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,441
(man) ? if it wasn't for you ?

778
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:20,077
? what can i say? ?

779
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:22,447
You really throw
one hell of a wedding.

780
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:26,150
Well, thank you. i'm just
glad it all worked out.

781
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,552
And you were right.

782
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,888
"perfect" doesn't always
look like you'd imagine.
hmm.

783
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:35,443
(clears throat)
um, may i, uh, cut in?

784
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,928
Mm-hmm.

785
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:39,097
? darling, i had no clue ?

786
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,749
Uh, look, if i step on your
toes, it's nothing personal.

787
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,719
Remember, i'm not
a very good dancer.
if i step on your toes,

788
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,272
It's probably because
i'm still mad at you.

789
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,142
Look, i know it must be hard
for someone like you

790
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:55,112
To date a guy like me,
but i want

791
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,531
Exactly the same thing
that you do--

792
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,384
To have something
that i'm passionate about.

793
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,338
And i don't know why
i haven't found my thing yet,

794
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,122
But i'll keep trying.

795
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:09,609
Just please
don't give up on me.

796
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,278
!

797
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,263
That was my toe.
ooh... i warned you.

798
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,066
Hey, matt, is this the girl
you were telling me about?

799
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,085
Aah! oh, my god.
that's adele.

800
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,504
What is she doing here?
what are you doing here?

801
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:23,506
Your photo shoot,
i believe.
mm-hmm.

802
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,525
And i heard i was getting
a foot massage.

803
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,461
Never had one before.
oh, my god,
me neither.

804
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,297
We have that in common. i have
something in common with adele.
(chuckles)

805
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,383
Well, very nice to meet you.
i bett get started.
oh, i prioritize
work, too.

806
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:35,652
We have two things
in common.

807
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,788
Ta-ra! take care.
ta-ra!

808
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,940
Matt, i don't even know
what to say.

809
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,777
Well, i may not be committed
to publishing anymore,

810
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,279
But i di't want there
to be any doubt

811
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,582
About my commitment
to you.

812
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,051
I love you.

813
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:56,323
(etta james) ? at last ?

814
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:00,077
? my love ?

815
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,496
I guess we're next.

816
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,666
I do have something
for you.

817
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,719
? my lonely days ?

818
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,772
Wow, that was quick.

819
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,441
?

820
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,160
A plane ticket.

821
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,729
I don't understand.

822
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,531
They, um, called
from the hospital.

823
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,484
They said you haven't
turned the job down yet.

824
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,219
Ignacio...

825
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,655
Shh, shh, shh.

826
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,124
Getting married now, i...

827
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,927
(sighs)
it's not the right time.

828
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,880
? ...are blue ?

829
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,917
? my heart... ?

830
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,903
This is
a great opportunity.

831
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:47,572
I still love you.

832
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,758
But if i'm committed
to you,

833
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:52,811
Then it has to be about
what's right for you...

834
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,429
Not me.

835
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:59,584
Well, we'll still see
each other...

836
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,953
Long-distance.

837
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,556
Yeah.

838
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:06,841

playing)

841
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,636
? who wants to be
right as rain? ?

842
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:22,323
? it's better
when something is wrong ?

843
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:25,443
? you get excitement
in your bones ?

844
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:29,063
?nd everything you do
is a game ?

845
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:32,450
? when night comes
and you' on your own ?

846
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,886
? you can say
i chose to be alone ?

847
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,371
(camera shutter clicks)

848
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,174
? who wants to be
right as rain? ?

849
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:42,944
? it's harder
when you're on top ?

850
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,881
? 'cause when hard work
don't pay off and i'm tired ?

851
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:50,068
? there ain't no room in my bed
as far as i'm concerned ?

852
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:52,754
? so wipe
that dirty smile off ?

853
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:55,056
? we won't be making up ?

854
00:39:55,123 --> 00:40:00,411
? i've cried my heart out,
and now i've had enough ?

855
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:05,049
? of love, oh, oh ?

856
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:07,101
(camera shutter clicks)

857
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:10,788
(jodie) so...
a couple getting married...

858
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:14,692
A space alien...

859
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:17,278
A crazy woman
smashing planets...

860
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:20,281
And adele.

861
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,334
I love it. it's weird.

862
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:25,153
It's thought-provoking.

863
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,822
And the piece you wrote
about music

864
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:31,359
Being the great uniter
in the vast universe...

865
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,878
It's brilliant.

866
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:37,365
You are
the y.e.t.i. winners.

867
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,317
Yeah! (laughs)
oh! yay!

868
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,470
Oh, god.
you are the future
of publishing.

869
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:46,024
And it's completely due
to your work.

870
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:48,660
It has nothing to do
with anything extracurricular

871
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:51,329
One of you may have done
last night.

872
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:52,730
(clears throat)

873
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,716
Matt, thank you.

874
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,101
It wouldn't have happened
witht you.

875
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:59,487
Well, we make a great team.

876
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:03,724
So i am going to
a sing-along.

877
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:07,261
(chuckles)
and, um, you know
that the men

878
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:10,198
Who generally go
to sing-alongs are...

879
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,166
A catch.

880
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:15,186
I love sing-alongs.

881
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:19,541
We certainly have
a lot in common.

882
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:22,577
(chuckles)

883
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:25,379
You are putting
a lot of trust in me.

884
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,865
I mean, getting married
is one thing.

885
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,918
But tting me pick out
your clothes--

886
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:32,387
That is a huge deal.
it's our honeymoon.
who needs clothes?

887
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:35,807
I knew i married
the right girl.
(laughs)

888
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:39,126
But on the odd chance
we actually get out of the room,

889
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:42,263
See bora-bora,
i am putting in one dress

890
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:44,231
And a pair of heels.

891
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:46,884
And, uh, i'm actually
out of sunscreen.

892
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:50,404
Do you have any,
or should i run out?

893
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:52,624
Mrs. meade?

894
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:54,993
(object clatters)

895
00:41:56,462 --> 00:41:57,946
Molly. molly.

896
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:00,965
Oh, my god!

897
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,951
Molly, can you hear me?

898
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:04,919
Molly,
