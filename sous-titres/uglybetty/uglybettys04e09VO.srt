1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,792
Papi, I am so excited about
our Christmas dinner tonight.

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:06,667
I've been telling Matt all about

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,125
Your traditional homemade tamales

4
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:08,917
How do these look?

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:13,833
What is that supposed to be?

6
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,917
Potato latkes swimming in oil.

7
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,875
Apparently, grandpa wants me
to be a house by new year's.

8
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,250
Ugh, what's that smell, papi?

9
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,958
Oh! That's even worse.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,125
Since when do you make
potato latkes?

11
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,292
Since I'm inviting someone
to join us tonight,

12
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,708
And I think she'd appreciate it
if we celebrated

13
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,500
Christmas and Hanukkah.
Someone?

14
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,750
She?
Hanukkah?

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,583
Well, there may be
a certain Jewish lady

16
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,917
I'd like to get to know better.

17
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:40,875
What?
After a long distance relationship,

18
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,375
It was nice to meet someone
in the neighborhood.

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,958
And she's excited to be
having dinner with a councilman.

20
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:49,875
Oh...  yeah. Archie's really busy, so...
I just called him. He's coming.

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,458
Oh, great.
Yay!

22
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,167
Now Archie and Matt can finally
get to know each other,

23
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,292
And then we can double-date.

24
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,708
Nope. Nope, I'm not gonna do
that thing that I always do,

25
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,375
Which is
get way ahead of myself

26
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,958
And start projecting into the future.
Could you project into this afternoon

27
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,625
And have him bring drinks?
Turns out,

28
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,458
Cooking Christmas and Hanukkah
dinner is quite a schlep.

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,417
I'd help, but I have model U.N.
Until 7:00. I'm Sweden.

30
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,583
That's great, mijo.

31
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,833
Come home when you can.
See if you can get us a discount

32
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,250
On a Volvo.
As Sweden,
you get a lot of that.

33
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:21,833
Oh, Papi, don't worry.

34
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,333
I promise I will start helping
you as soon as I get home.

35
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,250
Me, too.
No breakfast?

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,833
No. Actually, I'm feeling
kind of queasy today.

37
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,458
Oh, that's weird. Me, too.
Really?

38
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,375
I hope we're not
coming down with something.

39
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,167
All right, I'm off to work.
Love you all.

40
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,542
Have a good day.
Okay, bye.

41
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,333
Bobby!
Chipmunk!

42
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:43,542
Hey, hon, you know you're gonna
get over your crush on me

43
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,417
One day, right?
You're so funny. Bye.

44
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,625
See ya. Have a good day.

45
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,667
Bobby.

46
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,875
Hey.
What are you doing here?

47
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,292
I came--

48
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:54,583
No! I know exactly what you're
doing here and I don't like it.

49
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,708
What happened between us--
That cannot happen again, okay?

50
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,333
I came to give Justin
a ride to school, okay?

51
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,625
He's got a bulky project.
He does not have
a bulky project.

52
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,042
Oh, thanks so much, Bobby.
Who knew that

53
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,333
Nobel prize winners and what
they wore could be so heavy?

54
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,625
Hey, Mr. Suarez.

55
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,292
Hey, Bobby. I was just about
to put up the manger.

56
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,750
Do you like our baby Jesus?

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,458
We've had him since someone
stole our original 14 years ago.

58
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,500
I had nothing
to do with that, I swear.

59
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:23,583
Can we go?

60
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,917
Jimmy Carter's cardigan
just slipped off the hanger.

61
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,833
Let me give you a hand with that.
Thank you.

62
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,042
It's official!

63
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,458
Jumpsuits are back... again!

64
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,208
Thank or curse

65
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,375
Former "Mode" evil queen
Wilhelmina Slater,

66
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,208
Who started the trend
after being spotted about town

67
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,292
In other news, Connor Owens,

68
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:46,417
Former "Mode" finance-wiz-
turned-caged-con man

69
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,333
Is behind bars for
stealing the Meade fortune.

70
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,333
Officials are searching
for the missing monies.

71
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,458
Let's hope enough of it
turns up to buy Willie a belt.

72
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,375
After all, Ms. Slater,

73
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,083
A waist is a terrible thing to waste.

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,750
What was she thinking?

75
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,000
I've seen actual blueberries
look less round.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,917
I think
it's quite flattering.

77
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,875
Oh, Marc, she's gone.

78
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,417
You don't have to
defend her anymore.
Mom, leave him alone.

79
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,333
He's just working through
a little Stockholm syndrome.

80
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,292
She was
the Symbionese Liberation Army

81
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,417
To my Patty Hearst.

82
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,375
She even bought me a beret.

83
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,250
Speaking of accessories,
the ascot's really working.

84
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,667
You think so?
Trust me.

85
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,458
Mom, we really need to move
on a new creative director.

86
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,208
I don't like how Hartley's
dragging his heels

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,833
On that list of candidates I gave him.
He's considering a few other ideas

88
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,417
That are a little more...
"outside the box."

89
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,708
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

90
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,125
My mom's letting her soulless
new boyfriend call the shots.

91
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,000
That seems like good, solid
business sense to me, hmm?

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,708
Look, Daniel.

93
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,500
It's Cal's money that's
keeping this company alive.

94
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,458
And if you'll recall,

95
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,208
Our money is gone
because of your friend.

96
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,083
God, I hope he rots in jail.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,042
That traitor deserves
whatever he gets.

98
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,542
How on earth did you
manage to swing

99
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,667
Daily conjugal visits?

100
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,458
Well, having
a senator as a father

101
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,917
Certainly has its perks.

102
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,917
Willie, as fun as this is,

103
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,542
We didn't have you
turn me in for nothing.

104
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,208
I know you want to be
back at "Mode,"

105
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,167
So you do your part,
I'll do mine,

106
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:51,250
And we'll have you back there in no time.
Well, I hope it takes longer than that.

107
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,208
These past three weeks
have been heaven...

108
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,167
aside from my tailoring bill.

109
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,083
You have got to stop literally
ripping my clothes off.

110
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,542
I can't afford to be caught
sneaking out again

111
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,000
In one of your
ridiculous jumpsuits.

112
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,500
It's a miracle
I could pass it off as a trend.

113
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,875
You know,
some idiots will wear anything.

114
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,667
How long do we have to keep
hiding from her?

115
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,333
Well, until we're
less obviously happy.

116
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,958
Hmm, that could take awhile.
I know. I love our new thing--

117
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,625
No labels, no expectations,
just living in the moment.

118
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,750
Oh, by the way, will you bring
drinks to dinner tonight?

119
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,500
Something fancy. My dad's trying
to impress a new lady friend.

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,125
Some guys never stop
trying too hard.

121
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,333
You wanna see me break dance?
Not now.

122
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,167
But no expectations.

123
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,625
What are you thinking about?

124
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,083
You're glowing.

125
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,333
Nothing.

126
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,208
I guess you make me glow.

127
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:57,917
Mrs. Meade!

128
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,042
You'll be landing at

129
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,417
The Sioux Falls
regional airport at 2:35.

130
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,708
I'm sorry
I didn't book it sooner,

131
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,208
But those dopes
at the international terminal

132
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,625
Kept telling me
I was calling the wrong place.

133
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,000
Amanda, am I doing
the right thing,

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,083
Chasing after my lost son?
I mean, what if

135
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,917
He has a terrible life
because I gave him up?

136
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,958
What if he doesn't want to know me?
What--what if he hates me?

137
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,917
Mrs. Meade, you're putting way
too much pressure on my hand.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,708
Look, you just have to
show up and see him.

139
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,083
And you'll know what to do next.

140
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,917
Thank you, Amanda.

141
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,542
But not looking like that.

142
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,208
You're going to South Dakota.
You have to blend in.

143
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,708
Less "money,"
and more "food stamp."

144
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,375
Come on. We're gonna
give you a make-under.

145
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,292
I've got the silver fox on the move.

146
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,417
Oh, the decorations
are so beautiful.

147
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:50,792
Yeah.

148
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,042
Hey, you okay?

149
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,542
Yeah. I don't know why
I'm so emotional these days.

150
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,917
Hi, welcome to
Macy's believe station.

151
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,583
For every letter mailed to Santa,

152
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,667
Macy's will donate $1--
Up to $1 million--

153
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,250
To the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
That is so nice!

154
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,125
That's great.
Now I'm gonna ask Santa

155
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,458
To make sure that one day every
child is happy and healthy.

156
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,542
Sure. And I always ask
for world peace.

157
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,125
And what did you ask Santa for?

158
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,875
Well, I can't tell you. Then I won't get it.
Your wife's very superstitious.

159
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,042
Oh, she's not--
I'm not his wife.

160
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,708
Wow! January Jones
for our March cover--

161
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,917
That's exciting!

162
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,875
Ugh! Enough "Sad Men."
Isn't she a little played out?

163
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,625
I love her.
I love her, too.

164
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,875
You know, Marc, it's okay.

165
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,000
You can totally disagree with
Daniel and he doesn't hit you

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,583
Or psychically shame you in any way.
It's confusing.

167
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,250
By the way,
your tie is really wide.

168
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,375
Yeah, it's, uh...it's an ascot.

169
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,250
We're playing.

170
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,042
You realize that's, uh,
kind of my bagel you're eating?

171
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,667
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,208
I've been feeling sick all
morning, and now I'm starving.

173
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,292
You can have it.
I'll go get my own.

174
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,833
Hi, honey.
Hello.

175
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,292
Uh, Daniel, Marc,
I would like you to meet

176
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,000
Denise Ludwig,
our new creative director.

177
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,750
Denise, this is Daniel meade,
our editor-in-chief.

178
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,542
Hey, it is great to meet you.

179
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,625
Are you ready to
kick this thing in the ass?

180
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,958
Uh, Denise here
was head of development

181
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,458
For White Line pictures.

182
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,125
This little lady is gonna bring
a touch of tinseltown magic.

183
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:30,708
And you sure as hell could use it.
I'm here to commercialize your message,

184
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,958
Just like I did for White Line.

185
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,750
I was the one that took them
from yawn-fest indie darlings

186
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,583
To back-to-back blockbuster
tent poles.

187
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,833
I get back-to-back tent poles
just thinking about it.

188
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:43,792
I'm kidding. You can't sue me.
Actually, you can try. I'd like to see that.

189
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,792
Cal, we need to talk
for a minute.

190
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,500
Uh, why don't I show you
the tanning bed?

191
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:49,667
Solid.

192
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,792
Okay.
What are you trying to pull?

193
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,750
My mother and I submitted

194
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,958
A list of top candidates
in the business.

195
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,208
You hire someone
not even in the business

196
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,458
Without discussing it with us?
Well, I'll discuss it with your mom

197
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,833
When she gets into bed tonight.

198
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,208
And with regard to
your problems with Denise--

199
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,458
My money, my choice.

200
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:26,792
Please.

201
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,542
You shouldn't be standing
in your condition.

202
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,333
No, I'm not, uh...
No breakfast?

203
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,375
No. Actually, I'm
feeling kind of queasy today.

204
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,083
Daniel uh, you do know
you're eating my bagel.

205
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,917
I've been feeling so sick
all day, and now I'm starving.

206
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,208
I love our new thing.
What are you thinking about? 

207
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,000
You're glowing.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,917
No labels, no expectations,
just living in the moment.

209
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:46,917
Pregnant.

212
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,083
Excuse me.

213
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,292
Hi. Um...can you tell me
where the, uh...

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Um, you know what? Never mind.

215
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,208
I probably don't need it.
It's all in my head.

216
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,833
How'd you know?

217
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,542
Darling, I know that look.
I didn't work 25 years

218
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,167
At the Barnard Health Services
for nothing.

219
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,292
Just make sure

220
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:36,500
You wait the full three minutes
for a plus or a minus sign.

221
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,500
And the saltines
and the ginger ale?

222
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,542
Sodas and crackers--
Aisle four and aisle five.

223
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

224
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,667
Hi. I need a Be-Shure
and a non-see-through bag.

225
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,125
I'm a little late.
Pay at the front.

226
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,417
Thanks. Oh, saltines
and ginger ale?

227
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,750
Crackers and sodas--
Aisle five and aisle four.

228
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,625
And, honey, relax.

229
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,958
Maybe you aren't.

230
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,750
I don't think so. This is
the one test I never fail.

231
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,208
Unbelievable.

232
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,125
So how do you want to take down
Miss Cecil B. Female?

233
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,917
Dig dirt? Blackmail?

234
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,667
Twitter backlash? How do you want
to play this?

235
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,042
You know what? I don't want
to play this at all.

236
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,458
Denise isn't the real problem,
Hartley is.

237
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,875
As soon as the FBI finds out
where Connor hid the money,

238
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,500
We'll buy him out, fire Denise.
No need for crazy schemes.

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
It's like I'm in a new land

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,792
Where the customs are so strange.

241
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,042
She's here.

242
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,667
Daniel.

243
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,583
Marc.
Willie, I--

244
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,833
I'm really not interested.
Okay.

245
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,042
Daniel, admit it. You need me.

246
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,500
You'll never get that money
from Connor unless I help you,

247
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,750
And I won't help you unless I'm reinstated

248
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,292
In my old position first.
Actually, Willie, I don't need you.

249
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,375
The FBI is locating the money for us.

250
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,000
The FBI?  Cute.

251
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,667
And your replacement started today.

252
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,667
All right, then.

253
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,875
I want every stick out.
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,083
You'll be better off without me.

255
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,583
Clearly I'm no longer

256
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,167
The trendsetting icon I used to be.

257
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,667
Nice jumpsuits, ladies.

258
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,333
Call me if you need me.

259
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Mija! My help has arrived.

260
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,542
I'll be right down in a minute.

261
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,292
I gotta get in there.

262
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:04,458
Okay, hold on just one second.
Finishing up.

263
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,208
Betty, seriously.
Come on, already.

264
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:18,000
Coming!

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,958
I gotta pee.
Okay.

266
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,833
Thank you.
You're welcome.

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,667
Excuse me.

268
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,417
I need a bandage.

269
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,125
Okay, one second.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,542
When did you get home?
I've been here.

271
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:00,625
What?
What?

272
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,167
Why are you two still up here?
I need your help.

273
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:09,625
And that pot of tzimmes is not gonna make itself.
Just a minute. Papi, I gotta pee.

274
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, yeah, me, too.
You were just in here.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,875
Papi.
Papi.

276
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,667
Okay.
No, I gotta pee.

277
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,625
Hilda! So do I!
I am older!

278
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
That hurt!

279
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,792
Hilda, come on.

280
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,292
Seriously, how long does it
take you to pee?

281
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:39,000
Come on! Seriously.
I gotta get in there!

282
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,583
Okay. All right. All right.

283
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,333
Betty, I need to talk to you.
Not now.

284
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,000
Betty.

285
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:54,708
Oh, shoot.

286
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,167
Betty,
I need to talk to you.

287
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,708
It's important.

288
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,333
Oh, my God.

289
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh, Betty, seriously,
I gotta talk to you.

290
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,792
Coming!

291
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,250
Coming.

292
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,042
Betty?

293
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,792
Betty, s--
I'm pregnant.

294
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,083
What? I'm pregnant.
What?

295
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,792
Girls, downstairs right now!

296
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:38,666
There you are.

297
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,721
Can you get the brisket
out of the oven, please?

298
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,329
So...

299
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,330
you got burned?

300
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,101
What? No. I didn't get...

301
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:57,750
yeah, I got burned.

302
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:57,682
Of course I was being careful.
Why? Weren't you being careful?

303
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:02,492
Yeah, well, not as careful
as I should have been. Ow!

304
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:05,411
Burned twice?

305
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:07,984
That's what happens when you
don't wear an oven mitt.

306
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,106
Hey.
Hey.

307
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,085
This is the chair Willie got me

308
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:22,410
When I told her the one I had
was comfortable.

309
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,267
This mark here--
I was injecting her with botox

310
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,268
And I missed and hit a vein
in her forehead.

311
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:30,096
She ripped the needle
out of my hand,

312
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,660
Threatened to plunge it
into my eye

313
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,591
And said if it weren't
for my clogged pores,

314
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,918
My tiny brain would have
seeped out long ago.

315
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,049
Good riddance, huh?

316
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:44,884
Yeah.

317
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,714
Good riddance.

318
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,819
Still waiting on that order, Tyler.
Coming up.

319
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,812
All right.

320
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,430
You're not from around here.

321
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,483
Wh-what--what gave me away?

322
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,960
You have all your teeth.
Ah.  Yeah.

323
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,512
What can I get you?

324
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:36,722
Much as I'd love
to say scotch rocks,

325
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,445
I'll just go with
a cranberry and soda.

326
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,924
Ah, you, too, huh?

327
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,581
I used to pound pretty hard
in college myself.

328
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,376
You went to college.

329
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,991
I mean, you just seem so young.

330
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:49,936
Community college.

331
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,795
Oh.
A couple classes, you know.

332
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:54,519
Learned enough to realize
that a few more shots,

333
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,639
And it would all go south pretty fast.

334
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,447
It's genetic, I guess.

335
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,395
That's what I hear.

336
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:13,787
Can I get you some beer nuts?
That would be lovely.

337
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:09,428
So what do we do now?

338
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:13,034
I don't know.

339
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,207
You can cube cheese.

340
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,707
Ooh. I'll get that.

341
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:24,580
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.Are you gonna tell Matt?
Oh, my God. This is crazy. Are you gonna tell Archie?

342
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,943
I don't know!
I don't know!

343
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,834
Hilda, what am I gonna do?
I can't have a baby.

344
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,958
I know!
I mean, I've thought about it.

345
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,392
You know, maybe, someday,
but not now.

346
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:37,759
And my career, finally...

347
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,534
and Papi.
What are we gonna tell papi?

348
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:43,634
Nothing tonight. Okay, we don't
tell anybody anything tonight.

349
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,482
Let's just get through dinner.
But what if--

350
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,727
Papi is not gonna find out,

351
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,423
'Cause we're not gonna
say anything, Betty,

352
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,274
And we are
the only ones who know.

353
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,743
Hilda, Betty, this is Jean.

354
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,792
She works at the drugstore.
Hi.

355
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,922
Hi.
Hi.

356
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,548
What beautiful daughters
you have.

357
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:12,131
I'm surprised I've never seen
either of them

358
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,048
In the neighborhood before.

359
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:14,910
Are you well?

360
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,109
Yeah, thanks.
Yes, thank you for asking.

361
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:18,577
Are you positive?

362
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:24,060
Okay.

363
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,464
Where can I put my apple cake?
I'll take it.

364
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:27,874
I'll get that.

365
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,508
Hey. We both brought booze.

366
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,884
Just call us your sugar daddies!
Okay.

367
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:45,511
Phone call
from "Mode" magazine.

368
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,467
That's Daniel.

369
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:49,313
He can wait.
No, go. Go.

370
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,792
You have to make him believe I'm
the only route to that money.

371
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,744
Convince him you still love me,

372
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:56,671
Just like you convinced me
two minutes ago.

373
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,302
Go.
Yes.

374
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,726
Daniel, how sweet of you to call.

375
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,121
I don't believe it's gone,
you lying, son of a--

376
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,527
Oh, it's not gone. Not that
you're ever gonna see it again.

377
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:16,647
That money is mine.
You want to talk about mine and yours?

378
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,351
Let's talk about Molly.

379
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:21,466
She was mine
until you stole her from me.

380
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,509
And in a way, you stole Willie
from me, too.

381
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:26,657
Willie? Connor, what the hell
are you talking about?

382
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:29,303
I loved her. I wanted
to give her everything.

383
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:32,623
She chose you and your company
over me.

384
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,839
You're never getting
that money back, Daniel.

385
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,280
You've got enough
from me already.

386
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,251
You Marc St. James?

387
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,098
Oh. Uh, there must be a mistake.

388
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,680
This is supposed to go to Ms. Slater's.

389
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,671
She said she wanted you to have it.

390
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:04,761
Anyway... my niece made it,

391
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:07,702
And I thought it might be nice
to light alongside the tree.

392
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,880
Absolutely.
That is exactly the spirit

393
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,118
In which I whipped up these
multicultural holiday cocktails.

394
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:19,071
I present to you
mulled kosher wine.

395
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,081
Salud.

396
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,916
Oh. Ugh. This is terrible.

397
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,812
Is it okay if we have beer?
Yeah, that stuff is gross.

398
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:31,685
Okay, I got it. Who wants a beer? Matt? Betty?
Sure.

399
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,163
Oh, no, thank you.
Oh, yeah, we got it. Come on.

400
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,366
How could you turn down a beer?
I don't like beer.

401
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,818
I don't care. Passing on a drink
is a rookie mistake.

402
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:45,095
It's the first thing that makes
everyone think you're pregnant.

403
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:48,871
Well, I'm sorry. I've--I've
never hidden a pregnancy before.

404
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:50,861
Well, you need to get good
at it, and fast.

405
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:52,905
If somebody offers you a drink,
you take it,

406
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,499
You put your tongue in the top
and then you don't drink. Duh!

407
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,463
Oh, right. Duh. I don't know
why I didn't know that.

408
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:02,988
Girls, where are you?
Okay, here we are. Cerveza?

409
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,210
Here you go. Yum, beer.

410
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,203
But you don't like beer.
Sure, I do.

411
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,921
Oh, God. Here.
Let me help you with that.

412
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:19,855
I told you to act like
you wanted a drink,

413
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:22,609
Not like you were drunk.
Hilda, I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

414
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,518
Papi's date is the woman
I bought my pregnancy test from.

415
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,102
Wait. She's who I bought
my pregnancy test from today.

416
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:32,353
I could barely get home fast enough.
What? You took your test today, upstairs?

417
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:34,477
Yeah, I tried, but Papi knocked.
I had to stop halfway through.

418
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:36,182
Well, when you knocked,
I had to stop.

419
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,084
I freaked out. I dropped my test.
I dropped my test.

420
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,071
I had to sneak back in, pick it up off the floor.
I picked mine up off the floor.

421
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,748
Wait. Did we check the same test?
I don't know. I threw mine in the garbage.

422
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:44,923
I threw mine in the garbage!

423
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,979
Oh, here they come.

424
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,864
Where you going?
Um, I'm cold.

425
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,582
Oh, yeah, grabbing a sweater.

426
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,992
Scotch and soda, whiskey neat,
seven and seven.
Thanks.

427
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:58,062
Seems like a strange job
for you to take.

428
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,410
Temptation all around.

429
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,779
Well, if they're paying,
I'm working.

430
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,619
You know, here,
the post office, wherever.

431
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,002
Uh, my mom had to quit her job
a couple years ago, so...

432
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:10,336
I'm sorry. Is she all right?

433
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,052
Yeah. She's a fighter.

434
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:18,122
I'm sorry. Um, you're supposed
to be here on vacation,

435
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,656
Not listening to my troubles.

436
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,495
So what have you seen so far?

437
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:23,478
Nothing. I just got here.

438
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:25,323
Well, we got more
than Mount Rushmore.

439
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:28,242
We got the Badlands,
Crazy Horse Memorial

440
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:30,687
And a whole bunch of meth labs.

441
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:31,561
That sounds great.

442
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:34,626
Uh, no,
not--not--not the meth labs.

443
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,709
That was a joke.

444
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,407
So, um, if you want,

445
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:41,273
I can tell you some cool places
to check out.

446
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,716
I would like that very much.

447
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:50,523
Here you go.

448
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:52,679
Thank you.

449
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:55,786
You're very kind.

450
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,271
Negative! One is negative!
Aah! Oh, thank God.

451
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:04,011
And positive.

452
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:05,562
Oh, God. I hope it's not me.

453
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:10,223
So you're saying you want it to be me.
No, I just mean that it's gonna be so much easier

454
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:12,008
For you to tell Archie
than for me to tell Matt.

455
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:15,744
Not... really.

456
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:17,304
What do you mean?

457
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,019
Hilda, what are you saying?

458
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,242
Exactly what you're thinking.

459
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:27,005
Oh, my God!
It's not Archie's?

460
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,941
Well...
whose would it be?

461
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,812
Well, that's what--
Oh, sorry. Sorry. It wasn't...

462
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,879
Oh, my God. Are you pregnant?

463
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,521
Pregnant?
Like pregnant pregnant?

464
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:45,812
I don't know.

465
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:46,809
I'm not sure.

466
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,174
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

467
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,887
I might not be.

468
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,819
See, uh, Hilda took
a test and I took a test,

469
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,265
And it got mixed up, and we
don't know whose is whose.

470
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:00,623
But one of us isn't pregnant.
One of us is.

471
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,286
We just don't know which.
Whoa.

472
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:06,679
I didn't mean for this
to happen. Things were so good--

473
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,920
Are so good--between us,
and this is not anything

474
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,264
That either one of us
should be thinking about.

475
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:12,787
Trust me. I know that.
I hope it's us.

476
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:15,564
What?
I kind of want it to be us.

477
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:19,780
I know. I know it... isn't
something that we planned,

478
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,715
And it's probably--
Okay, okay, definitely--

479
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,414
It definitely is not
the exact right time,

480
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:27,639
But a baby, with you...

481
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,728
how could that be bad?

482
00:26:29,728 --> 00:26:32,003
Because. Just, uh, because.

483
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:34,551
Betty, listen. Look, I'm the guy

484
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,700
Who can never pick the right
thing for my life.

485
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,415
Well, maybe the right thing
finally picked me.

486
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,566
Look, Betty. Betty,
whatever problems we have,

487
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,063
We can work it out.
No, Matt. I don't want to work it out.

488
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,645
I don't want to have a baby
right now.

489
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,051
I mean,
I can't have a baby at all.

490
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:52,079
I-I can't be pregnant right now.
Okay. Okay. Well, maybe you're not.

491
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,040
I'll go pick us up another test.
How? Hilda and I have stalled dinner a hundred times.

492
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,758
There's no way my dad is letting you out of the house.
Don't worry. I'll be subtle.

493
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,594
Finally. Come. Sit.

494
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:06,195
You've been gone so long, your beer is warm.
I'll get more.

495
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:09,674
Yeah, we--we sure could use them.
Uh, Hilda, I think that's mine.

496
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:13,222
Is it?
Yeah, I'm sitting right there.
Who else's would it be?

497
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,047
Hey, anybody want a baby?

498
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:19,682
I got this for you. It's not
because I stole the last one.

499
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,961
Okay, I stole the last one.

500
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,928
All right. That was very thoughtful.

501
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:28,403
Uh, Jean, Archie,
this is, uh, Bobby.
Hey, Bobby. How are you?

502
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,171
Hey. How you doing?
Good.

503
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:33,044
Bobby?

504
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:37,496
It's Bobby!

505
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,198
Bobby in the house! Hey!

506
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:42,968
Yay! Happy Christmas!

507
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,487
Chipmunk--She's still got
a crush on me.

508
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,956
It's so cute. It's okay.

509
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:50,791
Oh, damn it, Marc. I just got
off the phone with the FBI.

510
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,222
They really think the money is gone,

511
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:54,246
But Connor admitted
he knows where it is.

512
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,386
He just won't tell me where.

513
00:27:55,991 --> 00:28:01,374
This ascot is making my neck sweat.
We're experimenting. It's a process. Here.

514
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:03,897
What are you going to do?

515
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,421
I don't know.

516
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,309
I mean, if I don't figure
this out,

517
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:08,888
I'm gonna lose my own magazine
to my mother,

518
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,710
Her stupid boyfriend
and Malibu Barbie.

519
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,587
Technically, the brunette
was Skipper.

520
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:14,848
Okay, Marc.

521
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,842
Daniel, I think that it's time

522
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:21,489
To call Willie.

523
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:23,668
No. No, absolutely not.

524
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,222
Besides, she broke Connor's heart.

525
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:27,483
There's no way he's gonna
give her the money.

526
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,119
I'm not so sure. You see,

527
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,753
Once you've known Willie,

528
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,934
No matter how terrible she was to you,

529
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:46,152
You never really get over her.

530
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:50,135
She will make you do things
you swore you'd never do.

531
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,597
I've done it.

532
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,435
Connor will do it.

533
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:58,648
And you'll do it, too.

534
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,256
And I'll tell you why.

535
00:29:02,513 --> 00:29:04,360
Because she's Willie,

536
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:07,052
And we're just men.

537
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,604
Wow! It's like you never saw
a wing before.

538
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:17,626
Well...

539
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:20,256
Look, it was nice meeting you,

540
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,181
But I'm getting out of here.
My shift is up, so...

541
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,103
I should be going, too.

542
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:29,492
Take care and, um, give my best
to your mother.

543
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,645
Sure.

544
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:33,717
She's lucky to have you.

545
00:29:34,378 --> 00:29:35,343
Okay.

546
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,133
Ready?

547
00:29:58,972 --> 00:29:59,782
Beautiful!

548
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:02,025
Okay, let's all go inside
and warm up.

549
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,250
Come on.

550
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:06,754
Bobby? You want to join us?

551
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:10,032
Oh, no. I think he's got other
things he's gotta do, right?

552
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:11,406
No, not really. Yeah.

553
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:13,096
All right, welcome.

554
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:16,851
Oh, thank you. Oh!

555
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,427
Um, I think you're in my spot.

556
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:22,919
Oh, I didn't know it was yours.

557
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,870
Hey. I thought you were
bringing beer.

558
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,823
They were out.

559
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,295
Well, you know how it is with
the holidays and alcoholics.

560
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:34,961
That's true.

561
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:37,844
All that matters is,
we can finally sit down

562
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:40,022
To a nice meal.
Jean, please light the menorah.

563
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:42,101
Matt, let me help you with that coat.
Oh, no, Papi.

564
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:43,283
No, no, no. It's fine. I got it.
I'm gonna say the prayer in English.

565
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:48,211
I want everybody to understand.
Dear God... let go, already!

566
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:53,711
Dear God.

567
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:10,366
Excuse me.

568
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:19,899
It wasn't me. I swear.

569
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,987
oh, thank God!
Oh, thank God!

570
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:37,856
Right?
Yeah.

571
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,694
I mean, I'd be lying if I didn't
say I was a little disappointed.

572
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:45,080
But it's all for the best.
I was getting ahead of myself.

573
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,625
It's not the right time.
Not at all. Oh, my God.
I have to tell Hilda.

574
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:50,875
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

575
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,388
I mean, uh, she's practically
engaged to Archie, right?

576
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,261
Betty? What's going on?

577
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,809
Whatever it is, I support you.

578
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,106
Look, I'm not mad.

579
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:02,525
All clear.

580
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,943
Oh, thank you, god.
I was gonna kill myself.

581
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:06,664
Sorry, mija.

582
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:09,178
It's fine, Papi. I'm relieved, too.

583
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,191
Good.
Me, too.

584
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:12,530
She said it first.

585
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,112
Look, let's just all go downstairs

586
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,611
And try to have a nice,
traditional Christmas/Hanukkah.

587
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:21,661
Papi, can you just wait
before you--

588
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:23,959
Whew! False alarm!

589
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,239
Hey! All right!

590
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,059
Back soon. Sweater.

591
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,119
But you're already wearing
a s-sweater.

592
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,518
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

593
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,505
Let's all go in
and start this dinner. Please.

594
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:43,655
Okay. Good. I'm starving.

595
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,706
Glad you're here.
Thank you.

596
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,376
I've been there, pal.

597
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,814
Well, you'll never guess what
I'm getting you for Kwanzaa.

598
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,366
Ugh. Hold on. Call waiting.

599
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:58,225
Yello?

600
00:32:58,225 --> 00:32:59,965
Amanda, I did it.

601
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,819
I saw him. I talked to him.

602
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,407
And now I'm done.

603
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,526
So he knows who you are?
No.

604
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,338
And he's never going to.

605
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,228
Holy smoke!

606
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,674
That lady just left me,
like, 2 grand.

607
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,403
Someone thinks you're cute.

608
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,185
Here we go.

609
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,195
Jean, I'm so sorry
about your menorah.

610
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:44,268
Oh, it's fine.
Between the Long Island nieces

611
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:47,169
And the Brooklyn nephews,
I have handmade menorahs

612
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:48,407
Coming out of my tuchus.

613
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,762
Ah, it would have been nice
to light it, though.

614
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,508
Well, we could improvise
with votive candles.

615
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,120
No offense
to the blessed saints,

616
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,874
But around here, we got those
coming out of our tuchus.

617
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,558
Where are the candles?
I'll go look.

618
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:15,455
Here goes nothing.

619
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:20,014
Daniel, Marc.

620
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:22,187
What took you so long?

621
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:24,875
Hilda.

622
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,511
You know, I never got
into all the saint stuff, Betty.

623
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,845
Well, it--it never made sense
to me.

624
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:37,076
They all looked so happy
suffering.

625
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,288
But...

626
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:41,596
now I get it.

627
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:45,768
What I did with Bobby...

628
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,542
what I did to Archie...

629
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,046
I'm a bad person.

630
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,392
I-I want to suffer. I deserve it.

631
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,981
I-I wish that someone
would peel my skin off

632
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:00,144
Or drag me behind a bunch of horses

633
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:02,733
Or make me swallow coals,
you know?

634
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,641
Are you absolutely sure
that it's not--

635
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,835
Yeah, he's been really busy
with the campaign.

636
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,601
These aren't about the baby,
by the way.

637
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:18,403
I've been lighting them all week.

638
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:21,826
I just--I needed
some sign, you know,

639
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:22,665
About whether or not

640
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:25,738
I should break up
with such a good guy.

641
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,448
Well, I got my sign.

642
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:32,818
I don't belong with Archie.

643
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:38,122
I just...I don't know if I'm gonna
have the guts to tell him.

644
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,120
Hilda.

645
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,720
Maybe you didn't make
the best choice...

646
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:55,068
but you are
a really good person.

647
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:58,812
And you don't deserve
to suffer.

648
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,537
Thanks.

649
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:05,435
But you know you still have
to tell Archie

650
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:06,945
That you don't want to be
with him, right?

651
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:10,739
Really? Couldn't you
just peel my skin off?

652
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,352
Can I come in?

653
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:18,552
I'm gonna
leave you two alone.

654
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,475
Hi.

655
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,920
What's with all the candles?

656
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,152
It's nothing.

657
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,801
It's not nothing, Hilda.

658
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,488
Your father invited me
here tonight, not you.

659
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:45,957
And every time I get near you,
you make some excuse

660
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:48,613
To run off into the kitchen
or rush upstairs, and, um,

661
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:52,463
Today when that woman thought
you were my wife?

662
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:55,531
You looked like
you'd seen a ghost.

663
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,861
I'm sorry. I--

664
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:59,693
No, it's--it's okay.

665
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:04,537
I love you, Hilda.

666
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:10,975
And I know you care for me,

667
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,962
But there's someone out there

668
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,871
Who's gonna be thrilled
to be mistaken for my wife.

669
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,019
And, um,

670
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,368
I deserve to find that person.

671
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,916
And you deserve to find
that person, too.

672
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:26,208
I hoped it could be me,

673
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:30,342
But... since it isn't,

674
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:32,798
It's... time

675
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,913
For me to say good-bye.

676
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:45,616
Happy New Year.

677
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:10,739
-woman

678
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:13,004
-man

679
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:16,080
- with 50% ownership.
- With equal veto power.

680
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:21,531
- Yes.
- Yes.

681
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:24,113
May I now, kiss the bride?

682
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:29,929
Not so fast. Can you really do this
without consulting your mother first?

683
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,231
Please. Focus on getting that money back.

684
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:37,703
Oh, I will. And I don't care if I have to
go to that filthy prison every day to do it.

685
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:53,157
Don't worry allright, I'm not gonna come around anymore,
I know that it makes you nervous. I don't like that.

686
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:58,284
Maybe a little.

687
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:07,562
- Bobby.
- What?

688
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:19,685
It's ok if you wanna drive Justin home now and
then, from school you know. Since it's so cold out.

689
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,161
Good!

690
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,073
***

691
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:30,020
Yeah.

692
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:35,233
That was a lovely dinner.
Such a nice family.

693
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:41,485
Thank you. We should do this again.
Maybe easter **.

694
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,333
I'd like that. Just don't tell my mother.

695
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:49,281
She'd kill me if she knew I was
dating someone who wasn't a Jewish.

696
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:05,729
I'm sorry I freaked out before.

697
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:17,103
Everything you said was so sweet. I wasn't really in
a place to hear it, but... I'm really glad you said it.

698
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:21,788
I meant it. I know. I know it's
not the right time, but...

699
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:28,571
***

700
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:34,286
- That's crazy right?
- No, that' not crazy.

701
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:38,021
Sometimes I imagine that too.

702
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:45,132
- And what do you see?
- It's silly.

703
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:48,494
And I'd much rather focus
on what I'm seeing right now.

704
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,014
That sounds good too.

705
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:58,119
- Merry Christmas Hanuka.
- Merry Christmas Hanuka.
