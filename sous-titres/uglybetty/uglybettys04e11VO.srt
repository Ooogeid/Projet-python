1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,320
Can we talk?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,280
Hi.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm doing crunches. You
got the money or not?

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,120
Yes. Well, no.
Y...some.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,250
But look, I think if you let me explain,

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,810
you'd be a lot more
open to working this out.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,410
I've had an awful, awful
week, and please just hear me out.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,740
Fine. Move your face.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,250
I finished Audrey Hepburn's
biography last night,

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,740
and it totally inspired me.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,370
Audrey Hepburn...
she's so boring.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,010
I hated "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,390
But if you tell one gay person
I said that, I will deny it. I will.

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,370
I promise. Anyway, Audrey
basically gave up her stardom

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,250
to go and do good in the
world, and it made me think.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,700
- I'm an editor now.
- Really?

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,190
And I'm finally in a position
to tell stories like that...

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,180
stories about people who do
inspiring and selfless things.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,320
Well, here's your next assignment
from the powers that be.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
Inspiring?

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,580
"The Most Comfortable Stiletto"?

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,810
Betty Suarez...

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,410
keeping the dream alive
for hookers with hammertoe.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,140
<i>Fed***</i>

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,520
I don't think I'll ever
get tired of those lips.

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,910
Willie, don't you think
we're kidding ourselves here?

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,090
Meaning?

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,920
Meaning you can't
go on like this...

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,810
giving up an actual life in the world

30
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,250
to visit me here in
this godforsaken place.

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm gonna be in here for
years. That's no life for you.

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,780
Please.

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,340
I've done much worse for much longer
and gotten much less out of it.

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm serious. You deserve more than this.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,990
Connor, I'm happy. Now stop it.

36
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,570
30 minutes! That's it!

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,090
I can't believe how many ads we
lost while Hartley was in charge.

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,610
Can we just talk a little more
about how much I hated him?

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,810
Maybe later. So when we
shaving the beard, do you think?

40
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,430
We are not. I like it.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,320
Hmm. We'll revisit.

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,560
Daniel, I need Marc, and you're
just gonna have to deal with it.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,290
Well, since you asked so
sweetly, how could I possibly say no?

44
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm sorry. I'm working like
an 8-year-old seamstress here

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,870
***

46
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,840
I don't have time to replace him now.

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,830
Hmm, says the woman who strolls
in at, oh, look at that...11:00.

48
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,060
I was visiting my sick aunt in Jersey.

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,560
You feel good about that crack now?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,910
Point being, you stole Marc from me.

51
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,960
The least you could do is share
him with me, just for a while.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,090
And how does Marc feel about that?

53
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,390
Uh, it's funny how you pretend
like I have any say in it at all.

54
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,500
Fine. But just for a while.

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,120
Will there be extra
compensation for this extra work?

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,580
I no longer feel betrayed by you.

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,540
That's compensation enough.

58
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,370
- Giddyap.
- Right.

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,360
- Well, what have you been up to?
- Well, I know, you know, work is kind of slow...

60
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,560
- Sorry I'm late. 
- ...do more charity work.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,830
Charity work? What charity work?

62
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,790
Well, I've been building
houses for happy homes.

63
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,500
Yeah, a group of us go in, and
we build them with the people

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,350
who are actually gonna
be living in them.

65
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,240
It's a great experience.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,650
Reminds me to be grateful.

67
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,570
You're so good. I hate you.

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,290
Me, too.

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,040
Sorry. I was eavesdropping.

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,090
Uh, I don't hate you. I love you.

71
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,240
Actually, I don't know you,

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,390
but I'm just grateful
that you do what you do.

73
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,280
See, that's what I want
to be writing about...

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,720
Stuff like that, people like
that who do things like that.

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,230
I'm sure I'll find a way to turn
"The Most Comfortable Stiletto"

76
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,570
into something a little more me,

77
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,060
but I have no idea what that's gonna be.

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,830
But anyway, enough. How was your morning?

79
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,380
Well, first yoga and a movie,

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,680
then I'm going to pick a
paint color for my walls...

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,930
swiss mocha or eggnog.

82
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,870
See? You leaving "Mode"
was really good for us,

83
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,480
'cause before I would
have already known that.

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,020
But now I'm like, ooh, what
color is he gonna choose?

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,320
And then
it hit me...

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,020
why don't I write a story called
"Walk a Mile in her Shoes"?

87
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,510
I can feature a specific shoe
and then attach a personal story

88
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,910
of an inspiring woman who wears
that shoe in her daily life,

89
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,010
like a woman who builds houses
for the poor and her work boot,

90
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,660
or a charitable executive
and her designer heels...

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,040
I mean, uh, comfortable stiletto.

92
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,340
Who's really gonna
believe that anyway, right?

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,310
What was wrong with the
assignment you were given, Betty?

94
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,950
Back up.

95
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,570
Nothing. I just thought
that it was a little light

96
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,330
and I could put it in my own voice.

97
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,690
You're not paid for your voice.
You're paid to imitate mine.

98
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,320
I chose that story for you.

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Sorry. I just
thought that...

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,520
You do make a good point. The
story does need something...

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,330
a new writer.

102
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,240
You can go. That's
right, Betty. You get nothing.

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,510
Everyone, watch Betty leave.

104
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,980
That's it?

105
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,010
Your boss was mean to you?

106
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,710
That's your awful week?

107
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,830
Let me finish.

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,570
Hilda, I'm freaking out.

112
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,090
I made Wilhelmina really, really mad.

113
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,020
What happened? Hey, chew
over the bowl, huh?

114
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,480
She took away my piece. What do I do?

115
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,200
Do I go back and apologize
and beg for it back?

116
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,920
Tell her I'm coming over, and
I'm pregnant and bloated,

117
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,330
and she'd better do
whatever you tell her to do.

118
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,200
Seeing as that whole
image terrifies me...

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,660
I think I'm just gonna ask for it back.

120
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,570
All right, well, that's your call.

121
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,240
Hey, what did I just say?

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,280
Okay, I'm going now. And be nice to Bobby.

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,770
Okay, bye.

124
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,930
My father is mad enough
that you got me pregnant.

125
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,600
You can't afford to wreck his house.

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,950
All right. It was an accident.

127
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,280
We can't afford any more
accidents around here.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,240
Look, it's a little
spaghetti on an old rug.

129
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,840
- I'll clean it up myself, all right?
- Oh, no, no. I will clean it up,

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,550
because that is who I am around here.

131
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,240
I am the cleaner-upper person.

132
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,090
I cleaned up after Justin this morning,

133
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,370
I will clean up after you now,

134
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,200
and I will be cleaning up after
this baby for the next 50 years.

135
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,280
Now you're mad at the baby?

136
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,120
No, I just...

137
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,630
I just want to take a
shower, and I haven't had time.

139
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,580
And now I'm pregnant, and I will never
have time to take a shower ever again!

140
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,440
Sweetie, come on, stop.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,960
- What's stopping you from...
- You spilled on the rug!

142
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,580
Excuse me, Wilhelmina?

143
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,770
You have 30 seconds. Go.

144
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay. Um, I'm sorry, really, really sorry,

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,590
about what happened
in the pitch meeting.

146
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,290
I didn't mean to offend you at all.

147
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,280
- 10.
- Wow. That was 20 seconds?

148
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,930
Really? Is that how how you want
to use the rest of your time?

149
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,280
No. Right. Again, I'm sorry.

150
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,450
I'm grateful to have the job
at all. I meant no disrespect.

151
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,550
I know my place here, and I will write
a great piece in your voice, I promise.

152
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,020
Save the world on your own time, Betty.

153
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,820
You write whatever
fluff piece I give you,

154
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,460
and then maybe I'll give you
something better. Understand?

155
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,870
Yes, 100%.

156
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,040
I did like the title of your piece.

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,400
"Walk a Mile in her Shoes."

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,910
So let's do that. Let's
have you walk a mile...

159
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,230
in these.

160
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,020
And write about how
comfortable they are.

161
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,310
Oh, and, Betty, I know what those soles
look like with a half mile on them,

162
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,400
and I know what they look
like with a whole mile on them.

163
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,810
Oh, my God. Are you
kidding me? Seriously?

164
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,160
- Betty? What the...are you all right? 
- Daniel!

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,720
No. I'm gonna die.

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,750
Wilhelmina's making me
write a first-person piece

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,440
on how comfortable these heels are.

168
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,120
What? Do you want me to talk to her?

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,140
No. I'm trying to pay my dues

170
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,060
so she'll give me
something better to write.

171
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,580
Will you walk with me, please?

172
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,990
Okay, but we have to walk fast.

173
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,520
Marc forgot to book my car again. I'm
literally rushing to an appointment at coach.

174
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,450
He's really been
messing up a lot lately.

175
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,530
Marc? Really? Marc's
an amazasg assistant.

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,420
And no offense, Daniel, but
you're not the best communicator.

177
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,770
Wait. That's...
Betty, but...no. What?

178
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,560
See? I mean, I understood that, but
I've worked with you for a long time.

179
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,750
I guess maybe. All
right, I gotta go left here.

180
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,800
Okay, just peel off gently.

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,060
Oh, no, no! Oh.

182
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,650
I can never tell with you, Betty.

183
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,160
Is this an accessory you're working, or
did you actually hurt yourself?

184
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,940
I actually fell into traffic.

185
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,910
A mile and a quarter.

186
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,980
I was ten blocks away from St. Vincent's,

187
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,250
So I just kept going, and fortunately,

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,990
it was a long wait, so
I could write my piece.

189
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,420
I e-mailed you 200
words from the hospital.

190
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,920
Fine. You may have another piece.

191
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:49,120
Supposed to make your skin feel as
soft as a baby's ass in two days.

192
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,700
See you Thursday.

193
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,660
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

194
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,920
Was that really moisturizer?

195
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,340
By Ukrainian standards, yes.

196
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh! Connor put me in the
worst mood this morning.

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,750
He's pushing me away.

198
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,130
He thinks he's doing it for me.

199
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,550
He suggests I go out and live my life.

200
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,950
What? What are you doing with your face?

201
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,020
You really are in love with him.

202
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,550
Of course, but that's no
reason to feel things for me.

203
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,530
You have to find a way to tell
him that you're not going away.

204
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,670
Exactly. But how can I prove
to him that I'm as committed

205
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,230
to this relationship as he
is to that prison sentence?

206
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,910
I think I've got it.

207
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,280
Oh, my God. You're not gonna
break him out of jail, are you?

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,800
No. Just the opposite.

209
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,050
Darling, as happy as I am to see you,

210
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,650
shouldn't you be out
on the town right now

211
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,390
trading barbs with some
irritating socialite?

212
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,420
You're irritating enough, especially
when you talk like that.

213
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,590
Now listen to me.

214
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,460
I know you're worried
about me, which is touching.

215
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,480
But I've had enough.

216
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,640
- What the...
- Just open it.

217
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,590
We're getting married.

218
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,280
Willie, this is crazy.

219
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,370
I mean, I love you for trying this,

220
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,250
but I'm still locked up in here.

221
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,210
And marriage is my way of showing you

222
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,410
I'm willing to be as
locked up as you are.

223
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,860
Connor, I love you, and
I'm not gonna lose you

224
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,850
just because you're in prison.

225
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,930
- So we're doing this. 
- Willie, please...

226
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,120
You can say yes now, or
you can say yes later,

227
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,230
but I will come back every day
until I get the answer I want.

228
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,970
*****

229
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,720
Will...you...marry me?

230
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,170
Yes.

231
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,570
You pushy, remarkable
woman, I will marry you.

232
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,170
You know, I probably shouldn't say this, but I met
the perfect person for that story you wanted to do.

233
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,300
The one about the shoes?

234
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,150
- Don't tell her that.
- Yes, tell me.

235
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,930
Okay, well, you know how my family gives money To
that organization that does relief work in Botswana?

236
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,100
Anyway, I met one of the women
that actually does the work...

237
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,350
very cool, very smart and a grandmother.

238
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,570
She's in town for one more week
before she goes back to Africa

239
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,620
for another tour, and she
had on these funky sandals

240
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,230
that would have been
perfect for the shoe angle.

241
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,730
- What did I just say? 
- What? She...she wanted me to tell her.

242
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,250
She doesn't know what she needs.

243
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,900
Now I just want to write it even more.

244
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,420
What is wrong with Wilhelmina?

245
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,150
Why can't she see how
good of a piece it can be?

246
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,050
You know what you should do?

247
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,720
Start your own blog.

248
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,550
Yeah! Like that what's her name...
Huffington...only not so newsy.

249
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,560
Actually, a blog is a great idea.

250
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,740
Then you could write whatever you
want and just publish it yourself.

251
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,700
- Well, yeah, but I don't know how to start a blog.
- I could help you.

252
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,330
Come on. This could be the first step in creating
your own magazine or a book deal...or a movie!

253
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,770
Okay, I wasn't so sure when you said "blog,"

254
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,500
but now we're talking movies, so I'm in.

255
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,950
Guys, come on. Would anyone even read it?

256
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,620
There are so many blogs out there.

257
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,640
- Betty.
- Yes.

258
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
Really?

259
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,050
Well, I mean, after hand
creams and high heels,

260
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,880
I'd be happy to inspire just one person.

261
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm sure I can get in touch with that woman
From the relief mission, set up an interview.

262
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,940
Should I do this? 'Cause
I think I want to do it.

263
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,410
- Do it. - Totally.
- Yes! - You have to!

264
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,280
Okay! I have a blog!

265
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,600
Should this stuff be burning?

266
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh, no.

267
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,090
Hey, Amanda, can I use the
apartment later today?

268
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,890
I'm doing this project outside of work,

269
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,280
and I need a place to do
interviews and a photo shoot.

270
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,820
Totally. It's been empty
since we moved out anyway.

271
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,320
Since you what? You moved out?

272
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,550
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

273
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,270
Marc and I moved across
the hall to the 2-bedroom

274
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,180
because we needed more space.

275
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,930
How many times do I have
to tell you this, Betty?

276
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,300
Once would be nice!

277
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,960
Once? Try three times.

278
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,420
Hey, Betty, it's me.

279
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,070
Listen, Marc and I
are moving out, so...

280
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,110
Mandy, it's Marc.
Betty is 9-1-5-4.

281
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,910
That's hilarious. I
keep doing that. Bye.

282
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,970
Do you know where is Daniel Meade's?

283
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,620
Hey, Betty. Marc and I are moving
out. I told you that, right?

284
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,140
You're sure you told me this?

285
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,170
Yes! Now settle.

286
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,570
It's not like you were
gonna move back in anyway.

287
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,500
Well, no, but I didn't know you'd
be giving up my apartment for good.

288
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,770
Betty, please. You gave up
your apartment a year ago

289
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,540
when you moved back to
your farm or wherever.

290
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,380
This is not a big deal. And we're done.

291
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm gonna go hit the ladies'.

292
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,010
Whatever is going on with your skin
makes me feel like I need to go hose off.

293
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,890
Hey. What are you doing right now?

294
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,780
Skydiving. What are you doing?

295
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm taking you out for a fun
surprise. Come on, let's go.

296
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,850
Do you not see the woman in
curlers at the end of my arms?

297
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,720
Plus, I...I have another appointment.

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,500
You know, I figured it out.

299
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,140
You're being mean because
you're almost done raising a kid,

300
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,900
and now you gotta do it again.

301
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,950
So as of now, okay, this...
this is Hilda week.

302
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,530
I'm taking you out every day.

303
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,570
We're gonna do something for you

304
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,960
so that you know your life's not just
about taking care of other people.

305
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,260
Go. Go, or I'm going.

306
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,030
Car's downstairs. You need
to hurry or you'll be late

307
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,620
for your cocktails
with the Dsquared guys.

308
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,020
Are you sure the car's here? Because
it never showed at Kors yesterday.

309
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,740
Actually, I'm sure the car showed up.

310
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,740
- But it didn't.
- But it did. Now go.

311
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,730
Oh! Stop. Wait. Daniel.

312
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,970
Oh, right.

313
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,520
- Oh! My...my jacket! 
- Shh.

314
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,500
I got this.

315
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,880
- What are you...
- See? Always prepared. Spin.

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,220
Where did this jacket come from?

317
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,850
From your dry cleaning.

318
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,730
And it fits flawlessly!

319
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,320
Now get out of here. You
have to be at Waverly in ten.

320
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,890
I thought I was going to Farmhouse.

321
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,040
Okay, all this doubting me is
starting to get a little upsetting.

322
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,350
Okay, wow. She's very sensitive.

323
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,540
Hey, I just did my first "she."

324
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,100
Yeah.

325
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,270
So what do you think?

326
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,170
I love it.

327
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,010
"To inspire at least one person."

328
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,950
Our first interview.

329
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,330
Hey there.

330
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,710
<i>"Helping the Homeless."</i>

331
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,240
<i>"Walk a Mile In These Shoes."</i>

332
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
- Lee, come in.
- Hi.

333
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,360
*****

334
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,220
I stayed in a gorgeous
hotel on the Zambezi...

335
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,130
amazing views, great food, the works.

336
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,370
And just up the road was
a village of such poverty.

337
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,650
In fact, the hotel solicits donations

338
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,060
to help support the
people who live there.

339
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,160
But after seeing how
these lovely people lived,

340
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,720
I needed to do more
than just write a check.

341
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,860
And if you could see the
smiles on their faces,

342
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,070
the pure gratitude they
feel for so little...

343
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,770
I don't have the words.

344
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,300
So I'll leave that to you.

345
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,140
So what's my surprise?

346
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,710
- The surprise is that it's closed.
- Oh.

347
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,970
What happened?

348
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,860
- Cut my finger.
- Let me see.

349
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,640
Okay, wait. Let me get a thingy.

350
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,680
Okay. So what am I missing here?

351
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,470
- Concert. Ace of Base.
- Ace of Base!

352
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,330
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

353
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,370
I remember how much we used
to like 'em in high school.

354
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,140
Love. We loved 'em.

355
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,660
Yeah, I don't know what's up.

356
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,770
You know, my friend Perry told
me they're playing here Tuesday.

357
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,010
- It's Wednesday.
- Get outta here.

358
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,090
Yeah.

359
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,210
You know, here I am, trying
to make you feel like

360
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,080
you don't have to take
care of people all the time,

361
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,730
and look at you right now.

362
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,980
Eh. We'll just do something tomorrow.
You did say it's Hilda week, right?

363
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,550
- That's right, I did.
- Okay.

364
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,050
Yeah. Let's go.

365
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,870
So did you publish it yet?

366
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,120
No, not yet. I'm scared.

367
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,610
What if no one reads it?

368
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,950
They will, I promise.

369
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,150
Look, do it now while I'm
on the phone with you.

370
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,750
Okay. Ready?

371
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,140
What? What happened? Did it crash?

372
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,060
No. Someone's at the
door. I'll call you back.

373
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,570
The landlord? Mr. Z.

374
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,310
I sent you letters. I call your work.

375
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,740
What are you trying to pull?

376
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,010
What are you talking about?

377
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,940
I want you out of here
by the end of the week.

378
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,770
And if I don't get those
last two months of back rent,

379
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,720
I am going to sue!

380
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,350
What? Two months back rent?

381
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,500
That's right. Two months!

382
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,150
- But...
- Stop. Hold up.

383
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,260
You make me sound like a crazy person,

384
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,320
and you get to be all innocent.

385
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,170
I am innocent! And you were very angry.

386
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,100
Oh, so it's me then? I'm
the worst part of your week?

387
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,190
No. It gets worse.

388
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,970
Keep going.

389
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, sweet Betty! Don't scare me like that.

390
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,880
Good thing I just took a leak, or this 
could have gotten really ugly.

391
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,780
You moved out of my apartment two months ago,
and you haven't paid any rent since?

392
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,030
Help. I'm scared.

393
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,680
You should be. Amanda, I can't afford 
to pay two months of back rent.

394
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,100
Okay, I told you about that. It is not my 
fault that you're deaf or whatever...

395
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,470
Stop talking! You are going to fix this...

396
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,310
Find the money, talk to Mr. Z., 
do whatever you have to do,

397
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,700
but this is your problem, not mine.

398
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,240
Marc, why didn't you tell me 
that you moved out of my apartment?

399
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,200
God, who can remember? 
That was months ago.

400
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,090
A hundred words on Wilhelmina's 
desk by the end of the day.

401
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,100
No! What is that?

402
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,500
Something for the hair...I think.

403
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,970
It's fine, I guess. I'm doing my own 
thing now, and I'm very proud of it.

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,830
Oh! Another hit. I have my own blog.

405
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,270
Aw! Welcome to six years ago.

406
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,780
That was uncalled for. 
Aw! Welcome to two years ago.

407
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,880
Thank you.

408
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,030
Hey, quitter.

409
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,000
Pansy.

410
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,310
I got three hits, and one of 
them said, you inspired me.

411
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,150
Congratulations. I saw that.

412
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,620
Wait. Was that you?

413
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,510
It was, and actually, that's why 
I'm here. You have a minute?

414
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,230
Sure.

415
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,890
I'm starving. I'll be back in ten.

416
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,420
But these ladies from Neiman's 
are here to see you.

417
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,490
Really?

418
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,980
So, uh, I thought our meeting was tomorrow,

419
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,820
but clearly it's not because you're here today,
looking so lovely, I might add.

420
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,070
Uh, I think you remember where my office
 is...just down the hall to the right.

421
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,290
I'll be there in a jiff. I promise. 
Thank you so much for coming.

422
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,390
Where the hell is Marc?

423
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,630
He just left with Willie.

424
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,110
Oh, of course he did.

425
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,100
Ever since we've been sharing him, 
he's been a total screwup.

426
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,950
You know, he's been getting 
my appointments wrong.

427
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,480
He forgets my lunch every other day.

428
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,280
He actually sent me to the wrong bar 
last night. Can you believe that?

429
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,130
And the guys from Dsquared had to 
come meet me. I looked like a total ass.

430
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,470
Okay, no offense, but 
this is totally your fault.

431
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,080
Marc's a genius, and you're not the 
best communicator in the world.

432
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,330
See, I knew what you meant just then, 
but we've had sex, so it's definitely you.

433
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,560
And Willie would kill to have Marc back.

434
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,310
Oh, my...that's it. That little...

435
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
That's exactly what he's doing!

436
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,350
Okay, that right there...I have 
no idea what you just said.

437
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,000
So guess what? You remember when I said my 
friend told me Ace of Base was playing Tuesday,

438
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,220
and you said, it's Wednesday, dumb-ass?

439
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,830
I don't think I said dumb-ass, but...

440
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,200
Well, I was wrong.

441
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,960
They're playing today!

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,340
Bobby! Oh!

443
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,090
It might take you a few tries, Talercio,

444
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,020
but when you come through, you really come through.

445
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,700
That's right. Plus, we're having 
ourselves a little sidewalk picnic...

446
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,710
Like we used to, except instead of candy 
bars and beer, we're gonna have actual food.

447
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,230
And prenatal vitamins.

448
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,600
Oh, my God. You think of everything.

449
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,400
****

450
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,100
Hi, honey. What's up?

451
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,870
It's Justin.

452
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,270
Oh, no.

453
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,860
Are you all right?

454
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,680
All right. Just give me...

455
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,150
No, Justin, it's fine. 
I'm not that far. All right?

456
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Justin, don't worry.

457
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,670
Okay. I love you.

458
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,040
Okay, bye.

459
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,950
He's sick.

460
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,000
No. How sick?

461
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,310
Sick enough that I gotta go.

462
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,480
But I want you to stay. This was the best idea.

463
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,760
Unh-unh. I can't stay. Come on. 
This is...this is Hilda week.

464
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,160
So what? You just have fun and come 
over tomorrow. You tell me all about it.

465
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,930
So sweet. Thank you. Have a 
good time. Stay. Have fun.

466
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,790
So after hearing Lee's amazing stories about Botswana,

467
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,120
I dropped by the mission offices 
to drop off another check.

468
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,860
Really? I love that.

469
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,000
God, Betty, what these people do.

470
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,040
Here, I...I've gotta show you this. Look at this map.

471
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay, here is the village, and 
this is how far away the river is.

472
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,650
Now they have a pump in their village because of us.

473
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,050
What?

474
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,910
Nothing, I just...I've never seen you like this...

475
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,260
so excited and...

476
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,300
I love that you're experiencing this.

477
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,460
Good. Me,too, 'cause, uh, that's 
what I wanted to talk to you about.

478
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,200
I spoke with Lee, and she said if I wanted, 
I could volunteer for the next tour.

479
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,570
For the what?

480
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
For...for a tour of what?

481
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,860
Of Africa?

482
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,160
Wait. Like, Africa Africa?

483
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah. Look...look, I know it sounds 
sudden, but I want to do this.

484
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,450
I want to leave with them next week.

485
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,350
Hello. I'm here to see Connor Owens.

486
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,680
I'd like a table in the corner away 
from everyone else, please.

487
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,940
It's funny how it only takes 20 bucks

488
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,230
and five minutes on the computer to get 
reordained to marry you and Connor,

489
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
yet it's completely illegal for me to 
marry a man myself.

490
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,720
Are you gonna bring that up 
every time I get married?

491
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,260
Excuse me. What's his name again?

492
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,700
Connor Owens.

493
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,100
It says here he's been transferred.

494
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,830
What? What are you talking 
about? Transferred where?

495
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,520
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

496
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,150
But he's definitely no longer at this prison.

497
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,650
This is not possible. Connor 
Owens has not been transferred.

498
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,400
You go get him and tell him Wilhelmina 
Slater is here now for him. Go get him!

499
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,550
Ma'am, he's gone. But there is an 
envelope for Wilhelmina Slater here.

500
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,420
I don't want an envelope! I want him!

501
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,010
We're supposed to be getting 
married today, you fool!

502
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,720
Don't you think he would have told 
me if he was being transferred?!

503
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Connor! Connor!

504
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,100
You're gonna have to calm her down, or we will.

505
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,930
- Willie, maybe you should.... 
- No!

506
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,000
Did he do this? Did he make this happen?

507
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
He did, didn't he?

508
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,770
Answer me.

509
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,630
Willie...

510
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,760
Don't look at me like that.

511
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,010
Six months? Why do you have 
to go for a whole six months?

512
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,270
Well, they want you to commit to at least 
that long so that they know you're serious.

513
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,160
Wait. At least that long?
Matt, this is a big move.

514
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,280
Betty...

515
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,640
look, you said that I needed to find 
meaning in my life, and you were right.

516
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,000
And I've wasted so much time asking myself, 
what do I need? What do I want?

517
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:54,100
But your story got me to ask a different 
question, like what do other people need?

518
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,830
What is this gonna mean for us?

519
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,960
Would it have to change anything?

520
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,280
How could it not?

521
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,720
Matt, you're gonna be living on the other 
side of the world for a long time.

522
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,890
And I thought that you would be happy for me.

523
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,160
Look, I feel like there's some perfect thing 
I'm supposed to say right now, and, uh...

524
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,830
It's...this is big, and it's sudden,

525
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,130
and...I don't know. I have to 
wash my hair for Wilhelmina.

526
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,960
Look, I...I gotta...I have to go.

527
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,310
Betty, look, you said you wanted 
to inspire one person, and you did.

528
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,400
Africa? Matt can't survive in Africa.

529
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,800
It's crazy, right?

530
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,200
Living in a house made of sticks, 
looking for a place to plug in his blow-dryer.

531
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,790
Please. Getting his hair all tall like that...
that takes a blowout. I know.

532
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,820
It's just so Matt, you know?
It's like, one minute he's a lawyer.

533
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,430
The next, he's an artist. 
The next, he's African.

534
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,320
And I'm just supposed to 
go along with all of it,

535
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,810
like I don't mind being another 
temporary thing in his life

536
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,630
that he will eventually move on from?

537
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,400
I mean, he should be 
considering me in this, right?

538
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,270
Hey, I don't like to get all up in your 
business, but, yes, he should.

539
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,710
Thank you. But I'm not allowed to say that.

540
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,290
No, because then I sound like a selfish 
monster telling the person I love,

541
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,210
no, Matt, you can't go to Africa to help people.

542
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,520
Hey. You sound however you want.

543
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,910
Who's that?

544
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,200
Papi's supposed to be at work.

545
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,720
Ah, they crack me up.

546
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,930
Bobby, what are you doing here? 
When did you get here?

547
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,320
I got here about five minutes ago.

548
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,880
I brought this one some of my uncle 
Hugo's special fever soup.

549
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,300
It's guaranteed to work.

550
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,550
It's hideous.

551
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,500
The ingredients are chicken broth, evil and dirt.

552
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,340
Hey, you, just drink it. You'll be up and 
dancin' by tomorrow morning.

553
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,310
I swear on Madonna's cheeks.

554
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,510
Hey, I told you it's Hilda week.

555
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,230
Upstairs. Go. Read a book, 
take a bath, whatever you want.

556
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,830
I got this.

557
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,050
Aah! That's it!

558
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,880
Excuse me, Wilhelmina.

559
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,930
I'm sorry to barge in, but 
I would like a second of your time.

560
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,230
I need to ask you to 
please stop torturing me.

561
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,420
My foot hurts. My armpits hurt. 
And now my scalp is burning!

562
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,360
All because I wanted to write something 
that maybe could make the world a little bit better.

563
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,720
So that's it. 
That's...that's what I wanted to say.

564
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,350
Today was supposed to be my wedding day...

565
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,440
to Connor.

566
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,200
But he made himself disappear, 
with money or connections or I don't...I don't know.

567
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,497
And the worst part is, 
he thinks he's saving me.

568
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,800
So I can live my life.

569
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,950
I know how to chase people who've wronged me,

570
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,460
but I don't know how to chase 
people who say they love me...

571
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,110
and then do this.

572
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,760
Well, obviously he loves you.

573
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,550
That couldn't have been easy for him.

574
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,930
He thinks this is love?

575
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,750
If he loved me, he'd do what I want...

576
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,110
Not this.

577
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,700
Please go.

578
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,920
Thanks for coming.

579
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,420
Of course. I wanted to talk to you, too.

580
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,800
I feel bad about dumping all that on you before.

581
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,610
Yeah, I...totally freaked out.

582
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,240
Yeah, of course you did. And I've been 
thinking about it, and maybe you're right.

583
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,700
Maybe, for our sake, I should stay in New York.

584
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,640
Maybe I could do some good here, 
and maybe I was just getting way...

585
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,200
Wait. Whoa, whoa, Matt.

586
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,120
Stop. That's a lot of maybes.

587
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,680
I...I didn't mean it that way.

588
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,600
You have to go. You have to do this.

589
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,770
Are you serious?

590
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,930
Very.

591
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,450
You're sure about this?

592
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,260
If you are.

593
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,040
I am.

594
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,880
But the one thing you cannot do 
is doubt how I feel about you.

595
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,720
Betty, you changed my life.

596
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:04,380
And that lasts forever, no matter 
where we may stand in the world.

597
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,800
Well...now I have something to write about...

598
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,950
good-byes.

599
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,270
Coffee!

600
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,480
Coffee? Marc, I asked you to get my dinner.

601
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,330
Oh, darn it. I knew I forgot something.

602
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,330
Okay, Marc, you know what? 
I understand why you're making all these mistakes.

603
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:41,800
You want me to fire you so you can
go back to working for Wilhelmina.

604
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,630
If that's what you want to do, 
you should just do it.

605
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,700
Get on that scale.

606
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,180
Since when do I have a scale in my office?

607
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,650
Since you have me in here. Hop on.

608
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,650
I've lost 8 pounds.

609
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,470
Yes, because I messed up your lunches 
and forgot to book your cars...

610
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,770
so you'd stop eating like a lonely girl 
and actually use those legs a little bit.

611
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,170
And look here...one, two, three.

612
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,930
That's how many times you were photographed this week.

613
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,290
Let me ask you something...how many 
times were you photographed last month?

614
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,470
Once?

615
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,930
Exactly. But this time, you 
were outside the Waverly,

616
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:20,700
where there is actually paparazzi, instead 
of the Farmhouse, where there is not.

617
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,880
And you were in this slimming jacket 
that looks great in black and white.

618
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,910
And furthermore, are you aware 
that you come off a little bit needy?

619
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,590
I d...I do? Really? Do I?

620
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,890
You do, which is why I let the boys 
from Dsquared go to the wrong bar,

621
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,900
because those queens should go 
to you. And P.S., it worked.

622
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,350
Dsquared, Michael Kors, Coach...they're all back.

623
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,440
So as you can see, in actuality, 
I did all this for you.

624
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,690
Unbelievable.

625
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,840
I...Why didn't you just come 
tell me about all this stuff?

626
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,900
Well, because...when I told you to 
shave your beard, you refused.

627
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,020
But lucky for me, now you have to 
shave it, 'cause there's gum in it.

628
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,370
There isn't gum in my beard.

629
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,250
What...what are you...

630
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,950
We can do this your way...or my way.

631
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,110
Coming.

632
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,320
Coming.

633
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,680
Here. It's not everything,

634
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
but I sold some of my hair to 
make up for the rent money.

635
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,520
But your hair looks the same.

636
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,760
Okay, I sold extensions...used ones. 
But I still want you to have the cash.

637
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,880
Look, Betty, I moved out right 
after Matt chose you over me.

638
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,620
I needed to start over, and I was too 
hurt and mad to talk to you about it.

639
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,190
It was so stupid.

640
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,290
Well...now we've both lost him.

641
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,010
He's moving away for a while.

642
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,790
Don't smile.

643
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,210
- I'm not.
- You're totally smiling.

644
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,710
So what are you gonna do?

645
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,000
I guess I'm starting over, too.

646
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,650
Well, I heard about an open apartment,

647
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,390
and it's close to me, which I wouldn't totally hate.

648
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,440
It's Betty. Can we talk?

649
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,700
Oh, that is a rough week.

650
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,140
I told you.

651
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,940
So what do you say?

652
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,460
Can we figure something out?

653
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,400
Maybe you could raise my rent a little?

654
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,830
I could pay you back over time.

655
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,780
What if I, uh, raise Amanda's rent 
and make her pay me back?

656
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,250
Yeah. That could work.

657
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,780
Did you ever write that piece 
on, um, good-byes?

658
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,150
Just the first paragraph. Why?

659
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,030
Uh, my old lady left me six months ago.

660
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,450
She said I let myself go.

661
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,400
Point is, I get it. I know 
what it means to have to...

662
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,930
start over...

663
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,500
and everything.

664
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:38,300
You read me that paragraph, 
and I'll let you move back in.

665
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,400
- Really?
- Really.

666
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,690
Sure, I can do that.

667
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,640
You got it there?

668
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,740
Right here.

669
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,390
It's just a rough draft though.

670
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,860
I won't judge.

671
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,860
I've had to say good-bye more 
times than I would have liked.

672
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,580
But everyone can say that.

673
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,880
And no matter how many times we do it,

674
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,510
even when it's for the greater 
good, it always stinks.

675
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,640
You think she bought it?

676
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,990
I'll have my guy make the deposit today.

677
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,200
* But less than forget *

678
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,920
* But spirits born *

679
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,150
* From the not happened yet *

680
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,140
* Gathering there *

681
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,600
* To pay off a debt brought back from the wars *

682
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,870
* We thought we lost you *

683
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,520
* We thought we lost you *

684
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,140
And though we'll never forget what we've given up,

685
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,110
we owe it to ourselves to keep moving forward.

686
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,520
We on tomorrow for more Hilda time?

687
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,990
Uh, no, I...I don't...

688
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,600
I don't need more Hilda time.

689
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,730
You're right. I was...I was 
freaking out 'cause I thought,

690
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,690
how am I gonna do this whole raising a 
kid thing by myself all over again?

691
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,830
But now I realize that I don't 
have to, 'cause I have you.

692
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,890
What makes you think 
I'm gonna stick around?

693
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,640
You.

694
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,870
You make me think it.

695
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,450
I guess I must have done something right.

696
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,420
What we can't do is live our lives 
always afraid of the next good-bye,

697
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,620
because chances are they're not going to stop.

698
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,110
I need some inspiration, too, you know.

699
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,660
* I know you want to run far away from one more *

700
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,430
* And that it's comin' at a bad time *

701
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,740
* Some cold place heartless ways *

702
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,150
* For all we know *

703
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,350
* I know you need to breathe through come back come too *

704
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,960
* But it's comin' at a bad time *

705
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,120
* Somewhat hard tangled day *

The trick is to recognize when a
good-bye can be a good thing.
