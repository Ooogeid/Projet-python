1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,645
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:01,655 --> 00:00:04,266
- Hello?
- Hi, Daniel. It's Betty.

3
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:05,930
Look, I need to talk
to you about Sofia.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,780
Perfect timing.
I just proposed.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,150
- Christina, it was all a lie!
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:13,465
Sofia set him up from the beginning.
She used Daniel to get her cover story.

7
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:16,830
"From fling to
ring in 60 days."

8
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,966
But thank you for being
such a good sport.

9
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:24,560
I fully intend to take over the
company sooner rather than later.

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,440
You manipulated me and you
lied to my face about Daniel.

11
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:28,479
I quit.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,840
Where's Daniel?

13
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:31,278
He disappeared.

14
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:40,182
Look, mija, I know you're upset
about leaving that big New York job,

15
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:42,401
but you have to eat something.

16
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:46,592
I never should have taken that
stupid position at Sofia's magazine.

17
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:48,292
I should've just
stayed at "Mode."

18
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,700
Yeah, aunt Betty.

19
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,883
I miss the swag.

20
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:58,512
Okay. Is there a sign on my
forehead that says, "crap here"?

21
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:00,963
What's the matter with you?

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,032
There's been an
Herbalux recall.

23
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:06,300
They're pulling all the products just
'cause some housewives in Secaucus

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,590
lost all their hair.

25
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:10,033
Why don't they just change what
they put in their shampoo?

26
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,712
They were using the hand cream.

27
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,882
The F.D.A.
is recalling the whole line.

28
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:16,572
I don't have a job anymore!

29
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:17,661
Are you serious?

30
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,541
Maybe Oprah can adopt us.

31
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:21,861
Wait a minute.
I used that hand cream.

32
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,472
Ay, what am I gonna do?
I have bills, car payments...

33
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,931
These nails--
they don't just happen.

34
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,443
I know how you feel.

35
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:32,222
- When I left "Mode"--
- Ay, Betty! Please.

36
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,100
Enough with the
"when I left 'Mode'"!

37
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,163
Okay? This is
totally different.

38
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:37,663
Herbalux was all I had.

39
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:40,003
You--you already
have another job.

40
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,931
Betty, that 4-top wants chips.

41
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,232
Now.

42
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,770
You're right.

43
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,253
Sometimes I forget
how lucky I am.

44
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,120
I've got e-mails,
voice mails, phone records

45
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,251
and the location of
the wrecked car--

46
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:05,293
everything you'd need to put Bradford
away for Fey Sommers' death.

47
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,271
$1 million.

48
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,922
Do I look like
I'm made of money?

49
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:12,771
Frankly, lady,
I don't know what you look like,

50
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:16,201
but that figure's nonnegotiable.
Oh, and you got 24 hours.

51
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:21,163
Leaves a bit of a stench,
doesn't he?

52
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,963
He still has what
we've been looking for.

53
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:27,990
You do realize that once
I hand over the money,

54
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:31,230
we need to be ready for
an immediate takeover.

55
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:34,991
You could be editor in chief
of "Mode" as soon as monday.

56
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:39,190
If there's anybody at that
magazine you can't trust,

57
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,780
it's time to fumigate.

58
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,100
I only used it once,

59
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,860
and I woke up
looking like this!

60
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,981
I'm getting married
on saturday.

61
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,880
Hey, he's still marrying
you with that nose.

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,171
Bald ain't gonna make that
much of a difference.

63
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,143
I don't think you need
another one of these.

64
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:05,050
I'm done. I'm done.
Let's just go home.

65
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,053
Can you help me fake a résumé?

66
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,563
Well, I would, but I was
planning on going into the city.

67
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,070
Daniel's coming home from Rio tomorrow,
and I thought the least I could do

68
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,381
was stock his fridge and
pick up his dry cleaning.

69
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,160
Why? You're not his
assistant anymore.

70
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,620
I know. I just...

71
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,483
none of this would've
happened if it wasn't for me.

72
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,662
I'm the one who pushed
him to propose to Sofia.

73
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:24,913
I just wanna make coming home
a little easier for him.

74
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:28,702
Betty, you're such
a good person.

75
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:32,263
You have a chip in your hair.

76
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:40,372
Mm, thank you. Very nice.

77
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,252
Very nice. Very nice.

78
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,691
Oy, Scotty!

79
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:49,690
What are you doing,
you paisley-wearing worm?

80
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,353
Yearbook committee.

81
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,213
Robyn in styles?

82
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:55,092
Oh, she's got a good
eye for vintage.

83
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,051
I need her for the layouts.
She stays.

84
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,020
By the way,
when you move into Daniel's office,

85
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:03,001
I am not sitting in
Betty's old chair.

86
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,420
This bum don't slum.

87
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:07,922
That's not what heard.

88
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,380
- Next.
- Christina.

89
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,720
I will need a
talented seamstress.

90
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:13,933
Her work is impeccable.

91
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,612
But I can't understand
a word she's saying.

92
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:18,401
'Ave a crumpet, guv'nor.
So annoying.

93
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,970
But then again,
she's the only one on the planet

94
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,830
who knows my real measurements.

95
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,560
So...

96
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:26,783
Question mark.

97
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,641
And next...

98
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:34,500
- Auf wiedersehen, Amanda.
- Of course. Unless...

99
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:37,662
She's Daniel's girl.
What has she ever done for me?

100
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,141
She leaves when he leaves.

101
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,363
Right, but she could...

102
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,060
You're gonna miss your little beard.
How cute.

103
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,783
No. Next.

104
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:49,860
Willie...

105
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:52,753
Daniel broke her heart.
She's not loyal to him.

106
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:56,150
She's just working
her way up the ladder.

107
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,082
But until she proves
her loyalty to me,

108
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,643
she's out.

109
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,580
And speaking of disasters,

110
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,620
it's time for our
daily dose of Daniel.

111
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,960
Still no sign of recently
dumped playboy Daniel Meade.

112
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,993
Rumor has it he's in Brazil,
licking his wounds...

113
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,890
and anything else
that walks by.

114
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:26,672
Meanwhile his ex Sofia
Reyes was seen saunt--

115
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,590
God, what died in here?

116
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:37,850
Daniel!

117
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,841
Hey.

118
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:43,642
So... how's Rio?

119
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,351
Uh, it's bueno.

122
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,801
I can't believe you
never went to Rio.

123
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,512
You sent me a postcard,
like, every other day.

124
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,543
"Weather's beautiful.
I'm doing great.

125
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,170
Hey, gotta go.
It's lambada time."

126
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,521
What did you want me to write--
"I'm hiding underneathy bed,

127
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:14,080
curled up in the fetal position.
Wish you were here"?

128
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:17,022
Ugh, Daniel, please.
Nobody cares what happened.

129
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,952
Look, I know you're 
in pain, okay?

130
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,751
But you can't hide from
the world forever.

131
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:27,111
Next week is fashion week,
and the magazine needs you.

132
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,272
Look at you.

133
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:33,790
What?

134
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,771
"Fashion week."

135
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:41,132
Five months ago, you thought
Cavalli was a kind of pasta.

136
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,621
Yeah, so did you.

137
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:48,471
We've both come
a long way, huh?

138
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:53,711
How are things at "M.Y.W."?

139
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,522
You learning a lot from...

140
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:57,841
her?

141
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:59,242
Yeah, well,

142
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,911
I couldn't work for her

143
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,520
after what she
did to you, so...

144
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,759
- I quit.
- You did?

145
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,830
Well, would it be really childish
of me to high-five you right now?

146
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:13,988
Yeah.

147
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,360
You know, Betty,
when I go back to "Mode," maybe...

148
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:23,001
I don't know--
maybe you could come back with me?

149
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,611
Are you serious?

150
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,632
Wait, but you already
have an assistant.

151
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:31,123
No, you let me handle Amanda.
I'm still the editor in chief.

152
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:33,013
I can have two assistants.

153
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,901
Right?

154
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,062
You're really into this high five
thing, aren't you?

155
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,283
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

156
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:48,432
Good morning.

157
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:52,162
- Ooh, your famous cupcakes.
- They're for my teacher.

158
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:55,293
Kid's getting a "D" in math.
Time to kiss butt.

159
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,640
Thank you.

160
00:08:57,655 --> 00:09:00,042
Mom! Are you driving me,
or what?

161
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:03,280
Okay, I got four different
interviews today. Which one?

162
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,513
I think I'm taking the bus.

163
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,063
Fine. Bye.

164
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,221
Okay, you guys.
What do you think?

165
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:14,390
Well, they're both very nice.

166
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,741
Sweetheart, you have
intelligence, ambition.

167
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,673
You don't need to
resort to this.

168
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,370
Look at my résumé.

169
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,551
- The purple one.
- Thank you.

170
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:30,831
Hey! Father in the room.
Father in the room.

171
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,520
Hey, have they filled that
position at Burrito King yet?

172
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:37,000
Hilda, trust me. You are way
too good to be the Chip Chick.

173
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,521
I bet you're excited to
go back to "Mode," huh?

174
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,740
Yes!

175
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:45,341
I missed it so much--
the excitement, the people.

176
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, some of the people.

177
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,922
A few of the people.

178
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,911
Okay--Christina.

179
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:56,330
And that Henry guy?

180
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:59,461
Yeah, we haven't even spoken
since the Christmas party.

181
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,792
It's probably for the best.

182
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,552
I bet you he's one of
those Wall Street types--

183
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,981
$100 haircuts,
dating 10 girls at once.

184
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,523
No. That's not Henry.

185
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,540
But Walter--aw.

186
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,891
Now he's a guy you
could settle down with.

187
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:14,811
So how did I know if I'm settling down,
or if I'm just settling?

188
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,421
Hilda...

189
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,592
Nipple.

190
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,103
I know.

191
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,010
I'm so sorry.

192
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:49,251
Okay, boss. Ready to...

193
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:51,053
Oh, no.

194
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,463
I don't think I can do this.

195
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:57,402
I mean,
what if I run into her at work?

196
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,320
We're in the same
building, Betty.

197
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,433
So you run into her,
and it sucks, and it's weird,

198
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:03,290
and you keep going,
and I'll be there if you need me.

199
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,290
Come on.

200
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,332
Now can we discuss
this cheeto tan?

201
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,221
What? I was supposed to
be in Rio for two weeks.

202
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,822
You look like an Oompa Loompa.

203
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,643
Okay, what floor are we on now?

204
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,610
Uh, 3rd. Only 25 to go.

205
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,731
Daniel, come on. This is crazy!

206
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,122
You're not gonna run into
Sofia on the elevator.

207
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,521
This isn't about Sofia.
It's about getting your heart pumping.

208
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:25,873
You can do it.

209
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:31,443
Just go. Save yourself.

210
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:38,062
You do know he's
coming back, right?

211
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:41,143
It's been two weeks,
and nothing.

212
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:43,723
If there's gonna be a new
issue on the stand next month,

213
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,433
someone's gotta be editor
in chief around here.

214
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,190
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

215
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,403
Ca-caw.

216
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,033
What are you squawking about?

217
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,832
It's our secret bird code.

218
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,790
What secret bird code?

219
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,823
Oh, wait.
I'm doing that with someone else.

220
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,252
Daniel's back!

221
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,991
- What?!
- What?!

222
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,391
Hey, everyone.

223
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:13,951
- Daniel!
- Daniel! - Daniel!

224
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:18,032
You look good!
It's been forever, huh?

225
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,301
- Wow, I can't believe it!
- I can't believe it's been so long.

226
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:24,470
Uh, fabulous tan!

227
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,272
Did you get something done?

228
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,751
What'd you bring us
back from Brazil?

229
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,350
Surprise!

230
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,743
We should hit it with a bat,
see if candy falls out.

231
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:42,302
So basically,
I'll just have two assistants now.

232
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,042
But I'm in charge, right?

233
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,611
It's more of a
partnership, really.

234
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,993
Exactly...

235
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,250
I'm in charge.

236
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:52,183
When one of you is busy, the other
one can just pick up the slack.

237
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,340
It'll be great.

238
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,002
Totally get it.

239
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:57,550
In charge.

240
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,852
So do you wanna go
over your messages?

241
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,982
Uh, sure. Five minutes?

242
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,202
Actually, I'd love a
coffee and a bagel.

243
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,412
Thanks a whole bunch.

244
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,833
He'd love a coffee and a bagel.
Thanks a whole bunch.

245
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:14,182
Well, if anything does open up,
I'm always available.

246
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,152
Okay, well, keep me in mind.
I'm a very fast learner and a--

247
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,321
The position's
already been filled?

248
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,733
In two hours.

249
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:23,050
Everyone wants to
be Chip Chick.

250
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:41,061
Yeah, Ms. Suarez... we looked at
your résumé, and unfortunately--

251
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:45,420
Hi, Hilda. This is Mrs.
Simmons from P.S. 350.

252
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,012
Thank you again
for those cupcakes.

253
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,942
Tell your father
they're amazing.

254
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,001
I'd pay money for them.

255
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,102
So I've sorted your mail
according to three categories--

256
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,581
people who are
kissing your ass,

257
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,291
people whose asses
you should be kissing

258
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,050
and people whose asses are,
like, huge.

259
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:11,883
Oh, and here are
your periodicals...

260
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,113
Oh! Uh, no. Not this one.

261
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:16,601
Uh, not this one either.

262
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:21,570
Uh... I'm gonna go
fire the mail room.

263
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:33,332
One onion bagel, slightly toasted,
light cream cheese.

264
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,810
I don't know if you know this,
but the space underneath your desk

265
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,263
is very good for hiding
in the fetal position.

266
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,402
I can stand guard if
you wanna give it a try.

267
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,121
I'm--I'm fine, Betty. Really.

268
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:52,953
Okay, then. There is a swimsuit
casting session at 10:00.

269
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm assuming you wanna go.

270
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,751
Wilhelmina can take that.

271
00:14:56,766 --> 00:15:00,320
What? Daniel, no.
You love casting sessions.

272
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:01,730
Hotties...

273
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,460
Big boobs.

274
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,121
Please don't ever
say "boobs" again.

275
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,831
I've just--I've been
gone for a few weeks.

276
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:12,003
I--you know, got a lot to catch up on.
I'm fine, really.

277
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:14,901
Okay, but eat something...

278
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,011
please.

279
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:28,830
God, he's in so much pain.

280
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,282
Oh, he's fine.

281
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,920
No, he's not.

282
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:34,521
He turned down going
to a modeling session.

283
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,010
We gotta get him
back on the horse.

284
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:41,340
Trust me. He spent the last two
weeks riding every horse in Rio.

285
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,943
I'm talking about building
up his confidence again.

286
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:47,050
He doesn't have a
confidence problem.

287
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,471
Well, there was this one time,
but he was really drunk--

288
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:50,671
Okay, stop.

289
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,433
8:00 p.m. tonight--
put it on his schedule.

290
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,641
I'm gonna get Daniel
a new horse to ride.

291
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,090
That didn't sound as
dirty in my head.

292
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,931
Ooh, somebody like Jennifer
Aniston would be amazing.

293
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:14,203
Betty, fixing up Daniel is not part
of your job description, is it?

294
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:17,063
I know, I know.
I just feel so guilty.

295
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,382
What about Tara Reid?

296
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:21,480
Lovely-- dinner with Tara Reid,
breakfast at the free clinic.

297
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:22,693
Mm. You're right.

298
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,882
Oh! Gisele--I wish I
could make that happen.

299
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,773
Gisele would make Daniel
forget about Sofia.

300
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:28,951
So do it.

301
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,682
What do you mean, "so do it"?

302
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:33,080
It's Gisele. It's not like we
go to the same laundromat.

303
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:35,630
Don't be such a numpty.
You phone her representative

304
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,823
and you arrange a dinner date.

305
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,542
Celebrities do that?

306
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:42,330
Where do you think Tom and
Katie hooked up? Church?

307
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:44,412
Hey, that's beautiful.
Who made that?

308
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:46,333
Little magic sewing mice.

309
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:48,091
They're very good.
Now go on. Run along.

310
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,020
Go and fix up your date,
you wee pimp.

311
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:53,390
No... this is one of your designs,
isn't it?

312
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:55,061
It's gorgeous.

313
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,553
Do you think?

314
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,180
I'm submitting it for the
"Mode" show at fashion week--

315
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,913
"Ten designers to watch."

316
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:02,610
Oh, my god!
You're totally gonna get in.

317
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,592
It's gonna be the beginning
of your huge career.

318
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,270
Betty, settle.

319
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,660
I enter it every year.

320
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,173
There's thousands
of applicants,

321
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,352
and the one who
picks who gets in--

322
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:12,861
Wilhelmina.

323
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,191
Well, she'll die eventually.

324
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,753
No, she won't.

325
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:27,833
Papi! You are never gonna
believe what happened.

326
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,503
- You got a job?
- Better.

327
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,653
I got my own company--

328
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,040
"Grandma Suarez's cupcakes."

329
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,202
- What?
- Yeah!

330
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,582
I took some of your cupcakes
to the Roosevelt diner.

331
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,571
They flipped for them.
They wanna sell them there.

332
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,230
- My cupcakes?
- Yeah.

333
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:46,032
They need a hundred of them
by 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.

334
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:49,082
This could launch me in
a whole new direction.

335
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:53,060
I could be the
latina Mrs. Fields.

336
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,901
Come on, you've got work to do!

337
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,803
But grandma Suarez was
gonna watch his stories.

338
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,652
What's this?

339
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,003
It's your desk.

340
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,841
Ooh, it matches your muumuu.

341
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:07,980
Don't you just love?

342
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:10,583
- It has wheels.
- I know.

343
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:13,512
You can sell pretzels from
it during your break.

344
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,421
Hi.

345
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:21,520
I understand Daniel's back.

346
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:25,962
Yes, uh, Mr. Meade.
He is in his office.

347
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:27,423
Thanks.

348
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,410
Thank you, sir.

349
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,100
How was Brazil?

350
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:39,200
Good, yeah.
Just got a little too much tun.

351
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,983
Nice of you to come
back for fashion week,

352
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,570
since you are editor in
chief of a fashion magazine.

353
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:44,870
Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

354
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:45,982
You better not.

355
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,043
After all your bad
press recently,

356
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,553
you need to be out there
in a positive light.

357
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:54,770
And next time you think about
disappearing for two weeks,

358
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,710
maybe you could give
your mother a call.

359
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,642
Let her know you're not dead.

360
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,873
She's lost one son already.

361
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,682
Wow, so it's that easy.

362
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:09,653
Gisele looked at Daniel résumé
and she'll go out with him.

363
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,261
She's gonna do it.

364
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,471
Okay. So, um,
Daniel will meet her at 8:00

365
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,350
at the front street café
in Brooklyn Heights.

366
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,673
Great.

367
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,181
That stumpy troll is totally
trying to upstage me.

368
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,522
She set Daniel up
with a supermodel.

369
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:27,982
Well, stop her.

370
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,492
Wheel her little cart
right out the window.

371
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,421
And while you're at it,
push Daniel out, too.

372
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,192
Why would I do that?

373
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:41,310
'Cause it'll prove your
loyalty to Wilhelmina.

374
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,751
Oops. Did I say that
out loud? Good.

375
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,493
What?

376
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,531
Come here.

377
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,631
Oh, my god.

378
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,033
My hair looks terrible.

379
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,552
What is this?

380
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,421
In the next few days, something
big is going to happen at "Mode,"

381
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:13,830
and when it does,
Wilhelmina's going to be in charge.

382
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,600
And when she is,

383
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,550
these are the people
who are staying...

384
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,403
and these are the people
who get the Jimmy Choo.

385
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,221
- The what?
- The boot.

386
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:22,123
- What?
- Gone.

387
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,860
- Huh?
- Later skater.

388
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:25,871
I'm on the out list.

389
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:27,630
I've never been out.

390
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:31,251
That's what I'm saying. You have to
screw over Daniel in order to stay.

391
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,962
I can't do that.
Daniel gave me this opportunity.

392
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:35,942
This could be a real
stepping-stone for me.

393
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,102
It'll be stepping-stone
to the unemployment line!

394
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:41,021
You have to prove your
loyalty to the queen.

395
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:42,213
You?

396
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,020
Wilhelmina.

397
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,372
Gisele?

398
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:52,713
And--and me?

399
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,883
Just think--if you become a big power
couple, they'll call you "Gis-aniel."

400
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,523
But I don't wanna be
set up with anyone.

401
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,812
I'm--I'm--I'm not
there yet, Betty.

402
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,881
Daniel, I am just trying
to help you move forward.

403
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:04,431
A nice date will remind
you what a catch you are.

404
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:08,460
I don't have any
small talk left in me.

405
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,932
Okay, just picture it--
you and Gisele at a table by the window.

406
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:13,982
Someone tips off the paparazzi.

407
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,400
They show up,
take a few pictures...

408
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,951
Aren't there enough
pictures of me already?

409
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:22,521
No, not of the new you--
the--the confident Daniel Meade,

410
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:25,401
thriving on the arm
of a supermodel.

411
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,792
And who knows?

412
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:31,033
Maybe even Sofia will see them.

413
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,751
Well, I guess I do have to eat.

414
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:38,640
Yes! Okay!
Let's get you a new shirt,

415
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,760
'cause you're a little
orange around the collar.

416
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,441
If you need us,
we're in the closet.

417
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:47,881
Great.

418
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:54,472
Can you believe it?
He's asking Betty for dating advice.

419
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:56,782
That's like asking Britney
Spears for parenting tips.

420
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,080
Oh, I love her.

421
00:21:58,278 --> 00:21:59,710
Back to you.

422
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,051
He will always
take Betty's word

423
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,122
over yours.

424
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,481
Right.

425
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:14,980
You wanna know
what team I'm on?

426
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:17,452
I'm on the team that's staying.

427
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,460
Yes.

428
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,050
It's totally ringing.

429
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:26,570
Hi. This is Betty from
Daniel Meade's office.

430
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:29,972
I'm so sorry for the late notice,
but could you please let Gisele know

431
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:33,282
that Daniel won't be able to
make it tonight? That's right.

432
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,542
Okay. We'll call back to reschedule.
Thanks. Bye.

433
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,771
The bitch is back.

434
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,990
Wait till Wilhelmina sees the
pictures in "Page Six" tomorrow--

435
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:45,270
Daniel Meade stood up in
front of the entire world.

436
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:54,642
Right this way, sir.

437
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,372
Here's your table.

438
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:57,933
Thank you.

439
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:02,773
Sir, did you want me
to get rid of them?

440
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:06,071
Uh, no, it's--it's fine.
My date'll be here any minute.

441
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:10,511
It's, uh, it's Gisele.

442
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,453
Model.

443
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:16,401
Supermodel.

444
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,642
Come on, Mrs. Lee. We gotta
"Wang Chung, party party" tonight.

445
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:33,700
One more batch,
we let you go home.

446
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:36,333
Ay, papi! It's not a Picasso.
It's a cupcake.

447
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,953
Let's move it!

448
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh, my god.
I once had a dream like this.

449
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:43,702
Stop talking. Pick up a spoon.

450
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:46,361
Mom, I can't do this anymore.

451
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,241
My hand hurts,
and I have homework.

452
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:51,533
Okay, look. You're--you're mixing flour,
milk and sugar.

453
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:52,741
It's chemistry!

454
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:54,640
Psst. Psst.

455
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:59,260
Help us. I had a shooting
pain in my arm an hour ago,

456
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:01,033
and she told me to walk it off.

457
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:02,300
What?

458
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,731
Hilda, what are you doing?

459
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:06,181
It's my new business.

460
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,310
I was tired of losing out on all
these crap jobs to college graduates,

461
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:12,050
so I'm selling dad's cupcakes!

462
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:15,721
It's Herbalux out,
and grandma Suarez in.

463
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:18,651
Okay, you know that you cannot run
a real business out of our kitchen.

464
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,512
You need permits,
you need insurance--

465
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,681
Hey, you're not the only one
who gets to dream big, Betty.

466
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,383
Why don't you try
supporting me?

467
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,831
You know,
I got a kid to take care of.

468
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:33,732
Now if you will excuse me,
I have to go motivate my staff.

469
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:43,942
Hey, Daniel.

470
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:46,123
What do you mean
she's not there?

471
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:48,890
Well, it's only 8:05.
She'll be there.

472
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:52,393
Okay, okay, okay. Calm down.
I'll make a call.

473
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,022
Sir...

474
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:03,462
do you mind if I take this?

475
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,253
Uh, yes, actually, I do.

476
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,523
She'll be coming any minute.

477
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,923
Gisele... the supermodel.

478
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:13,603
Daniel.

479
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:19,820
Does he know what
Gisele looks like?

480
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:22,181
Please tell me she's
standing right behind you.

481
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,753
She's not coming.

482
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,111
What? Why didn't you call me?

483
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,041
And have you walk
out of here alone?

484
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,291
In front of them?

485
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:30,261
Now just take this and smile.

486
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:32,273
Why?

487
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,471
Because they don't need to know
you've just been stood up.

488
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,730
As far as they know, you're having
a harmless business dinner

489
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,253
with your adorable, witty assistant
to discuss her much-deserved raise.

490
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,202
This is exciting.

491
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:46,671
Yeah.

492
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:48,791
Yeah.

493
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:50,411
Okay, yeah.

494
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:51,961
Oh, yeah.

495
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,283
Yeah. No, no.

496
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:56,882
Yes! Okay, yes.

497
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,232
Oh yeah. No, no.

498
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,521
Yes.

499
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:06,001
Do you wanna do the honors?

500
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,283
You did the right
thing, Amanda.

501
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:40,591
Did the paparazzi see us?

502
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:43,231
Did we lose them?
Did we lose the paparazzi?

503
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:45,442
I love saying "paparazzi."
I feel so famous.

504
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:47,901
Yeah, they're gone.
They think we're in the town car.

505
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,551
They're gonna follow it
right back into the city.

506
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,252
Decoy. Nice move.

507
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,231
Oh, there's only one problem.

508
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:53,950
What?

509
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,311
We don't have a town car now.

510
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,013
It's fine. We'll hail a cab.

511
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,421
We could walk.
I mean, it's a nice night.

512
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:04,850
Not exactly in any rush to get
back to an empty apartment.

513
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,792
Okay.

514
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,043
Cool.

515
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,333
So how'd you enjoy the dinner?

516
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:13,462
I thought it was good.
The snails were pretty good.

517
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:14,830
- You liked them?
- Yeah.

518
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,050
Here. Have mine.

519
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:18,263
Whoa.

520
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,430
You know what?

521
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm gonna buy you a slice.
Come on.

522
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:23,881
I could use a slice.

523
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:30,542
Did our smelly little friend
bring you the evidence?

524
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:33,033
I have it on my desk right now.

525
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:37,050
Now all we need is someone to
deliver it to the police--

526
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:41,061
someone who is not
connected direly to you...

527
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:52,682
I assume these will end up
on my desk again this year.

528
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,102
Doesn't hurt to apply, does it?

529
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,912
Christina, as much as
I'd love to help you,

530
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,950
there's only room for ten
up-and-coming designers for the show.

531
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:03,803
Oh...

532
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:08,442
this is somewhat, um...

533
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,601
interesting.

534
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:11,920
Really?

535
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:16,450
Because, well, I did try something
that was a bit different, so...

536
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:19,953
Last year your designs
were a bit too bohemian.

537
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,302
Your exact words were
"hippie hideous."

538
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:25,203
It's not just
about the designs.

539
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,330
Christina, it's
about the designer.

540
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:29,190
What do you mean?

541
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,611
Don't be afraid of
office politics.

542
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,961
Do favors for the right people.

543
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,582
You just might get
rewarded at the end.

544
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,253
Unfortunately, that is the
cruel reality in this business.

545
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:42,761
Okay, you can stop right there.

546
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:45,200
I know exactly how
you work, Wilhelmina.

547
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:48,443
Well, I'd rather make
it on my own. Thanks.

548
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,343
Admirable, but stupid.

549
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:55,790
It's too bad.
Those were your best designs yet.

550
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:01,490
But you are a
wonderful seamstress.

551
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:14,940
# Volare #

552
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,073
# Whoa, oh #

553
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,591
# Cantare #

554
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:26,670
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

555
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:31,040
You're thinking about her?

556
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:36,931
You know you're in bad shape when a
tone-deaf, karaoke-singing truck driver

557
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,710
reminds you of your ex.

558
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,772
I know this sound weird, but...

559
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:44,111
I actually think that in some ways,
you're pretty lucky.

560
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,853
I am curious to hear where
you're going with this one.

561
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,491
Daniel, you opened your heart.
You put yourself out there.

562
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:52,072
You were ready to
make that leap.

563
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:54,980
- Betty, come on--
- I mean it. I'm envious.

564
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,203
I wish I knew what
that felt like--

565
00:29:57,215 --> 00:30:01,833
to find someone who makes you wanna
swim across the East River in january.

566
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,643
Yeah, but don't you
have that with, uh...

567
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:04,380
Walter.

568
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:06,380
No, no, I'm talking about,
uh, Henry--

569
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:07,762
the guy from accounting.

570
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:11,213
No, no, no.
He doesn't think about me that way.

571
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,491
Are you serious?

572
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:15,671
Betty, I've seen the way he looks at
you. Believe me, I know that look.

573
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,403
I mean, he's totally into you.

574
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,470
Number 34, you're up!

575
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,081
Oh! Wipe your mouth. That's us.

576
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:26,373
What are you talking about?

577
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:27,760
Did you sign us up?

578
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,721
It's half-off if you sing.

579
00:30:30,577 --> 00:30:32,461
Yeah, but I'm rich.

580
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:41,052
# They say we're young, #
# and we don't know #

581
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:46,222
# We won't find
out until we grow #

582
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:50,981
# Well, I don't know #
# if all that's true #

583
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:56,691
# 'Cause you got me, #
# and, baby, I got you #

584
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,401
# Babe #

585
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,012
# I got you, babe #

586
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,200
# I got you, babe #

587
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:10,290
# They say our love #
# won't pay the rent #

588
00:31:10,306 --> 00:31:15,312
# Before it's earned, #
# our money's all been spent #

589
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:20,001
# I guess that's so, #
# we don't have a pot #

590
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:25,252
# But at least I'm sure #
# of all the things we've got #

591
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:29,382
Say hi to your husband.
Take him some cupcakes!

592
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:31,483
# I got you, babe #

593
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:34,631
# I got you babe #

594
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:38,633
# I've got flowers #

595
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:41,211
# In the spring #

596
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,572
# I've got you #

597
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:48,011
# To wear my ring #

598
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:54,912
# And when I'm sad #
# you're a clown #

599
00:31:54,925 --> 00:32:02,160
# and if I get scared #
# you're always around #

600
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:03,962
# I got you, babe #

601
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:06,560
# I got you, babe #

602
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:10,272
# I got you, babe #

603
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:19,493
Papi!

604
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:22,171
I'm mixing. I'm mixing.

605
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:23,553
What time is it?

606
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,660
5:00 a.m.

607
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:28,251
Check it out--$180!

608
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:31,413
And the best part is,
they doubled our order for tomorrow.

609
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:34,950
We are officially in with
the Roosevelt diner.

610
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:38,740
$180? Let me run the
numbers by you, Hilda.

611
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,111
Materials, ingredients,
the new mixer...

612
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:45,821
this little money-making scheme
so far has set us back $230.

613
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:49,713
We are investing in our future.

614
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:54,350
Grandma Suarez's future involves
a pillow and a blanket.

615
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:57,100
No, no, no, no, no.
You cannot quit on me now.

616
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:58,720
I need this to work.

617
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:01,833
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'm exhausted.

618
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,303
Fine. Fine. You know what?

619
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,921
I will make the
cupcakes myself.

620
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:08,903
Mija, if you believe
you can do it,

621
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,873
I believe you can do it.

622
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,622
That green thing...

623
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,502
that's the oven.

624
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,022
Is it hot?

625
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,802
I can't believe I've never crashed
a wedding reception before.

626
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,973
What an amazing way
to get free cake.

627
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,513
And bridesmaids.

628
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:32,381
That blonde chick
was totally into you.

629
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:33,843
- You have to call her.
- Oh, yeah.

630
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,613
Promise me that you're
gonna call her.

631
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:38,770
- I'll say "boobs" again.
- All right, we'll see...

632
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:41,092
Maybe. Wow.

633
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:45,600
I'm not used to seeing the
city from across the river.

634
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:47,173
Really?

635
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,340
It's the only way
I've ever seen it.

636
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:53,271
Wow. It's almost as
good as a blizzard.

637
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:55,893
What do you mean?

638
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,453
You know, when the city stops,

639
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,911
and there's this silence and...

640
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:03,243
everything kind of sparkles.

641
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:09,923
Next time I can't sleep, I'm coming
right back to this exact spot.

642
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:13,283
5:00 a.m.,
I'll be on this bridge.

643
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:16,031
Call me. I'll meet you.

644
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:22,191
You know,
my brother used to do that--

645
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:25,262
stay up partying all night,

646
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:29,073
then he'd find some after-hours
in Chinatown and call me,

647
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:30,730
tell me to meet him there.

648
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,641
You don't really talk
about him very much.

649
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:40,193
I guess I don't really think
of Alex as being gone...

650
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:47,031
More like he's on some
endless trip around the world.

651
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,583
How did he...

652
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:54,481
He jumped out of a helicopter
to ski down mount Juno.

653
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:58,223
He found chairlifts tedious.

654
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:01,823
Well, I bet you
really miss him.

655
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,232
At least he died
the way he lived.

656
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:11,743
If there was no risk involved,
Alex wasn't into it.

657
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:19,242
So what's stopping you from
going after this Henry guy, hmm?

658
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:23,091
Oh, god. Please, Daniel.
It's not worth talking about.

659
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,712
Why not?

660
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:30,300
I don't feel like competing with a
model who weighs less than my shoes.

661
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,782
What model?

662
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:33,410
Aerin.

663
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:37,723
He kissed her at the Christmas party.
I saw them.

664
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,231
- Aerin.
- Your ex.

665
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,123
That's who you're
worried about?

666
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,720
She must have kissed six
other guys that night, Betty.

667
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:46,380
I mean, for her, it's like saying,
"where's my coat?"

668
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,452
Yeah, well,
it didn't look that way to me.

669
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:53,002
Fine. You can make excuses
if you want, but...

670
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,482
you're better than
any model, Betty...

671
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,460
much better.

672
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,930
Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs--
I need eggs.

673
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:22,992
I need more milk.

674
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:26,893
You're up?

675
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,500
I never went down.
I have a big order tomorrow.

676
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:30,553
Where were you?

677
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,882
All over. Brooklyn, mostly.

678
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:35,040
- With who?
- Daniel.

679
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,321
I met him for dinner, and the food
sucked, so he took me for pizza,

680
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:38,582
and then we just hung out.

681
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:40,410
Are you insane?

682
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,600
You went on an all-night
date with your boss?

683
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,351
No, it wasn't a date.

684
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,742
First you set your sights
on some guy in accounting,

685
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:50,871
and now you're chasing after a man whose
wristwatch costs more than our house!

686
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,583
It was a business dinner,
and you know what, Hilda?

687
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:56,003
Some people think it's
okay for me to aim high.

688
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,820
What's that smell?

689
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:00,732
Oh, my god!

690
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:03,883
Oh, I can't believe this!

691
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:05,973
The timer never went off!

692
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:08,703
Do you have a clean pan?
There's some batter here--

693
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:12,482
Oh, forget it! I can't even make
a freakin' batch of cupcakes!

694
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:17,192
I'm 30 years old.
I got no employable skills.

695
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:19,552
Everybody else went to college.
I had a kid.

696
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,890
- What are you trying to say?
- I don't know.

697
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,000
Look, don't get me
wrong. Justin...

698
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:29,661
Justin is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

699
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,892
But sometimes

700
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:37,120
I can't help but wonder what my life
would have been like if I'd never--

701
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:38,722
Hilda, stop it.

702
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,780
You are an amazing mother.

703
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,373
Great.

704
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,451
How much does that pay an hour?

705
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:50,762
You're just going through
a transition period.

706
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,093
You needed this change.

707
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:56,510
You're gonna come out the
other side better than ever.

708
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:24,271
- Gotcha!
- Oh, Betty. Hey.

709
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:25,823
What are you doing here?

710
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,093
We're done with this.

711
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:29,262
You can't take the
stairs forever.

712
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:36,761
Don't be so smug. I'm not the only
one who's trying to avoid someone.

713
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:41,222
You know, I don't think I
want to avoid him anymore.

714
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:21,741
So if a woman didn't want to be
a seamstress her whole life,

715
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:24,143
what exactly would
she have to do?

716
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:28,061
You make it all
sound so unseemly.

717
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:32,423
I just have a small
favor to ask of you.

718
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:40,133
Drop this off at the
nearest police station...

719
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,383
anonymously.

720
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:58,251
What did you do with my cart?

721
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:00,480
Did you put it in
the men's room again?

722
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,133
You don't need it anymore.

723
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,370
This is your desk.

724
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:05,702
What?

725
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,912
Betty, it doesn't matter if
you're sitting in a chair

726
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,952
or a stool or a donkey.

727
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,740
You're Daniel's assistant...
his only one.

728
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:17,232
Really?

729
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:19,352
Yeah.

730
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:22,610
The only thing this one
and I have in common

731
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,933
is that we both
what's best for you.

732
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:26,932
I'd really like my
old job back...

733
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:30,072
with a raise, of course,
seeing that I am now way overqualified.

734
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:33,453
Well... okay.

735
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,341
Sounds fair.

736
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:45,281
Oh, and when you're done getting
settled, I would love a bagel.

737
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:48,231
That might take a minute.
I missed my chair.

738
00:40:57,775 --> 00:40:58,940
Hey!

739
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:01,531
"Mode" magazine.
How may I direct your call?

740
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:04,703
And the evidence?

741
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:07,533
It's being delivered
as we speak.

742
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:11,881
Never underestimate
the power of ambition.

743
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:16,873
I never do.

744
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:19,600
Well?

745
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:27,380
Hmm... looks like that skiing
accident really paid off...

746
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:29,330
Alex Meade.

747
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:31,760
Alexis, darling.

748
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:34,891
It's Alexis now.

749
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:44,223
