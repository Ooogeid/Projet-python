1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,997
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,167
Ta-da!

3
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:05,653
We're with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

4
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:07,224
Mr. Suarez,
you're under arrest.

5
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,422
You know,
I'm glad I saw this side of you.

6
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:15,529
Best-selling author behind
"M.Y.W.," Sofia Reyes.

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,842
You get my e-mails?

8
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:19,765
Yeah, I was busy
with my boyfriend.

9
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,589
Come work for my magazine.

10
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,120
You'll have your own
assistant within a year.

11
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,607
I guess this is good-bye.

12
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:29,025
You're destined for
bigger things than this.

13
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,406
Sofia, hi.

14
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,710
You make my heart beat faster.

15
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:36,052
You do take my breath away.

16
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:38,403
I love you, Sofia.

17
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:44,982
And we're live in 60 seconds.

18
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:47,902
On the bell, people.

19
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,670
Okay, camera two, tighten it up.
Ready, camera one.

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,250
Last looks, people. Last looks.

21
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,272
Whoa, Frodo.
Where do you think you're going?

22
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,902
I need to speak
to Daniel Meade.

23
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:57,983
Yeah, he's onstage already, and we're
going to air in less than a minute.

24
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,742
Okay, but it's an emergency!

25
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:00,900
What's your name?

26
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,270
Betty Suarez.
I'm assistant to Sofia Reyes.

27
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,531
I'm sorry. We've been specifically 
instructed not to let you anywhere near them.

28
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,802
What?

29
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:09,800
Hey!

30
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:14,152
Security, get her out of here!

31
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,933
Daniel!

32
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,652
Daniel?

33
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,550
Voilà! Breakfast parfait.

34
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,493
I made it all by myself.

35
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,661
Now there are a lot of layers,
so you have to eat your way

36
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,602
all the way to the bottom,
'cause there's a surprise.

37
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,532
Really?

38
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,472
Have I told you how impossible the
last two weeks away from you were?

39
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:45,122
It was unbearable for me, too.

40
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:47,891
Why is my yogurt crunchy?

41
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:50,643
Oh, that's the pine nut layer.
You gotta keep going, though.

42
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:54,141
So promise me you'll never spend
that much time away from me again.

43
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,393
Are you asking me
to stick around?

44
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,573
What's the surprise?

45
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,183
Papaya! It's your favorite
fruit growing up, right?

46
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,390
Look, I cut it into little
heart-shaped pieces. You see it?

47
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,162
No ring?

48
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,922
We haven't even gone through
the steps of love yet.

49
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,602
- What steps of love?
- Chapter one from your book.

50
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:16,592
Things a couple should do
before they get engaged--

51
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:20,433
meeting each other's parents,
going on an exotic wilderness vacation--

52
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:24,023
I wrote that chapter in the book
just to give it some pizzazz.

53
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:25,552
They're turning it into
a movie next year.

54
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,920
Penelope Cruz is
dying to play me.

55
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:31,722
So, um, the part about wearing
each other's underwear for a day?

56
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,932
No, I was drunk
when I wrote that.

57
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,890
Thank god.
This thing is kind of riding up.

58
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,503
Listen, Daniel,
forget about the book.

59
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:43,891
This is right.

60
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,953
Can't you feel it?

61
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,863
I do.

62
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,200
I really do.

63
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,762
I just--
I wanna savor this time.

64
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:12,680
You are not wearing
that sweater vest.

65
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,111
You don't like it?

66
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,530
No, I don't like it. I love it.

67
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,430
I almost bought the same
one at ladies 4 less.

68
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:23,832
- 40 off?
- Yeah!

69
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:25,710
Oh, you must be Betty.

70
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,810
Sofia's told us all about you.

71
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:30,221
I hear you were
a star at "Mode."

72
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,292
Oh, no, no.
I don't know about that.

73
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,602
Well, honestly,
I don't know how you did it.

74
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:38,343
My heart flares up if the eletor 
even stops on that floor.

75
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:40,721
- Well, it wasn't easy.
- Cute bunny.

76
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,933
Well, "M.Y.W." is
a lot different.

77
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:44,880
You couldn't ask for
a better place to work

78
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,982
or a better boss than Sofia.

79
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:49,732
Yeah, she's so kind
and supportive.

80
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,980
The best.

81
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,502
Listen, I'm right over
here if you need me.

82
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:57,411
Just promise me you will lend me that
sweater vest if I get a hot date...

83
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,352
or any date.

84
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,891
It's done.

85
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:12,552
I'm home.

86
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,923
I thought I'd never say this,

87
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,333
but I miss Texas.

88
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,113
Yeah, I was a little worried
about you that first day

89
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,862
when you plunked your
Jimmy Choos in cow dung.

90
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:35,482
Well, it wasn't as bad as you
calling them "Jimmy Poos."

91
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,400
Well, you gotta
admit that was funny.

92
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,563
Oh, there it goes again.
Lucky my colt's not handy.

93
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:43,833
What am I supposed to do?

94
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,371
I have to get back to reality.

95
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:49,153
Well, why don't you hold onto a little
bit of that calm you had in Texas
with me?

96
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:53,192
You know, be a little more armadillo,
a little less roadrunner.

97
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:57,190
Uh, a little more english,
a little less texan, please.

98
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,922
Well, you see, the armadillo--
he doesn't move very fast,

99
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:02,321
but he gets done what he needs to do,
then he lies in the sun.

100
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,540
The roadrunner never stops--
feathers flying everywhere,

101
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:07,633
running all over creation,
and he doesn't have any fun.

102
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:10,873
Weren't armadillos those
animals we saw lying dead

103
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:12,610
in the middle of the highway?

104
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,610
I never said they were smart--

105
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,722
just relaxed and happy.

106
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,112
What do you think of that,
Mr. Armadillo?

107
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:38,890
Mr. Suarez, do you have anything to
prove your year of entry was 1977?

108
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,391
Yeah, I think there are some ticket
stubs to "Saturday Night Fever"

109
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,990
somewhere in there.

110
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:49,581
- What are you writing down?
- None of your business.

111
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:52,783
- Listen, lady--
- My name is Constance, not lady.

112
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,340
I was giving you the
benefit of the doubt.

113
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,782
Look, I've been living in this
country for 30 years now.

114
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,992
I have two--I have two kids.

115
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,901
My wife is buried here.

116
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:06,163
And for the last two hours, you have
been grilling me nonstop like I'm--

117
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:07,503
A criminal?

118
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:11,482
Mr. Suarez, in the eyes of the I.C.E.,
that's exactly what you are.

119
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:14,602
Let me remind you,
you are in this country illegally.

120
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:18,711
My department is the one thing
standing between you and deportation.

121
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,531
Now I gotta go grab
myself a smoothie.

122
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,880
I hope by tomorrow morning,
you've, uh, found a new attitude

123
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,743
and something to prove
that year of entry.

124
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,523
Good day, Mr. Suarez.

125
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:50,723
Yeah. What department do I speak
to about getting a new caseworker?

126
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:53,103
"Rise and Shine
America" called.

127
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,780
They want a copy of the issue 
before your appearance tomorrow.

128
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,760
Well, they can't have the issue
until I've decided on a cover,

129
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,360
and I haven't decided yet,
so what else?

130
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:04,742
Bad news. The freelancer who wrote
that female nascar driver story--

131
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,872
she sold the same article
to "Jane" two years ago.

132
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,541
What? That was our fish
out of water story.

133
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,343
Do we have anything else?

134
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:14,862
I have a friend who can
paint with her feet.

135
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:19,871
- How is that a fish out of water?
- She doesn't have arms.

136
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,632
We need a socialite
in the military,

137
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,172
- a grandma who bungee jumps...
- I'm sorry I'm late!

138
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:29,053
A girl like that
working at "Mode."

139
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,353
Everyone, if you
haven't met her,

140
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,070
this is my new executive
assistant Betty Suarez.

141
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:34,921
Hi.

142
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,280
She used to work at "Mode"
till just recently.

143
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:38,970
Quite a different
vibe here, hmm?

144
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,347
Wow. Yeah.

145
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,255
For starters,
it's nice to see people actually eat.

146
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:47,296
And--and it's nice to work with people
of all different colors and shapes

147
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:51,250
- and sizes and-- and handicaps.
- Handi-capable.

148
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:54,051
Right. I'm sorry. I...

149
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,492
Betty, you are our fish.

150
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,682
- Excuse me?
- Our fish out of water.

151
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,170
Put down that coffee
and pick up a pencil.

152
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,922
I want you to quickly
write an article

153
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:11,070
all about your experience
working at "Mode."

154
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:13,113
Talk to the people that
you interacted with.

155
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,830
And, Betty, get me good,
honest quotes, hmm?

156
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:20,292
A normal fish in
shark-infested waters.

157
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,802
It's great! Get started.
600 words by tomorrow.

158
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:26,101
And, girls, come on.
We have a magazine to launch.

159
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:27,552
Sofia, can I talk to
you for a moment?

160
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:28,360
Sure.

161
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,673
I'm not sure how comfortable
I fell doing this.

162
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:33,721
You know,
I-I just felt like I graduated "Mode,"

163
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,023
and I was generally
not treated that well,

164
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,002
and I don't know if I'm ready to go back
and write about the experience just yet.

165
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:44,111
But, Betty,
this is exactly why you need to do this.

166
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,700
The wounds are fresh.

167
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:50,053
The article will be raw,
real, honest...

168
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,373
Qualities your former
boss seems to be lacking.

169
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,543
Oh, Betty!

170
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:00,633
Sofia, what-- what's wrong?

171
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:02,571
I think I'm losing Daniel.

172
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,890
What? No! Daniel loves you.

173
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,850
Why is he stalling, then? Huh?

174
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,750
This is where it happens.

175
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,052
He breaks down the girl,

176
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,983
takes her heart
and squashes it.

177
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,513
Oh, my god.

178
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:25,083
I think I am destined to be another
one of Daniel Meade's girls.

179
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,361
No! No, Sofia.

180
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:30,260
And I left Hunter for Daniel.

181
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:34,970
Now he's back in Europe,
and he won't even talk to me anymore.

182
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,530
I'm sorry.
I'm just so overwhelmed.

183
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:46,211
You go up to "Mode"
and write that article.

184
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,042
This is your big chance.

185
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,061
Okay.

www.forom.com

188
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,913
What exactly are
you doing back here?

189
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:33,280
I thought you went to work
for "Feminazi Weekly."

190
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm writing an article about
being an outsider at "Mode,"

191
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,302
and I wanted to interview you.

192
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,092
As much fun as that sounds,

193
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,852
I so don't have time for it right now.
Wilhelmina's due back any second,

194
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:46,431
and she's always extremely
tense after a relaxing vacation.

195
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,863
Okay, well, then,
just a quick quote.

196
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,440
Honestly tell me what was your
first impression was of me.

197
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,711
There you have it.
Now please just waddle off.

198
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,643
Marc, I don't even know
how to quote that.

199
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:04,003
Well, I was thrilled-- someone else
to make fun of behind their backs.

200
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:06,270
You also gave me a fun
hobby to do as well.

201
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,590
Which was?

202
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,861
"Betty's screen
savers of shame."

203
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:14,340
Well, they're not quite as flattering
as the ones I found of you

204
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,661
on dudecruise.com,
but they're not bad.

205
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,011
You did not.

206
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:23,402
Don't you ever tell anyone.

207
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,031
Erase those off your
computer right now then.

208
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,053
Fine.

209
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,781
Okay, everyone!
She's coming in!

210
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:35,011
Let's go, people.
Go, go, go. Look alive.

211
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,973
Cover that hideous thing up. You know
how she feels about floral prints!

212
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,593
Move it!
The shark is in the box.

213
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,580
Go. Randall, go!

214
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:46,200
Good morning, Marc.

215
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:49,182
W-W-Willie? Um, hi.

216
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:50,940
Are those jeans?

217
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,761
Aren't they fabulous?

218
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,213
Ted took me to,
uh, an outlet mall.

219
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,751
I shopped next to fat people.

220
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:01,441
Hello, Carl.
How was your holiday?

221
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:03,730
Kevin. I spent it
sending out résumés.

222
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:04,862
Why?

223
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,531
You fired me at the Christmas party.
I'm just packing.

224
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,052
Is that true?

225
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,662
As if it never happened, Carl.

226
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:14,141
- Kev--
- Don't push it.

227
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,182
So... I heard you called
asking for a new caseworker.

228
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,131
You don't have to say anything.

229
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,681
Maybe this wasn't a good fit,
you know?

230
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,041
It happens.

231
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,162
Look, I'm--
I'm sorry, Constance.

232
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,662
No problem.

233
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,650
Good luck to you.

234
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,341
Thanks.

235
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,013
Are you out of your mind?!

236
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,003
You can't just get
a new caseworker!

237
00:12:57,018 --> 00:13:00,161
I'm not a pair of cheap socks you
can return to a 99-cent store.

238
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,572
Let me remind you, Mr. Suarez.
You are an illegal immigrant.

239
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:08,311
Now I can make this easy, or I can
LoJack your ankle like an Iroc-Z.

240
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,342
Have I made myself clear?

241
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,211
- Very.
- Good.

242
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,972
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

243
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,521
An article? Ooh.

244
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:23,561
Make me sound extra glamorous...
and skinny.

245
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,000
So... honest quote-- what did you
think of me when I first arrived?

246
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,283
Well, I hated you, of course.

247
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:30,583
Hated me.

248
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,913
Is that because I didn't
look like everybody else?

249
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:36,612
No. It's because I'd been angling
for this position for months,

250
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,083
and you traipse in here with your
bushy eyebrows and really bad bangs,

251
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:43,012
and I'm like,
"that took my job?"

252
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,953
You're really confirming everything
I'm writing about. Thank you.

253
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:50,122
Well, must confess, at a certain point,
I did become envious of you.

254
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:51,932
Wait. You became envious of me?

255
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,801
Only in the most bizarre way,
of course.

256
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,092
I mean, I can't leave the house 
with an out of season handbag,

257
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,672
and you show up on a daily basis
looking like a... yard sale.

258
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:00,761
Didn't even care.

259
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:03,331
It's like you were genetically
engineered without the fear gene.

260
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:04,712
I gotta give you props.

261
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,251
Thank you, Amanda.

262
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:09,533
Oh, and F.Y.I.-- none of this
means I like you or anything.

263
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,923
Of course.

264
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:21,340
Where were you this morning?
I called you, like, a thousand times.

265
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:23,402
With Ted.

266
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,931
He's staying with me
through the weekend.

267
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,280
What'd I miss?

268
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:28,750
Some guy named Steve called,

269
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:31,290
said he had valuable
information about Bradford.

270
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,143
Cryptic! Shall I try him?

271
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,912
No. What else?

272
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,410
There's a 1:00 editors'
meeting about the bridal issue.

273
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:40,681
- Daniel can handle that.
- But it's Vera Wang this year.

274
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,570
You love your Wang.

275
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,941
What is it?

276
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:49,110
I don't know.
It's like a giant dead rat or something.

277
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,161
Did you piss off
Donna Karan again?

278
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:52,852
I think...

279
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,952
it's an armadillo.

280
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:00,031
Would you put him up
there for me, please?

281
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,620
Yes?

282
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,780
We need to speak...

283
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:12,801
in person.

284
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,262
Yeah, well, you weren't exactly the type
of girl I was used to working with,

285
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:22,852
but as I got to know you,
I really grew to like you.

286
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,393
And I gotta say,

287
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:26,602
you helped me grow as a person.

288
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,161
You're writing all
this down, right?

289
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:29,362
Of course.

290
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,830
So I really helped
you grow as a person?

291
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,870
Well, yeah,
with the whole Sofia thing.

292
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:35,873
I mean,
you had a huge part in that.

293
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,490
So you're still planning
on proposing to her?

294
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,340
Why do you ask?

295
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,172
Okay, look, you didn't hear this
from me, because if you tell her,

296
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:46,691
I will totally deny it. But she
was downstairs crying this morning.

297
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:48,262
She thinks you're
having second thoughts.

298
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,092
What?

299
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,650
- That's crazy.
- I mean, can you blame her?

300
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:53,691
She doesn't wanna become another
one of your "Daniel Meade" girls.

301
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:57,440
Listen, I think that if
you don't wanna lose her,

302
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,080
you know what you have to do.

303
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,821
Thanks, Betty.

304
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,300
I'm gonna go get lunch.
Can I get you something?

305
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,752
I have a new assistant
now. Remember?

306
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,222
Oh, yeah.

307
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:12,761
Now tell me, where does one
find an armadillo in Manhattan?

308
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:16,370
In Chinatown.
I think it was gonna be someone's lunch.

309
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:20,992
Well, despite the fact that it
clashes with most of my office,

310
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,642
I adore him.

311
00:16:22,738 --> 00:16:26,180
I put him on the shelf in front of me
to remind me what's really important.

312
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,631
Oh? What's that?

313
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,041
Well, moments like this.

314
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:33,570
I spent the past 20 years worrying
about hemlines and heels,

315
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:34,752
and for what?

316
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:38,040
If you have no one to share it with,
what's the point?

317
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,313
You're about to share hemlines
and heels with me, are you?

318
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,081
I was thinking about
sharing something else.

319
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:50,770
What?

320
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:52,463
I gotta warn you, Willie.

321
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,911
I'm hauling around a
truckful of baggage.

322
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:59,203
I have three exes. I'm working
on a fourth-- a passel of kids.

323
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,642
We both have plenty of baggage.

324
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:06,933
But... I'm willing to give
it a shot if you are.

325
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,711
Hey, lady. Get outta here.

326
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:03,120
Hunter is supposedly this perfect
model/racecar driver/humanitarian

327
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,730
living in Europe,
except he's here.

328
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,103
- So he gets around.
- I saw Sofia with him,

329
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,193
even though she told me
that they don't even speak.

330
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,142
Well, they reconnected.

331
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,033
She was handing him a wad
of cash--a lot of it--

332
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:15,942
right before he walked
into Boylesque.

333
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,442
The strip club on 34 and 7th?

334
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,082
What? I do manage to get out of
this closet every once in a while.

335
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:26,113
Well, I have to assume,
since it caters exclusively to women,

336
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,451
that he works there.

337
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,303
Sofia was dating a stripper?

338
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,890
Oh, my god. I love her.

339
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:33,601
This is so weird.

340
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:37,132
And she was so adamant about
getting Daniel to propose to her.

341
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:38,721
I don't know what to do.

342
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,453
Oh, I do.

343
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,551
What?

344
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,473
We investigate.

345
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:49,460
Here I am birthing a calf.

346
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:53,072
Oh, and Ted's lassoing me.

347
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:56,051
I don't care about your
silly little vacation.

348
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:59,452
- What about the plan?
- Oh, the plan.

349
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:03,032
The plan to take over Meade
Publication has clearly failed.

350
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:05,433
Bradford knows now with
complete certainty

351
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,780
that Fey Sommers is dead,

352
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:11,631
and we have no firm evidence
linking him to her murder.

353
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,850
Hand me my oxygen.

354
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,972
Wilhelmina, I fully intend

355
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:25,511
to take over the company
sooner rather than later.

356
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,472
And if you're not my ally,
then you'll be my enemy,

357
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:33,981
and there will be no place
for you anywhere at Meade.

358
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:39,083
Well, we'll just let the
chips fall where they may.

359
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,583
Where are we?

360
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,051
Somewhere I never
bring a woman to.

361
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,881
I didn't realize such a place
still existed in Manhattan.

362
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:54,122
Yeah, I know I have a
few notches on my belt.

363
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:57,092
Baby, it's all notch, no belt,

364
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,580
which makes me wonder--

365
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:01,732
how does a man with no belt
keep his pants on? Hmm?

366
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,252
Hmm... meeting
someone like you?

367
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:13,790
Mr. Meade!
This is so embarrassing.

368
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:15,103
What is he doing here?

369
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,022
I believe we're having
dinner together.

370
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:18,933
Before we move on
to that next step,

371
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,120
I thought it was important for
you to meet both of my parents.

372
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:25,682
- Welcome, Sofia.
- Hello. Thank you.

373
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,041
My god, she's stunning.

374
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:30,292
Thank god Daniel got
to her before you did.

375
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:33,833
Hello. I'm claire,
Daniel's recovering alcoholic mother.

376
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,732
- Welcome.
- Best behavior, mother.

377
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,262
I am trying to make
a good impression.

378
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:40,700
Oh, my darling. I would never
do anything to embarrass you.

379
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,010
Let me show you
Daniel's baby pictures.

380
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,781
He does the cutest
thing in the tub.

381
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,113
Does he?

382
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:50,592
So what are we looking for?

383
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:53,330
Something that'll show that barracuda
the year I came into this country.

384
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,462
Okay.

385
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:56,121
I can't deal with
this woman, mija.

386
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,361
She's rude,
she's obnoxious, she's--

387
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,311
The United States government.
What'd you expect?

388
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,462
Respect. She shows up unannounced
and starts needling me.

389
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,931
I don't think that
woman has ever smiled.

390
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,122
Dad, stop. You're powerless.

391
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,590
And you know, we really need
her on our side right now.

392
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,633
Constance Grady is only on
Constance Grady's side.

393
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,153
Well, then maybe Ignacio Suarez
should try being on her side.

394
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:20,082
You ever stop to think that maybe
she's actually trying to help?

395
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:23,541
Look, try getting in her good graces.
You know, something simple,

396
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,170
something sweet.

397
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:26,800
Make her smile.

398
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:42,393
You ladies ready to plunder the
seven seas for some buried treasure?

399
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:43,142
How much?

400
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,110
Christina, we are not
here for a lap dance.

401
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:50,012
Sir, um, we are here to see one
of your performers. Uh, Hunter?

402
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,993
Every other guy is
named Hunter here.

403
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:53,973
You're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

404
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:56,591
Uh, well, he's--
he's tall and blond,

405
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,933
and he looks kind of nordic.

406
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:04,083
Oh. Of course. Hunter nine.

407
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:07,460
Well, get in line.
Everyone wants a piece of the nine.

408
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:17,992
Oh, I think we're gonna need
an awful lot of singles.

409
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:22,411
I open my closet door,

410
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,883
and there was Daniel
in my Pucci strapless

411
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:28,252
and a pair of
patent-leather pumps.

412
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,290
For the record,
I was 6 years old,

413
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,712
and it was my brother
who dressed me up.

414
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,871
You never talk
about your brother.

415
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,223
He died two years ago.

416
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

417
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:42,410
It's been a bit of a bumpy road
for the Meade family of late.

418
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:44,663
It seems our luck is changing.

419
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:46,500
To Sofia.

420
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,042
To Sofia.

421
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:51,691
Ay, perdón.

422
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:53,920
Gracias.

423
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:57,512
As a Reyes, you must have had
plenty of maids growing up.

424
00:22:57,525 --> 00:23:01,412
We spent a week at Javier Reyes
estate in Puerto Vallarta.

425
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,533
He has the most
darling little zoo...

426
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:07,422
or rather, zoo-ló-gico.

427
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:09,602
Muy bien, but you
got the wrong Reyes.

428
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:12,462
Growing up,
we only had one maid--my mother.

429
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,153
And the closest I ever
got to the upper crust

430
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:17,871
is when I used to help
her clean their houses.

431
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,991
So no silver spoon.

432
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,680
Oh, no, no, no.
We could barely afford a plastic one.

433
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:24,692
That's why I like this girl--

434
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,940
someone who actually worked
for what they got out of life.

435
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,773
You could learn something
from her, Daniel.

436
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:32,372
And I fully intend
to, father...

437
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:36,021
for as long as she's
willing to teach me.

438
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:42,683
Hello!

439
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:45,333
Betty, it's a bridge and
tunnel bachelorette party.

440
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:45,973
So?

441
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:50,100
That woman there is about to marry
some fat, bald, pasty-looking dentist.

442
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:53,211
This is her last supper.
She is cashing out.

443
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:55,100
Well, do you think he'll
take my A.T.M. card?

444
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,743
Well, I know where
he can swipe it.

445
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:59,721
Okay, fine.
Here's lunch for the week.

446
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,493
Oh, $20! Hunter!

447
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,650
He's coming, he's coming.
20$.

448
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:07,742
Hey, ladies. I see you're ready to
pay the proper fine for the nine.

449
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:11,423
You can cop a feel if you'd like.
Just don't let management see you.

450
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,290
Okay.

451
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:13,953
- Christina!
- He said...

452
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:17,033
Um, Hunter,
do--do you have a girlfriend?

453
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:21,241
I got girlfriends, boyfriends,
all sorts of friends.

454
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,220
So, you mean,
you're--you're bisexual?

455
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:28,832
That's right, babe.
You buy... I'm sexual.

456
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:32,130
So what kind of lap dance
you in the mood for?

457
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:33,653
Cupping the cobra?

458
00:24:33,746 --> 00:24:36,011
Feeding the kitty?
Slapping the bongos?

459
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:38,393
Or just a good
old-fashioned hot dog race?

460
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,413
Yes! I'm assuming that
everything's just à la carte--

461
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:42,342
Hey, Hunter!

462
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:45,833
Jiggle your junk on over here.

463
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,991
Whoa. Time's up, ladies.

464
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,852
I gotta go service
the high rollers.

465
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,950
- No, wait! Wait!
- I just gave you a $20!

466
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:55,780
Come to mama, baby. Oh, my god.

467
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,560
Well, he's a whore, isn't he? I mean,
what more do we need to investigate?

468
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,420
Well, I have to find
out about him and Sofia.

469
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:03,962
Right. Well, I suggest you make
a beeline for that A.T.M.,

470
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,352
which is absolutely fine by me,
you know,

471
00:25:05,385 --> 00:25:08,170
because I am here for
the long haul. Right.

472
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,892
You two look so happy together.

473
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,180
How long have you been married?

474
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,033
It'll be 38 years in september.

475
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:19,271
They make it look so easy,
don't they?

476
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:22,760
I almost shot him one
Christmas in Ann Arbor.

477
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:25,551
Thank god it was me who
was loaded and not the gun.

478
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,051
You almost shot him?

479
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,142
Well, every family does
holidays a little differently.

480
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:32,132
In a marriage, things happen.

481
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:38,331
Things like Tisha and Cindy
and Candee with two E's.

482
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,100
And let's not forget about Fey.

483
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,353
Settle.

484
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:45,891
My point is that marriage can
be pretty awful sometimes.

485
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:50,571
But somehow you find a way to go on,
and that's a good thing.

486
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:53,920
Because when something
really bad happens,

487
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:57,251
like losing one
of your children,

488
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:03,272
you realize that you could never
survive it without your husband.

489
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,970
Come on. Dance with me.

490
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,312
You're bombed, aren't you?

491
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:26,012
It's just a little cough syrup.

492
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:34,302
If you turn and run,
I will completely understand.

493
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,872
Never.

494
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,543
I'd love to have
what they have...

495
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,570
but without the cheating.

496
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:44,810
If you cheat on me,

497
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:48,942
I swear I will cut
your cojones off.

498
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:54,912
Do you think our grandchild will
have a spanish name like Paco?

499
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:57,900
Do you like her?

500
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,343
She's lovely.

501
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:01,410
There's just
something about her,

502
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:03,703
like she's hiding something.

503
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,280
Aren't we all?

504
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
You know, if you want it,

505
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,493
we could have what they have.

506
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,010
Stop the hoggin'!

507
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:21,252
Hey, here! Look! Money!

508
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,703
This'll get you a minute.

509
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,933
Okay, I just wanna know
quickly--have you ever been hired

510
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,390
to pretend to be
somebody's boyfriend?

511
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:29,191
Happens all the time--
a girl wants to make a guy jealous.

512
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:31,253
Well, is that what you
did for Sofia Reyes?

513
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:33,610
Is she already giving
me recommendations?

514
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,492
Nice.

515
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:43,763
Hello?

516
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:47,500
Hi, Daniel. It's Betty.
Look--I need to talk to you about Sofia.

517
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:50,342
Hey! Perfect timing.
I just proposed.

518
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:52,621
- You did?!
- Yeah, isn't that great?

519
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,412
I mean, it would have never have
happened if we hadn't had our
talk today.

520
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:57,040
Thank you, Betty!

521
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,650
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

522
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,690
Um... yeah...

523
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,182
Congratulations.

524
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:19,351
Box seats for "Cosi
Fan Tutte" at the Met.

525
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,412
Prepare to be dazzled.

526
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:25,051
And a pair of
Ferragamo wing tips.

527
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:28,893
Sorry. No cowboy
boots at the opera.

528
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:36,901
Well, what's going on?

529
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,221
I had a long talk with
my wife today, Willie.

530
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,751
I don't know how to say this.

531
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,481
I think you just did.

532
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:53,880
Willie, wait.

533
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,400
Joanne and I have a
daughter together.

534
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,091
And my other kids--

535
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,211
they don't need
another ex-stepmom.

536
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:05,801
My family's pretty broken.

537
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,231
I gotta try and fix it.

538
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:13,203
Look, I-I don't expect
you to understand, but--

539
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:14,780
Let's not, shall we?

540
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,970
What chance did an armadillo
and a roadrunner have, anyway?

541
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:29,542
Keep the shoes.

542
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:35,020
And try not to step
in any cow dung.

543
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,161
Good morning, Sofia. Coffee?

544
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,350
Where'd you get it?

545
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,213
Hunter's jockstrap?

546
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:08,873
What? You didn't think
he was gonna tell me

547
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:11,480
that a bushy-browed
latina girl with braces

548
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,632
came and asked
questions about us?

549
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,730
You can leave us alone for a second.
Thank you.

550
00:30:18,836 --> 00:30:21,852
Sofia, why would you hire someone
to pretend to be your boyfriend?

551
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,531
I knew about Daniel's reputation,
and, well,

552
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,951
being just another single
girl wasn't gonna be enough

553
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:29,160
to drive him to
wanna be with me.

554
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,052
Well, why would you want,
or even need,

555
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:33,280
to drive someone to
wanna be with you?

556
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,910
The car's downstairs to take
you to "Rise and Shine America."

557
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,340
Daniel's already waiting.

558
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:38,723
Thank you, Ruthie.

559
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,780
- He's going with you?
- Yes.

560
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,180
We are going to announce our
engagement together on air.

561
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:49,483
Okay, um, I'll just grab a few things,
and I'll come right down.

562
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:53,002
No, you are going to stay here
and finish up that article,

563
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,102
and I expect it to be ready
by the time I get back.

564
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:11,123
- Good morning, Wilhelmina.
- Didn't I fire you?

565
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,233
I can't believe today's the big day.
Aren't you so excited?

566
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,221
Yep. Big day. Really excited.

567
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,083
Thank god we finally
got the cover.

568
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:28,531
Oh, my nerves had me all blotchy,
thinking she might not pull it off.

569
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:30,820
Never doubt Sofia.
The article's great, too.

570
00:31:30,836 --> 00:31:33,283
I don't think she slept a
wink last night writing it.

571
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:36,741
- Is that going to press?
- As we speak.

572
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:37,951
Wow.

573
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:41,032
Um, can I read that?

574
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,631
Oh, uh... Sofia doesn't want 
you to read it yet.

575
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:44,922
Why not?

576
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:48,812
Okay.

577
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:52,021
Hey!

578
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:03,280
Oh, you--you--you... Get her!

579
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:08,513
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

580
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,523
"The rules to getting any guy you want
to propose to you in 60 days or less."

581
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:31,523
You gotta do what you gotta do.
"Pique his interest."

582
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:35,972
My editors and I are working...
"Stay in close proximity."

583
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:39,752
Why do you think I'm a tease?
"Give him a taste."

584
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,001
Hey, you. Come here.
"Make yourself unavailable."

585
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,722
Come on, Daniel.

586
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:47,503
This is where you stop me from
walking back into that club.

587
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,720
"Create a ticking clock."

588
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:57,613
- Betty.
- Christina, it was all a lie!

589
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,310
Calm down.
What--what are you talking about?

590
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:02,993
Sofia set him up from the beginning.
She used Daniel to get her cover story!

591
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:11,193
From the R.S.A.
studios in midtown Manhattan--

592
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,703
"Rise and Shine America."

593
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:16,051
Coming up,
acclaimed author and magazine editor

594
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:19,633
Sofia Reyes is here to talk
about her new magazine, "M.Y.W."

595
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:22,842
And her engagement to New
York's most eligible bachelor,

596
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,310
Daniel Meade.

597
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:27,280
Okay, camera two, tighten it up.
Ready, camera one.

598
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,103
Security, get her out of here.

599
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,001
Daniel!

600
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:34,013
Daniel!!

601
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,131
Well, now, Sofia,
it's a big week for you.

602
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:40,441
- Yeah!
- Yes. Yes, it is.

603
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,501
So tell us about your magazine.

604
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:46,071
I created "M.Y.W." in
order to fill a void.

605
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:50,451
There are no magazines that actually
make a modern woman feel empowered.

606
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:54,002
This is not about overpriced
clothes or wrinkle creams.

607
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:55,581
These are real articles.

608
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,182
- Fantastic.
- Yeah. That's great.

609
00:33:57,197 --> 00:34:00,841
And I understand you've used yourself
as an example for the first cover.

610
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,323
That's right.

611
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:05,971
Statistics would say that I
shouldn't be here right now.

612
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:08,800
But I am, with a new magazine

613
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:14,702
and newly anged to the most
notorious bachelor in New York City.

614
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:20,353
I got him to propose
to me in 60 days.

615
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,743
- Wow.
- Wow.

616
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,293
- 60 days-- that's like 2 months.
- Yeah!

617
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:26,593
Is that true? 60 days?

618
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:31,163
Uh, yeah. Um...
I guess it was, uh, exactly 60 days

619
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:34,212
from the day we first met till,
uh, last night

620
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:36,681
when I proposed. Yeah.

621
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:38,732
And that's my lead article.

622
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:43,062
"From fling to
ring in 60 days--

623
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:48,072
techniques to make you get
the man you want in 60 days."

624
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,780
And if they worked for
me with Daniel Meade,

625
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,793
they'll work for
any woman out there.

626
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:57,413
Now, Daniel, were you aware that she
set out to try and get you to propose?

627
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,192
No. Uh, I wasn't.

628
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:04,212
We, uh, we--we met, and...
we fell in love.

629
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,673
Well, actually...

630
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,100
Daniel, you fell in love.

631
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:12,552
I mean, I have to tell you, as much as
I like you-- you're a terrific guy.

632
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:17,643
But right now I just wanna focus on
my career, not on a relationship.

633
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:21,140
But thank you for being
such a good sport.

634
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:26,850
- Well, uh... fantastic. Uh...
- Fantastic.

635
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:30,293
So let's talk more about--

636
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:54,592
Even I'm shedding
a silent tear.

637
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:58,593
Guess it's impossible for
any of us to have it all...

638
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:03,711
but no reason why we
can't keep trying.

639
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:11,353
By the way, that Steve guy
called again about Bradford.

640
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,831
Get him for me.

641
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,792
Well, the magazine is "M.Y.W.,"

642
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,492
and the woman behind it all--
Sofia Reyes.

643
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:25,801
Oh, and Daniel Meade, of course,
ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,010
Thank you both for stopping by.

645
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:30,713
And that's a wrap.

646
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:30,788
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,276
Daniel. Daniel.

647
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,402
How could you do this to me?

648
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:44,412
Sofia, I fell in love with you.

649
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:45,910
I know you did.

650
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:49,133
And for what?
A publicity stunt? Really?

651
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:53,180
How many times have you done exactly
the same thing to dozens of women?

652
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:56,263
How many times have you broken
their hearts and dumped them?

653
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:59,572
I can guarantee none were
broadcast on national television.

654
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:01,571
This wasn't easy for me either.

655
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:04,293
I thought it would be,
but it wasn't.

656
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,332
It's just that when I start something,
I have to follow through,

657
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:10,343
and you can call me a bitch.
You can call me whatever you want.

658
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,452
But it's how I've gotten
where I am today.

659
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:17,790
Otherwise, I would still be dusting
houses in Mexico with my mother.

660
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:20,733
For what it's worth...

661
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:27,200
you were so much more than
I ever thought you would be.

662
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:32,320
And I'm sorry.

663
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:56,453
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

664
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:09,561
I'm going to go down
right now and fire her.

665
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:14,441
You're certainly free to
do whatever you want.

666
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:19,280
If I was C.E.O., I'd be signing
her up to a long-term contract.

667
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:24,082
That stunt she pulled will probably
guarantee you the single biggest launch

668
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:26,711
of any magazine in
the company's history.

669
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:28,390
But you're my son.

670
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,263
She hurt you.

671
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,163
It's just business, dad.

672
00:38:57,075 --> 00:39:00,993
Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:02,980
Thank you.

674
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,801
You betrayed me.

675
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,793
Now that's not true.

676
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,890
You manipulated me and you
lied to my face about Daniel.

677
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,533
Yes, I did, but not about you.

678
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:17,900
I did not lie about
your potential.

679
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,543
I did not lie about
your abilities.

680
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,293
That's why I hired you.

681
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:25,452
I see a lot myself in you.

682
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:27,910
Well, I don't see
any of myself in you.

683
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,603
Here's my article about
working at "Mode."

684
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,790
Funny thing researching it--

685
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,633
those people might be superficial,
but they know it,

686
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:38,310
and they don't pretend to be
anything more than they are.

687
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:41,593
I actually think I fit in better
there than I ever will here.

688
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,830
- Betty--
- I quit.

689
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:53,391
December 10th, 1977.

690
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,010
A lease--that'll work.

691
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:58,340
First apartment my
wife and I lived in.

692
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,222
No heat, no hot water,
a view of a brick wall--

693
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:03,273
it was, uh, paradise.

694
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:06,771
Well, thank you very much
for your cooperation.

695
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:10,412
Well, listen, Constance,
I-I wanted to apologize

696
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:12,923
for getting off on the
wrong foot with you.

697
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,182
And so I, uh...

698
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,401
I wanted to give you this.

699
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:25,110
A lot of letters.
That's why the words are so small.

700
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,422
You don't know...

701
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:38,023
You just don't know
what this means to me.

702
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,290
I mean, everybody's always treating
me like a glorified meter maid.

703
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:47,090
Thank you so much.
You just made my day.

704
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:52,112
Adiós, Ignacio.

705
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:55,661
I hope to be seeing
a lot of you.

706
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,052
Well, hello.

707
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:28,662
Marc! Where's Daniel?

708
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:31,110
Oh, that bird has
flown the coop.

709
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:32,250
What?!

710
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:35,092
Instead of coming back to
the office this morning,

711
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,680
he had his driver
take him to J.F.K.

712
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:38,283
No one knows where he is.

713
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:40,103
- You mean...
- Poof!

714
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:41,233
What?

715
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:43,011
He disappeared.

716
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:56,951
