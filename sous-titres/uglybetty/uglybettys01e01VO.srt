1
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,002
I like your poncho.

2
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,873
My dad got me one
in Guadalajara.

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,845
Milan. Dolce & Gabbana. Fall.

4
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:30,604
Betty Suarez?

5
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,993
Hi. That's me.

6
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,873
Um, I have a hard copy of
my resume if you need it.

7
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:38,573
Should I follow you?

8
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:43,016
Actually... there's
been a mistake.

9
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,292
A mistake?

10
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:48,760
All the entry-level positions
we were hiring for...

11
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:50,785
they've been filled.

12
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,479
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,741
Um, sir? While you got me here,

14
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,913
I thought I could tell
you a little about myself.

15
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,973
Magazines are my passion,
ever since I was a kid,

16
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:06,251
and I can't imagine
a more amazing place

17
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,931
to start my career than
Meade Publications.

18
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,960
I know most of your
magazines inside out.

19
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:12,692
I try to devour
as much as I can.

20
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,010
Clearly.

21
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:17,560
Also, I've learned so
much through them.

22
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,513
You know,
stuff so beyond my world, like--

23
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:21,950
like who the up-and-comers are
on the London art scene, or--

24
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,601
or what the political machinations
in Darfur are all about,

25
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,693
or which Bali Resort is considered
the most romantic in the world.

26
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,613
And I have tons of ideas.

27
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:32,052
I'm always jotting stuff
down on the subway.

28
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:33,681
But I'm getting
ahead of myself, sir.

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,880
- All I really want is a chance...
- Good-bye!

30
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,653
...in any position or publication--
I can type 100 words a minute!

31
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,951
I hate telenovelas.

32
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,020
I wanna watch Fashion TV.

33
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:07,480
Justin, you can watch
Fashion TV later

34
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:09,352
when your aunt Betty
is babysitting, okay?

35
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:10,573
Come have some flan.


36
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,152
I don't want flan.

37
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,202
I'll get fat.

38
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,213
Honey, you're a boy.

39
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,633
It doesn't matter if
you're fat or not.

40
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,480
Betty, did you order
dad's birthday cake?

41
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:25,402
Of course. Chocolate volcano,
same one I got last year.

42
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,663
So... how was your interview?

43
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:32,120
Um... I think it
was really good.

44
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:34,300
I mean, they were impressed.

45
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,851
You didn't get it.

46
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:38,801
Well, they said that they had
hired everyone they needed.

47
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,290
I don't understand...

48
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,342
you're sharp, you're prepared.

49
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,953
Someone should have begged
you to work for them

50
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:45,392
the day you graduated
Queens College.

51
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:49,163
Betty, have you thought about
exploring other options?

52
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,831
Hilda, I am not going
to sell Herbalux.

53
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:54,061
Well, I wasn't saying that...

54
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,060
necessarily.

55
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,691
- Dad.
- This career is Betty's dream.

56
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:04,492
Okay, but I hear somebody else
has some pretty big dreams, too.

57
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,091
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:10,031
Justin, tell your aunt Betty what her
boyfriend was saying the other night.

59
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,561
Walter was on his cell phone
talking to someone, and he said,

60
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,850
"she's the one."

61
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,660
He wants to marry you?

62
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:19,322
He does?

63
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,933
Well, would you do it?

64
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,282
Well, I mean--
we haven't talked about that yet, but--

65
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:26,572
Well, I think he's
a catch. Flan?

66
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:29,161
That's him.

67
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:36,431
Hi, Ignacio, Hilda. Hi, Betty.

68
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:37,760
Hey.

69
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:38,973
Here.

70
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,621
It's a return. The mute doesn't work,
but it sounds awesome.

71
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:44,202
Thank you.

72
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:51,412
Uh...

73
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,163
- Betty, can we talk?
- Yes.

74
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,792
Sure.

75
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:00,763
Oh,  um, outside. Yeah, okay.

76
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:14,943
Celebrity-studded funeral services
were held today for Fey Sommers,

77
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,981
the much loved and
hated editor in chief

78
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:20,952
of fashion bible
"Mode" magazine.

79
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,621
It was the bitch slap
heard 'round the world

80
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:27,032
when longtime "Mode" creative
director Wilhelmina Slater

81
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:31,121
was passed over for the top
spot in favor of Daniel Meade,

82
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:34,853
the nominally experienced son
of Meade Publications owner

83
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,490
Bradford Meade.

84
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:39,331
Can the notorious manwhore

85
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,790
translate his talent
at bedding women

86
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,982
into dressing them?

87
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:01,811
How do you like
your new office?

88
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,781
You scared me. Um...

89
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:06,371
would you just, uh,
give me a few minutes? There's some--

90
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:10,300
some things I need to
wrap up before I leave.

91
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:15,683
Interesting decorating motif.

92
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:21,382
You can get up.
He knows you're there.

93
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,932
I'd like to introduce
you my new assistant...

94
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,340
Charmaine.

95
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,331
I'm sorry to interrupt
your... dictation,

96
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:38,221
but this is not the
way you run a magazine.

97
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:40,890
What?

98
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm in love with someone else.

99
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,022
But...

100
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,851
How? I...

101
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:51,881
I mean, I thought we...

102
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,091
Well, who is it?

103
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:04,712
- Gina Gambarro?
- I'm sorry, I...

104
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,652
- I...
- No.

105
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:09,741
You don't have to
say anything else.

106
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,082
Good luck, Betty,

107
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:17,041
with everything.

108
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,080
Are you feeling any better?

109
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,780
I'm fine.

110
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:43,653
Hello?

111
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,871
Some  guy from
Meat Publications.

112
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,513
Meade?

113
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,581
This is Betty Suarez.

114
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,630
Are you serious?

115
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,780
Yeah! I--
yeah, of course I-I can start tomorrow.

116
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:01,050
Um, what magazine is this for?

117
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,582
"Mode"?

118
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,510
Yeah, I'll be there first
thing in the morning.

119
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,790
Okay!

120
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:10,690
Thank you.

121
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,072
Bye!

122
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:16,042
Assistant to the
editor in chief!

123
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,412
I didn't know you wanted
to work for "Mode."

124
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:21,481
Well, this wouldn't have
been my first choice, but...

125
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:25,153
if I do good here, 
I can go anywhere in the company.

126
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,232
Well, just try and
dress fashionably.

127
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:31,360
Do have anything?

128
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,532
Actually, I do.

129
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:44,543
Oh, my god.

130
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,683
Hi. You the "before"?

131
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:52,321
Before and after--
the photo shoot.

132
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:57,241
Are you delivering something?

133
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,321
Oh, no! No.

134
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:01,622
I-I work here.

135
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,282
F or?

136
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,312
For the new editor in chief.

137
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,003
So everyone's in
the conference room,

138
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,000
and Daniel's about to start
his first staff meeting.

139
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,871
- I'm Amanda, by the way.
- Betty.

140
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:18,322
Okay, F.Y.I., Betsy, assistants are
usually here before their bosses.

141
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,761
Oh, well,
I was filling out paperwork in H.R.

142
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,003
Yeah, just don't
let it happen again.

143
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:25,540
So, uh, where do you come from?

144
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:26,815
Queens.

145
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,539
What job did you have?

146
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:33,031
Oh, actually, apart from internships
and part-time jobs to pay for school,

147
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,970
this is my first real job.

148
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,242
That's funny.

149
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:40,052
I was told I didn't have enough
experience for the position.

150
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:41,403
It's over there.

151
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:49,082
You are an attractive, intelligent,
confident businesswoman.

152
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:52,850
So I gotta confess-- I'm probably
not gonna remember everyone's names,

153
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,601
and I'm really, uh...

154
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,220
Are you okay?

155
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:03,861
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm so sorry.

156
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,242
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:10,513
Anyway, uh, I wish I wasn't--

158
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:16,922
Uh, I wish I wasn't coming in as a new
guy under such terrible circumstances.

159
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,571
I realize I have
some awful big...

160
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,091
teeth--shoes to fill,

161
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,973
but I can't tell you how
excited I am to be working

162
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:28,750
with such an amazingly
talented and dedicated staff.

163
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,032
Now I'd like to take the
moment to talk a little

164
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,151
- about some of the ideas--
- So sorry I'm late.

165
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,103
Oh, you began without me.

166
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,972
- Sorry, Wilhelmina, I waited--
- Shh! Marc...

167
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,391
gift.

168
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:46,642
Thank you.
As I was saying, I really wanna--

169
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,662
Well, aren't you gonna open it?

170
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:57,903
Swarovski crystal,
to commemorate your first day.

171
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,400
Thank you.

172
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,523
But it is "Daniel,"
not "Danny."

173
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,762
What?

174
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:05,250
I'm hellaciously upset, Marc.

175
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:06,611
Oh, my god, I am so sorry.

176
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:09,441
Shh! Purge this from
memory, please.

177
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:12,570
As I was saying, it's a particularly
exciting time for me because--

178
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:15,701
I think we need to discuss the
Fabia Cosmetics supplement.

179
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,881
Fabia Cosmetics?

180
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:20,800
The biggest ad buy of the year, and the
only paid layout editorial ever works on.

181
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:24,143
Well, I'm sure Fabia will love
whatever we come up with, right?

182
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,493
Daniel, you--you
don't understand.

183
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,643
Given the new circumstances,

184
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:32,941
Fabia needs to sign off on the
spread before we go to print.

185
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,790
Obviously, we're all here
to help you succeed,

186
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,200
and we've got plenty of ideas.

187
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,330
So I think we all need to get back
to work to make sure that this--

188
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:44,881
your very first issue with
your name on the masthead--

189
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,171
sparkles.

190
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,793
Okay, everyone,
let's not dillydally.

191
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,842
Our editor needs us.

192
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,743
- Killer poncho.
- Thanks!

193
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,461
Mr. Meade?

194
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,942
Excuse me, um, Mr. Meade?

195
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,062
Hi.

196
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,661
Um, I just wanted to come and
introduce myself personally.

197
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,031
I'm Betty Suarez.

198
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,553
It's a-a pleasure to meet you.

199
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:18,362
Hi, Betty. Um, um...

200
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:19,800
who do you work for?

201
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:22,991
Well, um, I work for you.

202
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,913
I'm your new assistant.

203
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:29,261
Did you get the crease
under the hairline?

204
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,942
Yes, Willie.

205
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:35,381
20 years, Marc.
No one has done more, worked harder...

206
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,491
I have bled for this magazine,

207
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,640
helped make it into
the icon it is today,

208
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:44,150
and that nasty, nepotistic son of
a bitch gives my job to his...

209
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:45,502
His  son.

210
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:50,312
Who's a self-absorbed, lothario punk
who knows nothing about fashion!

211
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,062
Tell me the truth--

212
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,032
is it because I'm getting old?

213
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,613
Absolutely not. Ugh!

214
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,840
Though you could do with a tad
bit more between the brows.

215
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:04,921
So what are you gonna do?

216
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,170
Just wait and see.

217
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:09,181
Well, he's well on his way
to falling flat on his face.

218
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:11,330
I mean,
can you believe that assistant?

219
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:14,832
This is "Mode,"
not "Dog Fancy."

220
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,792
Done.

221
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:23,111
What do you want me to do with the,
uh... leftover?

222
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:24,833
All yours.

223
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,110
Give me a moment, Marc.

224
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,822
How are you
recovering, darling?

225
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:38,550
Well, I'm sure
you'll feel better

226
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:42,851
once, uh,
everything here starts coming to a boil.

227
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:53,382
Here.

228
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,392
Oh, thank you.

229
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,573
What are you doing?

230
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:59,333
Um, I'm just gathering
information on Fabia for Daniel.

231
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,450
Ugh, she is so
fabulously douchey.

232
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:03,731
Who's he in with?

233
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,783
Oh, um, Phillippe Michel.

234
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,062
He's a photographer.

235
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:10,132
Oh. He's doing the supplement,
isn't he?

236
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,433
Oh, he's amazing.
He's shot, like, everything.

237
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:16,381
Yeah, I think-- you know, it looks
like they're really good friends.

238
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,243
Oh, well,
there had been some drama.

239
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,872
Daniel hooked up with Phillippe's
ex-girlfriend a couple of years ago.

240
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,741
But they're fine now.

241
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:26,200
Yeah, we went out for,
like, a week.

242
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,353
And they don't call him "the
tripod" because he's a photographer,

243
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,600
if you catch my drift.

244
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,743
This is crap.

245
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:36,523
No.

246
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:38,261
No.

247
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,671
Too down, too out.

248
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,222
Can't go there.

249
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:43,953
All this is terrible.

250
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,401
That's what I thought.

251
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,692
Phillippe, can I trust
you with something?

252
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,111
Of course, Daniel.

253
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,030
You know you're like
a brother to me.

254
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:54,280
I don't think anyone wants me here,
especially Wilhelmina.

255
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,793
Well, that's no secret.

256
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,971
I think she's trying to take me in the
wrong direction with this Fabia layout.

257
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,752
Do you have any ideas?

258
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,910
Like, a million,

259
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,990
but keep things on the Q.T.

260
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:07,380
Most of these people are
still loyal to Wilhelmina,

261
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:10,120
and you don't want them
mucking things up.

262
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:15,012
Um, sorry to interrupt,
but can I get you lunch?

263
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,150
No, no,
but you go ahead. Thanks.

264
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,810
Hi, I'm a really
big fan of yours.

265
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:25,072
That travel layout you
did with the tiki torches,

266
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:28,603
wow, that was--
that was really gorgeous.

267
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,612
Thank you.

268
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:32,620
Yeah, it kind of reminded
me of this Hiroaki spread

269
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,253
I'd seen a couple of years ago.

270
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:43,043
Hey, listen, I don't know who
you are or what you're implying,

271
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:46,692
but, um, I would never use
another photographer's idea.

272
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:50,743
Oh, no, no! No, no, I wasn't--
I wasn't saying... um...

273
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,921
I-I should go.

274
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,691
What's the story here?

275
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,830
I know the type of
women you hire.

276
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:06,890
My father made me.

277
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:08,901
You're kidding me?

278
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:11,832
Look, she appears to
be good, capable--

279
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:16,773
Fugly! Listen to me, you are the
editor in chief of "Mode" magazine.

280
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,651
This business is all image. 

281
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,801
Is that what you want
representing you?

282
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,470
Paparazzi taking your pictures,
and she's standing behind?

283
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, I can't fire
her, Phillippe.

284
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:27,071
Well...

285
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:29,121
what if she quits?

286
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,060
And how do I get
her to do that?

287
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,030
You beat her down...

288
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,723
to a pulp.

289
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,702
Hey,  you.

290
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,893
Betty, right?

291
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,361
Daniel Meade's new assistant?

292
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:09,563
Yeah. How did you know that?

293
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:12,272
Oh, everybody knows
everything around here.

294
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,772
I'm Christina.
I work in the closet.

295
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:15,911
The closet? What--

296
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,643
Mm-hmm, where all
the clothes are kept.

297
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:21,031
I act as an in-house seamstress,
sort of track of things.

298
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,293
Sometimes, they even let me keep some
of the crappy stuff from last season,

299
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:28,461
but, you know, I have to improvise
'cause everything is a size zero!

300
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,292
- Voila.
- Nice.

301
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,820
Anyway, well, I like it.
Mostly 'cause I'm by myself,

302
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,563
- away from all the chic-ees.
- The chic-ees?

303
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah, the bitches
that work at "Mode."

304
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,731
Hey, girls!

305
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,420
Zelda, Nancy, this is Betty.

306
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,641
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

307
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:47,441
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

308
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,403
It's the bizarro version
of "Sex and the City."

309
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,892
Stop it, I'm gagging!

310
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,981
Funny, you look like any
old schlub sitting here,

311
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,542
feeding these stupid pigeons.

312
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:11,123
I doubt if any old schlub
would be feeding them

313
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,963
artisanal pain de mie
they made themselves.

314
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:15,460
There's nothing to worry about.

315
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,292

She's gone.

316
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:20,100
Weren't you sitting
front row at the funeral?

317
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,210
Closed casket.

318
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:26,082
Double... triple-check.

319
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:28,460
The things Fey
Sommers knew about me,

320
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,373
about the company...

321
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:31,953
I'm on it.

322
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,330
Hi, Betty.
There's a problem with my lunch.

323
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,643
Okay.

324
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:41,202
I love cole slaw.
I hate cabbage.

325
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:44,141
But cole slaw is...

326
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:48,380
No, no, no. No, I know. I just--
I-I like the--the tart, tangy dressing.

327
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,250
Can you do something
about it...

328
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,860
Before it gets to
room temperature?

329
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:59,630
# She works hard for the money #

330
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,092
# So hard for it, honey #

331
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,662
# She works hard for the money #

332
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:09,022
# So you better treat her right #

333
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,221
Hello?

334
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:13,273
Hi, Daniel.

335
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,163
# So hard for it, honey #

336
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:19,772
# She works hard for the money #

337
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:23,993
# So you better treat her right #

338
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:28,432
# Onetta there in the corner stands #

339
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:32,033
# And she wonders where she is #

340
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,222
# And it's strange to her #

341
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:37,923
# Some people seem #
# to have everything #

342
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:42,770
Hi.

343
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,422
Betty, where are you?

344
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,242
I'm still working.

345
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,222
You forgot, didn't you?

346
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:50,813
Oh, my god, dad's birthday.

347
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:53,393
Yeah, I was busy.

348
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:02,442
Look, I gotta go, okay?
I'll get home as soon as I can.

349
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:10,371
Um, yeah, the, uh...
the red turkey is on the move.

350
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:11,593
Hold on...

351
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,851
it's work stuff.

352
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,291
Will ya sleep over
another night?

353
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:17,743
Sure.

354
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,863
So, uh,
when's this position gonna open?

355
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:27,131
Oh, hopefully, very, very soon.

356
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:30,571
Oh, okay.
Well, uh, good night...

357
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,802
boss.

358
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:37,732
Bye!

359
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,460
- Hey.
- Hi.

360
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,821
Do you--do you need
anything else?

361
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:49,051
Why don't you stick around for a little
bit, make sure everything's okay?

362
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,403
Yeah.

363
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,761
Okay, no--no problem.

364
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,770
Perfect timing.

365
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:25,203
Oh, Walter!
You're such a big boy.

366
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,740
He's sleeping.

367
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,690
Hilda, I know...

368
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,693
Do you realize this is the
first time since mom died

369
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,610
that we haven't all been
together on his birthday?

370
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,710
Yes, I realize that,
and I am sorry,

371
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,320
- but I was working--
- It's fine, Betty.

372
00:20:56,947 --> 00:21:00,550
I just hope it's all worth it.

373
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,633
We saved you a piece of cake.

374
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,823
It's in the fridge.

375
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:53,461
Oh, this photo shoot is
gonna be absolutely sick.

376
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:57,910
Best supplement we've ever
done for Fabia by far.

377
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:07,321
Oh, yeah,
I'm--I'm on my way to set as we speak.

378
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,242
Hello?

379
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:15,332
It's a really
exciting day, huh?

380
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:17,571
I mean, with the photo shoot.

381
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:21,423
Hey, Daniel, I know you're
really overwhelmed right now,

382
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:24,632
but I was wondering,
there was something that I just...

383
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,430
Daniel, you know, I was wondering 
if you had a quick moment--

384
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:34,252
Do I look like I have
a "quick moment"?

385
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,582
No.

386
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,141
So sorry.

387
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:39,510
Damn it!
They forgot one of the outfits.

388
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,981
Go up to the closet
and bring it to set.

389
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,152
Please?

390
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:58,273
Feel the fabric on that thing.

391
00:22:58,286 --> 00:22:59,721
It's  kind of rough.

392
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,342
That's because it's burlap.

393
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:05,430
Basically, you're talking $7,000
for a designer potato sack.

394
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:07,591
I can't believe people
actually buy this stuff.

395
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:08,920
I can't believe they wear it.

396
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:12,791
And usually just once before they'll
chuck it to make room for the
next season.

397
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,452
But that's fashion,

398
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:17,530
and I've got to say, I love it.

399
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:21,441
Oh, you're not too much into it,
are you?

400
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:23,461
Um, no.

401
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:24,791
Not really.

402
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,861
So how's it going?

403
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:29,881
Um...

404
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:34,022
Brutal, huh?

405
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,643
Well, nothing I do
is good enough.

406
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:42,601
He treats me like dirt.

407
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:48,821
I mean, just now I was trying to
show him this one idea that I had...

408
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:52,093
It would've taken him
30 seconds, but...

409
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:54,153
he bit my head off.

410
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:57,701
What?

411
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:59,551
Betty...

412
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:02,613
Nancy was down in
human resources, and...

413
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,700
some people there were talking,
and, uh...

414
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:10,533
well, apparently, Bradford was
the one that wanted to hire you.

415
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,371
Bradford Meade?

416
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,371
Wait, he knows who I am?

417
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,170
He made Daniel hire you...

418
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,812
'cause he didn't want
his son to be tempted

419
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,910
to sleep with his
assistants anymore.

420
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,402
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Betty.

421
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,781
- No, that--that explains a lot.
- Betty--

422
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:35,151
No, no, really, it's fine. I should
be grateful that I got my break.

423
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:37,583
It's not so easy for everyone.

424
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:42,343
This is just how it was
supposed to happen for me.

425
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:45,253
Well, I should be going, so...

426
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:47,673
Thank you.

427
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:21,360
Oh! So, uh, I was just on my lunch
break, and I thought I'd stop by.

428
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,071
This is really amazing.

429
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,853
Thank you, Amanda.

430
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:26,960
And if you need anything...

431
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,823
Traffic or hangover?

432
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:30,832
Did--did anyone read
the contract to her?

433
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:33,011
She needs to be here
for the test shots!

434
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,580
Hey, what's going on?

435
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:37,293
Izabela, the brazilian model...
she's late.

436
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,332
This is a crazy,
complicated shoot, and I need her

437
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:42,232
dressed and ready... right now.

438
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:44,673
Phillippe, they're test shots.
Let's just use the stand-in.

439
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:47,171
No, no, she's too specific. I need
someone with her--with her skin tone.

440
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:48,983
Someone like...

441
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:51,713
her.

442
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,062
Funny.

443
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:56,841
I bet you she quits
before she does it.

444
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,102
Whoops, excuse me.

445
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:06,753
Betty! Oh,
I am so glad you're here.

446
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,912
Listen, we have a crisis and
we really need your help.

447
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:10,790
Okay.

448
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,560
Uh, one of our models
didn't show up.

449
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:16,733
We really need someone to
stand in for her in wardrobe.

450
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:20,131
Um, so...

451
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:22,282
you want--you want me to do it?

452
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,763
Well?

453
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,913
Well-- this...
is what you want me to do?

454
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:33,611
Yeah!

455
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,350
Well, it looks like
she finally quit.

456
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:51,313
Good.

457
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:56,542
Smart ass had no business working
for you in the first... place.

458
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,190
# Please allow me to #
# introduce myself #

459
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,501
# My name is superstar #

460
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:05,772
# Short for nothing #

461
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,451
Where do you want me?

462
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:15,363
Right... there is fine.

463
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:18,242
I see a shadow. Can you move
that light over to the right?

464
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,290
Thank you.

465
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,242
Movement, ladies. Movement.

466
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,683
Sexy.

467
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:24,763
More, more.

468
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,231
Give me more.

469
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:29,113
Okay, you're devouring
the camera with your eyes.

470
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:37,211
Give me a little more
coquette, Betty.

471
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,640
Stop it.

472
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,623
Stop it.

473
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,402
Betty, wait!

474
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,602
This is what you wanted,
isn't it,

475
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:04,063
to humiliate me
and make me quit?

476
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:08,433
God forbid you had to work with the
ugly girl your dad forced you to hire.

477
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:11,333
Well, congratulations.

478
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,533
Chamomile?

479
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,190
Thank you, Justin.

480
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,051
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

481
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,462
It happens.

482
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:42,483
Mom said she wasn't surprised.

483
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:43,900
Hilda said that?

484
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,732
She said all the
stuff you wanna do,

485
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:49,330
owning a magazine,
doesn't happen for people like us

486
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,282
unless you're J.
Lo or something.

487
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:56,020
She said she wishes you'd
be more realistic, but...

488
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,921
I think she's full of crap.

489
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:08,402
- Hold this.
- What...

490
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,252
what are you doing?

491
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:23,941
I just wanna say that
this is really unfair.

492
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,913
I live two doors down!

493
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:27,372
I can see you!

494
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,161
What the hell you doing?

495
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:32,703
Um... where's Walter?

496
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,370
It's over.

497
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:37,872
Look, Walter--
he's sweet and everything--

498
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:41,263
but I told him from the start I
wasn't looking for anything serious.

499
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:45,423
And he said fine, he could still
get me 30% off a flat screen.

500
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,122
You used him for his discount?

501
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:50,823
Oh, he offered.

502
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,260
Bitch!

503
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,432
You broke my plasma!

504
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:06,162
We're so thrilled to
have you here, Fabia.

505
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:11,502
Now, why don't we let the
pictures speak for themselves?

506
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,162
Smettila!

507
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,021
This is freaking joke, right?

508
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:41,113
Uh, no.

509
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:42,860
You stupido.

510
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:45,492
All of you, stupido!

511
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,991
Idiots, idiots!

512
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:01,442
What--what just happened?!

513
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,750
Well...

514
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:08,331
Fabia's probably still a little
sensitive about the accident.

515
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,273
Accident?

516
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,640
Oh, you didn't know.

517
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,772
About a month ago, she backed her S.U.V.
into 12 people outside Marquee.

518
00:31:18,197 --> 00:31:20,233
I was in Saint-Tropez.

519
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:21,842
I had no idea.

520
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:24,561
Why--why didn't
anyone say anything?

521
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:28,543
Daniel, if I may,
you didn't include me in the concept.

522
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:31,262
And we all thought you
knew what you were doing.

523
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:37,893
Fabia's not just talking about
canceling... the "Mode" supplement.

524
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:44,300
She's considering... Pulling advertising 
from every single one of my magazines.

525
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:47,432
Is it true you worked
on this on your own,

526
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,321
didn't consult Wilhelmina
or anyone else?

527
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:50,653
Look, I can explain.

528
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:54,833
I had--I had a very strong feeling
she was trying to sabotage me.

529
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:58,720
The only person who
sabotaged you was yourself.

530
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:00,333
Sorry I let you down.

531
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:03,900
Well, I'm sorry I keep hoping you'll
be something you're clearly not.

532
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:06,381
- My leg is cramping.
- Look, I can fix this.

533
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,431
I'll just present her
with a whole new idea.

534
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:09,971
We just closed book.
It's too late.

535
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:12,810
Tomorrow morning. Please.

536
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,233
Give me another chance.

537
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:17,982
Daniel called again
looking for you.

538
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:22,451
What part of "unavailable"
does he not understand?

539
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:24,561
I'll let him know.

540
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:29,293
He really should've
come to me earlier.

541
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:33,372
It wouldn't have made any
difference now, would it?

542
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,240
Not really.

543
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,721
To teamwork.

544
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:39,633
To revenge.

545
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,710
He has a heart condition.

546
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:37,271
Yes, he--he needs
his medication.

547
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:42,351
But you can't just cover the pills
and then randomly decide to stop.

548
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:46,773
But it's--it's a real person's health,
it's not a case number.

549
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:49,572
Give me the phone.
I'll let 'em have it.

550
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:53,402
No. No, I don't wanna hold again.
Not again.

551
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,601
No, just wait--

552
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:04,242
It's fine. We'll just--
we'll get 'em tomorrow. It's fine.

553
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:05,930
Thank you, mi amor.

554
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,832
You're so much better at dealing with
this bureaucratic stuff than I am.

555
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,491
No, you know I don't mind.

556
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,760
I know.

557
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:13,543
You're always so good to me.

558
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:17,870
So strong,
determined, optimistic...

559
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,702
just like your mother was.

560
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:30,733
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

561
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:31,702
I've been busy.

562
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:35,272
Betty, I need to talk to you.
I made a terrible mistake.

563
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:38,921
Wait, did you realize this
before or after Gina dumped you?

564
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:41,123
What? No, no,
I broke up with her.

565
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:45,923
Betty, it was wrong,
and I wanna make this up to you. I--

566
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:47,862
Betty.

567
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,443
Are you dating someone?

568
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,732
Walter, please go!

569
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,240
Dating this guy?

570
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,431
Look, you need to go.
Please. You need to go.

571
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,051
But, Betty, I-I...

572
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:00,743
What are you doing here?

573
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,500
I wanna talk.

574
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,212
It's a nice place.

575
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:11,553
Yeah, we're just in
between interior designers.

576
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,360
- Really?
- No.

577
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,103
Oh, right. It's a joke.

578
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,451
Betty, I am so sorry.

579
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,882
You didn't deserve what
I put you through.

580
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:29,153
I-I listened to all the wrong people
about a lot of things, and...

581
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:31,842
I have no one to
blame but myself.

582
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:37,311
Well, I appreciate
that, Daniel.

583
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,720
But you're going to leave here,

584
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,793
and you're going to take your
town car back to your soho loft,

585
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,572
and I'm still gonna be here--

586
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:45,972
out of work

587
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:49,073
and dealing with problems
that you'll never understand.

588
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,922
Try me.
Betty, come on, we've all got problems.

589
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:53,993
Oh, and what are yours, Daniel,

590
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:58,252
what restaurant you're gonna eat at,
which model you're gonna sleep with?

591
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:02,351
Try spending the day on the
phone with some crappy H.M.O.,

592
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,561
getting them to cover
your dad's prescriptions.

593
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:07,752
Or try lining up
a job--any job--

594
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,551
'cause you have to help
pay the rent next month.

595
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,201
Look...

596
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:15,683
I lost a brother a while back.

597
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:20,161
He was the good one in our family,
and I've never quite measured up.

598
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:22,062
But I am trying.

599
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,710
Betty, I--I could never
compare my problems to yours,

600
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,671
but they're mine.

601
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:31,350
Nothing's ever easy.

602
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:39,142
I saw the layout
you made for Fabia.

603
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:40,913
You did?

604
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:43,250
I thought it was very smart

605
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,401
and beautiful.

606
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:47,383
Well, thank you.

607
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:50,662
I want to take your
ideas to Fabia,

608
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,963
giving you credit, of course.

609
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:57,182
And I really want you to come back,
be my assistant.

610
00:36:57,196 --> 00:37:00,350
I promise you things
will be different.

611
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:06,232
I--Daniel, I--I mean,
I-I really have to think about that.

612
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,250
Well... you have tonight,

613
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:15,763
otherwise, I'll probably
be out of a job as well.

614
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:36,601
Did you hear that?

615
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,931
Every word.

616
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:51,281
So... where the hell is he?

617
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:53,343
He said 10:00 a.m.

618
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:59,650
Well, Fabia...
on behalf of the entire magazine,

619
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,031
ci perdoni.

620
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:05,232
This whole thing has
been unacceptable.

621
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,512
Marc.

622
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:10,363
Now that I have a moment of your time,
I'd like to show you some of my ideas.

623
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,060
Sorry we're late.

624
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:18,012
There was obviously no time
for a new photo shoot, so, uh,

625
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:21,250
what we're gonna be showing
you is just a rough idea.

626
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:26,643
Oh! Uh, wait.
No, this is--this is not the right file.

627
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:29,520
Um, just one sec--one second.

628
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:31,143
This is it.

629
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:37,500
Um... in order to show the
softer side of Fabia Cosmetics,

630
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,021
we're going to use the concept
of mothers and daughters,

631
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:44,690
focusing on the small,
special moments that--

632
00:38:44,707 --> 00:38:47,113
that are usually
taken for granted,

633
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:52,391
the theme being, "it's not the big
events... but the little moments"
that matter.

634
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,653
I just had a daughter.

635
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,301
I do none of those things...

636
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,713
but I can understand.

637
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:04,290
What makes you think this is
going to appeal to my customers?

638
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:14,063
Um. Well, if--if I may,
I do have the statistics here.

639
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:18,180
Um, though one might assume that
your demographic is very young,

640
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:21,190
in fact, there's been tremendous
brand loyalty since you've launched,

641
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,521
which means that the
people who were teenagers

642
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,233
when they began
using your cosmetics,

643
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:28,561
well, now, like you,
they are...

644
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:30,932
beginning to settle down
and have children--

645
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:34,411
um, 58% to be exact.

646
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:37,113
And you could do this in time?

647
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,712
Of course.

648
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:43,001
Uh, did you want to approve the, uh,
uh, models and images beforehand?

649
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:46,812
Nah. Just make sure
it's not too sappy.

650
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:51,163
Do a picture where they're pulling
their hair or biting each other.

651
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:52,920
So that's nice.

652
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:54,733
Now I go.

653
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,820
Good work.

654
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:06,681
- Oh, the idea was actually--
- His best one, don't you think?

655
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:11,122
Indeed.

656
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:13,291
Welcome back, boss.

657
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:14,960
Marc.

658
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:31,282
I'm very unhappy.

659
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:33,243
It's a setback.

660
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:35,261
But it's just a matter of time.

661
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,942
Once he's out of the picture,

662
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:39,782
the company will be
ours for the taking.

663
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:41,982
Considering the way
everything's played out,

664
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:47,023
it seems to me that you should keep
an eye on that damn ugly assistant.

665
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:50,062
What's her name?

666
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,491
Betty.

667
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:54,031
- Betty.
- Betty.

668
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:55,323
Betty.

669
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:57,393
Betty! Betty.

670
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,990
Oh, Christina,
thank you again, so much.

671
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:03,601
No, no, no. Go. Go.

672
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,801
You should've let me tell
him it was your idea.

673
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:12,951
Don't worry.
I will the next time.

674
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:15,550
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

675
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,370
So I've confirmed your
lunch for tomorrow

676
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:20,521
and your 3:15 with the
graphics department is set.

677
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:22,520
- The feature editor would like--
- Betty...

678
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:25,622
Tomorrow morning. It's okay.

679
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:29,032
Good night.

680
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:37,933
# Well, her face is a map of the world #
# Is a map of the world #

681
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:42,350
# You can see she's a beautiful girl #
# She's a beautiful girl #

682
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:45,092
# Suddenly I see #
# Suddenly I see #

683
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,000
# This is what I wanna be #

684
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:50,290
# Suddenly I see #
# Suddenly I see #

685
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,091
# Why the hell it #
# means so much to me #

686
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:57,270
# Suddenly I see #
# This is what I wanna be... #
