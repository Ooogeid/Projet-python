3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,100
hilda,I'm so sorry,but it has to
be my last shampoo. I gotta go.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,810
Betty,take it easy. I like it
ugh,but only on the weekends...

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,690
if you know what I mean.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,870
<font color=#38B0DE>ugly betty S04E03</font>

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,500
Sorry,sammy,but I gotta get going.
I'm just anxious out getting to work.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,950
Aunt betty,don't worry about it.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,170
I'll just stay home
from school and help out.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,420
I'm not double-booking haircuts to make
money to get you into private school

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,480
just so you can get rejected
'cause you're too stupid

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,670
'cause you skipped public school.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,730
re we go,ladies. A little
dulce and cafecito on the house.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,230
Hey,sammy. Betty ll you
about the big promotion?

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,670
No,what big promotion?

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,410
Yeah,well,I-I got promoted to
associate features editor at "mode."

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,340
But don't you worry. I will be
back to assistant in no time.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,760
Mija,don't talk like that.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,850
Sit up. Well,it's true.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,140
My first issue as
editor is going to print,

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,110
and I am the only one
without anything in it.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,300
Plus,matt is killing all of my pitches
and basically making my life impossible.

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
You know you're hurting me,right?

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,000
Matt is a spoiled bitch.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,050
- mija! -
Hilda. - mom.

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm sorry. I'm just saying.

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,790
Everybody is all sweet
when you're in love,

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,310
but it's when
something bad happens--

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,570
that's when a person
shows their true colors.

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,460
I don't know who he is anymore.

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,580
Well,I don't know if you guys know this,

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,280
but currently,I'm working
in the fashion industry.

33
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,390
- What?
- Oh,yeah.

34
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm dointhe remodel on evan grant's
condo down in the west village.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,020
Evan grant?

36
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,430
The dolce & gabbana men's designer

37
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,980
who breathed life into
the fur-trimmed hoodie?

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,000
Must be. I heard him on the phone saying

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,200
he's leaving the dolce
and going to the gucci.

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,870
- What?
- Now that's supposed to be a secret,all right?

41
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,500
No one's supposed to know about that.

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,900
But let's be honest. Who the hell cares?

43
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,330
Oh,sammy.

44
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,520
If--if I could get the
first published interview

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,380
with the new creative director at gucci,

46
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
do you know what that
would do for me at work?

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,480
Well,maybe sammy can hook you up with
the guy,and you can ask him all about it.

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,290
Yes.

49
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,710
Betty,sammy promised to "hook me up"
with a salon chair two months ago.

50
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,480
You see it here?

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,320
Well,anything you could do,sammy.

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,100
I--it would-- it
would really help.

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,350
There are a lot of people
lining up for my job.

54
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,230
I don't want to make it any
easier for them. Thank you. Bye!

55
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,200
oh,my god. Wilhelmina is going to freak.

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,420
Claire and papa hartley
killed the cotton club shoot.

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,230
now baby hartley's calling
an emergency editor's meeting.

58
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,620
- Morning,guys.
- Hate you. Oh,yay.

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm so glad that i get to catch a rare
glimpse of the last living monchichi

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,990
waddling into a meeting
that i should be in.

61
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,150
You are,like,oozing self-pity
today. Something's up.

62
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,550
Oh,my god! Happy birthday!

63
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,350
We are not talking about that. Got it?

64
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,380
One more mention,and
heads will roll--

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,650
pretty blonde heads that
don't have their original nose.

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,250
Mean.

67
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,210
Ooh,ooh,sorry,betty. I
always sit here. Remember?

68
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,890
okay,um,matt.

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,180
Is there another chair?

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,200
Uh,oh,yeah. I asked for one for you.

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,320
Um,I guess that's all they had.

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,970
A beanbag?

73
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,090
You all right down there?

74
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,590
Yep. I'm fine.

75
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,390
How is betty the editor
of a fashion magazine?

76
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,570
That would be like me
being the editor of,like,

77
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,600
a mechanic's magazine or you
being the editor of a magazine.

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,490
Pick up your face.

79
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,660
Wait. You just totally slammed me.

80
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,610
At least you were
considered for the job.

81
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,080
Nobody around here
even takes me seriously.

82
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,350
Damn it. You just made
me think about my life.

83
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,490
with the cotton club shoot dead,that means
that there is an opening in this issue.

84
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,510
- So I'm gonna need--
- wait,I'm sorry.

85
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,560
Did you say an opening in this issue?

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,220
Uh,yes. That's what I said.

87
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,780
I will be taking pitches all
day. So I need good ideas.

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,770
But think cheap,okay? The
budget is only gonna be about...

89
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,280
uh,betty. Can you not text right now?

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,810
Yeah. No,I'm sorry.
It--it's business related.

91
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,030
See,I was shampooing this
guy's hair this morning,

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,290
and he said he might
have a story for us.

93
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,690
Well,it wasn't,like,a creepy shampoo.

94
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,010
My sister has a hair
salon,and it was just busy,

95
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,460
so she needed my help. I'm her
sister. What am I gonna say,no?

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,620
Okay,stop. We're uncomfortable.

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,100
Ay,so come to me whenever you have
your pitches. All right? Let's go.

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,500
Matt. Matt. Matt.

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,640
Yeah.

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,130
I think I might have a
pitch,actually. A pretty good one.

101
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,710
Nothing personal,but I can't take
"might" to wilhelmina. Thank you.

102
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,650
No,I know that. I
know. But you know what?

103
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,380
The way you said that,that
did feel a little personal,

104
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,730
and I would just
appreciate it--matt,

105
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,120
- don't-- -
okay,betty,don't--please--

106
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,650
look,I am trying to keep my
job here just like you are.

107
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,010
And I don't know if you realize this,

108
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,120
but your U.N. Fiasco
made us both look bad.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,990
So which one of us is
making this personal?

110
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,510
They are so in love,it's
disgusting. I want that.

111
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,980
Take it. I justant her job.

112
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,570
are we obsessed with betty?

113
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,880
Yes. and it's exhausting.

114
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,260
Oh,I know,and I'm sorry.

115
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,030
But that psychedelic misfit
toy is living my dream.

116
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,700
Would I let someone
take my dream from me?

117
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,850
Or would I find a way...

118
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,210
to take it back?

119
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,250
Oh,I never think to
destroy someone for me.

120
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,820
At's called low self-eeeM.

121
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,870
I can't believe this is still healing.

122
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,400
How hard did you hit him?

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
It was like his st
ble actually fought back.

124
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,270
Oh,no.

125
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,470
I can see you,daniel.

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,830
Hate my new desk.

127
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,630
Aren't you supposed to be at a
support group meeting right now?

128
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,090
Daniel,is that true?

129
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,360
I didn't want to go,all right?

130
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Some sad bereavement group is not
gonna help me get over molly's death.

131
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,750
That's not what I need right now.

132
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,530
What,support,guidance?

133
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,090
Care... shared experience--which
of these is the problem,daniel?

134
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,410
Come on. You're kinda trapping
me with your words there.

135
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,200
Daniel,this sort of thing
can't keep happening,

136
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,130
as much as I would like for you to
punch matt in the face again right now.

137
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,880
There is another meeting this afternoon.

138
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,780
If I find out that you're not there,I'm
gonna physically carry you myself. Got it?

139
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,910
Betty,did you know that editors' calls

140
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,230
get transferred to assistants
during editors' meetings?

141
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,450
Yep. I used to get 'em
when I worked for daniel.

142
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,590
Remember how iating it is? Please
hold for your pretty sister.

143
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,060
When you're done listening in on
bty's phone call,I need my coffee.

144
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,380
Hilda. Did you get my text?

145
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,140
Yeah,I got it. I called
sammy,and guess what.

146
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,610
The stupid goomba came through.

147
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,220
no! He did?

148
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,680
For you-- a big meeting with
a fancy designer today at 4:00.

149
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,410
For
me--nothing.

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,810
today! What?! This is amazing.

151
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,870
Hilda,if I can get this story,I
can get it in this issue.

152
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,450
what was that? ****

153
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,870
No. I-I don't know what that was.

154
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,270
You know what you do,right?

155
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,480
You go into matt's office and you
rub this in his spoiled rotten face.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,060
No way,jose. I am keeping
this one to myself.

157
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,730
If I want to keep my job,I
have to go around matt.

158
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,450
He's made that very clear.

159
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,760
All right,I will text you
the address. I gotta go.

160
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Okay. Thank you,thank
you,thank you,hilda. I love you!

161
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,460
It's about time. I'm
trying to find somebody

162
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,090
to cover a busboy shift
at the restaurant.,

163
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,910
Oo let me do it.

164
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,050
- What? - Yeah.
- No. - Why?

165
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,520
I said busboy. Not bus-you.

166
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,380
Papi,wait.

167
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,070
I really need the money to get
justin out of that awful school.

168
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,540
I promise you,I will do
such a good job. Ridiculous.

169
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,720
- Okay. For justin.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,510
Now get over tre early
so they can ain you.

171
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,190
please,papi. I think I know how to
take dirty plates off of a table.

172
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,480
Mizrahi's tv show,cindy
crawford's skin care line--

173
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,510
have I stepped io a time
warp? Is--is this the '90s?

174
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,160
Well,actually,you know,thosethings
are happening right now--

175
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,030
don't give me these tired pitches
to replace my canceled photo shoot.

176
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,150
Now I know fashion's
not really your thing,

177
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,270
but you can at least
try to fake it better.

178
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,240
we're done. Get out.

179
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,810
Please tell me some good
news. I'm not enjoying my day.

180
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,620
you are now. I found connor.

181
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,950
Feel like a trip to bermuda?

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,390
reyou' going down there now?

183
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,380
Well,what are you gonna
do,march up to him and say,

184
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,030
"hey,con,remember that
money you stole from 'mode'?

185
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,960
- Hand it over"?
- No,marc. I'm gonna make him an offer.

186
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,640
He can either come back to the U.S.

187
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,830
With my armed bounty hunter

188
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,780
and stand trial for his crimes,

189
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,030
or he can give me
what's left of the money,

190
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,210
and I can buy out hartley and the
meades and... you know the drill.

191
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,540
They're clearly trying to
push me out of this company.

192
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,200
I can see it in their old,droopy eyes.

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,910
Are you gonna be able to do this?

194
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,700
I mean,you did have
feelings for that man.

195
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,150
Whatever feelings I had,marc,won't
get in the way. I am no amateur.

196
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,720
Where is she off to,club a seal?

197
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,320
whatever. She's gone. It gives
me time to deal with suarez.

198
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,860
Apparently she's got some huge story
that's gonna save her ass at "mode.

199
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,120
" She has a meeting with
a mysterious "he" at 4:00.

200
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,230
Ooh. What's the story?

201
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,750
Doesn't matter. I'm not
gonna let her get it.

202
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,730
And if young betty doesn't
get something in soon,

203
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,500
her job is as good as mine.

204
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,880
Young betty? You mean
'cause you're older than her?

205
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,420
Okay,why don't you just kick
me? Kick me in the special parts.

206
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,730
No more birthday,got it? None.

207
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,060
happy birthday!

208
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,710
oh,my gosh. h-how'd you know?

209
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,750
I did office birthdays the
whole time i was an assistant.

210
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,720
But now that that's your job,I
thought I would do one more

211
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,940
because I knew you would
never get yourself a cake.

212
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,860
You get me. You really get me.

213
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,400
To be honest,I almost forgot just
because had a terrible morning.

214
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,980
But now I think it's
gonna be a great day,

215
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,810
and I hope it's gonna be great
for you,too,marc. Make a wish.

216
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,910
Daniel,swear to me that
you're really there.

217
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,060
I swear. How do you want me
to prove it to you? What...

218
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,830
excuse me. Will you please tell
my friend where I am right now?

219
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,240
Please.

220
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,820
A crappy school,support group.

221
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,980
This phone smells like cheese.

222
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,730
See? I'm gonna go to the whole thing.

223
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,050
It's gonna be really
good for you,daniel.

224
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,740
I know it's gonna be good
for me. Good-bye,betty.

225
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,930
oh,no,you don'T. Get back here.

226
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,150
Oh,hey. Uh...

227
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,320
you promised that person you'd stay.

228
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,060
You had me vouch for you.

229
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,500
Don't rope me in and then
make me seem like a liar.

230
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,120
It's rude.

231
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,390
Come on.

232
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,750
I had no idea I was gonna
be meeting him in his home.

233
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,190
I thought it was gonna be an
address for his office or something.

234
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,840
Well,the only way I
could get him down here

235
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,930
was I had to tell him he had
to pick a shower tile today

236
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,330
or the project was gonna
take another two weeks.

237
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,180
And he's a little ticked
off,but... so what?

238
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,230
The way you just said that,that sounds
like he doesn't know he's gonna meet me.

239
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,520
He doesn'T.

240
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,620
Okay,calm down.

241
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,550
You are a very impressive young lady.

242
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,400
You just be you,and he's gonna love you.

243
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,650
I have two minutes,sammy,two.

244
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,730
I've made a million decisions today. I
do not want to be doing this right now.

245
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,550
Here. Would you take this from me
before I throw it against the wall?

246
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,800
that's it? 12 shades of blue?

247
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,150
I cannot be doing this right now.

248
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,230
Would you--you-- somebody just decide.
Somebody just pick a tile for me.

249
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,670
Someone? Anyone?

250
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,630
Who the hell are you?

251
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,380
Hi. I'm betty suarez.

252
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,930
Um,work at "mode" magazine.

253
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,510
- "Mode"?
- "Mode."

254
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm a features editor there,and...

255
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,870
I was wondering if you would
leme do a story on your transition

256
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,290
from dolce & gabbana to gucci.

257
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,190
No,wait. How-- how do
you know about that?

258
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,770
Are people talking about that?
Is it out there? It can't be.

259
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,430
No,no,no,no. No one
knows. Just me. Just me.

260
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,920
What--I don't-- what
are you even doing here?

261
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,710
Don't look at me like that.
She's a good kid,all right?

262
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,400
She's a friend from the neighborhood.
She's just trying to save her job.

263
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,040
Oh,really? And how are
you gonna save your job?

264
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,780
Uh,no,no,mr. Grant.
Please don't fire sammy.

265
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,300
He was just trying to help me...

266
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,050
in a really weird way.

267
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm gonna leave you my card.

268
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,360
And you can call me if
you want. I hope you will.

269
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,980
Either way,it's fine.

270
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,210
I-I promise I will not
tell anyone about yourtory.

271
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,570
I can't even pick a tile.

272
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,490
How am I supposed to
decide in three seconds

273
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,360
if I should give my story to an
11-year-old editor who broke into my house?

274
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,650
Well,I would just put 'em all up.

275
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,130
I like all of the blues together.

276
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,440
Really?

277
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,010
Why do I like that?

278
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,230
Oh,becae I just stole your idea.

279
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,420
No,that's what you do when you show
your suits and you dress your models

280
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,570
in the same color shirt and
tie-- the blue on the blue,

281
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,910
the gray on the gray,just
slightly different shades--

282
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,190
which you said in your
2008 fashion week interview

283
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,420
was to bring attention
to the suit and not...

284
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
the tie and the... the shirt.

285
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,890
All right,we'll have dinner tonight,see
if we're a good match. If we are,great.

286
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,960
If not,you do not break in
to my house again. Got it?

287
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,420
Yeah.

288
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,450
Call my office.

289
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,580
An sammy,put them all up,blue on blue.

290
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,410
You got it.

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,700
you couldn't take it either?

292
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,500
Either? You're the one who
made me go back in there.

293
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,010
And I was right to. Those
etings are very helpful.

294
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,580
But?

295
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,620
- But this one sucked so hard.
- Thank you.

296
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,790
How about that chick who was wailg
about her 100-year-old grandmother

297
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,580
that feland broke her hip and got
pneumonia and died 2 days later?

298
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,800
I know. 2 days... at 100. It doesn't
sound like such a bad way to go.

299
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,120
Right? I mean,trying losing
somebody your own age.

300
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,450
Yeah.

301
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,270
You,too?

302
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,140
These doughnuts arold as hell.

303
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,570
What do you say I,uh,treat
us to me fresh ones?

304
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,540
I feel like I owe you.

305
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,490
What's all this about?

306
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm trying to figure out what
betty's big story is so I can kill it.

307
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,700
but I don't know her password.

308
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,180
- Try "burger. "
- I already did,

309
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,440
and "cupcake" and "menudo"
and "daniel's lady.

310
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,100
" What are you doing?

311
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,070
I'm iting you a thank-you note.

312
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,680
Well,a thank you and an apology.

313
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,710
ever since you got this promotion,

314
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,680
I have been letting my
jealousies get the betterf me.

315
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,120
So... can I start over?

316
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,770
Can we... go back to being...

317
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,940
whatever we were before?

318
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,310
Well...

319
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,170
to be honest,that is
why I got you the cake.

320
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,550
I wanted you to know that
despite all of this,we're still...

321
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,320
you know,whatever we were before.

322
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,390
so,uh,hey,how did that big meeting go?

323
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,050
Oh,it,uh... was fine.

324
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,050
scary at first,but,you know,

325
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,650
uh,it just turned into
dinner at my dad's place.

326
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,260
Nothing--nothing
big.

327
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,100
Sounds exciting.

328
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,430
Where does your dad
work again--frankie's?

329
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,590
You know,I have to get back to doing
some research. Do you need anything else?

330
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,170
Nope,that's it. Have fun.

331
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,850
willie.

332
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,170
Can you believe there's
traffic in bermuda?

333
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,660
Well,luckily I've chased felons here
befo *** So I know all the shortcuts.

334
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,290
Did you find connor?

335
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,250
We're outside of his hotel
waiting for his return.

336
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,570
Claire give you any
trouble abt me being gone?

337
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,130
No. But betty,on the other hand,is
a headache that just won't quit.

338
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,340
She's got some big,important dinner
tonight that clearly I have to ruin,

339
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,220
but I don't want her to know
that it was me who ruined it.

340
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,390
So...

341
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,450
now I have to figure out some way of
getting betty to come undone at dinner...

342
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,570
without me being there.

343
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,120
Everyone has their achilles' heel,

344
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,080
and no one's is more
obvious than betty'S.

345
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,450
Oh,my god.

346
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,530
I think I just found
betty's achilles' sensible--

347
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,600
<i>- if you'd like to make a call.
- Willie?</i>

348
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,500
I try to be a good
friend,but there is a limit.

349
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,280
Wait. Don't leave.

350
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,900
What would you say if I told you

351
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,750
that I figured out a
super fun way for you

352
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,460
to prove your worth around here?

353
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,240
I would say it's
nighttime. Tell me tomorrow.

354
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,640
That doesn't sound like a woman
who wants to be taken seriously.

355
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,190
That sounds like a girl who
wants to go out,get drunk,

356
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,850
fall in bed with a man
who doesn't love her,

357
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,930
come back here tomorrow and
answer phones for the next 20 years

358
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,340
or at least until the hard
livin' catches up to her

359
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,830
and "mode" wouldn't dare let that
grizzled face out from behind a cubicle.

360
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,660
- I'm listening.
- Wait here.

361
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,940
Matt,I just had the best idea.

362
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,360
- For the magazine?
- No,no,for you.

363
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,420
Remember today when you brought
all those pitches to willie

364
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
and she shamed you in the worst way?

365
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,070
Yeah,thanks for reminding me.

366
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,210
Sorry,but come on. Can you blame her?

367
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,390
You really don't know
anything about fashion.

368
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,700
And as long as she thinks that
you're only here because-- well...

369
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,230
that's not important.

370
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,630
No,no,no,that sounds important.

371
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,520
- Only thinks I'm here because-- -
because you want to be near betty.

372
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,060
But relax. She only thinks
that because everyone else does.

373
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,390
Everyone else does?

374
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,360
Matt,matt,matt,matt,matt...

375
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,990
you haven't exactly been
soaking up information,

376
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,220
trying to prove that you
actually belong here,have you?

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,770
No,I gus not. But it's not that easy.

378
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,360
Or is it?

379
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,130
It's free dinner at frankie's--
super-hot restaurant--

380
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,000
with a n **** whose father
owns half this company--

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,280
a man who one day may take over himself.

382
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,910
All you have to do is teach
him a little bit about fashion,

383
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,370
which nobody knows better than you,

384
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,940
and he'll totally see that you deserve
a brighter future here at "mode.

385
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,900
" I don't see the downside.

386
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,410
I hate his shoes.

387
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,300
Here,put these on.

388
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,860
Why?
Wh--

389
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,560
have fun.

390
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,020
...and what I've been doing
there. Here you go,ms. Suarez.

391
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,140
You're usual. And for the
gentleman-- vodka rocks,two limes.

392
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,710
- Thank you.
- Sure.

393
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,180
And how about a little
starter from the kitchen.

394
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,410
- Thank you.
- One of ms. Suares favorites,on the house.

395
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,570
Wow. They really treat
you well here,huh?

396
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,780
Yes,they do,because they are my
family and they are pretending.

397
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,200
This is my sister hilda
and my father ignacio.

398
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,440
- Hi.
- How you doing?

399
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,310
- Mucho gusto.
- tambien.

400
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,920
Right. Well... bon app *** it.

401
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,670
sorry about that.

402
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,650
They just want this to be
special for me. Th're like that.

403
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,210
Oh,yeah. My family
is the exact same way.

404
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,940
- Oh,really?
- God,no. They're horrible people.

405
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,630
Would you guys consider adopting?

406
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,570
Oh,uh,uh,for free clothes? Yeah!

407
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,410
My sister and my
nephew would love to a--

408
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,230
hey,betty.

409
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,370
Oh. Oh,good. You turned so
white,I thout I would turn around

410
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,910
and see a gunman or a
kardashian. Who is that?

411
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,150
Nobody. They're nobody.

412
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,790
Okay,that's my...

413
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:09,280
my boss/ex-boyfriend,and
that's my "friend"/ex-roommate.

414
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,150
Oof. And they're on a date?

415
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,330
no. A date?

416
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,030
No,they're--they're so
not each other's type.

417
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,800
I-I mean,he's rich,so
he's her type,but no.

418
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,760
do you want to go somewhere else?

419
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,380
No. No. Why would we?

420
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,360
Oh,okay. Maybe betty's not
on a date five tables away.

421
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,990
a date? Even if she
were,you know,we can stay.

422
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,570
Oh. Okay.

423
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,960
Order me... a martini.

424
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,200
I'll be right back. I gotta whiz.

425
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,220
oh,I am so sorry. Two minutes.

426
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,170
is that matt with amanda?
What are they doing here?

427
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,070
Are they on,like,some
kinda date or something?

428
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,740
I--no,I don't know. Why does
everybody keepaying "date"?

429
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,730
Two people can have
dinner. Is called friends.

430
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,680
So what,they're friends now?

431
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,790
Hilda,please. Don't
make this a thing,okay?

432
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,640
I can't think about that. I need
to focus on my meeting with evan,

433
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,540
which matt can't even know
about,all right? Promise.

434
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,930
of course. Are you...

435
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,370
seriously on a date with
amanda in my father's restaurant

436
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,020
with betty sitting right over there?

437
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,380
I don't think that's
any of your business.

438
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,710
Just like it's none of my business

439
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,850
that betty is sitting 10 feet away
from mewith whoever that guy is.

440
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,080
That sounds like you are on a date.

441
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,230
But you know what?
That's cool. becausebe.

442
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,030
Tty is on a date,too.

443
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,550
- really?
- Yeah.

444
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,370
Well,good,good. I guess we're even then.

445
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,740
I completely understand,but
this is my point--

446
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,440
if you release atatement to the
press,the excitement lasts,what,a day?

447
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,960
If you let me do a story at "mode,"

448
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,830
then we can feature any of your new
designs along with a huge announcement,

449
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,080
and then it's a whole event,not
just a-a piece of news.

450
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,230
No,that makes sense. Although now
I'll have to finish those new designs.

451
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,200
I have designer block. That's
what I'm suffering from right now.

452
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,040
I can't decide whether I
want a thin knot on my...

453
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,550
I'm so sorry. One--one
second,I promise.

454
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't worry. I told him you are
on a dat. Too you're welcome.

455
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,350
Hilda,you
prom--wait,what?

456
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,650
- He said he was on a date?
- Yes.

457
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,340
- No.
- Yeah.

458
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,000
Why woul he can'T...

459
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,300
no.

460
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,850
Hilda,what are you doing to her?
You should be picking up plates.

461
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,350
Papi,I gotta tell her what
kind of guy matt really is.

462
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,410
- ****ay!
- Please. Listen.

463
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,930
You know what you gotta do?

464
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,330
You gotta go out there and
rub your date in his face

465
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,620
just like he is rubbing his in yours.

466
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,310
No. No,I can't-- I
can't--I can't do that.

467
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,870
Evan's not even my date.

468
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,540
Th-- I can't deal
with this right now.

469
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,860
I-I won'T. I can'T.

470
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,050
I have to focus on the
meeting. This isn't happening.

471
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,220
This is not happening.

472
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,410
Oh,my god. I'm so
sorry. Here,let me help.

473
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,450
- I'm sorry.
- No,no,no,I got it. I got it.

474
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,820
- Please just-- - no,no,no,it's
okay. Ah,that's hot. Sorry.

475
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,670
Can you just go back
to your seat please?

476
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,830
- You okay?
- Here you are,sir.

477
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,140
I just--I can't
stand the feeling...

478
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,090
that I don't know what to do.

479
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,500
What comes next? What's gonna help?

480
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,590
You just gotta try and find
something that works for you.

481
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,150
I try everything.

482
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,430
As far as mourners go,I think
I fall on the needy side.

483
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,800
Is anything working?

484
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,080
Actually,there's this thing I
heard that really stuck with me.

485
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,220
It's this idea that
when you lose someone,

486
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,020
you should do one thing every day
that makes you feel totally alE.

487
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,070
You know,because it feels
like there's so much death?

488
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,510
I don't exactly know what wouldake
me feel like that right now.

489
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,830
It's--it's
been a while.

490
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,520
I hear ya.

491
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,780
Unfortunately for me,a t of the things

492
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,700
that used to make me
liel ave are illegal.

493
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Wait. What's that smile?

494
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,940
When I was a kid,we used to
spend the summers in the hamptons.

495
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,220
My brother and i would stay up...

496
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,400
and then we'd sneak in to the
neighbors' yards and swim in their pools,

497
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,560
which was kinda
weird,because we had a pool.

498
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,060
But it didn't matter,'cause every
time we did it,I always thought...

499
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,720
we are,for sure,the coolest kids ever.

500
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,010
you know... I didn't do my
feel alive thing for today.

501
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,180
- so is--is that,um--
- hey. Sorry to bother.

502
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,500
But I gotta get a picture of my
little sister's first big meeting.

503
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,950
- No.
- Get over there.

504
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,750
Squeeze together. Squish together. ...

505
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,660
Let's do something soft and pretty.

506
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,030
Okay. Close together. Squish,squish.

507
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,140
- Is this okay?
- Yep.

508
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,500
- Really see--yeah,get cozy
like you're friends-- - hilda.

509
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,210
take the picture.

510
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,430
good. That was great. Thanks. Saving it.

511
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,050
So do you want to talk
about classic designers,

512
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,630
current trends or the next big thing

513
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,700
that only i and a few japanese
schoolgirls know about?

514
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
All of it,but,you know,first,you--
you gotta try this salad. It's amazing.

515
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,310
Oh,no food. Just liquor.

516
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,840
I save all my caloric
intake for dessert.

517
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,700
- I got an eyelash in my...
- oh,let me get--here. H.

518
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,610
- It hurts. Get it out. Get it out. Get it out. Geit out.
- No,no,no. Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait. I got it.

519
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,240
- Did you get it? Get it,get it,get it,get it,get it. It hurtso much.
- Got it.

520
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,350
You know wha why don't i come back
over there and show you some stuff

521
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,790
that I've had published
at "mode" and--and online?

522
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,450
Justide by side,uh,if that's okay.

523
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,680
It makes it easier to...

524
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,630
just,it's easier to...

525
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,670
oh,this here is A...

526
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,000
- oh,there it is.
- Like,if you want a tailor,you can go to the random woman...

527
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,760
- marc
- this trip is a total disaster.

528
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
Connor checked out this morning.

529
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,210
And I suspect he was tipped off
by our bargain bounty hunter.

530
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,810
We need a new bounty hunter.

531
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,690
Next time,I prer one in brown.

532
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,480
hello,willie.

533
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,460
Connor.

534
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,690
Give that back to me.

535
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,780
I just want to catch up a bit before you
call the goon and start the blackmailing.

536
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,420
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

537
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,390
Don't pretend with me.

538
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,370
I know every me you've
made since I left.

539
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,230
you know,I may be a crook,but
my feelings for you were real.

540
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,440
And I thought you felt
the same way about me.

541
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Any feelings I had for you
died the day you stole from me.

542
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,240
How could you,connor? I put my life
into that magazine--everything I had.

543
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,560
And you took it. You walked off
and you left me with nothing.

544
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,160
I didn't really take
from you. I took for you.

545
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,520
And I'd it all again.

546
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,460
Come away with me.

547
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,520
- You are insane.
- Yeah,but I'm happy. Are you?

548
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,300
Wilhelmina,you have always
lived your life a certain way.

549
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,040
But when you're ready to
pursue another option with me...

550
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,510
just put it out there.
I'll find you again.

551
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,260
But not until then.

552
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,500
Ah,and one more thing...

553
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,330
Did we make it? I think wee it.

554
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,700
I don't think anybody saw us.

555
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,510
Actually,we're not done yet.

556
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,800
Go get the lights.

557
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,590
natalie,just,um... so we're clear.

558
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,810
I'm not really,uh,ready for.

559
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,080
For what? Sex?

560
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,890
My boyfriend O. D. 'Ed two months ago.

561
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,640
And I didn't have time to
shower today,so you're safe.

562
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,530
It's fine.

563
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,420
my god,it'sold.

564
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,300
- I can't believe we did this.
- Oh,I know.

565
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,270
Okay,bye. That was marc.

566
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,870
I told him we're fine,but
betty is a sloppy drunk

567
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,440
and she's being all
handsy with some dude.

568
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,780
He totally loves me right now.

569
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,930
that was when I sprouted wings
and flew directly into the sun.

570
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,670
- I don't know why I did that.
- Well,I do.

572
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,760
You want to see what's
going on over there?

573
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,880
Go see what's going on back there.

574
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,200
- No,I don'T.
- This meeting is over. Good night.

575
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,580
No. No,I'm--no,please.
I-I-I promise,I...

576
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,350
I don't know and I don't care what
is going on between the two of you,

577
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,790
but what you did
tonight was unforgivable.

578
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,030
what did we do?

579
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,170
- Oh,that is so you,amanda--
- just playing innocent

580
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,200
while you throw yourself
at the nearest billionaire.

581
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,330
Oh,back that projector up.

582
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,680
Yeah,betty,I don't think that we were the
ones drawing attention to ourselves tonight.

583
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,690
Oh,please,matt. You were all over her.

584
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,730
What,me? Me? What
about you and that guy?

585
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,980
Whoa! Okay. Stop.

586
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,280
I just realized what's been going on her
you know,it is one thing to flirt with me.

587
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,830
You're a man,I'm me,it happens.

588
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,310
But to do it just to get back at betty?

589
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,840
Nobody uses this to make that jealous.

590
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,960
I guess I stupid to think that you
actually wanted to hear what I had to say.

591
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,200
No,amanda. I...

592
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,450
- you know,just because your date was bad doesn't mean...
- it wasn't a date,matt.

593
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,720
- You have to come over here...
- actually,it was really important...

594
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,290
okay,all right. Into
the kitchen. Here we go.

595
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,520
That was a meeting.

596
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,070
A very important meeting
with a very important man

597
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,980
who had a great story for our magazine,

598
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,460
who you might have recognized

599
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,480
if you worked at "mode" for any
other reason but to torture me.

600
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Do you know how hard I have
worked for this promotion,

601
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,130
how long I have waited?

602
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,010
And you are ruining it.

603
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,590
You are ruining something
that means so much to me.

604
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,050
I know! I know I am,and I can't help it.

605
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,910
- What?
- You're right,I am awful to you,but...

606
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,540
I can't stop myself because
I can't stand seeing you happy

607
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,650
when I am in so much pain.

608
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,230
And you--you probably
can't understand that

609
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,260
because you are so...good.

610
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,770
You're not some spoiled
rich kid who can't handle it

611
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,340
when he doesn't get his
way,but apparently...

612
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
that's who I am.

613
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,970
And the worse thing is
that,with every word I say,

614
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:32,520
I know I am ruining whatever hope
we had of fixing this relationship.

615
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,920
I don't know what just happened.

616
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,230
He told you who he is.

617
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,560
it's from the,uh,bodega.

618
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,990
I remembered you were waiting for dessert,but
you,uh,left before you got it,so...

619
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,810
is that it?

620
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,070
Look,I've been kind
of a-a monster lately,

621
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,940
and unfortunately,you were
one of the people I hurt.

622
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,450
I mean,you were nice enough to share
your considerable wisdom with me,

623
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,890
which I desperately
need,and I disrespected you.

624
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,640
My considerable wisdom,huh?

625
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,400
- what--what,too
arch? - No.

626
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,670
Whatever. I wish I knew
half of what you kno

627
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,690
what I'm trying to s iS... I'm sorry.

628
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,310
You're a smart,interesting woman
and you should be treated like one.

629
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,090
So I'll-- I'll
see you tomorrow.

630
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,580
- Hey,matt.
- Yeah.

631
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,730
you know what really makes me angry?

632
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,790
I didn't even get to
say good-bye to her.

633
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,600
Well,who says you have to say good-bye?

634
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,980
I mean,why do we have to give up on
relationships with people we've lost?

635
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,740
Why can't we still have
them,but in a different way?

636
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,540
Why don't you talk to her?

637
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,660
Talk to molly right now under the stars.

638
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,260
No. come on. I'm not that guy.
I don'T... I don't do that.

639
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,780
Don't be such a dude. Come on.

640
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,350
No. I... I can't do that.

641
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh,my god. Was he always this
much of a wuss when you knew him?

642
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,410
Okay. All right.

643
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,110
hi,molly.

644
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,120
I'm sorry I didn't get to say good-bye.

645
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,890
I think I need to stop
being so angry now.

646
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,240
I guess I was just afraid...

647
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,620
if I wasn't angry enough,you'd think...

648
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,170
you know,I didn't care.

649
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,190
I really need you know that I...

650
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,620
I did care...

651
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,950
so much.

652
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,560
I still do.

653
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,640
I bet she gets that.

654
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,430
yeah.

655
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,160
Feels like she does.

656
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,310
No. Amanda! Please don't close the door.

657
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,600
A lot of traffic in here tonight.

658
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,770
Amanda,I'm sorry.

659
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,090
What I said was... mean and unfair.

660
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,910
Well,thank you,and just so you know,

661
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,260
I only went out with him because marc
said matt was insecure about work,

662
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,850
and it would be a really good
opportunity for me to step up--

663
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,640
wait. Wait,marc set you up?

664
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,450
Did he tell you to go to
my father's restaurant?

665
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,710
Yeah,he made the reservation.

666
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,530
oh,my god. That bitch.

667
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,050
Yes,what you just said.

668
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,440
tonight after you left,matt
sort of broke down and...

669
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,700
said all this stuff about being
a bad guy and... I don't know.

670
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,840
For the first time in a long ti,I saw...

671
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,770
the good guy underneath,the
guy I fell for,

672
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,420
the one who still cares about
me and... and now I'm stuck.

673
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,960
And I don't know what to do.

674
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,160
Am I right about him...

675
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,490
or should I just move on?

676
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,440
Honestly,betty,I think
it's time you moved on.

677
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,080
So,associate features editor
suarez,how'd the big dinner go?

678
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,020
Bad. Actually,really bad.

679
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,730
And to make things
worse,I just found out

680
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,750
"elle" scored a great story
that I worked very hard to get.

681
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,950
But please don't pretend to feel sorry
for me,marc. I know exactly what you did.

682
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,860
and you know what? We
both deserved this job,

683
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,080
but I got it,so deal with
it and act your age...

684
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,090
your new age.

685
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,180
oh,hey,mandy.

686
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,600
You don't use me for
your little schemes,okay?

687
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,280
we use people together.

688
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,150
I'll text you when I'm over it.

689
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,470
Hey. Welcome back.

690
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,340
You okay... about not finding coor?

691
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,840
Well... what could I do?

692
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,100
You win some,you lose some.

693
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,140
Weirdly,I won mine,
