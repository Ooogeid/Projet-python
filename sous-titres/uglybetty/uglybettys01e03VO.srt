1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:02,208
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:03,533
Killer poncho.

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:04,911
Thanks!

4
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:07,094
- I'm Betty Suarez.
- Hi, Betty.

5
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:08,848
I'm your new assistant.

6
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,527
I got the job because Bradford
Meade didn't want his son

7
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:13,411
to be tempted to sleep
with his assistant.

8
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:16,182
Nepotistic son of a bitch
gives my job to his...

9
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:17,608
His son.

10
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:21,170
So the question is,
how do we get to Bradford?

11
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,915
We use Daniel.

12
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:24,199
Who is this?

13
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:27,031
He's a man of many,
many secrets, Daniel.

14
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,330
Dig a little deeper,

15
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:31,942
and you may find he's capable
of practically anything.

16
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:35,490
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,793
You know,
I think I was here before them.

18
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:42,612
This is a party for my boss.

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:44,962
Daniel Meade--
I'm his assistant.

20
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:50,041
No, I am, I am. Here, look,
I have--I have my xerox card.

21
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,992
It's here somewhere.
I know I have it.

22
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,290
They don't just give
these to anybody.

23
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,290
Oh, see, she knows me. Amanda!

24
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:58,170
- Right this way.
- Amanda!

25
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,392
Sweetheart, why don't you
come back on monday night?

26
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,572
That's when we let anybody in.

27
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:11,511
Oh! Here, look, I found it.
My--my xerox card.

28
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:15,462
I'm standing outside Vamp,
Manhattan's hot spot de jour,

29
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,212
and it's nothing but trendy and fendi
here for Daniel Meade's cover party,

30
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:23,390
as we celebrate his first issue
of "Mode" hitting the stands.

31
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:26,153
More than a few eyebrows
were raised on the catwalk

32
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:29,431
when Meade was chosen to
replace the late Fey Sommers

33
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,881
over seasoned creative
director Wilhelmina Slater.

34
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:36,711
Miss Slater, this way!
Wilhelmina, hi! You're gorgeous!

35
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,301
What'd I miss?

36
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:41,212
"The Times," "Page Six," "The News"--
they've been all over Daniel.

37
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:43,901
Heidi Klum is a no-show,
Isaac's in the back getting sloppy,

38
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:47,221
oh, and... wait till you see
Veronica Jensen's face-lift.

39
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:48,890
Lawsuit!

40
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:53,211
Look at them, falling all over
themselves trying to get a quote.

41
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,611
As if he actually knew
anything about fashion.

42
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:58,730
The man went to Vera Wang's spring line,
gave her a high-five.

43
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:02,020
# But I can't seem to #
# get you over here #

44
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,562
# To help take this off, #
# baby can't you see #

45
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,330
# How these clothes
are fitting on me? #

46
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:13,071
# Dance! #
# Dance dance revolution #

47
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,831
# Keep ya body movin' #

48
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,273
# Now first things first... #

49
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:25,752
Hi.

50
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,851
Walter, what are
you doing here?

51
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,551
Okay, my turn.

52
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,272
Betty, check it out.

53
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,591
Actually, I think, uh,

54
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,062
I'm the one that should be
asking the questions here.

55
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:42,150
Like, what were you doing out at
some club with your boss till...

56
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,242
9:45?

57
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:46,713
Well, it was a party
for his first issue.

58
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,813
And why am I explaining
this to you, Walter?

59
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:50,410
We're not even dating anymore.

60
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,953
Yeah, and whose fault is that?

61
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:54,651
Well, you're the one
who dumped me for Gina.

62
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:56,270
For just two days,

63
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:58,990
and it takes longer than
that to digest corn.

64
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,320
As beautiful an apology as that is,
Walter, I think we're over.

65
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,960
Come on.

66
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,992
Betty, look what I brought you.

67
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,232
This game's been on
back-order for two months.

68
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,472
Couldn't even use my discount.
Full price.

69
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:11,923
So I'm supposed to
forgive you because

70
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:14,601
you couldn't use your
employee discount?

71
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:17,371
Walter, go home.

72
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:20,031
I would,
but we're in the middle of a game here.

73
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:21,551
Yes!

74
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,243
Okay...

75
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:25,273
now I'm gonna go home.

76
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,173
Full price!

77
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,712
July issue. Black lace push-up bra, 
red mesh thong.

78
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,073
See, I never forget a face.

79
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:55,442
Careful, Daniel,
I think she's only 12.

80
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,411
Hi, dad.

81
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,980
I see that you've
been mingling.

82
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,350
Are you talking to anyone
who actually matters?

83
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,910
I've done 40
interviews already.

84
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,243
Look's like my first
issue's a home run, huh?

85
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:10,163
Yeah, you pulled it off.

86
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,252
Christy Benson from "New
York Minute" seems to think

87
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,381
I did a little more
than pull it off.

88
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:15,902
You're the editor
of "Mode," Daniel.

89
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,311
"Mode" sells "Mode."

90
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Meade,
can we get a 2-shot with Daniel?

91
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:23,341
A couple more, sir?
This way. Thank you.

92
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:29,130
Well, if that wasn't
a cover shot--

93
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:33,240
media mogul Bradford Meade and his son,
the shining star.

94
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:34,843
The issue's a big hit, Daniel,

95
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,952
and your brother really
would've been proud.

96
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,483
Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

97
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:40,143
What did I do, anyway?

98
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,741
"Mode" sells
"Mode." Right, dad?

99
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:44,820
You remember the yacht?

100
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,842
Your dad throws this
party to introduce Alex

101
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,512
to the entire fashion community

102
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,942
as the new editor of "Hudson."

103
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,480
He walks in with a black
pinstripe Armani jacket,

104
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,291
white tuxedo front shirt

105
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,040
and polka-dot boxers.

106
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:01,150
That picture ended up in almost
every newspaper in the country.

107
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,641
Circulation went up 38%.

108
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:05,061
That is an editor.

109
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:06,143
Well, you should've
told me that, dad.

110
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,721
I would've gladly
dropped my pants for you.

111
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:12,702
Oh, sorry.

112
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:15,621
Maybe it was insensitive of
me to mention him tonight?

113
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:19,442
This is Daniel's party,
but, uh, Alex is such a...

114
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,533
tough act to follow.

115
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:25,412
So was the club amazing?

116
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,663
They say people wait in line for,
like, three hours just to get inside.

117
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:29,970
Some even more.

118
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,463
You're home early.

119
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:32,851
I checked your homework.

120
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,193
Was there any famous
people there?

121
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,730
Did you bring me a matchbook?

122
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:37,011
Justin, I forgot.

123
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,962
Well, what about the bathroom doors? Do
they really fog over when you push a button?

124
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:42,113
Justin, I...
didn't have to use the bathroom.

125
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,700
Okay, Justin, 
go get ready for bed.

126
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,992
And by the way,
I read your boss' first issue.

127
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:54,173
A little bulky, but good balance of
style, accessories and puff pieces.

128
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,852
You didn't get in, did you?

129
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,521
I have to go e-mail Daniel
his itinerary for tomorrow.

130
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,053
Síentate.

131
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,651
Why do you do this
to yourself, hmm?

132
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:09,340
I keep telling you,
those places aren't for people like us.

133
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:13,113
Hilda, please, just... don't.

134
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,031
Okay.

135
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:21,593
Okay, look, if this is so
important to you, let me help you.

136
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,132
- How?
- How?!

137
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:26,552
I am the top-selling Herbalux
sale associate in my district,

138
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,700
and all because I know
how to sell myself--

139
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,983
the hair, the face,
the clothes.

140
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:34,622
You gotta look it to be it.
That's the Herbalux way.

141
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:37,731
Thanks, but I don't think so.

142
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:41,631
Betty, mama...

143
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:43,690
you wanna fit in
with these people?

144
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,485
I got news for you--

145
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,159
they're not gonna change.

146
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,051
Mnh-mnh. You have to.

147
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm gonna get chocolate sauce.

148
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,501
Hey.

149
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,233
Good morning to you, too.

150
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,882
You know what the doctor said.

151
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:39,700
You already threw
away my cigars.

152
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,440
- One lousy cup of coffee--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,523
Have you been going to medical
school on your lunch hour?

154
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:46,563
Dad, you have to take this more
seriously. This is your heart.

155
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,561
- Have you taken your pill?
- I only have a few left.

156
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:50,961
- I'm trying to make 'em last.
- Dad, take it.

157
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,143
We'll get a refill.

158
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:54,461
All right, I'm taking it,
I'm taking it.

159
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:57,621
You know, I actually think I'm making
some headway on this H.M.O. thing.

160
00:07:57,637 --> 00:08:00,050
I finally got a real person
on the phone yesterday

161
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,860
instead of some
stupid recording.

162
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,150
I had to wash it
down with something.

163
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,111
You didn't stay
long last night.

164
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,630
No, sorry.

165
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,103
I had to wake up early for
the conference call to Milan,

166
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:30,803
and then go over 
the kiera shoot proofs, and then

167
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:33,191
approve the models
for the Paris spread.

168
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,703
It's 9:15.

169
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:38,651
Well, someone's got to hold this
magazine together, Bradford.

170
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,391
I mean, Daniel is trying,

171
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:45,043
but, uh,
some people are just naturals.

172
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,481
Don't worry.

173
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:48,571
I've got his back.

174
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,620
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

175
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,100
Well, don't you look... sweaty?

176
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:09,512
I've been in the archives.
Daniel wanted all these back issues.

177
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:12,733
Mm-hmm. Well, we missed you 
at the party last night.

178
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:16,533
What happened,
sale at the 99 cents store?

179
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,800
No, I... I couldn't get in.

180
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:23,032
Are you serious?
Oh, you poor thing.

181
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,672
Those jerks at the door...

182
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:28,422
all they seem to care
about is appearance.

183
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:33,440
Look, it's all about appearance.
That's all Alex did to "Hudson."

184
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:36,862
He changed the font, the layout,
hired some trendy photographers,

185
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,233
and my father thinks
he's some kind of hero.

186
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,273
I can do these same
things to "Mode."

187
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,813
But, Daniel,
your first issue was a big success.

188
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,730
My nephew loved it.

189
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,732
It wasn't my issue,
and you know it.

190
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,521
I mean, Wilhelmina chose every designer,
every article.

191
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:54,061
I just signed my initials
to lots of memos. I...

192
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,630
That's gonna change.

193
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,113
Set up a staff
meeting for monday--

194
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,512
all department heads,

195
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,300
and work around my
father's schedule.

196
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,450
I want him there, too.

197
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:10,323
Two words-- fa boo.

198
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,691
It's for that breast
cancer thing at the plaza.

199
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,390
And who's the lucky "plus one"?

200
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,020
The senator's in town.

201
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:18,912
I thought breast
cancer was pink.

202
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:22,350
It is, but alzheimer's went
better with the outfit.

203
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:25,710
What? I'm supporting.
That's what counts.

204
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,102
Zip me.

205
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,743
What do you want, anyhow?

206
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,080
Conference room,

207
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,813
and it's good.

208
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:34,323
So here are all the models
that Alex worked with,

209
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:37,230
and I found that font
style that he used.

210
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,533
Um, also, I brought all of
these photographers' books.

211
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,192
This one right here--this is
my favorite. He's amazing.

212
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:46,181
He's shot everyone from, like,
Madonna to the Dalai Lama.

213
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,200
Yeah, this is
Vincent Bianchi...

214
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:50,263
and he'll never work for us.

215
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,250
Well, why not?

216
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,640
When he worked with Alex,
they got in this huge blowup.

217
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,120
He thought Alex was a fraud.

218
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,340
Alex thought he was some
temperamental artiste.

219
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,590
He vowed never to work for
Meade Publications again.

220
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,241
But, Daniel, you're not Alex.

221
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,413
Look, if my brother the
wunderkind couldn't make it work,

222
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,841
I seriously doubt
I'd be able to...

223
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:11,340
Look, let's just, uh,
see who else is here, huh?

224
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:15,561
Tweedledee and Tweedledumpy have
been in there for two hours

225
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,093
going over back
issues of "Hudson."

226
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:22,470
Now... he's trying to actually
rip off his own dead brother.

227
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:26,260
Oh, my god, it couldn't be any
easier if I gave him the gun,

228
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,733
and he aimed it at his foot.

229
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:39,550
The police released Fey Sommers' car
to a scrape metal yard a week ago.

230
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,313
How come it's taking you so
long to find out where it is?

231
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,042
Location info is private,

232
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:48,073
and there's over 142 salvage
yards in the Tristate area alone.

233
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,692
Why don't you just go back to your
big building and make magazines,

234
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:52,080
and let me do what I do?

235
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,760
Well, you better do
what you do quickly.

236
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:57,662
The grease monkeys in these garages
can't spell their own names,

237
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,423
but it won't take much
for them to figure out

238
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:02,053
the steering was tampered with.

239
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:05,583
And I don't care how good
you think your work is.

240
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,883
What are we drinking to?

241
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:17,033
To a father who
realizes his child

242
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:19,120
will never compare
to the one he lost

243
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,242
and to a son who knows
he'll never measure up,

244
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,582
no matter how hard he tries.

245
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:28,373
It's practically shakespearean.

246
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:31,272
As long as there's this wedge
between the two of them,

247
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:33,452
their relationship is doomed.

248
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:36,930
Daniel's time at the magazine--
and ultimately, the company--

249
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,360
will be limited.

250
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:44,002
Well, perhaps it's time I drive
that wedge a little deeper.

251
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,873
What would Daniel think
if he were tipped off

252
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:50,881
as to what his dear old
father were capable of?

253
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,363
Hey, what if we shrink
the magazine down

254
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:06,011
so women can fit it in
their purses easier?

255
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,873
See, now Alex
would've made that.

256
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,870
He should be the one here doing this,
not me.

257
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,521
At least my father
would be happier.

258
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,501
If your father didn't think
you could do this job,

259
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,920
then why would he
give it to you?

260
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,465
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:29,453
Is this...
kung pao chicken or--or orange beef?

261
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:33,770
Well, after five hours, Daniel,
I-I don't really think it matters.

262
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,931
You know what next saturday is?

263
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,920
The Harvard/Yale game. Biggest 
college football game of the year.

264
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,923
You want me to try
and get you tickets?

265
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,000
You know,
every year since we were kids,

266
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:46,490
my father would take Alex to that game.
It was their--their thing.

267
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:49,292
He never once invited me.

268
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:55,693
You know,
I actually thought after Alex died,

269
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,310
he was gonna ask
me to go, but...

270
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,812
It's okay. I'm used to it.

271
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,553
Every parent has
a favorite, right?

272
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,590
Well, you know, my dad doesn't.

273
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:11,221
Sure, he does.
I mean, they all do.

274
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:15,450
Sometimes it's, uh, something small,
but you can see it, you know?

275
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:20,460
They, uh, smile a little brighter
when one of you walks in the room...

276
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:25,183
laugh a little louder when
one of you tells a joke.

277
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,491
Good morning!

278
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,761
Justin, you are not
gonna make me late today!

279
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,302
What time did you
get in last night?

280
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:43,890
I don't even remember.

281
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:46,142
Daniel's going through a bunch
of stuff with his father...

282
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,463
Justin!

283
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,530
What?

284
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,601
Hilda, do you ever think about

285
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:00,951
dad and us and,

286
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,230
you know, if he has a favorite?

287
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:04,771
Yeah, I think so.

288
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,951
- You.
- You.

289
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,281
Come on, you're right up
there between Tito Puente

290
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:11,583
and his nose hair clippers.

291
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:14,312
I am gonna kill that kid.
Morning, papi.

292
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,320
You didn't get in
till 3:00 last night.

293
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:17,843
Why they keeping so late?

294
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:20,111
Well, my boss is trying to make
some changes at the magazine,

295
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:22,643
and I still have to go through
these photographers' books.

296
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,511
Well, they're
working you too hard.

297
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,162
You tell 'em you want a raise.

298
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,452
Okay, dad.

299
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,052
Vincent Bianchi?

300
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,952
Yeah, he's really amazing.

301
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:33,103
So he ended up making it
as a photographer, huh?

302
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,051
Damn, I always thought that
kid would end up in jail.

303
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:36,411
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,882
Vinnie Bianchi--
he grew up over on Grand.

305
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,112
His family owns
Astoria Lemon Ice.

306
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:42,851
He grew up four
blocks from here?!

307
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,183
Yeah, his old man's always going
on about his kid's pictures.

308
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,773
He's got a bunch of 'em hanging
up on the wall in there.

309
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,873
Dad, I have to go.
Um, I love you.

310
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,721
I love you, too.

311
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,482
Put down the coffee!

312
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:05,630
Hello? Hey, someone!

313
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,460
Someone get that!

314
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,731
Anybody else work here?

315
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,003
Bianchi gallery.

316
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:20,842
Hi, um,
I'm not sure if you can help me,

317
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,021
but I'm trying to
reach Vincent Bianchi.

318
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:25,563
- You got him.
- Oh, um, okay.

319
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:26,992
Wow, I wasn't expecting this.

320
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:30,241
Um... I thought I was gonna
have to leave a message.

321
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,501
You wanna call back?
I could let the machine pick up.

322
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,631
No! No, no. Um, no.

323
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:38,600
Okay, um, Mr.
Bianchi, I am a really big fan of you.

324
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:42,581
That cover shoot you did for "Rolling
Stone"-- wow, that was amazing.

325
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,862
Oh, thank you.
You have excellent taste.

326
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,091
How can I help you?

327
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,543
Well, actually, I'm calling about your
availability for a magazine shoot.

328
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:52,751
Um, you gotta go through my
rep for that--Sheila Cordova.

329
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,733
She handles me for
print work, okay?

330
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,420
You know, you and I--we went
to the same high school.

331
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,352
Huh?

332
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,542
Queensborough High, right?
Class of '93?

333
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,692
- Do I know you?
- No. No, no.

334
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:05,201
We didn't go at the same time.

335
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,693
Actually, my name is Betty
Suarez--class of 2002--

336
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:12,082
but it turns out that you and me--we
grew up, like, four blocks from each other.

337
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,650
I live off of Roosevelt.

338
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,762
You're a Jackson
Heights girl, huh?

339
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,900
You don't say.

340
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,432
And I practically live
at Astoria Lemon Ice.

341
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,652
You know that doughnut
place two blocks down?

342
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:22,883
That's where I grew up.

343
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:26,671
I-I worked there every summer in
high school, and it burnt down.

344
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,662
Now it's a deli.
It's a pretty good one, but...

345
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:29,990
Not as good as Sal's,
though, huh?

346
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,722
On 87th? Oh, my gosh,

347
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:35,091
like, the best sausage and pepper
hero on the eastern seaboard.

348
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,440
Mmm, yeah, just the smell of
those things would get me high.

349
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,553
I haven't thought about
those in a long time.

350
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,093
So, Betty Suarez, okay,
you got me hungry...

351
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:44,263
and curious.

352
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,501
What is this job you wanted
to talk to me about?

353
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:48,771
Well, I work at
"Mode" magazine,

354
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:52,532
and my boss, Daniel Meade,
was wondering--

355
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:53,941
Hello?

356
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:57,651
The senator will be picking me up
here for the luncheon on monday.

357
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,532
Before then, I want my
commendations framed and hung--

358
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,781
avanti-classical gold
with a white matte.

359
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:04,691
White matte.

360
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,360
Put the clio and the women in
publishing on the credenza.

361
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:09,541
Call phillip.

362
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,861
Order two dozen cherry
black calla lilies

363
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:14,493
for the coffee table.

364
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:16,742
Those are his favorites.

365
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,763
Marc!

366
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:29,210
# ¿Por qué me dijiste #

367
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:31,682
# Que tú me amaba #

368
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,563
# ¿Por qué me
dejaste triste... #

369
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:39,270
# ¿Por qué me dijiste #

370
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,912
# Que tú me amaba? #

371
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:47,270
#¿Por qué me dejaste
triste y abandonada? #

372
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,473
- Bradford Meade.
- I found it--

373
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,401
Bayonne Salvage Yard.

374
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,533
Did you get rid of it?

375
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,482
That's not gonna be
as easy as I thought.

376
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,283
Why not?

377
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,412
Open your e-mail.

378
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,251
I sent you a little present.

379
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:18,740
"You can own fashion guru
Fey Sommers' death car."

380
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,423
A sick punk's selling it
to the highest bidder.

381
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,203
See, I'm trying to get
the magazine to attract

382
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:35,122
a hipper,
more fashion-conscious woman.

383
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:37,842
So they were out of poppy seed. 
I got you onion.

384
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,823
Okay, you're at the newsstand,
500 covers in front of you...

385
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:42,151
which one of these grabs you?

386
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,843
Bathing suit. It's fresher.

387
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:46,150
Definitely, and neon is in.

388
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,621
I really like the gown.
It's very Cinderella.

389
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:52,850
Yeah, listen, could you get
some cream cheese for that?

390
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,553
So...

391
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,470
I'm trying to get this font.

392
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,583
I was trying to go for
something cool and sexy.

393
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:08,051
Daniel Meade.

394
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:09,923
Who's calling?

395
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,630
Betty?

396
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:14,240
Vincent Bianchi's
on line three...

397
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:15,363
for you.

398
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,991
Really?

399
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,181
Hello?

400
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:23,003
Oh, you did. I'm so glad.

401
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,891
Well, you know, I just--
I thought that

402
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:28,510
it was probably a while since
you've gotten down to Sal's, so...

403
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,600
Are you serious?

404
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:34,700
Oh, my god, that would be 
so wonderful, Mr. Bianchi.

405
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,651
Okay, Vincent.

406
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:41,752
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was--that was
my boss who picked up. Hold on.

407
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,620
He said he loved the sausage and
pepper heroes that I sent him.

408
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:46,662
He thought I had cojones.
I'll explain later.

409
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,742
Just go pick up the phone.

410
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:55,842
Well...

411
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:00,200
I don't really
know what you did,

412
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:03,200
or how sausage and
peppers helped, but...

413
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:06,831
thank you,
and we're having lunch on monday.

414
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,633
Well, would you like me
to set up a reservation?

415
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:13,212
Yeah, um, actually, see if you
can get us a table at Madison Six.

416
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,823
And, uh, make it for three.

417
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,881
He asked that you come along.

418
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,203
What?

419
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:19,801
Wait, wait, wait,
he asked for me?

420
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,711
Oh, and, uh,
maybe we could both...

421
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,241
dress up a little on monday?

422
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,821
I think he meant
natural fibers, sweetie.

423
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:36,820
Come on, Christina,
there's gotta be something.

424
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:39,723
A sweater or a jacket?

425
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,730
I can't walk in there
looking like me.

426
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,132
You look fine.

427
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:46,911
But you're not Vincent Bianchi.

428
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:49,522
He's expecting one of
these "28th floor girls."

429
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:50,902
And since when did you want
to look like one of them?

430
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,090
They're not even real!

431
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,001
Real women snort
when they laugh,

432
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:56,451
they've got fat asses,
wobbly upper arms

433
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:58,083
and get P.M.S.

434
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:00,183
I thought you wanted to
run a magazine someday,

435
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,092
not spend 12 hours a day wondering
about what your hair's doing.

436
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:06,051
Yeah, but this job is the only
chance I have of ever getting there.

437
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,533
I was in Daniel's
office earlier,

438
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,853
and he wanted the
opinion of a "Mode" girl.

439
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,941
He didn't look at me.

440
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,531
So you honestly think that
I have any future here

441
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:17,313
if I don't at least
try to change?

442
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,952
Never mind.

443
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:34,621
Betty, what are you doing?

444
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,343
What's going on?

445
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:41,163
I work in an office
full of glamazon women

446
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:44,210
who are all 6 feet tall
and perfectly waxed.

447
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,300
That's what's going on.

448
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:49,630
"Glamazon"?

449
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,473
Never mind.

450
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:55,421
Hey, come here.

451
00:22:56,355 --> 00:23:00,063
Since when does that kind
of stuff get to you?

452
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,311
Hey.

453
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:05,983
Amor, you are so beautiful.

454
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:08,771
Dad, stop.
Please don't even try that.

455
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,421
- And you have such a big heart--
- And stop it with the "big heart."

456
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:16,833
The speech didn't work when I was
cast as a rock in the school play,

457
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:20,023
or when I was sitting at home
with you and mom on prom night,

458
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,130
and it's not gonna
work now, so...

459
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,942
Betty, you'll always
be my special girl.

460
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:27,012
You know that.

461
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:33,723
Just so you know,

462
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:38,370
you were a really
terrific rock.

463
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:44,373
Dad, don't forget
to take your pill.

464
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:46,040
Okay.

465
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,872
See?

466
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,611
Shut up.

467
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,432
Just help me.

468
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:02,843
She has a 2:00 with Choli.

469
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:07,143
I have a 2:00 with Jean-Luc.

470
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:10,330
Mama!

471
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:12,910
Choli...

472
00:24:14,445 --> 00:24:18,711
So what are we thinking today?

473
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:22,200
Something befitting
an editor in chief.

474
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,923
No... you get the job?

475
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:28,642
Soon. Very soon.

476
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:31,532
So do you think you could
really make me look like this?

477
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:35,342
Honey, you sit back and relax
and let Choli do her thing.

478
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:38,571
We gon' need the big tweezers.

479
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,830
Thank you.

480
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:15,540
Perfect.

481
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,671
Are you sure I look like this?

482
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:20,952
Baby, you look better.

483
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,973
# Ladies up in here tonight #

484
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,571
# No fightin' #

485
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:36,061
# We got the refugees in here #
# No fightin' #

486
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:39,763
# No fightin' #
# Shakira, Shakira #

487
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,932
# I never really knew that
she could dance like this #

488
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:44,272
# She make a man want
to sing spanish #

489
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:45,850
# ¿Cómo se llama? #
# Sí #

490
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,062
# Bonita #
# Sí #

491
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,592
# Mi casa, su casa #
# Shakira, Shakira... #

492
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:50,941
Betty?

493
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:53,471
Dude, how could you have
broken up with her?

494
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:55,660
She--she's hot.

495
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,001
Me?

496
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:01,741
Really?

497
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,680
Thank you!

498
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,122
# All the attraction,
the tension #

499
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:08,421
# Don't you see, baby,
this is perfection? #

500
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:11,731
# Hey, girl,
I can see your body moving #

501
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,483
# And it's driving me crazy #

502
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:16,612
# And I didn't have
the slightest idea... #

503
00:26:16,628 --> 00:26:18,212
Penthouse, please.

504
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,831
Yes, sir.

505
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,922
Oh, Mr. Meade! Hi.

506
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:36,893
How are you?
I'm Betty, Daniel's assistant.

507
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:40,112
Oh, yeah, yeah. You look...

508
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,093
taller.

509
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,791
Thank you.

510
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:47,213
# Reading the
signs of my body #

511
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:48,700
# And I'm on tonight #

512
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:50,300
# You know my hips don't lie #

513
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,360
# And I am starting
to feel you boy #

514
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,771
Excuse me. I'm going to have
to call you right back.

515
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:59,693
# Oh I know I am on tonight #
# My hips don't lie #

516
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,760
# And I'm starting to feel it's right #
Betty? Oh, ho.

517
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:07,062
I think I just found
my new screen saver.

518
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,481
Daniel Meade's office.

519
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,292
Excuse me. Who's calling?

520
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:16,543
Um, just one second.

521
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:18,593
Yep?

522
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,990
Daniel, there's a woman on line
two who won't tell me her name,

523
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,162
but she says she wants to talk
to you about your father.

524
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:26,241
Oh, just get rid of her.
No. Uh, wait.

525
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,582
Daniel Meade here.

526
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:30,642
Hello, Daniel.

527
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:32,870
I just finished
your first issue.

528
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,311
You should be very pleased.

529
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:36,632
Who is this?

530
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:39,750
Oh, that's not
important right now.

531
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:43,901
The real question is,
how well do you know your father?

532
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,190
Excuse me?

533
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,202
Do yourself a favor.

534
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:51,553
Ask him what he's been up to
at the Bayonne Salvage Yard.

535
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:59,132
What the hell is
that supp--whoa.

536
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,613
Look at you.

537
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:05,590
Yep. You told me to dress
up for our lunch today.

538
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:08,950
Yeah, and dress
up you did. Yeah.

539
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:12,500
Um, you know what? I was thinking
maybe we should call Madison Six,

540
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,841
see if they have a
table in the back,

541
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,970
just so we can have a little
privacy with Bianchi.

542
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,200
- Okay.
- Great.

543
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,730
Have you seen her yet?

544
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,492
Yes, I did,
and it looks as if Queens threw up.

545
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,890
He should be quite impressed.

546
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:47,891
Ooh! Someone got
their hair did.

547
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:52,760
So I'm pitching we go
for an entire redesign.

548
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:55,370
Splashier colors,
bolder looks...

549
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,441
overhaul the entire layout.

550
00:28:57,456 --> 00:28:59,280
It can be a whole new "Mode."

551
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:01,410
Stop using, you know,
the same old models.

552
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:04,382
Get cutting-edge photographers,
more interesting writers.

553
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,432
I mean, do we really need another
editorial on eating disorders?

554
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:16,543
Now... I happen, uh,
to be having lunch today

555
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:19,563
- with Vincent Bianchi to discuss--
- Vincent Bianchi?

556
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:21,813
You expect him to do
a spread for "Mode"?

557
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,623
You know his history
with the company.

558
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,332
Your brother couldn't
work with him.

559
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,603
Why do you even try?

560
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,141
Because he's one of the best,

561
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:34,771
and I think I can persuade
him to consider it.

562
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:36,783
Daniel, I for one,
think it's wonderful

563
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,141
you've taken such
initiative at the magazine,

564
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:42,493
but some of these changes
you're suggesting...

565
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,721
uh, let me put it this way.

566
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:47,851
Uh, sometimes change
is a positive thing,

567
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:51,573
and then sometimes, well,
they can spin out of control.

568
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:53,380
You start with a
simple redesign,

569
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:55,530
and all of a sudden,
before you know it,

570
00:29:55,545 --> 00:30:00,573
you're talking about bold new
colors and a daring new look,

571
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:04,310
and the truth is,
you haven't really improved on a thing.

572
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,000
- Wilhelmina--
- I'm just saying,

573
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:09,231
change isn't always
for the better.

574
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:13,882
In some cases, it can make 
a bad situation even worse.

575
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,680
This is the ladies room.

576
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:40,141
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

577
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:42,112
It's just another
day at "Mode."

578
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:44,791
You can't listen to a
thing Wilhelmina says.

579
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:48,783
- She's a jerk.
- No, Daniel. I'm the jerk.

580
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,940
Thinking that fake
nails and a new hairdo

581
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:55,123
could actually make a
difference on someone like me.

582
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,012
Okay.

583
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,890
Yeah, look... um...

584
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,790
I-I don't know what I'm
supposed to tell you.

585
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:07,821
This is the way
this place works.

586
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,991
It is a fashion magazine.

587
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,673
Appearance--

588
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:13,650
it means something here.

589
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,433
I know.

590
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:21,361
Listen, I know you're going to feel
a whole lot better after our lunch.

591
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,753
You can order
anything you want.

592
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:25,422
No, I'm not going.

593
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:28,132
What? No, no. You have to go.

594
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,633
Betty, Bianchi
wants to meet you.

595
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,880
You're the whole reason this
lunch is even happening.

596
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:34,090
Daniel, he doesn't
even know who I am.

597
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,650
Just take Amanda.

598
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,712
It's like you said--appearance
means something.

599
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,862
She'll fit right
in at Madison Six.

600
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:42,060
Betty, come on.

601
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:45,003
Daniel, just go.
You're gonna be late.

602
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,793
And don't forget the proposal.

603
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:10,020
About time.
How long does it take to put on makeup?

604
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:13,802
Well, I also had
to fix my hair.

605
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,070
Thought you were Amanda.

606
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:18,210
I didn't know you'd
be joining us.

607
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,640
Afraid I might botch things up
with Bianchi if I were on my own?

608
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:26,732
Let's just say that I had a sudden
craving for the quail at Madison Six.

609
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,323
Okay.

610
00:32:32,335 --> 00:32:34,730
Betty Suarez is here.

611
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,500
Shall we?

612
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:54,413
He called.

613
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:56,840
He's running late
to pick you up.

614
00:32:56,855 --> 00:33:00,711
Well, a senator's life can
never be called his own.

615
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:05,013
Be sure to meet him
downstairs to escort him up.

616
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,942
Vincent. Daniel Meade.
Sorry we're late.

617
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,320
Ah, no problem.

618
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:17,911
Just killing time, trying to figure
out what these five forks are for.

619
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,230
Bradford Meade.

620
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:20,980
I remember you, yeah.

621
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,803
And this is Betty Suarez.

622
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:25,783
Ho-la.

623
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,753
The quail here is excellent.

624
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:53,102
Quail! Could you hear 'em
in the old neighborhood,

625
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,992
if they saw us in
a place like this?

626
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:59,641
Oh... carbs. No.

627
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:08,030
But, uh, who cares about carbs
when you're from Queens, right?

628
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:13,470
Excuse me. I'm going to need a
very large glass of wine, please.

629
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:18,190
Is this color peach or salmon?

630
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,553
Marc! Marc, will you cover 
my phones for me, please?

631
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:23,150
- Daniel forgot the proposal--
- Oh, I'll bring it to the restaurant.

632
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,630
No, I'll take it to him.
It's my job.

633
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:27,610
Oh, come on. They won't even let
you past the host at Madison Six.

634
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,810
Ah-ah. Just let me. I got it.

635
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:31,961
Marc, give it to me!

636
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,741
I can't hit your boss,
but I can hit you.

637
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:37,052
And everybody knows I'm from Queens,
so I will do it!

638
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:39,822
Thank you.

639
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:47,493
So none of the girls
looked like you

640
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:50,060
when I went to
Queensborough High.

641
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:54,192
Hey, does Mrs.
Rodriguez still teach there?

642
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:57,143
I'm gonna say...

643
00:34:58,337 --> 00:34:59,863
she died.

644
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:17,202
So you're still just
a creative director?

645
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:20,160
Yes, daddy.

646
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,792
Shall we?

647
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,231
So, uh, we feel 
this holiday issue is our chance

648
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:35,513
to try something really out
there for our feature spread.

649
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:38,853
4-page pullout. You would have
total carte blanche, of course.

650
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:41,320
So what does your
old man do, anyway?

651
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:43,633
Investment banker.

652
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:46,792
Your father's an investment
banker... Betty?

653
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:51,192
Oh. I mean, yeah.
That was always his dream.

654
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:55,252
You know, if he ever 
made it out of the Bare-Rio.

655
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,652
What?

656
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,201
- Okay, that it's it. It's over.
- Daniel...

657
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:01,413
Look, I can't keep
doing this, dad.

658
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,192
I'm sorry, Mr. Bianchi.

659
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:04,343
Are you ready to
hear the specials?

660
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,763
Actually, could you hold
off on the specials?

661
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm about to blow a very,
uh, big deal here.

662
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:11,272
Mr. Bianchi...

663
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:13,990
this is not Betty Suarez.

664
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:15,961
Hmm?

665
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:20,773
No kidding.

666
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,643
Come on. Give me some credit.

667
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:26,260
This girl's never been within 10 feet of
a sausage and pepper hero in her life.

668
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,021
He is so right.

669
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:30,010
So where's the girl I
talked to on the phone?

670
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,341
She didn't want to come,

671
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,943
and it's my fault.

672
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:35,183
And she was looking forward
to meeting you very much.

673
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:38,920
But because we're all caught
up with some stupid image,

674
00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:41,802
I made her feel insecure about
fitting into a place like this.

675
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,732
He's my boss. I just need to--I
need to take him the envelope.

676
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:46,590
He's right there.
It's just 10 feet in.

677
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,660
I can't imagine why you
thought she wouldn't fit in.

678
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,112
Look, here he comes.
He'll tell you.

679
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,601
I'm so sorry, Mr. Meade.
She says that she's with you.

680
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:55,782
She is.

681
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,982
Look, sir. You just--you
forgot the layout proposal.

682
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:00,011
There's someone I want you to meet.
Come here.

683
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:06,542
Now this must be Betty Suarez.

684
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,040
Mr. Bianchi. Hi.

685
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:10,762
It's really an honor.

686
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,231
Really.

687
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,252
Look, Mr. Bianchi,

688
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,593
between your fight with my brother and
what we just tried to pull off here,

689
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:19,812
I'm sure there isn't a reason in
hell you'd want to work with us,

690
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:22,560
but I gotta say, I--

691
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:25,251
I think it'd be a great
opportunity for both of us.

692
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:27,593
You would have free rein
to call your own shots.

693
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:28,723
I give you my word.

694
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:31,611
Actually, I give
you Betty's word.

695
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,743
She's the only one who's been
straight with you so far.

696
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:41,811
You know,
you're nothing like your brother.

697
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:44,991
No. I'm not.

698
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,582
I'm not Alex.

699
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:52,051
I'll leave you
with the proposal.

700
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,032
Mr. Bianchi.

701
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,633
Here you go.

702
00:37:58,747 --> 00:38:00,442
Thanks.

703
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:10,351
Excuse me.
Could I get a matchbook, please?

704
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,862
My nephew is never
gonna believe this.

705
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,543
Awesome. Thanks.

706
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,263
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

707
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:25,383
I should have insisted you
come to lunch with me today.

708
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:28,270
Well, Daniel,
I'm sorry that I backed down.

709
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,740
I mean, I should not have let
Wilhelmina get to me like that.

710
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:34,620
Look, fake nails or not,
you came through for us, Betty.

711
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,722
Bianchi was only
there because of you.

712
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:39,952
I guess you really do
have cojones, huh?

713
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,623
So I'm going to go.

714
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,313
- He's doing it.
- We got him?

715
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:51,603
We got him.

716
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:54,680
His one stipulation is that
he answers only to you

717
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:58,003
and to no other "blowhards."

718
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,833
Okay.

719
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:06,383
Betty, uh, please send 
an e-mail to all creative.

720
00:39:06,395 --> 00:39:10,933
"Vincent Bianchi will be shooting
our december feature spread."

721
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:13,233
Shut up!

722
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:15,523
Right away, sir.

723
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,173
Congratulations.

724
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,033
Thank you.

725
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:28,202
Dad, I got a weird
call from some woman.

726
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:32,061
She said to ask you about
Bayonne scrape yard.

727
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,433
Mean anything?

728
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:36,473
I haven't the foggiest.

729
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,383
Must be some kind of crank.

730
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:42,953
I've never even
been to Bayonne.

731
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:03,051
Vincent Bianchi will
be shooting december?

732
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,963
He got him?

733
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:06,541
Damn!

734
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:35,581
Hey, look who's home
in time for dinner.

735
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:37,480
What happened to your makeup

736
00:40:37,496 --> 00:40:39,240
and your nails?

737
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:40,732
It was kind a long day.

738
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:41,992
They didn't fire you, did they?

739
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,193
'Cause I'll go down there.

740
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,780
No, dad, they didn't fire me.

741
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:48,963
In fact, because of me,

742
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:52,470
we landed Vincent Bianchi
for a big magazine shoot.

743
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,043
That's a big deal?

744
00:40:54,058 --> 00:40:55,463
I could've gotten you that kid.

745
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:58,012
Yes, dad,
it's kind of a big deal.

746
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:01,310
It's a really big deal.

747
00:41:01,327 --> 00:41:03,801
Well, in that case...

748
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,721
I'm very proud of you.

749
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:08,500
Thank you.

750
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:13,910
And you know what?

751
00:41:13,926 --> 00:41:15,722
If it wasn't for
Hilda's makeover,

752
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:17,840
none of it would
have even happened.

753
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,752
Hey, how about that?

754
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,810
Ah, my two girls.

755
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,443
Betty, it's all set up.

756
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,252
Where you going?
We're about to eat.

757
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,062
Hilda, this is one club
they can't keep me out of.

758
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,180
# Dance revolution #

759
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:35,203
# Keep ya body movin' #

760
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:39,893
# Now first things first #

# Ain't no time to rehearse #

762
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:44,151
# Put your back foot forward #
# Now switch your tail in reverse #

763
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,563
# Slide to the side #
# But you gots to do it right #

# Work it, twerk it, #
