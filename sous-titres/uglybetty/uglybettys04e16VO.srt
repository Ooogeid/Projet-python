1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:02,656
-Previously on "Ugly betty"...
-no, no, no! Aah!

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:05,892
You are not the same person
I met three years ago.

3
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:08,148
Betty, you've already chand,

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:10,285
but you're still you.

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:12,553
-I'm an editor now.
-Really?

6
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:14,889
I don't want you ever
around my mother again!

7
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:16,516
What the hell is going on?

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,293
He's only interested in his
career and leeching off of you!

9
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,929
-Tyler is not who you think he is.
-Well, who is he then?

10
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,132
He's your brother.

11
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,021
I really, uh,
need to see you tonight.

12
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:27,401
I'kind of busy right now.

13
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,470
Thanks for not ditching me tonight.

14
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:31,706
-I couldre.
-Well, you've got one.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,808
Hilda suarez, I love you.

16
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:36,711
Will you marry me? Oh!

17
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,946
So you like someone.

18
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,216
-Yeah at is...
-their name?

19
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,886
Lily.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,587
I just got off the phone
with lena korvinka.

21
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:49,257
She loved my audition and
wants to formally invite me

22
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,592
To join her class!

23
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:53,261
Romeo...

24
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,962
Romeo...

25
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,932
Wherefore art thou, romeo?

26
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:59,901
Deny thy father

27
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,571
And refuse thy name.

28
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,875
You see? Acting is...

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,877
Reinvention.

30
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,046
I mean, who is to say

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,016
That juliet has to be the
prettiest girl in the room?

32
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,018
You know, maybe she's
some misguided boob

33
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:19,387
With bad eyes and bad hair

34
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:21,455
And bad teeth.

35
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,062
What?

36
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:29,931
Okay, everybody take two minutes.

37
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,301
I'm just gonna call my cat
and grab tonight's speaker.

38
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,720
Am I too early to pick you up?

39
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,938
Yeah, but you should stay
for the guest speaker.

40
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,074
He used to date a gossip girl.
That's why he's speaking?

41
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,810
That's his qualification?
That's all I need.

42
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,080
Oh, aunt betty,
this is my friend austin.

43
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:49,250
Oh, austin, hi. Hey.

44
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:52,253
It's very nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

45
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,194
Oh, you tell her what
a great actor I am?

46
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:55,823
No. Just what a giant ego you have.

47
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:58,593
And this is lily. Hi. Cute glasses.

48
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,829
Thanks. Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:05,099
That's the girl that I like.
Good news.

50
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,835
Tinkerbell ate his dinner,
and he's going to be fine.

51
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,837
All right.

52
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:12,840
Now tonight's speaker is
an award-winning playwright

53
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,843
And a foxy little muckety-muck.

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,645
His latest play,

55
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,314
"T rebirth of rita,"

56
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,149
Opens next week.

57
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,820
Please give a warm
welcome to zachary boule.

58
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,590
Mwah, mwah. Merci.

59
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,592
I know him.

60
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:35,296
I read his first play.
It was so good and so tragic.

61
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,832
What a nice treat for me.

62
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,201
Hey, everybody. Hey.

63
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:42,203
Hi.

64
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:45,206
So lena asked me to speak
about reinvention today,

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,509
Which is a theme in my next play.

66
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,212
It was like he was
talking directly to me--

67
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,681
Everything he was saying
about reinventing yourself,

68
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,183
Your look, your life.

69
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,220
Mm, that's very interesting.

70
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,589
I mean, that's everything
I've been doing this year--

71
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:04,934
-My new look, my new job.
-You don't say?

72
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,616
Hilda, stop.

73
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:08,454
I see your engagement ring,
okay? Congratulations.

74
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,106
Good, because I'm practicing
how to show it off

75
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,542
Without looking like
I'm showing it off.

76
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:16,045
-Do my hands look dry?
-Too obvious.

77
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,948
Oh. As I was saying,
zach was really inspiring.

78
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:22,885
And by "Inspiring,
" Do you mean "Cute"?

79
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,887
No. Ay, is he cute?

80
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,756
That is not even
what I was thinking!

81
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,759
I mean, not that it would matter.
He dates gossip girls. Ugh.

82
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,695
And he won a drama desk award.

83
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,456
I write a blog. I won a blobby.

84
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,857
But I was thinking about
pitching him to "Mode"

85
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:40,393
-For the new york issue.
-Oh, yeah, you should.

86
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,929
Nothing says "New
york" Like theater.

87
00:03:42,963 --> 00:03:44,998
Here, let me fix your hair.

88
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:46,966
No. I see it!

89
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,269
You st scratched my glasses.

90
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:52,739
That's because it's a diamond.

91
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:59,212
-Hey, your mom's on the phone.
-I don't want to talk to her.

92
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,823
I can't keep telling her
you're in the bathroom.

93
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,975
That's what you've been
telling her?For four days?

94
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,052
Does she... at least...
sound... worried?

95
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,061
Just talk to her.

96
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,674
She waits 30 years to
tell me I have a brother,

97
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:10,985
After she drops that bomb,

98
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,242
She whisks him off to
paris to meet alexis.

99
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,230
I think I'm entitled to a
little more time than that.

100
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,740
Think about how your brother feels.

101
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,336
Don't call him my brother.

102
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:22,851
-My only brother is my sister alexis.
-Exactly my point.

103
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,520
The poor guy gets off a
bus from south dakota,

104
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,688
You punched him,
and now he's whisked off

105
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,690
To meet manzilla in
some foreign land.

106
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,659
Since when are you his friend?

107
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:35,430
I'm not. I just-
you know what? Forget it.

108
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:37,398
I have a lot of work I
have to get back to.

109
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,696
Daniel meade's office.

110
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,767
Now, marc,

111
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,769
I need all thoughts of
go-go boys in glitter pants

112
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:43,087
Out of your head today.

113
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:44,528
James cameron's
people are gonna call.

114
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,631
They're doing the c.G.I. Work

115
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:48,040
To help me re-create old new
york for my cover shoot.

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,341
Right.I should tell you,
daniel's concerned about the cost.

117
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,710
I don't care about daniel.

118
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,761
-You spend money to make money.
-Good morning!

119
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,775
Was that monochromatic
blur betty suarez?

120
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,377
I know. Where are the
polka dots and butterflies

121
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:07,481
-And m-mexican blankets? -Uh, yeah.

122
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,650
Does she look... nice?

123
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,618
Willie!

124
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,020
You swore you'd die

125
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:16,857
Before you ever complimented
a suarez ensemble.

126
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:19,159
Aah!

127
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,061
-Oh, my god!
-Willie!

128
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,663
-What happened?!
-Isn't it obvious?

129
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,366
Your stumble into good
taste has killed her!

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,702
By now you've all heard
what happened to wilhelmina.

131
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,338
She is having surgery
on a perforated ulcer,

132
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,406
But she is going to live.

133
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:34,714
The good news is,

134
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,065
I am taking point on
the new york issue.

135
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,617
So I guess we should send
flowers or something.

136
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,954
I GUESS $40 SHOULD ABOUT COVER IT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

137
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,871
It's just like you
to cheap out, Daniel.

138
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,506
-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU...
-I had a little time before surgery,

139
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,893
so I'm gonna run this meeting,
thank you.

140
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,798
UH, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S THE BEST IDEA?

141
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,195
Daniel, I could die on the table.

142
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,764
Are you rely gonna
take this away from me?

143
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,867
-I THOUGHT IT WAS A ROUTINE OP...
-Features, what do you got for me?

144
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,728
Um, hi, wilhelmina. It's betty.

145
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,530
I've been thinking about
the idea of reinvention

146
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,500
York city to--

147
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,135
Oh!

148
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,769
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

149
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:13,006
I'm fine. It's your pitch.
It's excruciating.

150
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,708
Just give her a chance.

151
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,810
Fine. Five words, go.

152
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,279
Um...

153
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,282
Profile!

154
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,784
Um...

155
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,552
Playwright.

156
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,521
-Reinvention.
-No.

157
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,423
I gaveou five words.
You chose to use "Um" Twice.

158
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,025
No playwrights.

159
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,394
Theater is dead,
and so is your pitch.

160
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,330
I am not wearing that.

161
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,035
Apparently, my table is ready,
so I will leave you with this--

162
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,538
I've given Marc detailed instructis

163
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,542
as to how to proceed with
my New Amsterdam shoot.

164
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,477
Wilhelmina, that's too expensive.

165
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,648
-I told you  we are not doing that.
-Daniel, you stupid moth--

166
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,717
All right, that shoot is canceled.

167
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,436
Daniel, can I please
re-pitch you my idea?

168
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,804
Look, I hate to say it,

169
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,807
But I have to agree with
wilhelmina on this one.

170
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,509
-I don't see how it fits in a fashion mazine.
-It does!

171
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:08,711
Look at how fashionable he is!

172
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,914
Besides, his new play is
all about reinvention,

173
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,882
Which is the core
of fashion, right?

174
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,318
I mean, what's out
yesterday is in tomorrow.

175
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,397
And I'm sorry,
but new york is theater.

176
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:18,860
I don't care what wilhelmina says.

177
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,199
Is he with leighton meester?

178
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,801
-They're not together anymore.
-Wow,ou said that fast.

179
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:25,804
You know what? If you want to
ask him out, just ask him out.

180
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,774
-We don't have to do a story on him.
-What?! Uh, no.

181
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,776
That has nothing to do with it.

182
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,612
I just think that this would
be a really good story.

183
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,247
Run with it.

184
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,916
At the very least,
it'll piss off wilhelmina.

185
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:43,127
Thank you, and trust me,
this is totally professional.

186
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,132
Your real name is ezra butinsky?

187
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,134
Why would I make that up?

188
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,036
I guess it doesn't have
quite the same romantic ring

189
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,038
As "Zachary boule."

190
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:57,007
So you think my name's romantic?

191
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,009
Is this interview taking a turn?

192
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,811
Ha ha.

193
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,780
Uh, sorry.
I interrupted you before.

194
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,048
What was your question?

195
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,185
Right. Oh, 'cause I...
was asking you a question.

196
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,255
How has your time at oxford

197
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,092
Influenced your new play,
"The rebirth of rita"?

198
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,693
Off the record,

199
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,897
I kind of embellished my bio
to sound more interesting.

200
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,633
-Oh.
-I did one summer program there.

201
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,202
The truth is,
I grew up in new jersey.

202
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:27,671
Typical dork-- glasses and braces.

203
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:29,773
Not that I'm implying

204
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,109
That glasses and
braces make you a dork.

205
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:34,783
-It's just-- I mean, I still...
-it's okay. I can handle "Dork."

206
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:37,001
I'm supposed to be getting
them off soon anyway.

207
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,416
I just have to find
a new orthodontist

208
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,320
-'cause my old one went crazy on me.
-I love mine.

209
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,176
I can get you the info if you want.

210
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:44,723
Yeah, that would be great.

211
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,303
-Although, somehow those work for you.
-Thanks.

212
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,905
Okay. So...

213
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:54,640
Uh, what about writing
do you enjoy the most?

214
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,999
Mm. I'm kind of an over-thinker,

215
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,968
-So I like to create impulsive characters.
-Mm.

216
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:02,204
You know, the kind that
get swept up in a moment

217
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,206
And take action.

218
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,348
-That sounds... liberating.
-Doesn't it?

219
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,674
I mean, wouldn't our lives
be so much more interesting

220
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,376
-If we didn't think everything through first...
-totally.

221
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,011
If we just lived in the moment?

222
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:15,446
We want something, we go for it.

223
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:47,129
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

224
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:49,398
-No, it's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

225
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:53,135
It's totally unprofessional and-
-and disrespectful to you

226
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,373
And whatever potential starlet
girlfriend you might have.

227
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,841
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,457
Look, I can assure you
that this will in no way

229
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:02,725
Negatively affect the piece
that I am writing on you.

230
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,593
Sorry.

231
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,763
Oh, good. You're still here.

232
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:09,244
-Hey, you.
-Sorry to bother.

233
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:10,658
I know you probably have some

234
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,147
-big fabulous date or something.
-Oh, you're sweet...

235
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,049
But no.

236
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,318
And now you've made me sad.

237
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,934
-What's up?
-My acting class is doing a scene night

238
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,136
For family and friends,
and I wanted to invite you.

239
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,673
Oh... A night of scenes...

240
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,608
Performed by teenagers. How fun.

241
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,543
How many scenes are there?

242
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,812
-12.
-And what number are you in the order?

243
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,181
-Ten.
-Are any of these kids famous?

244
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:38,318
One girl did a p.S.A.
For lead paint when she was 4.

245
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,553
-She had to chew a windowsill.
-Oh.

246
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:42,655
It's lily-- the girl that I like.

247
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,924
Right. So--so, that's...

248
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,493
Still happening?

249
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,495
Yeah, it's great.

250
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,730
My friend austin likes her,
too. Oh, okay.

251
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,899
So you both... like her.

252
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,135
Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,872
Well, count me in. I love drama.

254
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,874
And I like theater.

255
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:08,448
"Zachary boule "Is one of
broadway's brightest rising stars.

256
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:10,750
"In fact, I'd say the
only thing brighter

257
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,752
Is his dashing smile."

258
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:15,455
"Dashing smile"?
Keep it clean, suarez.

259
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,759
"WE MET AT A BAR ON 29th STREET.

260
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:22,729
"His handshake was firm.

261
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,631
"I couldn't help but imagine

262
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:27,100
Those same hands
massaging my shoulders."

263
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,140
I need you too something for me.

264
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:37,377
Anything, zach. Anything at all.

265
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,245
I wanna read my play to you.

266
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,383
That's exactly what
I hoped you'd say.

267
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,018
"Page one,

268
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,653
Act one."

269
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:48,188
That's amazing.

270
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:51,858
"A spotlight illuminates
a well-worn easy chair,

271
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,826
Center stage."

272
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,396
An easy chair-- that's so good.

273
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,003
Wow. You're really
in the zone, huh?

274
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:06,139
Zone? Yes.

275
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,107
I'm feeling the zone.

276
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:09,943
How was that thing last night?

277
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,611
-Thing?
-Mm-hmm.

278
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:13,546
Oh, you mean my meeting with zach--

279
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:15,181
Zachary--zachary boule?

280
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,084
Good. But I wouldn't
really call it "A thing."

281
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,053
I'd call it an interview.

282
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,155
Wow. You're being
kind of weird, hmm?

283
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,791
I'm not acting weird.
You're acting weird.

284
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,693
Hello?

285
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,027
Zachary.

286
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,196
How weird.

287
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,900
Um, daniel, this is zachary.

288
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,469
It's nice to meet you.

289
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:39,239
You have a... really big fan here.

290
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:41,574
Daniel, I'm not a fan.
I'm not a fan.

291
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:44,043
I'm an impartial journalist.
Can I help you with something?

292
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,474
Just wanted to follow up
on our thing last night.

293
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,822
ÐèÒªÌýÒë

294
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:51,985
Well, uh, let's go
somewhere and talk.

295
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,156
All we have to do is drop
these caftans and turbans off

296
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,455
With wilhelmina--

297
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,456
The outfit of choice for
any recovering diva.

298
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,920
Mm. Tyler just sent me a text.

299
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,545
He wants to have dinner with me

300
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:06,222
when he gets back from paris.

301
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,280
I can't decide if it's weird or hot

302
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,291
That you're sleeping
with one brother

303
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,659
-And secretly befriending the other.
-I can't either.

304
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,859
On one hand, I've known
daniel for years,

305
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,793
And I really care about him.

306
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,521
But on the other hand,
tyler's a model.

307
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:22,284
-So it's kind of even, right?
-Ah, dilemmas.

308
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,251
Dr. Bynes to proctology.

309
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,719
Dr. Bynes to proctology.

310
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,454
Aw.

311
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:31,715
Oh, sweet. She's napping.
I want to pull back the covers

312
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,684
-And look at her body while she sleeps. N
-no! No, no.

313
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:37,086
Let's just drop this stuff off

314
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,055
And go have a nice lunch.

315
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,257
I was thinking soup and
half a salad. Oh, okay.

316
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:46,262
Really, marc?
Soup and half a salad?

317
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,559
When the cat's away,

318
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,130
the mice will gorge
themselves to death.

319
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,730
Oh, my god. Willie...

320
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:54,734
You're in semiprivate room.
This was all they had available.

321
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,637
Lucky for me, she gets no visitors.

322
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,506
Just slowly rotting away.

323
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,675
Oh, sad face.

324
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,111
Well, you're looking awfully spry

325
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,680
For someone who's recovering
from a perforated ulcer.

326
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,648
Well, I have to stay alert

327
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:12,819
-To go over the final details for our new amsterdam shoot.
-Ohh.

328
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:16,756
Did you not remember that
daniel killed that yesterday?

329
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,225
Of course I remembered.

330
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,628
And I'm reviving it,
so we'll work from here.

331
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,231
And don't you dare tell daniel.

332
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:27,000
If you're hungry,
call down for some ice chips.

333
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:32,444
I'm sorry that you had to
come all the way down here.

334
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:34,946
-Well, the way we ended things last night...
-I know,

335
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:38,652
zach. I am sorry.
I am so embarrassed.

336
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,755
I wish I could take
everything back.

337
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,249
I mean, I'm a journalist.

338
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,160
I should be able to maintain a
certain level of profession--

339
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,931
Have dinner with me tonight.

340
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:54,801
I would love to.

341
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,636
No! No, I can't.

342
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:59,706
I pushed really hard
to write this article,

343
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,844
And if my boss found out
that you and I were involved,

344
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,846
That would look really bad.

345
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,782
So...

346
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,784
Then we won't tell him.

347
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,819
If anyone found out...

348
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,854
Zach, you're in the tabloids.

349
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,223
I had to date two actresses
and crash a motorcycle,

350
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:20,060
And suddenly everyone wants
to take your picture.

351
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,896
We can keep it a secret,
just between us.

352
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,898
I've gotten pretty good

353
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:27,801
At avoiding the paparazzi
when I have to.

354
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:31,314
Okay, yes. A secret date.

355
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,215
A secret date.

356
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,121
Yeah, uh, maybe tomorrow.

357
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,757
I know, but...

358
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,774
Ugh. Even through a morphine haze,

359
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,276
I can see the shoddy
work on these samples.

360
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:56,579
Have new ones sent
over immediately.

361
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,981
Oh, and call the waitress.
I need more jell-o.

362
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,350
Wilhelmina. Ugh.
Speaking of jell-o.

363
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:03,085
I just tried to book lorenzo

364
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,054
For the cover shoot
we're actually doing,

365
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,323
And I find out that
he's already been booked

366
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:10,693
-For your new amsterdam shoot-
- e one we're not doing. -Ohh!

367
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,895
It's not gonna work this time.

368
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,297
Look, you can come up with
something more manageable

369
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:18,100
For the next cover,
but this one is mine.

370
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:21,604
-Let it go.
-Screw you and your crappy gerber daisies.

371
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,806
Fine. You win.

372
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,442
Thank you.

373
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,642
Well, I guess that's that.

374
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:30,835
I'll just take these down.

375
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,803
No, you heard daniel.

376
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:36,073
I get the next cover,
so park your ass down.

377
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,714
Jock strap night at boy bar

378
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:40,811
-doesn't start till 10:00.
-Get out of my head, woman.

379
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:45,593
Okay,

380
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:47,052
There's a chance this
movie might stink,

381
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,706
But it's starring bruce willis,

382
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,611
So the theater will
probably be empty.

383
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,983
Well, in that case,
I'd better do this now.

384
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,785
Marc, you have to escape. Hide!

385
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,221
I am not going to jock
strap night alone.

386
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,491
I will look like a fool.
Oh, hey, betty.

387
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,849
Yeah, she's hanging out
in the lobby again.

388
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,751
-I know. Weird. It's not even saturday.
-I'm sorry.

389
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,753
I work with her,
and she's such a gossip,

390
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,884
-So let's just wait five minutes and...
-I didn't bng my wallet,

391
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:13,358
Because I knew you
were gonna be there.

392
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,893
Yeah, she's still here.
I don't know.

393
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:19,296
-She seems happy. I don't ask.
-Again, I'm sorry.

394
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,449
Let's just dash out
before she comes back.

395
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,058
Fine. I'll find some other
queen to buy me a drink.

396
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:26,193
Oh, my god.

397
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,929
Betty met someone in the lobby.

398
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:31,398
You should totally
start hanging out here.

399
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,234
Why would that make you sad?

400
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,670
Okay, hopefully she's
not coming back.

401
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,672
I think we'rsafer back here.

402
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:45,646
All right,

403
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,148
Here are all the bridal
issues I could find.

404
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:51,118
Okay, so tell me,

405
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,720
Does this say engagement party

406
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,156
Or... dead hooker under a bridge?

407
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,625
Does she have to be a dead hooker?

408
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,528
-Could she just be a live hooker?
-Can you just answer me?

409
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,964
Bobby's cousin is coming over,
and she's a hooker.

410
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:07,234
I don't want her to think
I'm making fun, you know.

411
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:09,970
Then keep looking.

412
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:12,706
Aw. Oh, let me guess.

413
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,641
We're taking the path train

414
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,643
Out to new jersey tonight

415
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,048
To go to this out-of-the-way
argentinean restaurant.

416
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:20,781
-That's cute, right?
-That is cute.

417
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,584
I still n't believe
he's actually into me.

418
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,186
Why? Because he's an
award-winning playwright?

419
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,755
Listen, you wrote a play, too.

420
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,225
Second grade. You remember?

421
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,160
"The bumblebee that
needed glasses."

422
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,963
Ohh, god!

423
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:38,465
That thing broke my heart.

424
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,335
Anyway, the point is,
you are worth it.

425
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,437
Believe it now.

426
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,839
Your child is calling. Hi, justin!

427
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,342
Hi, sweetie.

428
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:50,425
Mom, where the hell
are the cloth napkins?

429
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,279
Oh, whoa. What's
with the word "Hell"?

430
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,278
Well, lily's coming
over to watch a movie,

431
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,817
And it's our first time alone,

432
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:58,752
And I can't very well serve
her popcorn with paper towels,

433
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,274
-Can I?
-Well, actually you can, but--

434
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,431
Oh, god. She's here. Forget it.

435
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,731
Oh, hell.

436
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,108
-Hi.
-Hey.

437
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,146
Oh.

438
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,914
Hey.

439
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:25,784
-Hey, where's your tv? I'll set up the movie.
-Oh, it's in there.

440
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:29,954
She invited me. I guess
she wanted me here, too.

441
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,498
Or maybe she felt sorry for you,

442
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,092
-'cause you were left out.
-Or maybe she likes me better.

443
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,895
Or maybe you need a breath mint.

444
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,065
Guys, which "Romeo & juliet"-
zeffirelli or luhrmann?

445
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,866
-Luhrmann.
-Luhrmann.

446
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,703
Welcome.

447
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,841
Everyone.

448
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,943
You know, I have to admit,

449
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:55,080
All this sneaking around
has been kind of fun.

450
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,549
Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot.

451
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,018
My orthodontist's card.

452
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,491
Cute.

453
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,595
Bye. Bye.

454
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:28,312
Daniel, I know what
this looks like,

455
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:29,340
But I can explain.

456
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,345
I think I can put two
and two together.

457
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:34,169
You begged me to let you do a
story on a hot new playwright.

458
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,359
I finally agreed to
an objective profile,

459
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,332
And now I discover you're
actually dating him.

460
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:41,549
In my defense... I have no defense.

461
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,079
I don't even know
what to say to you.

462
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,367
You could lose your
journalism license.

463
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,455
Oh, no! My journalism license?

464
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:51,340
What?

465
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,924
Daniel! You are so cute
when you're mortified.

466
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:57,640
You have no idea how
stressed out I've been

467
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,418
Trying to keep this
a secret from you.

468
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:01,125
You're actually
worried what I think?

469
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:03,422
Betty, I'm here because
I'm fooling around

470
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:04,645
With my assistant.

471
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:09,035
So my point was, I'm not one
to pass judgment on anyone.

472
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:11,323
Just give me a little
heads-up next time.

473
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,525
I think I'm gonna say
no to dinner with tyler.

474
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:19,206
I've got this thing with daniel,

475
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,227
And aren't there state laws

476
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,295
Against going from one brother
to another? Probably in texas.

477
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,916
You're not allowed
to do anything there.

478
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:27,247
Maybe I'll just have
coffee with tyler.

479
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,846
He's so nice, and I think I'm a
little bit smarter than he is.

480
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:33,564
You have no idea how
good that feels. I do.

481
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:37,980
Mandy, look, what you have
with daniel is casual and fun,

482
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,165
But with tyler...
you don't know what that is.

483
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:42,256
So you have to ask yourself,

484
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:43,513
Are you happy with what you've got

485
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:47,525
Or do you want the possibility
of something more?

486
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:49,311
No.

487
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,481
Not you two.

488
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,129
Excuse me? I'm wilhelmina
slater's doctor,

489
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,226
And I can't have you two
bringing her any more work.

490
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,653
If she doesn get some rest,
she'll never heal.

491
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:02,260
But, dr. So-and-so, we don't
have the power to stop her. Try.

492
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:06,211
Otherwise you'll be visiting
her here for a very long time.

493
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,590
What are we supposed to do,
kill her?

494
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,567
We can't.

495
00:22:10,857 --> 00:22:12,449
She'll only grow stronger.

496
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:17,604
Hi. Hi.

497
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:18,765
Where the hell have you been?

498
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:22,901
We got held up by dr. Who's-it.
He's really worried out you.

499
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:25,496
That fool. He couldn't find
his ass with both hands

500
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,027
If I spotted him a cheek.

501
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,716
So let's get to work.

502
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay. Well, here's this.

503
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,942
Distract her.

504
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,197
Excuse me, wilhelmina.

505
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,669
I have a very important
question to ask you.

506
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,259
Yes?

507
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,367
Which of these is the cabbage patch

508
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:48,722
And which is the prep?

509
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:49,584
"A"...

510
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:54,238
Or "B"?

511
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:00,495
What is she doing?

512
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:03,195
And what are you doing?
! I'm saving you from yourself.

513
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,198
You idiot! No! Ow, ow. Ow!

514
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:06,063
When I wake up, I swear to god,

515
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,494
AAAA

516
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:10,989
And... hug you. Ohh.

517
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:24,431
Aah! Ohh! Ohh. Oh, I forgot.

518
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,200
She always does that when
she first falls asleep.

519
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:28,329
Ndy? I peed a little.

520
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:31,320
Oh, it's okay. I won't tell anyone.

521
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,121
Hey, I got your message.

522
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,655
I was surprised you
wanted to meet me here.

523
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,238
I wanted to show you something.

524
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,229
Betty, what are you doing?

525
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,866
People can see u

526
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,118
I know. We don't
have to hide anymore.

527
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:55,830
But what about all the
code of ethics stuff?

528
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,910
I was taking it too seriously.
I can do that.

529
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,713
So I was thinking maybe
I could be your date

530
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,763
To the premiere tonight?

531
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:04,848
I would love that,

532
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:08,297
But let me just call my
mom first and cancel.

533
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:10,963
Wait. You were gonna take your mom?
I know. I'm lame.

534
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,775
But she kinda lives
for every opportunity

535
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,506
To come into the city
and see a celebrity.

536
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:15,845
That's not lame. That's sweet.

537
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,592
No, stop, stop.
You can't cancel on her.

538
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:20,024
Why not? I would
rather go with you.

539
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,487
That's also very sweet,
but you should take your mom.

540
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:24,748
I can go later in the week.
You sure?

541
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:28,197
Yes. Now go. You have
to get ready. Okay.

542
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:33,282
Break a leg!

543
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:38,490
Ugh. Okay. Well, this hair
isn't getting any better.

544
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:39,801
Let's just go.

545
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:46,100
What's wrong?

546
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:48,546
Why are we sitting?

547
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:50,754
I'm freaking out.

548
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,375
I have to kiss lily
in our scene tonight.

549
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,639
You have to kiss lily?

550
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:02,340
But I thought you liked
this girl, right?

551
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:04,513
Isn't this a good thing?

552
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,736
Yeah, we've just
never rehearsed it,

553
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:10,953
And our first kiss
is gonna be onstage.

554
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,024
What if she thinks that I'm... bad?

555
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,285
Okay, well...

556
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,241
If you think about it,

557
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,203
You're in a pretty good place.

558
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,203
You actually like the
girl you have to kiss.

559
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:30,186
So just let...
your feelings take over.

560
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:33,802
And you won't be...

561
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:36,045
Bad.

562
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,599
If you kiss someone

563
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:42,177
With feeling,

564
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,160
They know it,

565
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,808
And you know it.

566
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:49,593
It's like...

567
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,576
It's like everything
else goes gray,

568
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,397
And...

569
00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:58,435
You're the only two people
left in the whole world.

570
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:01,725
Thanks.

571
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,162
I feel better now.

572
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:06,811
Good.

573
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,922
I've never felt more alone.

574
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,429
Off we go!

575
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:20,262
Excuse me.

576
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:22,384
Ooh! Sorry.

577
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:24,520
Okay. Oh!

578
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,948
Did I hit you? I'm sorry.

579
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,253
Sorry. Oh. Are those
for one of the actors?

580
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,935
No, the playwright.
We're seeing each other.

581
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,689
Zachary boule? Really?

582
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:38,340
Really. I mean,
I was supposed to sit with him,

583
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,354
But he's bringing
his mother instead,

584
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,994
And I couldn't just not come,
so I used my press pass.

585
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:44,727
Actually I thought I'd
get a better seat.

586
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,457
Not that these are bad seats.
These are great seats.

587
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,824
Sure. Let's just hope the
play is as good as that story.

588
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,548
Oh, there he is.

589
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,158
Zach. Zach!

590
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,304
Hi! I made it.

591
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,297
I know this is gonna
sound insensitive,

592
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,978
But you're gonna sit down, right?

593
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:31,511
No, um...

594
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,329
I have to go. Excuse me. Sorry.

595
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:38,382
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

596
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,772
Excuse me. Shh!

597
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,512
Mama? Mama, where are ya?
I can't see ya.

598
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,395
I'm here, rita.

599
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:49,998
I had some trouble
getting back here

600
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,412
Through the fog.

601
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,667
Run on down and help
me with this dirt.

602
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:58,538
Was daddy with you? Oh,
he's held up by mr. Wilkins.

603
00:27:58,558 --> 00:27:59,514
Sorry. I didn't mean--

604
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,450
His mare's workin' through a fever.

605
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,764
sorry again. I'm sorry.
He'll be back in a bit.

606
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,875
How was I supposed to know

607
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,293
She was gonna come down the aisle?
That's so clich?

608
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:13,413
This isn't what I thought it would be.
Then what are you saying?

609
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,935
Tell him, beatrice.

610
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:16,625
I'm saying good-bye.

611
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,305
That's not how you say good-bye.

612
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:26,027
Oh, my god. I think this is it.
What? This is what?

613
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,006
Oh, my.

614
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,423
Terrific! That was terrific!

615
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:54,611
A little better in rehearsal,

616
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:55,942
But that was good.

617
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,507
Oh, dear god,

618
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:05,504
Would you please knock it off?

619
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,090
Oh. I'm sorry.

620
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,613
I assumed by the
zombielike complexion

621
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,299
And the occasional death
rattle you wouldn't mind.

622
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,478
Ouch.

623
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:22,061
S×ÖÄ» Save it for those poor
kids you torture all day.

624
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,618
Those kids are my employees.

625
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,795
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

626
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:28,985
I have a business to run.

627
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,507
Oh, I understand.

628
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,927
I used to be you.

629
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,214
You know, I'm gonna call the nurse.

630
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,941
You are clearly having a stroke.

631
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,900
You're a high-strung type "A" Bch

632
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,997
Who doesn't give a damn about
anything but her career.

633
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,530
You see, this is why I
wanted a private room.

634
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:46,000
And let me tell you something.

635
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,025
You are getting old.

636
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:50,389
You heard me.

637
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:53,054
You can paralyze your whole face.

638
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:55,703
You can lift your boobs,
your butt and your neck

639
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,744
Until you're 6 inches
off the ground,

640
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,447
But you can't stop time.

641
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,431
One day your precious job
is gonna be done with you,

642
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:06,120
And all you're gonna be left with

643
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,666
Is a bunch of missed holidays,
skipped vacations...

644
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,155
And a son you haven't
seen in 20 years.

645
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:18,188
Hell, I might be a grandmother

646
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:19,228
And not even know it,

647
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,738
But I got stock options...

648
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:27,789
And a bunch of toys I
can't even play with.

649
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:38,159
Thank you so much for coming, but I

650
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:40,739
need to find my friends.
Okay, well, I love you. Mwah.

651
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,349
Have a good time at the cast party,

652
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,540
And stay as long as you want,

653
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,578
But take a cab,
and be home by 11:00. Okay.

654
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:47,839
By the way,

655
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:52,308
That thing you were worried about-
-you total sold it. Thanks.

656
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:28,775
Betty!

657
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,681
Betty, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.

658
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,197
It must have been
so hard to grow up

659
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:34,854
With a mother who was
younger than you.

660
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:36,579
Good luck with the play.
No, it wasn't my idea.

661
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,831
My agent and manager
set up the whole thing.

662
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:40,590
You think all this
would've happened

663
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,078
To ezra butinsky,
nerd writer from jersey?

664
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:45,860
Yes! Because ezra is talented.

665
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,716
Yeah, well, ezra didn't have
any of his plays produced

666
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:49,687
Until he changed his
name to zachary boule

667
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,508
And got a $500 haircut. Well,

668
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:54,299
I'm glad that worked out for you,
but I'd like to go.

669
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:57,790
Come on. I have a reputation.

670
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:01,002
That involves being seen
with hot girls on your arm?

671
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:04,327
Exactly. They get me press,
and that fills the seats,

672
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:06,755
But it doesn't mean
we can't go out.

673
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,553
Just that no one can
know about it. For now.

674
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,501
Come on.

675
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,301
I like you, betty.
Just wait for me after the show.

676
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,711
Don't think about it.

677
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:19,770
Be impulsive.

678
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,877
Just...

679
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:22,776
Do what you want to do.

680
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:40,668
Hey, what are you doing?

681
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:43,640
I thought we were gonna hang out.
You guys go without me.

682
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:46,433
Justin, I know you saw us.

683
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:48,050
Don't worry.

684
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,190
She didn't pick me
over you or anything.

685
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,255
I kissed her.

686
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,754
You got to do it onstage,
so I wanted my shot, too.

687
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,812
Well, she seemed pretty into it.

688
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:58,715
I guess.

689
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,434
You weren't?

690
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:04,788
Well, it wasn't like
you two onstage.

691
00:33:05,428 --> 00:33:07,057
That seemed intense.

692
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,585
Yeah, well...

693
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,603
I guess it's just because
I'm a good actor.

694
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:14,277
R-really?

695
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:16,345
Yeah.

696
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,333
I-it was better in my head.

697
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,615
You know, this is messed up,
all right? Like...

698
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:28,987
Oh, and by the way,
you weren't that good, all right?

699
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,480
'cause I had to move
all the way over here,

700
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:32,004
'cause you were totally blocking me

701
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:35,319
When you kissed her. You wish.
I definitely did it right.

702
00:33:35,353 --> 00:33:37,682
You just have to have everyone
seeing you all the time.

703
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,589
Oh, trust me, they were
looking at me anyway.

704
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,685
You are so in love with yourself.
Wouldn't you be?

705
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:51,720
?You make me so good ?

706
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,495
?To be around ?

707
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,258
?Feeling like you should ?

708
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:00,571
I'm sorry.

709
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:05,102
?Won't get you down ?

710
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,632
?In the system ?

711
00:34:09,652 --> 00:34:12,089
?Hell amidst 'em ?

712
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:16,751
?Everyone's a messed
up trip, yeah ?

713
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:20,550
Isn'that dress tacky?

714
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,171
Ay, I wouldn't even wear that.
I wouldn't even wear that!

715
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:25,028
That dress is a no.

716
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:30,817
Hey, I'm home. Justin!

717
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,900
Hey. There's my star!

718
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:35,154
Oh, my god.
You are not gonna believe

719
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:36,324
What your aunt betty did.

720
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,734
She punched that guy
zachary at his premiere!

721
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:40,274
Look, it's already on the internet.

722
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,632
Wow, that's crazy!

723
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:46,063
I'm not proud of it,
but it did feel really good.

724
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:49,151
Okay, well, good night.

725
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,834
Hey, why are you
rushing off to bed?

726
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:53,479
And why are you home so early?

727
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,350
I thought you were gonna hang out

728
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,298
With lily and what's
his name. Austin.

729
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,805
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, I was...

730
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:02,708
Um... i'm just not
feeling that great.

731
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:06,400
I-I don't think I'm gonna
go to acting class tomorrow.

732
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:07,960
Really?

733
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:13,125
Must just be the excitement
from the night, huh?

734
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:14,743
Yeah.

735
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,265
Maybe.

736
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:24,790
Man, teenagers and
their mood swings.

737
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:27,008
One minute he's up and
the next minute...

738
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:32,526
Oh, god. What's wrong with you?

739
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,084
This whole time,
I thought I was hiding him...

740
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,357
When he was hiding me.

741
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,553
I knew how this was gonna end.

742
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:47,641
Oh, come on, come on.

743
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,383
You can't turn this into
something that it's not.

744
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,378
It's true.

745
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,645
Every time I feel like
I'm moving forward,

746
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,212
Someone reminds me that...

747
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,687
I'm still just the dork
with glasses and braces.

748
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,492
But those braces are
coming off any day now.

749
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:05,480
Yeah, but what if nothing changes?

750
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,430
Then I'll have nothing to blame.

751
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,049
Oh, honey.

752
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:13,214
You gotta stop.

753
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:16,504
Somehow you got it in your head

754
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:18,801
AAAA

755
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,827
But you gotta let that go.

756
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:25,390
It's time to come up with a
whole new story for yourself.

757
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,915
You are who you are.

758
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,617
And the sooner that
you're okay with that,

759
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,555
The sooner that you see what I see,

760
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,009
The happier you're gonna be.

761
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:37,971
I swear to god.

762
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,029
Okay!

763
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,387
Hey, did you get my text?

764
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,610
Um, no.

765
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,980
I've been kind of
avoiding texts all day.

766
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:00,730
Well, I finally talked to my mom.

767
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,170
We really got into it again.
I am in such...

768
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:07,690
A bad mood. I'm sorry, daniel.

769
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,471
Do you have plans? Uh...
you know what?

770
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,391
I'm not sure I'm up for
our kind of plans tonight.

771
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,688
Oh. Okay.

772
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:18,887
Cool.

773
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:20,734
Do you mind if I just hang out?

774
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,999
I don't really feel like
being alone right now.

775
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:28,178
Come on in. I'll grab a couple
of marc's 64-calorie beers.

776
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:29,735
You want one? Nah, I'm good.

777
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,193
You're late.

778
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,031
Oh! Sorry, willie.

779
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,325
About yesterday...

780
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,630
It's fine.

781
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:51,404
Turns out you were right.

782
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:53,946
It was good for me.

783
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:55,354
Really?

784
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:56,287
Yes.

785
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:58,345
I had an epiphany last night.

786
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,444
That angel...

787
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:10,984
That sweet, wheezing angel

788
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:13,887
Said something to me last
night that made me...

789
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,302
Reevaluate my priorities.

790
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:20,428
I'm wasting my life, marc.

791
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:21,765
What am I doing?

792
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,803
Working at a fashion magazine,
day and night. And for what?

793
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:27,101
A paycheck?

794
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:31,058
A meager percentage of
some dwindling bottom line?

795
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,907
I know what I want,

796
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,943
And it's not "Mode."

797
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,091
It's not?

798
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:46,803
It's meade. I want the
whole damn company.

799
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:49,289
And this time, I'm not
gonna dance around claire,

800
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:51,258
No more compromising with daniel,

801
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,742
No more nice willie!

802
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:55,188
This has been nice willie?

803
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,725
If I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die with the most toys!

804
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,129
Betty?

805
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,041
Oh, no. Look at your face.

806
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:09,361
It's okay. I deserved it.

807
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,745
I came by to say thank you
for sending me the profile.

808
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:13,249
Uh, it was surprisingly nice.

809
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,936
Kind of expected you to trash me now.
No, I would never do that.

810
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:20,173
Aside from the occasional
punching and sneaking around,

811
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,038
I like to keep it professional.

812
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,965
I'm glad you liked the article.

813
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,205
Betty...

814
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,759
I really am sorry.

815
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:30,521
And I really like you.

816
00:39:31,513 --> 00:39:33,774
And this might be
presumptuous of me to ask,

817
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:36,870
But is there any chance you
might give me another shot?

818
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:39,906
No.

819
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:41,824
Thanks. But, no.

820
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,816
I think it's time for me
to try something different.

821
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:47,095
But I'll see you around.

822
00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:57,450
Hey. Hi.

823
00:39:57,864 --> 00:40:00,239
Um, have you seen austin?

824
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:01,602
No.

825
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:02,851
I'm sorry I'm late.

826
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,455
Some days, it's just
hard to get out of bed.

827
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,869
You're actors. You'll see.

828
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,670
Okay, let's begin.

829
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,215
Yeah? Shouldn't we wait for austin?

830
00:40:13,235 --> 00:40:16,259
Oh, no. Uh, austin will
no longer be joining us.

831
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,379
He dropped out of
class this morning.

832
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,766
Okay, so today we're gonna talk

833
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:25,452
About having a physical
life on the stage.

834
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:35,162
?I'll follow you,
and you'll follow me ?

835
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,832
?My fabrics mystery ?

836
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,906
?I'll wave your loyalty
in the freezing breeze ?

837
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:44,930
?So desperately ?

838
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,910
?Whoo, ooh, whoo, ooh ?

839
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,109
Hi. My name is betty suarez,

840
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:50,886
And I'm looking for
a new orthodontist.

841
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:54,848
I was wondering if dr.
Frankel is taking any new patients?

842
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,480
I've been wearing braces
for over four years now.

843
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,082
?And another one comes down ?

844
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,322
Wednesday?

845
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:05,143
That would be great.

846
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:46,116
Of people in our area are

Of people in our area are
