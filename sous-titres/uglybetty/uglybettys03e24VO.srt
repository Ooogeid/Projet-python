1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,540
The dreams always begin the same

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,170
I'm eating a hot dog in a park

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
And that's when I notice everyone is gone.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,660
- Weird. just then, I hear henry's voice. - Betty?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,870
I realize it's not henry, but...

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,730
Antonio Sabato Jr.?

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,560
Before I can do anything,

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,810
Antonio rips the hot dog from my hand.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,000
No hot dog for you, Betty Suarez.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,010
And then he kisses me.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,010

Joanna    ronald     sadnessleaf
honeybunny

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,780
Matt?

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,090
How could you, Betty? You betrayed me.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,280
You're a cheater. you kissed him.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,070
You kissed Antonio Sabato Jr. with tongue.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,830
You frenched Antonio Sabato Jr?

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,140
Was it good?

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,250
That's not the point.

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,030
Obviously, he'Henry.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,390
Oh. So what's the hot dog?

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,440
Also not the point.

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,030
I think I have to tell Matt that I kissed Henry

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,650
Before we move in together.

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,760
Betty, I don't care how guilty you feel.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,580
Keep your piehole shut.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,630
Please tell me, what good is telling him?

28
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,460
Well, I don't want there to be secrets between us,

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,530
Especially when we're about to take things to another level.

30
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,580
I mean, it's been three days already.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,860
Listen, if that kiss meant nothing,

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,620
You're about to turn nothing into something.

33
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,490
I don't know.

34
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,950
Matt's coming home from his painter's retreat today.

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,310
I'm just gonna tell him at lunch.

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,780
Good morning.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey. What are you doing up so early?

38
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,260
The live media telecast of the Mama Award nominees.

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,420
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,010
Oh, the Mama Awards-- am I nominated?

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,770
The magazine and media association awards.

42
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,500
Yeah, it's, like, my favorite awards show

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,250
After the Oscars, the Tonys,

44
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,040
The Golden Globes and the Grammys.

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,800
Aw. My baby's so full of culture.

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,180
You are so getting into

47
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,850
That performing arts high school.

48
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,000
Mom, it's too early for love.

49
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,200
Nominees in the category of socially relevant article

50
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,130
Are "anorexia's forgotten prisoners,"

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,670
The "New York Review"...

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,810
In honor of the Mama Awards,

53
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,300
Your traditional one bite of bagel.

54
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,230
Thank you.

55
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,890
I assumed since you're off to work for "Vogue" now,

56
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,370
You wouldn't be here this morning.

57
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,020
Oh, Stop. My head may belong to Anna Wintour,

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,220
But my heart will always belong to you

59
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,610
And Jake Gyllenhaal-- but mostly you.

60
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,610
And the nominees for best fashion issue of the year...

61
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,630
That's our category.

62
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,630
"Elle," spring fashion issue, march, 2009,

63
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,040

Editors-in-chief Daniel Meade and Wilhelmina Slater...

66
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,850
Willie, it's your first nomination as editor-in-chief.

67
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,230
Too bad I have to share it with that drooling idiot.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,310
Congratulations.

69
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,740
You're nominated for a Mama for the wedding issue.

70
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,580
Mm. that's cool.

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,550
Cool?

72
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,280
It's huge.

73
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,540
Not to mention, I'm on the cover.

74
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,780
Okay, that is definitely the best part.

75
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,800
Wait, wait. you had a fever last night.

76
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,710
You have to get back to sleep. Come on.

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,510
I'm fine.

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,630
And even better knowing... you're gonna win.

79
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,180
Yeah. I can't wait--

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,270
My husband on stage accepting his trophy.

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,590
I am so proud of you, babe.

82
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,300
Yay, Wilhelmina!

83
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,770
All hail the nominee!

84
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,670
Oh, this is all too much. you know I hate attention.

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,690
- Brava, Willie. Brava. - Oh, you don't have to do that.

86
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,860
- Keep doing that. - Marc, where is the press?

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,480
Eagerly awaiting their queen.

88
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,710
That's not their queen.

89
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,280
Look at them fawning over her

90
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,100
Like she's Obama's portuguese water dog.

91
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,370
I think it's time we bust out

92
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
That little secret we dug up.

93
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,270
So are there any more questions

94
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,860
Oh, I have one.

95
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,990
Uh, I was thinking about taking a little vacation

96
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,370
To Madison, South Dakota.

97
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,980
I heard it's a wonderful place to find your inner child.

98
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,890
Ever been there, recently, or maybe in the early '80s?

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,980
I think we've had quite enough questions.

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,630
Thank you all for coming.

101
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,930
Thank you.

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,010
What does she mean? what does she mean by that?

103
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,530
Were you there at that time?

104
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,070
I'm so sorry.

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,640
You know how easily the elderly tire out.

106
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,750
Now who wants to talk about my nomination?

107
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,325
When did you find out?

108
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:34,880
How did you share that with Daniel?

109
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,150
Congratulations!

110
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,420
Huh. That's... interesting.

111
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,520
It's an "M" for Mama. You can't tell?

112
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,780
A piece broke off.

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,060
Okay, I ate it.

114
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,905
Why aren't you out there doing any press?

115
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh, my mom's Senior V.P. now.

116
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,650
I'll let her be the face of the company.

117
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,610
I meant to ask you, has Penny Meadows turned in

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,755
That Yves Saint Laurent piece yet?

119
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,890
I haven't gotten anything.

120
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,130
That's weird. She's been working on that for months now.

121
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm gonna need that for the fall issue.

122
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,210
Can you go check and see how it's coming?

123
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,440
- What? - It's just... she's mean...

124
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,550
And scary and she always has terrible breath,

125
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,190
Like coffee and moth balls

126
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,890
And some other weird smell I can't quite figure out.

127
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,110
Betty, she's not that bad.

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,780
What the hell do you want, eyebrow?

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,830
Good morning, Penny.

130
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,540
Daniel was wondering about the Yves Saint Laurent piece.

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,150
- Working on it. - Right, I understand. It's just--

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,340
Look at those damn pigeons-- taunting me,

133
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,660
Making their little pigeon noises...

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,510
Crapping all over the window.

135
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,870
- Could you give me a hand here? - Um, okay.

136
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,490
See, the thing is,

137
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,300
They're starting to work on the fall issue,

138
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,870
- And Daniel's just a little concerned... - You want a beer?

139
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,280
No, thank you.

140
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,860
Uh, maybe... maybe after work,

141
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,200
When it's appropriate to drink.

142
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,970
So about the article--

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,470
Listen, buzzkill, you can't rush art, okay?

144
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,690
Did anyone say to Picasso, "yo, Pablo,

145
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,650
"uh, could you hurry up

146
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,970
"with that Guernica thing?

147
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,690


149
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,740
You're a real Pioneers full of fun. shoo!

150
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,760
Shoo! shoo! shoo!

151
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,790
Come on. go. shoo. shoo.

152
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,510
Why are they wearing gas masks?

153
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,790
It's protecting them

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,970
From the foul stench of their lies.

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,510
Wow. uh... that's neat.

156
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,890
It's dark, but neat.

157
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,650
It's where inspiration took me.

158
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,870
Um, matt, I have something

159
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,790
That I've been meaning to talk to you about.

160
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,630
I'm glad to hear it.

161
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,670
God, this is hard.

162
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,110
But before we move in, i-i think that you should know--

163
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,480
Oh, my god! penny?

164
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,220
Fall fashion exclusive--

165
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,180
Emphasis on "fall."

166
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,860
"mode" feature editor penny meadows

167
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,310
To shoo pigeons away from her 28th-floor window.

168
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,270
On my sexy death meter, this one barely rates a 3.

169
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,240
All right, so I issued a statement to the press,

170
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,600
Signed the police report.

171
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,560
- What else are we forgetting? - I sent flowers to the family.

172
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,390
- Oh, good. thank you. - daniel, I was thinking,

173
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,680
Maybe I could organize a memorial service

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,630
So that her friends here can say good-bye to her.

175
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,480
-did she have friends -not really, but we'd do sth nice

176
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,520
- I was thinking a coffee cart. - oh, I'd love a coffee--

177
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,410
I mean, uh, I think penny would've really liked that.

178
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,380
I hate even thinking about it,

179
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,770
But how are we gonna spread out her workload here?

180
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,610
Well, um...

181
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,340
Daniel, since you brought it up,

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,460
- I was thinking--  - do you want her job?

183
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,310
Oh, god. it sounds so awful when you say it out loud.

184
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,120
No, no, we were thinking the same thing.

185
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,640
I think a feature editor position

186
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,100
Would be a perfect fit for you.

187
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,160
Well, we should be respectful.

188
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,090
You know, let the grieving process happen

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,390
Before we tell anyone.

190
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,330
Way to go, aunt betty!

191
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,200
Guys, please. it's a really delicate situation.

192
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,190
Promise me you're not gonna show up at work

193
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,610
With balloons or a cake.

194
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,500
- Somebody say cake? - papi, please. it's so inappropriate.

195
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm sorry for how you got the job, mija,

196
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,410
- But you know you deserve it. - thank you, papi.

197
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,190
Look, if it helps, we can all go to church tonight

198
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,390
- And light a candle for the poor woman. - oh, good.

199
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,810
I could light a candle for saint vitus.

200
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,430
The patron saint of all actors?

201
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,650
He's gotta have some pull at the performing arts school.

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,590
oh, honey. Don't worry about it.

203
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,160
You're gonna get in. you're gonna be a big star.

204
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,740
Now go help grandpa with the meat loaf.

205
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,070
Hurry up. hurry up.

206
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,340
so tell me, what happened with matt?

207
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,740
I didn't get to tell him.

208
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,720
The accident sort of interrupted things.

209
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,900
- Good. - no, not good. I need to tell him.

210
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,360
You know that I am a very spiritual person, right?

211
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,320
- Not really. - I am.

212
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,210
And I try to find the meaning in everything,

213
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,280
And all I'm gonna say is, that woman gave her life

214
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,910
So that you could have a chance at a new one.

215
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,510
okay, that's a little much.

216
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,520
You got a new job, you got a chance

217
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,880
At a clean slate with matt.

218
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,210
Why are you gonna screw it up by telling him?

219
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,120
You're just gonna hurt him.

220
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,880
Okay, ryan,

221
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,780
If you're going to be replacing marc,

222
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
There are a few things you need to know.

223
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,020
NO.1, wilhelmina doesn't like being called by her name.

224
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,790
She prefers "honey."

225
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,800
And number "b," she insists on a morning mouth kiss--

226
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,790
- A big one. - amanda!

227
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,840
- Are you trying to sabotage young ryan? - yes, I hate him.

228
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,500
Marc, you can't just replace yourself

229
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,510
- With another gay guy. - I'm not gay.

230
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,940
Yeah, right.

231
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,330
You're in a long-distance relationship

232
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,860
With a lovely heavy woman.

233
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,000
Watch your back, new boy.

234
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,090
She's coming out of her meeting.

235
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,650
Give this file to her.

236
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,330
Wilhelmina...

237
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,000
We need to talk.

238
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,650
So victoria hartley told you about south dakota.

239
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,860
She told me her husband got you pregnant.

240
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,050
I assume that's the same story.

241
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,730
I was pregnant by my husband's best friend.

242
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,590
I had a very difficult decision to make.

243
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,770
I left the city and i...

244
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,080
Terminated the pregnancy.

245
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,730
Bradford and cal never knew.

246
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,380
But all the lying drove me to have a nervous breakdown.

247
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,770
It took me a year to recover.

248
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,660
Mm. I love our girl talk.

249
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,100
So I suspect there's a reason why you don't want cal

250
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,510
To know about your difficult decision.

251
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,460
I could see how he might hate you.

252
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,630
What do you want, wilhelmina?

253
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,610
I want you to step down

254
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,320
As senior vice president of meade,

255
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,190
And keep your big dandelion head

256
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Out of any "mode" business.

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,240
Oh, claire, you know what might be fun?

258
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,830
If you announce your resignation at the mama awards.

259
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,360
Seems appropriate.

260
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,860
Don't you think?

261
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,300
I didn't think it was possible

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,710
For a human being to exist

263
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,430
And not have one ounce of humanity,

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,630
But there you are.

265
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,510
Why, claire, you flatter me.

266
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,480
Methinks ye olde claire is vanquished

267
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,260
yes, we have conquered our enemy once again.

268
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,220
It seems like

269
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,360
This will be our last conquest together.

270
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,930
I guess it is.

271
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,730
We've had a lot of good times together. oh.

272
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,680
Remember breaking into that safe

273
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,510
To steal bradford's will?

274
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,040
Oh, that was the best.

275
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,120
No. the best was having christina accused

276
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,820
Of kidnapping her own baby.

277
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,230
Wait, you're forgetting the fact

278
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,220
The we stole the sperm from bradford's cold, dead body

279
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,490
In the first place.

280
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,520
Oh, good times.

281
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,490
Oh. we really should be in jail.

282
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,120
Marc, I know I always haven't been...

283
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,400
Forthcoming with my praise for you.

284
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,140
I just want you to know that, uh...

285
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,650
I'm really...

286
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,080
Going to miss you.

287
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,940
Oh, my g--oh!

288
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,580
Um, wilhelmina.

289
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,940
I-i just wanted you to know

290
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,690
That penny's memorial's about to start.

291
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,800
Oh, uh, marc, before you go,

292
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I want to talk to you about something.

293
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,480
So is that really the best picture

294
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,590
You could find?

295
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,610
It's the one where she was happiest.

296
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,180
Oh--matt. hello.

297
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,380
Hey, how's it going?

298
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,940
Uh, pretty crazy.

299
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,030
Yeah, I'll bet.

300
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,960
Hey, listen, I know you're busy,

301
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,220
But before everything happened,

302
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,980
You were gonna tell me something.

303
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,040
No, no. it was nothing.

304
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,880
Really? 'cause it sounded pretty important.

305
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,300
No, it was about the move.

306
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,970
Um, listen, matt, uh,

307
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,630
The memorial is just about to start.

308
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,450
So could we talk about this later?

309
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,690
Sure.

310
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,910
Oh, my god. a ghost.

311
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,230
I'm not a ghost, dumbass. I'm her twin sister.

312
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,270
Oh. oh, I am so, so sorry about your sister.

313
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,760
We all...

314
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,390
Worked with her.

315
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,420
You must be Mindy.

316
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,740
Wow. you really do look-- I know.

317
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,110
Penny got the looks, and I got the personality.

318
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,370
Well, we're so glad you could make it.

319
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,320
We were just happy to have an opportunity

320
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,956
To pay tribute to your sister.

321
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:16,999
Ok  lets get this doll and tony show on the road

322
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,830
- I have a 4:00 eyelash tint.  - who had the latte?

323
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,680
Oh, thank god. coffee.

324
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,880
Hello. hi.

325
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,680
Everybody, thank you so much for coming. um...

326
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,250
God, there's so much to say about Penny Meadows.

327
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,150
She was part of the "mode" family.

328
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,370
Excuse me. sorry. Could we maybe not

329
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,540
make blended drinks while people are talking?

330
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,520
Thank you.

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,530
Uh, so even though we all didn't know her...

332
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,470
The--the way we wanted to know her...

333
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,710
We'll miss her.

334
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,650
Is there anyone else who'd like to share their thoughts?

335
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,570
I have something I'd like to say.

336
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,470
Good.

337
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm saddened, as everyone is,

338
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,000
By the sudden death of Penny Meadows.

339
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,300
The only way to make... sense of this tragedy

340
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,930
Is to ensure that her legacy lives on.

341
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,450
That will be my goal

342
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,060
As the newest feature editor at "mode" magazine.

343
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,300
What?! no way. that's my job.

344
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,160
- this news you lose Betty  - I did this news

345
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,080
I went after her job the second she died. oh.

346
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,830
Is this still about my sister?!

347
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,120
You can stare all you want, Marc.

348
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm not giving in. Daniel gave me this promotion.

349
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,560
And wilhelmina gave me the promotion.

350
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,500
Yeah. aren't you going to "vogue"?

351
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,650
I passed when Willie reminded me

352
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,210
How much I was needed at "mode,"

353
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,950
Which everyone here agrees with. yeah.

354
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,850
How could you be on his side?

355
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,900
Amanda, I took you in when you had nowhere to live.

356
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,250
That's because you wanted me for your ponzi scheme.

357
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,870
You mean the Ponzi Scheme where I paid your rent

358
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,480
- you went out shopping? - Yeah, I want my money back.

359
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,250
Scram.

360
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,450
It seems that the only thing that we can agree on

361
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,580
Is that you're both qualified for the job.

362
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,050
Unfortunately, there's only one position as editor.

363
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,000
So here's what we're gonna do--

364
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,990
We're making copies of Penny's hard drive--

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,520
All her research on the Yves Saint Laurent article.

366
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,510
you'll take what she's done and prepare it for publication.

367
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,010
Whoever does best gets the job.

368
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,790
The loser gets fired.

369
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,030
- The loser stays an assistant. - not as interesting, but ok.

370
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,510
Any questions?

371
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,990
No.

372
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,230
I guess we're on.

373
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,900
We certainly are.

374
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,950
It's from Laguardia.

375
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,230
- The airport? - The school of the performing arts.

376
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,770
I can't open it.

377
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,830
I can't.

378
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,380
"thank you for your application."

379
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,090
"unfortunately, we're unable to accommodate you

380
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,430
For the upcoming school year."

381
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,510
What?

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,800
Sorry, mijo.

383
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,800
- They're idiots! - Hey, the good news is, it says

384
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,460
You can try out again next year.

385
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,110
I don't want to go next year.

386
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,940
Yeah, I know, Justin, but look at this way--

387
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,870
You know how many times

388
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,580
I ran for city council before I won?

389
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,580
Things that are worth it, sometimes, they--they take time.

390
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,470
I... I-I just wanted to go now.

391
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,310
You're gonna win this.

392
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,720
I wouldn't have agreed to it if you weren't.

393
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,330
There isn't a chance in hell

394
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,315
Marc is gonna turn in a piece better than yours.

395
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,280
I hope so.

396
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,960
Is that your family?

397
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,890
No, Amanda, they're birds.

398
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,930
And apparently the only thing on Penny's hard drive.

399
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,380
Where are her notes?

400
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,670
Well, they wouldn't be on there.

401
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,100
Penny always worked from home.

402
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,690
She only ever came in if she needed

403
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,010
Those ugly yellow pads from the supply closet

404
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,010
Or to take a quick whore's bath in the ladies room.

405
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,700
Thank you, Amanda.

406
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,310
Do you want to get some lunch?

407
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,160
So I think most of penny's research

408
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,330
Is in her apartment.

409
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,530
I was going to go by, see if I can get in.

410
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,660
Well, it sounds like you have a good handle on things.

411
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,100
So did, uh, Henry and his girlfriend get off okay?

412
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,370
I think so.

413
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,460
You, uh, see him again before he left?

414
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,630
I did, briefly, but it wasn't a big deal.

415
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,960
Really? it seemed like a big deal.

416
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,760
I saw you. you kissed him.

417
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,570
Right here in this park, you kissed him,

418
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,310
And I have given you every opportunity

419
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,440
To tell me the truth, but you didn't.

420
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,260
You've just been lying to me.

421
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,860
- I haven't been lying to you, Matt. - maybe not directly.

422
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,030
It's not like I said,

423
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,690
"hey, Betty, I know you're my girlfriend,

424
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,750
I just want to know, have you kissed anyone this week?"

425
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,605
'cause that's not usually a question boyfriends have to ask.

426
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,250
It didn't mean anything. I swear.

427
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,550
- I-I was just saying good-bye to him. - I don't believe you.

428
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,350
Matt, please. Can we just talk about this?

429
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,310
That is what I've wanted to do ever since I stood there

430
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,000
With my heart in my socks watching you kiss him.

431
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,040
Look, don't you know how I feel about you?

432
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,600
don't you know that I'd never kiss someone else, ever?

433
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm sorry. It just happened. it means nothing.

434
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,150
- You have to trust me. - How?

435
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,420
I opened up to you, I wanted us to move in together,

436
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,280
And this is what you do to me? I...

437
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,030
Matt.

438
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,940
Hilda, I lied to him, and you told me to.

439
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,780
But you were protecting his feelings.

440
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,900
Yeah, that distinction was kind of lost on him.

441
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,760
A year ago, everything was so clear.

442
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,850
I wanted my own place in the city. I wanted a promotion.

443
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,040
The last thing I wanted was a boyfriend.

444
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,640
And now it's all I can think about.

445
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,200
Okay, you gotta listen to me.

446
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,020
Matt needs time to cool off, and you cannot screw up

447
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,515
Something that you've been working for the past few years

448
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,580
how am I supposed to think about work right now?

449
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,810
Mama, you have to.

450
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,580
Focus.

451
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,360
No, listen to me, you tell Dave

452
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,370
I want those prints on my desk by this afternoon,

453
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,100
Or we're taking our business someplace else.

454
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,320
It's not negotiable.

455
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,390
You're sexy when you get all bossy boots.

456
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,720
What?

457
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,280
You have been working so hard

458
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,450
Taking care of "mode" and me.

459
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,570
I thought a romantic meal might force you

460
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,770
To take time out to enjoy yourself.

461
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,490
Plus, I need your opinion on my dress

462
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,060
For the mama awards.

463
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,810
What do you think?

464
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,530
I think lunch... is gonna have to wait.

465
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,850
But it'll get cold.

466
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,190
I don't care. it's not negotiable.

467
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,040
You're here?

468
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,190
No, you're here.

469
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,420
I call the apartment!

470
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,800
No, no. you can't call the apartment.

471
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,890
We're both entitled to the same information.

472
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,200
Great. making up rules as we go along.

473
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,140
Well, we're both here. we need the research.

474
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,270
What have you found?

475
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,600
Nothing. just boxes and boxes of menthol cigarettes,

476
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,270
Vintage porn,

477
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,770
More menthol cigarettes.

478
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,660
We are never gonna find anything in here.

479
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Nothing except for more of these female jock straps.

480
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,620
- Bras, Marc.  - Whatever.

481
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,370
I allowed myself to get beat up all through high school

482
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,150
So I wouldn't have to handle things like this.

483
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,280
God, she really did like beef jerky, didn't she?

484
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,810
Oh! that's the other smell on her breath.

485
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,810
What are you two dinks doing here?

486
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,120
Mindy, hi.

487
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,860
How are you?

488
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,385
I just had a pap smear,

489
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:11,880
I stepped in poo on the subway,

490
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,520
And my sister's dead. how do you think I am?

491
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,570
In need of a hug.

492
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,230
Betty, hug her.

493
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa. back off.

494
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,040
Got a real lezzie vibe off you the minute I met ya.

495
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,520
What? it wasn't enough to ruin my sister's memorial?

496
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,890
You have to come in here and wreck her apartment, too?

497
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,080
Mindy, we're just looking for anything

498
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,880
On your sister's Yves Saint Laurent piece.

499
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,380
And we want to put it together and publish it in "mode."

500
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,920
For Penny.

501
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,970
Our penny.

502
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,230
Is this what you're looking for?

503
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,050
maybe.

504
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,750
Amanda said yellow.

505
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,360
- No, no, no. what are you doing?  - no!

506
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,490
Penny hated "mode."

507
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,350
Now get out!

508
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,180
To Penny...

509
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,610
Hater of pigeons, lover of vintage porn.

510
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,540
Today really has been the worst day.

511
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,580
Ugh. Matt hates me, this assignment is a dead end,

512
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,110
And I am so mad at daniel.

513
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,110
I know. he is such an idiot.

514
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,060
What the hell is wrong with Wilhelmina?

515
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,110
I know. daniel is such an idiot.

516
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,800
it's not like you haven't already given her

517
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,460
Your blood, sweat and tears.

518
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,040
I have practically cut arteries open for that woman.

519
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,510
You know who I think the real idiots are?  The two of you.

520
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,920
You're a mean drunk.

521
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,260
Seriously. you are such whiners.

522
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,810
Not to mention, you are totally letting me down.

523
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,730
If one of you freak shows doesn't pull ahead,

524
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,210
Then who am I supposed to glom on to?

525
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,860
And yes, I bring the pretty and the sparkly...

526
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,240
But shockingly, sometimes that's not enough.

527
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,940
And, you know, Marc, with your brains,

528
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,590
And, betty, with your aztec build,

529
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,080
There is nothing the two of you can't do.

530
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,940
So what are we supposed to do?

531
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,420
I don't know. I'm so drunk...

532
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,770
My jockstrap is starting to dig in.

533
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,690
I'll be right back.

534
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,810
She's right.

535
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,610
About what? I didn't follow any of that.

536
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,090
Marc, we can do anything.

537
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,170
We just have to join forces.

538
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,500
What are you thinking?

539
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,170
What is this?

540
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
Our letters of resignation.

541
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,420
Resigning?

542
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,620
What about the article?

543
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,540
- It flew out the window.  - like penny herself.

544
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,930
Look, we are both worthy of this position.

545
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,530
So we're doing what any good editor should do

546
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,870
Presenting you with strong options.

547
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,080
- It's either marc  - or betty.

548
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,970
Unless you want both of our resignations,

549
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,550
You have to decide who gets promoted to editor

550
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,520
Of a fashion magazine.

551
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,980
A features editor.

552
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,400
Of a fashion magazine.

553
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,290
- Enough.  - Give us some time to discuss.

554
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,230
You are dismissed.

555
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,430
That was terrifying. did I seem terrified?

556
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,600
I was terrified.

557
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,650
I'm still shaking. it was good, though.

558
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,010
I feel strangely empowered.

559
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,930
Where are you going?

560
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,110
To see Matt. wish me luck.

561
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,160
Hi.

562
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,550
- Can we talk? - I don't know if I'm ready.

563
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,220
Matt, please just listen to me.

564
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,000
I made a mistake,

565
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,480
And I should've just told you what happened, but I didn't,

566
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,250
And I'm sorry, and if I could go back and change it,

567
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,150
I would, but I can't.

568
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,020
All I can tell you is that I love you

569
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,770
And I want to be with you.

570
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,470
I don't think we should just throw this all away.

571
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,170
I have to get to class.

572
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,300
Here's a ticket to the mama awards.

573
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,080
I hope you'll come.

574
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,840
Oh, no. I forgot. have you seen my note cards?

575
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,820
Don't tell me

576
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,040
You're one of those guys who goes up there all modest,

577
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,280
Then has a prepared speech,

578
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,800
- like you knew you were gonna win.  - look, you were right.

579
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,960
It's a big deal.

580
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,330
I mean, think about it. what if we win?

581
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,880
I don't want to look like a deer in the headlights.

582
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,740
I'm glad it's important to you.

583
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,940
You're warm.

584
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,070
Your fever's back. Molly

585
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,280
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

586
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,490
No, we're both staying home.

587
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I'm gonna go cancel the limo right now.

588
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,060
honey, this is your night.

589
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,290
And I will not be the reason you miss it.

590
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,210
-But it's more - I'll make you a deal.

591
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,680
Your award's later in the presentation, right?

592
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,000
- Yeah. - So you go, I'll take a nap,

593
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,840
And then I'll meet you there in time for your category.

594
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,180
Save me a seat.

595
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,620
Okay.

596
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,350
But I'm having the nurse come by to check on you.

597
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,240
Suzuki st. pierre reporting

598
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,160
From the mother of all publishing award shows...

599
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,600
The mamas.

600
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,770
Tensions are high and faces are pulled

601
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,430
As we wonder who will go home with a mama

602
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,570
And who will go home to feel self-worth

603
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,540
With booze, pills, internet sex and trans fats.

604
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,800
Or as I call it, thursdays.

605
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,510
Looking forward to your big announcement.

606
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,770
Oh, look.

607
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,760
Somebody's been picking through liz hurley's old rags

608
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,340
Oh, my god.

609
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,410
He just said I look exactly like liz hurley.

610
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,050
Yeah, go with that.

611
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,820
And there's evelia avila.

612
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,540
I'm sorry. oh, my god!

613
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,530
Antonio sabato jr.

614
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,780
Aunt betty, didn't you have

615
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,100
A dream with him the other night?

616
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,250
-J...uh, justin. -what was that dream?

617
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,180
it was nothing.

618
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,370
Aunt betty, tell him about the hot dog.

619
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,110
god, it's good to meet you.

620
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,990
Stop. that was fun.

621
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,680
Did it cheer you up?

622
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,200
Yeah. I mean, I'll never have a career like his

623
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,730
Because I didn't get into the performing arts school,

624
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,850
-But I could always be a plumber. -justin.

625
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,060
Aunt betty, I'm fine.

626
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,990
- I'm just happy you brought me here. - betty!

627
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,240
Hey, you, betty's son, come with me to the swag room.

628
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,530
- I want to get two bags. - okay.

629
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,670
I didn't know you were coming tonight, matt.

630
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,890
I wasn't. I came to see betty.

631
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,580
Everything all right, son?

632
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,750
I don't know how I didn't get in.

633
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,190
I mean, how do you beat a monologue from "equus"

634
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,090
And 16 bars from "les mis"?

635
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,410
You're great, kid. they made a mistake.

636
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,410
Well, like everyone says, there's always next year.

637
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,880
- But the problem is this year, right? - yeah.

638
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,840
You're about to start public high school in queens

639
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,960
And you're afraid that it's going to suck, right?

640
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,300
Pretty much.

641
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,560
It might.

642
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,020
It's just...

643
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,730
I don't always fit in with new people.

644
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,620
And I thought that laguardia would have more people...

645
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,030
You know, that...

646
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,790
Like the same things that I like.

647
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,400
Right.

648
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,580
Well... this may shock you,

649
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,680
But yours truly

650
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,030
Is a product of a public high school,

651
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,090
And I think I'm pretty great.

652
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,770
The trick, I think, is to find your niche.

653
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,150
And if you can't find one...

654
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,740
Make one.

655
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,210
Maybe I have been too hard on her, dad.

656
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,610
I mean, she was kissing him good-bye.

657
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,250
I should be able to let that go, right?

658
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,670
What?

659
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,300
Did I ever tell you about my first motorcycle?

660
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,520
- Okay. - and I've had a lot of cycles since then,

661
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,140
But I never loved any of 'em like I loved that old girl.

662
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,930
I get it.

663
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,890
I'm fancier, but henry runs like stink.

664
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,010
All I'm saying is,

665
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,770
You will always be competing with that first motorcycle,

666
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,140
Especially if it's shoving its tongue

667
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,230
Down your girlfriend's throat.

668
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,850
I don't know what to do.

669
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,010
I know. I've been there.

670
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,480
But... I let myself

671
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,170
Just get good and mad

672
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,550
And then I channeled that into work.

673
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,400
It made me what I am today.

674
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,910
I don't really have a job anymore.

675
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,150
You could.

676
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,640
Dvds?

677
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,350
where are the hermes? where are the chanel watches?

678
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,550
Dvds, seriously? they're not even on blu-ray?

679
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,620
This should be a nice treat for you then.

680
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,380
Daniel's acceptance speech.

681
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,680
So he'll be tongue-tied, and you'll take over.

682
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,560
See? I'm still your assistant for the moment. I do my job.

683
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,890
Nice.

684
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,250
Wilhelmina, we need to talk.

685
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,090
Hey, "air buddies."

686
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,910
- What is it, daniel? - well, we've been avoiding this all day.

687
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,710
- We need to make a choice-- marc or betty? - okay. marc.

688
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,930
- Wilhelmina, come on. - you're right.

689
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,110
We are dealing with the fate of two people's lives.

690
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,650
There's only one fair way to do it.

691
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,590
You want to flip a coin?

692
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,490
Look, they're both equally qualified,

693
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,010
And neither of us are willing to budge.

694
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,390
You have a better idea?

695
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,900
Heads, it's marc. tails, betty.

696
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,900
- I guess that's it.  - Yes, that's it

697
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,450
And the nominees for photographer of the year are...

698
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,880
Patrick demarchelier for "american vogue,"

699
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,030
oh, it's happening.

700
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,960
I hope it's not annie leibovitz.

701
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,440
I mean, I love her, but I'm bored.

702
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,020
Betty, can I talk to you?

703
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah. I'll be right back.

704
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,640
And the mama goes to...

705
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,720
Annie leibovitz for "vanity fair."

706
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,610
So about the job...

707
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,120
Daniel, it's...It's fine.

708
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,430
I know it was a hard decision and--

709
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,150
It's yours.

710
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,340
You're our newest features editor.

711
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,130
What?! aah!

712
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,050
Oh, my god! that's amazing!

713
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,140
Thank you! thank you! thank you! aah!

714
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,690
You scared the hell out of me.

715
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,070
-I couldn't really help myself. -my god. this is wonderful.

716
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,360
I'm just glad you're not going too far.

717
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,430

Oh, uh, sorry.

727
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,160
Maybe I should, uh...

728
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,720
This award means so much...

729
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,650
So much to me personally.

730
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,730
I mean, it's not just the end product

731
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,570
Of a-a... a lot of hard work.

732
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,040
It's, um... it's a symbol...

733
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,570
A symbol of love.

734
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,900
You know, sometimes...

735
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,370
We're fated to meet certain people

736
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,190
Who, uh, can change our lives,

737
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,360
People who really make a difference.

738
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,390
They make you a better person,

739
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,250
They push you to grow.

740
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,130
I'd just really like to share this award with everyone

741
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,610
Who did this with me.

742
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,640
Thank you.

743
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,000


745
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,670
Thanks, betty. hey, where did molly go?

746
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,380
I haven't seen her.

747
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,900
She was right next to you.

748
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,460
No, I don't think so.

749
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,000
Betty, she was standing right next to you.

750
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,750
Daniel, I didn't see her. are you okay?

751
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,060
Yeah. um... I'm gonna go.

752
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,800
Great speech, wilhelmina.

753
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,980
Speaking of speeches,

754
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,370
When are you announcing you're stepping down?

755
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,300
I'm not going to step down.

756
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,450
then I think it's time hartley knew about your choice

757
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,470
Not to have his baby.

758
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,800
I already know, and it's none of your business.

759
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,160
Cal and I have been talking,

760
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,340
And we decided

761
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,350
We need to reevaluate your role in the company.

762
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,640
I still don't believe it.

763
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,430
Okay, we got the champagne and the cake ready.

764
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,940
We're very proud of you, mi amor.

765
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,280
Why aren't you home yet? yeah.

766
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,550
There's just something I wanted to do first--

767
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,360
Stop by my new office.

768
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,510
You're getting everything you wanted.

769
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,750
I am. I'll see you at home.

770
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,380
Matt... I'm so glad you're here.

771
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,740
I mean, can you believe...

772
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,140
betty, wait. I have to ask you something.

773
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,800
Okay.

774
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,230
Do you still love him?

775
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,200
So you do.

776
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,540
Matt... look, henry was my first love.

777
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,620
I guess there's always gonna be

778
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,930
A part of me that does,

779
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,670
But... but that's a part of my past.

780
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,090
I mean...

781
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,320
Don't you feel that way about your first love?

782
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,930
The thing is, betty...

783
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,530
You're my first love.

784
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,830
You told me all I needed to hear.

785
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,660
What are you saying?

786
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm saying... we're over.

787
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,250
What--what, that's it? you're just gonna walk away?

788
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,320
I'm never gonna see you again?

789
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,190
No, you'll see me... every day.

790
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,730
My dad offered me a job at "mode,"

791
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,260
And I'm gonna take it.

792
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,660
I'm your new boss.

793
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,440
I have never felt more alone.

794
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,110
It appears that my position at my own company

795
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,260
Is being undermined.

796
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,080
My company is all I have.

797
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,410
How can I help?

798
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,860
Well, the only way I can fix it

799
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,590
Is to get enough money to push out cal hartley.

800
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,480
And the only person I know with that kind of money...

801
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,550
Is the man who stole it

802
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,230
Connor owens.

803
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,490
You want him alive?

804
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,420
As long as I get the money, I really don't care.

805
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,400
What are you doing here?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
