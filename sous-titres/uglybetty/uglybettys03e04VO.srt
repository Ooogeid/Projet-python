1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,980
*****

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,290
you're dating a married man?

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,800
I didn't know that he was
married when we started dating.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,240
This is just gonna end bad.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,930
Well, who says it's gonna end?

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,220
I know how much you care about me, and
I care about you, too, but not in ty.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,780
you're a natural father.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,530
His grandparents want
him back in france.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,500
I know he misses them.

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,750
He can miss them and still
want to be here with his father.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,490
Daniel isn't daniel jr.'S father. I am.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,300
I will not rest until the person who threatened
the life of my unborn child is brought to justice.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm afraid you're under arrest.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,260
I didn't push christina.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,390
I know you did it.

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,470
Today the center ring of the meade
family circus belongs to alexis meade,

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,500
who's been charged with helping wilhelmina
slater's surrogate down a pesky flight of stairs.

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,940
hold everything. It looks
like daniel meade has arrived.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,640
oh, mr. Meade!

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,690
Make a hole, bitches.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,320
Oh, my god. This ordeal has taken
a terrible toll on daniel meade.

22
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,370
He looks like some kind
of twisted hunchback.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,730
<font color=#00FFFF>Ugly
Betty Season03 Episode04</font>

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,150
all right, you guys.
Let's go around the back.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,590
I'm in.********

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,890
Of course.

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,040
I think it's great that
you're supporting your sister,

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,230
even if she did, you know, push my
best friend down a flight of stairs.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,680
Yeah, well, I'm still pissed at
alexis for letting me take the blame,

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,360
but mom wanted me to
talk to her, so here I am.

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,510
Well, try and play nice.

32
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,530
Oh, and, um, could I
take the town car to work?

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,320
No.

34
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,420
you look like crap.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,590
They said my eyebrow pencil
could be used as a shank.

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,430
I can see that.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,230
So I spoke to your lawyer.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,740
He thinks with the plea deal, you
could probably get off with a fine

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,330
and a few hundred hours
of community service.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,100
That's it.

41
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,740
I don't know why mom insisted I
come down here just to tell you that.

42
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,970
It wasn't just to tell me that,
daniel. I need to talk to you.

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,530
13 years ago, when we met
daniel jr.'S mother in paris,

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,390
I was obviously still a man, and,
uh, the thing is, I slept with her.

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,460
- It was just once.
- Why are you telling me this now?

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,390
Because I saw the results
of the paternity test,

47
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,980
and you're not daniel jr.'S father.

48
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,820
I am.

49
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,570
Look, I'm--I'm gonna give
up my parental rights.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,010
We can keep this out of the press.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,890
As far as anyone will
know, D.J.Is your son.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm so sorry, daniel.

53
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,040
Is there anything you want to sae?

54
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,450
I think it shows real maturity
that daniel's helping alexis.

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,570
he's totally growing a person.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,220
Okay, uh, betty, what time are
you getting home from work tonight?

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,070
Oh, I don't know. Um, like,
7:00. Why? You want to hang out?

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,730
Actually, coach and I were wondering if
we could hang out at your place again.

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,150
Hilda, no.

60
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,340
I said you could use my apartment that
one time so that you guys could talk.

61
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,850
I know, but-- excuse
me one second--

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,860
I know, but papi walked in on us.
We didn't get a chance to talk.

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,520
Come on, betty. Please. I really
need to find out where this is going.

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,960
Fine, but I swear, after this,
I'm changing my locks, and...

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,060
oh, my god! Gio's back.

66
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,330
- What?
- Gio's back from rome.

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,560
Oh, I can't wait to
hear all about his trip.

68
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,140
Oh, well, isn't that gonna be weird?

69
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,730
No. Why would it be weird?

70
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,040
I don't know. Maybe because he offered to
whisk you away on this romantic trip to rome,

71
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,790
and you threw it in his face.

72
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,940
I did not throw anything
back in his face.

73
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,990
I care about, you, gio, but
I can't go to rome with you.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,630
Right now I need to be on my own.

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,840
I completely understand.
Have a wonderful trip.

76
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,450
Nope. He was ine. All right,
I'll talk to you later.

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,850
Whatever.

78
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,720
buon giorno! How was your trip?
Was it amazing? Tell me everything.

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,550
I'm not telling you nothing.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,270
You and I--
we don't talk.

81
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,100
"Banned!"? Gio, what is this?

82
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,210
I thought we were fine.

83
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,950
Fine?

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,470
After the way we left things?

85
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,090
The truth is, I would rather be
all alon than go to rome with you.

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,220
I don't understand.

87
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,360
Well, then let me make myself clear.

88
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,460
um, it didn't happen like
that, and I did not spit.

89
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,730
Yeah?Well, maybe you don't notice,

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,320
but sometimes when you talk really fast,

91
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,500
you end up spitting a little bit.

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,120
Gio. Gio! Stop.

93
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,050
Okay.

94
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,740
You want to hear about my trip?

95
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,340
Two weeks in one of the most romantic
places on earth, and I was alone.

96
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,840
And since your boss made
all the arrangements,

97
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,040
all of the reservations
were under your name.

98
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,510
So everywhere I went, it
was, "welcome, signor suarez.

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
"Can I get you anything, signor suarez?

100
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,530
Where's your wife, signor suarez?"

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,630
There must have been something
good, right? It was rome.

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,430
And you went to find your
flavor, likmario batali.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,100
Did you find your flavor?

104
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,350
Oh, I found it, all right.

105
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,040
See, there was this cheese, a
scamorza, made by a farmer named donato,

106
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,100
and all of the milk from the
cheese came from one cow--louisa.

107
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,670
Feed her by hand, pamper
her, massage her...

108
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,650
oh, I know. I know.

109
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,200
But the cheese...

110
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,370
who knew heaven could come from a cow?

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,240
Not me.

112
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,160
The sandwiches I was gonna make...

113
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,980
that cheese was gonna change my life.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,690
Life changing--
that's good, right?

115
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,100
Then I landed at J.F.K.

116
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,990
And the customs guys confiscated it.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,710
Something about food import rules.

118
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,530
Oh, god, gio.
That's-- I'm so sorry.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,270
Oh, it's fine.

120
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,880
See, as I sat there, watching them
eat my once-in-a-lifetime discovery,

121
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,320
I had an epiphany, a
moment of total clarity.

122
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,140
- I hate you.
- What?

123
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,700
You're not a nice person.

124
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,750
Not only are you banned from gio's
deli, you're banned from my life.

125
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,010
Gio.

126
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,010
You can't ban me from your life.

127
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,530
I am a very nice person.

128
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,030
And you know what? You can't
hate me, because we're friends.

129
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh, my god.

130
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,140
He hates me.

133
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,040
I n't stand that gio feels that way.

134
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,910
I should do something,
something to make it up to him.

135
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,510
Wait. Have you had your hand
in there this whole time?

136
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,470
Yeah, I just didn't want
to interrupt your rant.

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,550
Did you get into a fight? We talked
about that. You suck at fighting.

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,470
It wasn't a fight exactly.

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,290
Then what happened?

140
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,770
Look, you don't have to know everything
that goes on in my life, betty.

141
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,030
Some things are private.

142
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,910
Oh, okay, "private."

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,590
'Cause the other day you had me
check a mole on your "lower back,"

144
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,650
but today there are
boundaries, and yay for that.

145
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,320
I gotta go. I'M...
taking D.J.To lunch today.

146
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,400
And then I have my sister's arraignment.

147
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,500
You know, you should probably
just give gio a little time.

148
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,670
I'm sure he'll forget about it.

149
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,080
You don't know gio.

150
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,580
He gets something in his mind, he doesn't let
it go, like this cheese that he found in italy--

151
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,450


152
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,910
- donato scamorza?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,650
Oh, it's amazing. My friend mario
uses it in all his restaurants.

154
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,600
Mario? Batali?

155
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,350
Oh, my god. He's gio's hero.

156
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,740
Maybe he could get me some of that cheese, and
then I could give that to gio as a peace offering.

157
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,800
You think you could call him for me?

158
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,790
- Uh, D.J.And
I-- - call him.

159
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,620
Okay.

160
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,220
How's my baby?

161
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm fine, willie. You know how
I get when you call me that.

162
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,150
Oh, that baby.

163
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,370
Gestating nicely I'm told, though christina
is getting a little too comfortable at the spa.

164
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,050
She's requested a few extra days
for her and her terminal scotsman.

165
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,150
Make sure she's aware her contract with me
specifically limits extracurricular womb activities.

166
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,280
okay, I will try... to tell her that.

167
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,950
So I suppose you've heard.

168
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,680
Alexis got community service.

169
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,740
if I had known this is how the system
worked, I'd have tried to kill more often.

170
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,120
She tries to off your offspring, and
she gets off with a slap on the wrist.

171
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,680
It's an offing outrage.

172
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,860
Or it could be the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

173
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,870
Exactly what I was thinking.

174
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,030
Though the fact that she'll be out before
cocktail hour does get my dander up.

175
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, my dander is sky high.

176
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,760
Still, I'm not gonna look
a gift horse in the mouth.

177
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,710
No, you'd be a fool to.

178
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,010
I'm completely lost.
Just tell me what to feel.

179
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,610
Why don't you get your lips off my
ass and get the D.A.On the phone?

180
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,240
so what's going on? The arraignment was
supposed to start a half an hour ago.

181
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,610
Well, I'm afraid there's
been a little hiccup.

182
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,190
Uh, apparently, due to the
horrific nature of your crimes,

183
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,960
uh, blah, blah, blah,the D.A. Is bumping
the charge from misdemeanor assault to...

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,890
attempted murder.

185
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,330
Oh, my god.

186
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,060
They're also insisting
that alexis be denied bail.

187
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,090
now what are we going to
do? I thought we had a deal.

188
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,270
I know. I'm--I'm trying to see if we
can salvage some kind of plea agreement.

189
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,720
Um, barring that, we go to trial.

190
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,720
No, I am not putting my daughter's
future into the hands of 12 people

191
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,920
who are too lazy or stupid
to get out of jury duty.

192
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,760
Maybe I should just go to jail.

193
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,030
Maybe I'm getting what i deserve.

194
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,580
I did a terrible thing.

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Well, that doesn't make
you a terrible person.

196
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,740
Now don't you worry, dear.

197
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,060
I contributed handsomely to the
district attorney's election campaign.

198
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,530
Mommy will make this all better.

199
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,220
Richard, darling, it's claire meade.

200
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,180
Claire, you know this is inappropriate.

201
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,710
I can't talk to you while
I'm prosecuting your daughter.

202
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,890
Why don't you reduce the charges and let alexis
get to picking up trash along the west side highway,

203
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,410
like you promised?

204
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,710
She admitted to pushing a pregnant
woman down a flight of stairs.

205
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,870
And your point is?

206
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,780
The point is, I'm
under a lot of pressure.

207
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,110
I can't make it seem that there's a
different standard of justice for rich people.

208
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,570
Funny, I don't recall justice being
quite so blind when you were accepting

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,910
that obscenely large check
I wrote for your campaign.

210
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,540
Claire, I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

211
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,590
now, counselor, if we have
any further interruptions,

212
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,110
I'm gonna have to
hold you...in contempt.

213
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,950
Yes, your honor.

214
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,600
You know, we, um, we could
have done this in the park,

215
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,830
like, an actual picnic
outside on the grass.

216
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,180
With all the ants and the dog crap?

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,110
What is it?

218
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,120
I just-- I've
been thinking...

219
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,620
About--about
this.

220
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,020
Indoor picnics? Dog crap?

221
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,130
No, wise guy, about us, about sneaking
around and using my sister's apartment.

222
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,980
And what if justin finds
out that you're married?

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,180
- I'm leaving her.
- I mean, where is this going? Let me finish.

224
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,870
Wait. What did you say?

225
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,150
Tony, don't mess with
me. I swear to god...

226
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,050
it's no joke. I am
telling her this afternoon.

227
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,920
No more sneaking around, no more
"dates" in the back of the car.

228
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,410
My dad'll be happy to know
I'm not gonna burn in hell.

229
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,400
No eternal damnation,
always a good thing.

230
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,840
Hey, betty.

231
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,080
A pair of sweaty, smelly
balls arrived for you.

232
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,870
Yay!

233
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,710
Is this your lunch?

234
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,450
No, it's for gio, and
no, you can't have any.

235
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,560
That's too bad.

236
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,280
One slice of that fatness...

237
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,960
or ten of these.

238
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,210
- I totally win.
- Oh, excuse me.

239
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,070
Can you direct me to daniel
meade's office, please?

240
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,040
Oh, yes, counselor adams. Follow me.

241
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,270
Uh, oh, my god. Is that donato scamorza?

242
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,370
We need to discuss the
custody hearing for daniel jr.

243
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,120
Why? You're not handling that.

244
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,260
I asked getman at the
firm to let me step in.

245
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,980
I feel bad about your sister.

246
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,670
I just want to knock one of
'em out of the park for you.

247
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,730
There we go.

248
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:53,550
Anyway, now you remember that the,
uh, grandparents of the boy in france

249
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,970
filed a petition for custody?

250
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,730
Getman told me not to worry about it.

251
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,880
Well, that was when we were all under the
impression that you were actually the father.

252
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,530
Feel free ry wor about it now.

253
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,520
Wait. They know? How the
hell did they find out?

254
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,500
I thought we were gonna
keep this within the family.

255
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,820
Well, they subpoenaed our evidence,
which included your paternity test.

256
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,150
We'll fight 'em, right?
I'm--I'm still D.J.'S uncle.

257
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,790
I still care for the kid. I know
I'd make a good dad. Bring 'em on.

258
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,170
That's the spirit, but the thing is that the
judge already awarded them temporary custody.

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,870
What?

260
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,420
Well, when alexis relinquished her parental
rights, those damn frenchies swooped right in.

261
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,920
In one hour, they're gonna
be at J.F.K.To pick him up.

262
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,980
Can't we do something?

263
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,390
Oh, sure, sure, sure.I filed a motion
to have the custody order suspended,

264
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,720
but if they get daniel
jr.Back on french soil,

265
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,310
it doesn't make a difference
how strong our case is,

266
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,390
you can kiss that kid good-bye.

267
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
- Betty.
- Oh, daniel.

268
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,250
I know it's been crazy today, but I was
wondering, could i leave work a little early?

269
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,730
Perfect. I was just about to ask you
to take care of one little thing for me.

270
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,220
- Oh, of course. I just have to get home.
- Not a problem.

271
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,240
You see, gio doesn't know that
I have an apartment in the city.

272
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,500
So I placed this huge sandwich order from his
deli so that he could deliver it to my apartment.

273
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,650
That's brilliant.

274
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,660
When he shows up, I'm
gonna give him the scamorza.

275
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,810
It can't miss.

276
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,010
You're not listening to me.

277
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,860
No, I'm not. Listen, I really need you to pick
up D.J. After school and take him somewhere.

278
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,070
Where?

279
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
Uh, I don't know. I
don't care. Anywhere.

280
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,630
Actually, it's probably better
if you don't tell me where.

281
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,490
Okay, look, daniel, I am not taking him
anywhere until you tell me what this is about.

282
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,830
Look, D.J.'S grandparents are on their way
here right now to take him back to france.

283
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,540
But how can they even
do that? You'reis father.

284
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,570
Look, I don't know.

285
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,550
I can't go into the complex
international legal issues right now.

286
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,610
They're french. They
do things differently.

287
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,940
All right. Well, this
still sounds a little fishy.

288
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,410
betty, please.

289
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,450
If you don't do this,
I'm gonna lose him.

290
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,170
gio's deli.

291
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,620
"B.Suarez"? Aw, crap.

292
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,130
Right on time. Great service, as always.

293
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,680
- What is this?
- Come in.

294
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,060
What part of "banned" don't
you understand, suarez?

295
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,440
Banned from the deli.

296
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,810
I thought I still had some
wiggle room on delivery.

297
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,630
Bonjour.

298
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,040
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a business to run.

299
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,530
No. No, no, no, no, no. Gio, please.

300
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,220
I can't let it end this way.

301
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,040
Just listen for a second.

302
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,930
You know, there is nothing that
you can say that could make me...

303
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,010
what's that smell?

304
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,250
Heaven from a cow.

305
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,800
donato scamorza.

306
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,050
Where'd you get this?

307
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,540
Well, I have my ways, and i
wanted to do something nice,

308
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,890
you know, to make up for what happened.

309
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,560
Fine.

310
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,420
Where you going?

311
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,140
Leaving.

312
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,610
But I gave you cheese.

313
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,090
Thank you. Good-bye.

314
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,450
- You're still angry?
- Yep.

315
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,930
What are you doing?

316
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,600
Give--don't--don't squeeze.
Don't squeeze. Give me the...

317
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,400
stop being such an indian giver.

318
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,730
Okay, first of all, that is an outdated
and culturally insensitive term,

319
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,920
and second of all, you
are not getting this cheese

320
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,560
until we've sat down and spoken
properly and gotten pasthis.

321
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,630
Monsieur meade, we want to thank you so
much for taking such good care of daniel.

322
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,380
He says wonderful things about you.

323
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,160
He does? I mean, uh,
you've spoken with him?

324
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,760
Well, yes, he has written us many
letters since he's here in new york.

325
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,600
I didn't realize.

326
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,280
No need for letter now.

327
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,020
His family is here.

328
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,550
I am his family.

329
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,800
Monsieur meade, I mean,
we want to take him--

330
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,830
I'm sorry.It's
just--

331
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,690
since we lost our
daughter, he is all we have.

332
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,180
Where is our grandson?

333
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,320
We need to take him home.

334
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,240
He's with my assistant.
Look, I tried to call.

335
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,010
She's just not answering her phone.

336
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,740
If you're looking for betty,
she's at her apartment.

337
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,410
You're welcome.

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,200
this is me rock climbing in yosemite.

339
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,730
Can you imagine, me, betty suarez,
hanging off a cliff 50 feet in the air?

340
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,710
- Le grand canyon.
- Yeah, that's right.

341
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
And we hiked all the way to the bottom.

342
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,090
Did you know that only 1% of visitors
to the grand canyon actually do that?

343
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,450
Right. Well, the important thing is
that I learned that I can do anything,

344
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,230
and--and even the things that terrified
me, and that's all thanks to you, gio.

345
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,650
You were always pushing
me to take risks.

346
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,240
You changed my life.

347
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,930
So...

348
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,240
breaking up with me
made your life better?

349
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,250
What? No. No. You are
taking this all wrong.

350
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,900
No, no. I don't think so.

351
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,360
You know, this isn't about
you making me feel better.

352
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,180
This is about you feeling
better about yourself.

353
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,710
If you were listening to
what I'm trying to tell you--

354
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,440
but I have been listening.

355
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,930
I've been listening to you talk for about a
half an hour about what great friends we are,

356
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,990
about how I changed your life by
sending you on this mountain climbing,

357
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,490
river rafting, clam
chowder-eating vision quest.

358
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,560
But for once, this isn't about you, and
if you didn't live in betty suarez land...

359
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,850
okay, I do not live
in betty suarez land.

360
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,330
Oh, yes, you do.

361
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,460
25 teddy bear lane,
betty suarez land, U.S.A.

362
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,660
And if you were to step
out of it for one minute,

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,750
you'd realize that it takes two to make
a relationship, and I'm not interested.

364
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,660
- Well, why not?
- Because you broke my heart!

365
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,310
I'm sorry. I-I
ha--I have to. Yes?

366
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,740
betty, D.J.'S grandparents
found out where you are.

367
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,990
What? D.J.

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,030
Look, they're coming to get him.
You have to get out of there.

369
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,470
Daniel, what is going on?

370
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,680
All? C'est qui?

371
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,650
is betty suarez there? Hello?

372
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,250
I need to speak to
betty suarez right now.

373
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,300
They're here. Today's the day...

374
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,160
- betty, what's happening?
- I know you're up there.

375
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,290
I'm not gonna let you take him away.

376
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,810
Daniel, it's them. They're here.

377
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,910
betty, get out of there. Just leave.

378
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,330
He's up there now, isn't he? Let me in.

379
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,970
Okay.

380
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,770
no! No, no, no.

381
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,900
Hey, what the hell's going on?

382
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,450
daniel's about to lose
custody of his son.

383
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,040
His grandparents are coming
from france to take him back.

384
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,190
Well, how could they do
that if daniel's the father?

385
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I don't know. It's a french thing.
Look, where's your van? Downstairs?

386
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,430
You're not expecting me
to drive you anywhere.

387
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,240
Gio, I know you hate me, but please
don't take it out on daniel or his son.

388
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,490
Hey, D.J., Ever been on a
real live new york fire escape?

389
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,770
L'Èchapper flamb? Come on.

390
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,500
prison reality is not living
up to my fantasy at all.

391
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,590
Where is all the scary, beefy trade?

392
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,480
- Oh, marc, we're in a women's prison.
- I know.

393
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,680
I'm surprised you wanted to see
me,wilhelmina,after what I've done.

394
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,530
What would the world be
without the power forgive?

395
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,580
And in the interest of forgiveness,

396
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,160
I may have a way to help put
this nightmare behind you.

397
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,340
What do you mean?

398
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,670
Let's just say the district attorney
and i share certain enthusiasms.

399
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,570
I could talk to him about reducing
these outrageous charges against you.

400
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,260
You did this.

401
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,950
You got him to charge
me with attempted murder.

402
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,190
Oh,don't act so shocked. Alexis.

403
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,720
This is what we do. This is our thing.

404
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,640
You screw me over. I screw you back.

405
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,020
A whole lot of screwing goin' around.

406
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,750
The point is,I can make
this whole thing go away.

407
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,820
And what's it going to cost me?

408
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,910
Your shares in meade publishing.

409
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,610
What?

410
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,690
I'm not going to give you
control of my family's company.

411
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,230
How can you even ask me that?

412
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm just sayin',you're the
one with the guilty conscience.

413
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,530
I'm terrified of going to prison,more
scared than I've ever been in my entire life,

414
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,540
but I will do a hundred years
before i screw my brother over again.

415
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:18,700
So thank you for the offer,but
this time,you can screw yourself.

416
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,620
are you being followed?

417
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,140
I don't know.

418
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,360
Are we being followed?

419
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,700
nope.

420
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,400
No.

421
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
So where are you heading?

422
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,280
I don't know.

423
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,490
Where should we take him?

424
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,420
Does he like the ballet?

425
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,950
Because they're
doing "swan lake" at--

426
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,390
you're not taking him to the ballet. 
(We're not gonna take him to the ballet.)

427
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,980
Well,what's wrong with the ballet?

428
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,340
Kids love the ballet.

429
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,860
Justin loves the ballet.

430
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,440
Look,let me talk to gio.

431
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,290
No.

432
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,570
Why do you need to talk to gio?

433
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,170
Give me the phone.

434
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,230
Um,I'm handling it.

435
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,060
What about coney island?

436
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,110
We'll grab some dogs,ride the cyclone?

437
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,180
Perfect. Gio,I'll meet you there.

438
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,360
Thank you for driving.

439
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,480
you always do this to me.

440
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,430
Right when I think I'm
out,you pull me right back in.

441
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,050
Well,you know what,gio?

442
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,920
When this is all done,you can get
back into your meaty cheese van

443
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,870
and drive as far away from
betty suarez town as you want.

444
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,970
Suarez land.

445
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,960
hello!

446
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,090
Come on back.

447
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,900
Through the beads.

448
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,630
Welcome to hilda's beautilities.

449
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,760
What can I do for you,perm,pedicure?

450
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,230
I'm here about my husband.

451
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,090
Oh,yeah,yeah.

452
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,080
We do men's hair,too.

453
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,530
I followed him hery One da .

454
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,090
his name is tony diaz.

455
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,710
Tony?

456
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,620
You don't have to pretend.

457
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,870
I know what's going on.

458
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,460
Oh,listen.
I know--

459
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,960
please,just talk to your sister.

460
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,610
Tell her to stop seeing him.

461
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,560
My sister?

462
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,990
He's been meeting her in
the city,in her apartment.

463
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,990
I was just there,thinking
I was gonna catch him again.

464
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,000
But she was there with
some fren.Guy she must...

465
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,290
be some insatiable slut.

466
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,530
Hey.

467
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,210
This is my sister we're
talking about here.

468
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,670
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,430
I don't even blame her.

470
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,720
It's our own fault,tony and me.

471
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,220
We married young.

472
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,760
We've been together for a long time.

473
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,360
At some point,things just got cold.

474
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,120
We stopped talking,spending
time together.

475
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,570
Everything.

476
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
But I never stopped loving him,ever,

477
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,270
even today, when he told me he
was in love with someone else.

478
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,820
Is that crazy?

479
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,370
No.

480
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,820
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

481
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,800
Please,just talk to your sister.

482
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,440
Tell her I want a chance,that's all.

483
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,040
I want to make things
better between him and me.

484
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,470
I want a chance to save my marriage.

485
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,260
you won!

486
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,070
Pay up.

487
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,000
Fine,but I'm gonna kick your
derriere in the ring toss.

488
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,740
well,you're good with him.

489
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,870
Yeah,well,he's a good kid.

490
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,750
Where's D.J.?

491
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,780
He went to grab something
to eat. You okay?

492
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Look,I don't have much time.

493
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,900
I got a car waiting to take
D.J. And me to the airport.

494
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,660
The meade family jet
is gonna fly us to...

495
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,250
I haven't figured that part out yet.

496
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,990
Do you guys know,

497
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,330
uh,is there a country that doesn't have
an extradition treaty with the U.S.?

498
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,070
Iceland's a real country,right?

499
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,000
Daniel,what are you talking about?

500
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,680
The judge refused to grant
a stay for the custody order.

501
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,920
D.J.'S grandparents are
taking him back to france.

502
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,890
What?

503
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
But that's--
that's crazy. Why?

504
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,570
It doesn't matter.

505
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,390
it doesn't matter,daniel?
You're his father.

506
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,850
They can't just take your son.

507
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,690
He's not my son,okay?

508
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,670
D.J.Is not my son.

509
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,590
guys.

510
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Hey,D.J.

511
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,530
You having trÈs fun?

512
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:33,960
D.J.,Come on.

513
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,950
Wait.

514
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,000
D.J.

515
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,850
D.J.,Come on.

516
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,780
Stop.

517
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,640
Come back.

518
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,870
On the upside,his english
is getting really good.

519
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,570
D.J.!

520
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,740
daniel jr.!

521
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,820
D.J.!

522
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,450
Daniel jr.!

523
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,460
Daniel,why didn't you tell me?

524
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,180
You tell me everythi.

525
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,060
I know.
I-I just--

526
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,650
I guess I thought I could fix it
somehow,you know,make it go away.

527
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,120
I was just afraid if I said it
out loud,it would make it real.

528
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,510
Well,do you know who the real father is?

529
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,020
Yeah.

530
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,360
Alexis.

531
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,570
Look,the important thing is,alexis
doesn't want to be the father and I do.

532
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,410
What does that mean?

533
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,470
What are you gonna do?

534
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,390
I'm gonna run away...

535
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,580
someplace his grandparents
can't get to us.

536
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,760
Are they awful people?

537
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,390
No. Not at all.

538
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,360
Okay,so...

539
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,620
these two nice people show
up to get their grandson,

540
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,120
and all of a sudden, you want to
become an international fugitive?

541
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,050
It's a really bad plan,isn't it?

542
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,750
Well...

543
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,630
you know,sometimes when we
want something really bad,

544
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,440
we forget that there are
other people involved.

545
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,280
We just get stuck in
our own little worlds,

546
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,260
and it doesn't matter
what other people feel...

547
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,530
excepthat it...

548
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,720
it does matter.

549
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,610
I think I know where he is.

550
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,120
Come on.

551
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,900
You know,I went to a lot of trouble
to get you a perfectly nice cubicle.

552
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,290
You'd really destroy my daughter's life,

553
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,610
all for some power
play over the company?

554
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,670
Alexis tried to destroy my
child's life for the same reason.

555
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,120
I just want justice served.

556
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh,I know what you want,

557
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,380
but alexis will never give you
control over meade publications.

558
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
She'll go to prison first.

559
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,940
Well,then we have nothing to discuss.

560
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,990
Not necessarily.

561
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,210
I said she'll never give
you control over the company.

562
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,670
Go on.

563
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,380
I'll convince her to split her shares,

564
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,710
sign over half to
daniel,half to you--

565
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,670
well,your unborn child.

566
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,750
You'll each have a
50% stake in meade--

567
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,870
equal partners in running the company,

568
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,470
equal partners in running the magazine.

569
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,350
You'll both be
editors-in-chief.

570
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:26,790
And in exchange,you will use your influence
with the D.A.To get the charges dropped.

571
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,940
Well,I don't think daniel
would be happy with you

572
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,970
bartering away his legacy to
spring his jailbird sister.

573
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,060
You may not understand this,wilhelmina,

574
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,620
but there's something called sacrifice.

575
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,890
Daniel and alexis have
had their differences,

576
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,170
but at the end of the day,
they're still brother and sister,

577
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,530
and that's all that really matters.

578
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,900
Are you sure he's down here?

579
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,340
Why don't we just check the cyclone
one more time or dante's inferno?

580
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,670
Nah. Trust me.

581
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,950
He doesn't want to be around
a bunch of screaming tourists.

582
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,480
What he really needs is a place
to be alone with his thoughts

583
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,700
and maybe get a good shot
up some chick's skirt,too.

584
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,260
And...

585
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,260
voil?

586
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,590
D.J.

587
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,080
Are you okay?

588
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,260
You really had me worried.

589
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,390
Look...

590
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,180
I'm so sorry you had
to find out like this.

591
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,020
But it doesn't change the way
I feel about you,not a bit.

592
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,840
Even after I found out,I
still wanted you to be my son.

593
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,490
I wanted to fight for you.

594
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,120
Why don't you...

595
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,770
fight?

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,330
It's complicated.

597
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,690
Your grandparents miss you very much.

598
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,720
I know you miss them...

599
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,200
and your mom.

600
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,300
Don't you?

601
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,020
Look,I just-- I
think it's time...

602
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,940
for you to go home for a while.

603
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,820
But I want you to be father,mon papa.

604
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,910
I want that,I mean,more
than anything,but...

605
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,500
D.J.,I'm not.

606
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,140
Maybe I can...

607
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,010
be your really cool american uncle.

608
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,310
I'm not going away...

609
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,810
ever.

610
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,760
Wow. You look great.

611
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,430
Thanks.

612
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,170
Well,I thought we could go
out for dessert,take a walk...

613
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,830
or we could do whatever you want to do,

614
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,030
'cause I don't have to
be home anytime soon.

615
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,940
I can't,tony.

616
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,050
What's wrong?

617
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,070
You're married.

618
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:17,270
Well,I told her today,everything,so
you and I,we could be to.

619
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,310
Ther it's okay.

620
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,260
We don't have to worry.

621
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,830
No.

622
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,910
Hilda,it's over.

623
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,090
It was over before I met you.

624
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,460
Does she feel that way?

625
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,960
I feel that way.

626
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,170
I am meant to be with you.

627
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,080
Okay,wait. No. Stop.

628
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,800
Please.

629
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,280
Jill came to the salon today.

630
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,000
- She's still in love with you.
- What?

631
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,960
I can't be the reason you guys break up.

632
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,220
What are you talking
about? This is crazy.

633
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,810
- Tony--  
- hilda,don't I have a say in this?

634
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,320
I love you.

635
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,220
You understand that?

636
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:00,540
I love you,too,but I lost
somebody that I loved before.

637
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,850
We never got a second chance.

638
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,810
I don't wish that on anybody.

639
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,680
whatever happens with you and your
wife,I can't be responsible for it.

640
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,420
I'm so sorry.

641
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,620
here's your cheese.

642
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,300
Heaven from a cow.

643
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,870
Thank you.

644
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,540
You earned it.

645
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,480
Oh,and,gio...

646
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,830
so you were right.

647
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,770
I guess sometimes I do
live in betty suarez land,

648
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,870
but only because I really thought
that we could be friends again.

649
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,280
I know.

650
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,420
That's how you roll in teddy bear lane.

651
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,950
I thought I was doing some big,selfless
thing,and it was all about me.

652
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,820
I guess I just have to let
you feel what you need to feel.

653
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,470
But whatever it's worth,I...

654
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,940
I really am sorry that I hurt you.

655
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,020
I was thinking,I spent
the whole day with you,

656
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,220
breathing the same air and
everything,and it w-wasn't so bad.

657
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,220
Gio.

658
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,370
I guess it was stupid,banning
you from my life.

659
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,960
No,it's not stupid,not
if that's what you feel.

660
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,060
You know,I've known you for a
while,and I've seen you at work,

661
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,660
swimming with those sharks at "mode,"

662
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,610
keeping daniel's head above water.

663
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,920
You're gonna do great
things one day,suarez.

664
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,680
I don't blame you for choosing yourself.

665
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,420
oh,willie,don't feel bad.

666
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,370
Bad?

667
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,190
Why should I feel bad?

668
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,670
Well,you lost alexis' portion of meade,

669
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,410
and now you have to
share "mode" with daniel.

670
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,570
I'm distraught.

671
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,880
Oh,marc,my adorable
but shortsighted minion,

672
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,050
six months ago,I was nothing more
than a salaried employee for meade.

673
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:23,020
Now I control 50% of
a publishing empire.

674
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Only 50% to go.

675
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,580
Did I say "distraught"?

676
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,290
I meant "hot."

677
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,240
You look pretty good.

678
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,000
No jailhouse tattoos.

00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,840
You haven't lived until you've
been thoroughly deloused.

681
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,920
So are you sure you don't want
to stick around for a while?

682
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,420
No,I don't trust wilhelmina
not to sic the D.A.On me again.

683
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,230
Besides,I could use a break.

684

Provence is beautiful this time of year.

685
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,690
My flight leaves in an hour.

686
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:16,210

can spend some time getting to know D.J.

there,for never judging me.

00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,700

I deserve no better and no worse*

706
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:44,860
