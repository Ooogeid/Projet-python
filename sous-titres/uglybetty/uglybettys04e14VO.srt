1
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,737
mirror, mirror, on the wall 

2
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:08,732
don't care who's fairest of them all

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:11,938
queen of your own world 

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,108
sexy and unstoppable

5
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,814
a woman, not a little girl

6
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,691
life is in control

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,384
love, love yourself 

8
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:24,354
you're so powerful

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:26,781
respect yourself

10
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,528
love, love yourself

11
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:34,595
it's so beautiful to love yourself

12
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,176
Aah!

13
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,810
Too funny!

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,960
Should one of us change or...

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,702
What are you going on about?

16
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:50,387
We're wearing the same dress.

17
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,499
No, we're not.Why are you being so weird?

18
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:56,698
Oh, it's fashion week.It makes you all anxious,

19
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,450
Like a lesbian at a makeup counter.

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,771
- What? I love fashion week. - Uh-huh.

21
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,576
Ok, maybe I used think it was a big fuss about nothing.

22
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:03,576
It was a big fuss about nothing.

23
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:06,779
-But now I'm into it. I get it. -Clearly.

24
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:12,374
Oh! Mandy, next time you decide to take in a giant,

25
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,571
crazy stray,

26
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:16,175
-Ask me first!- Marc! Marc!

27
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,334
Oh, thank god. Thank god I didn't miss you. Hi, ladies.

28
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,925
Remember you said you'd give me a good-bye kiss?

29
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:24,501
No, what I said was "Don't touch me."

30
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,294
How about I just close my eyes,

31
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,546
And you kiss me anywhere you want?

32
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,787
Oh! Bye.

33
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:35,308
How much longer must I be a hostage in my own home, mandy?

34
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,122
I have enough stress as it is!

35
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:39,021
It's his first fashion week as editor.

36
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,071
Yes, and wilhelmina is up my grinch to prove myself,

37
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,723
And--that's really cute, by the way. New?

38
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:46,130
Isn't that funny that we're wearing the same outfit?

39
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,261
Who is? What?

40
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,394
Yeah, I know. Speaking of crazy, when is she leaving?

41
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,994
Do your jobs, people.

42
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,860
"Mode's" Ten designers to watch show

43
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,860
Is in two days, and as of yet,

44
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,657
Half the seats are empty-- which is just as well,

45
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,997
Because one of our designers just quit!

46
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,523
And to make matters worse,

47
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,858
Daniel's banning male models from the show.

48
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:15,642
Everyone in this room is an editor... allegedly.

49
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,940
The only person who's not a complete disappointment

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,973
Is betty.

51
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,291
Let betty be a shining example to all of you--

52
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:26,254
Working day and night, like a trusty old mule.

53
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:27,658
And as a reward,

54
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,256
Betty will be writing this month's book review.

55
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:35,508
So what?A history of the sewing machine."

56
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,427
I've been meaning to read this.

57
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:41,019
How serendipitous. Well, go ahead, dear.

58
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:43,952
Right now? What about the meeting?

59
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:48,819
Well, it is 800 pages. Best get crackin'.

60
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,852
Aye, aye, captain.

61
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,119
Uh, amanda. Chocolate e-claire! How's it hangin'?

62
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:03,153
It's... hanging fine. Thank you.

63
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:07,019
Uh, amanda, I won't be in for a few days. Ooh. Where to?

64
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,219
South dakota to see your long lost secret son again?

65
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,719
No, and you don't have to ask me that

66
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,358
Every time I leave the office.

67
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,165
I'll just be tied up with fashion shows,

68
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:18,535
-And if daniel needs me, I'll be on my cell. -Sure thing.

69
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,199
And, amanda...

70
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,996
About my son. Hmm?

71
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:33,829
If you could just forget I ever said anything about it...

72
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,227
Said anything about what?

73
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,685
Okay. So--

74
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,344
-Oh! -Oh! Sorry.

75
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:42,212
Sorry!

76
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,395
I'm reading the history of the sewing machine...

77
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:47,278
And I can barely put it down. New headset?

78
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,279
Yep. Brand-new, state-of-the-art, hands-free.

79
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,276
-Same one the cia uses. -Oh.

80
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,799
So which show are you covering for fashion week?

81
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,298
-I'm not covering the show. -Oh, sure you are.

82
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:59,432
All the editors get assigned a show. Some have two or three.

83
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,133
Oh.

84
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,166
That's why wilhelmina didn't want me

85
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,665
In the meeting today.

86
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,332
She assigned me a book report

87
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,565
While everyone else is out covering fashion week.

88
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,699
Come on, betty. I'm sure you're being paranoid.

89
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,699
It was probably an oversight.

90
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,365
It wasn't an oversight.

91
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:19,257
Come on. I thought we agreed. Everyone gets a show.

92
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:21,224
Daniel, you nixed my male models,

93
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,390
And we lost a designer. I'm scrambling here

94
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,923
Just to try to put this show on its feet.

95
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,391
I don't have time to consider betty's feelings.

96
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,857
Well, I don't think it's fair to single her out.

97
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,857
I'm gonna call her right now.

98
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,524
Do what you want. You always do.

99
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:36,090
Dial betty suarez mobile.

100
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,457
It's a new earpiece.

101
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,457
STATE-OF-THE-ART. Say okay to dial Becky Jones.

102
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,023
No. Dial betty suarez mobile.

103
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:48,524
-Dial Becky Juarez?-N-NO. SORRY. UGH!

104
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:49,551
Betty Jonas? NO.

105
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,457
Mm. I don't know how you can stand to live with marc.

106
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,149
Sometimes I just want to wrap my arms 

107
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,573
and legs around him like an octopus and squeeze him

108
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,128
till he loves me back. 

109
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,370
You know marc's gay, right?

110
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,384
You're hilarious. Whatcha lookin' for, doll? 

111
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,188
My green tube minidress.

112
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,520
THERE'S A HOT PARTY AT LEVANTeast TONIGHT.

113
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:12,854
Ooh, at hotel on rivington. Fun. Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:15,321
Ooh, wait. You know what? I think I borrowed that dress.

115
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,888
Hold on... yes!

116
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,921
Here you go.

117
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:21,721
Yeah, you just put a little perfume under the pits,

118
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,420
It's good as new.

119
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,988
My mini! It's all stretched out!

120
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,420
Helen, what am I gonna wear? 

121
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,255
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

122
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,687
What do you got, an hour? I'll make you somethin'.

123
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,754
Yeah, you're gonna make me a dress.

124
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:37,420
Aah!

125
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,520
And voil?

126
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,554
Oh, my god.

127
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:53,130
Helen, you totally just made me a dress. Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,549
How are you so good at sewing?

129
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,802
Well, you know I was amish for a while, right? Oh.

130
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:59,808
Yeah, just for a summer for this guy I was dating--

131
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:02,377
Nebediah. Mmm, he had the softest beard.

132
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,776
Anyway, all those long nights

133
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,527
In pennsylvania without television,

134
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,899
You get pretty good with a needle and thread.

135
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:12,217
-Helen, could you make more of these? -Sure, why?

136
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,284
With your crazy sewing skills and my crazy fashion sense

137
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:19,284
And a fistful of mood stabilizers,

138
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,840
We could be a real design team.

139
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,058
What do you think? 

140
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:24,300
Oh, hon, I've never said no to a proposition.

141
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,832
I'm not about to start now. Aah!

142
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,699
One... two... three! Ah.

143
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,315
Can you believe the restaurant

144
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,532
-Didn't want this anymore? -Yes, it's awful.

145
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,399
It's classy. When you walk into a house

146
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,547
And you see a big, beautiful chandelier,

147
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,720
You think, "These people have class."

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,999
Oh, betty, it says that you have a missed message.

149
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,536
Lemme see. Oh, that's daniel.

150
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,014
-Will you just play the message out loud? -Yeah.

151
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,295
Maybe a little higher, mija.

152
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,762
Ready? One, two, three!

153
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,762
Hey, Betty. I'm with Wilhelmina.

154
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:56,996
Uh... Oh, uh, say hi, Wilhelmina. Come on, say hi.

155
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:58,662
Hello, Betty.

156
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,559
Good news. The whole thing was a misunderstanding.

157
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:04,493
You are covering a show for Fashion Week. YAY!

158
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:05,258
Betty! Oh!

159
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,428
Oh! Sorry! Betty.

160
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,829
Sorry!

161
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,284
I'll e-mail you the details, okay?

162
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:10,401
See you tomorrow. Bye.

163
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,987
OH, WHAT A RELIEF! YOU CAN JUST DELETE IT.

164
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,133
Are you happy?

165
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,331
Now we've got Betty judging a fashion show.

166
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:18,631
Come on, what's the big deal?

167
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:19,993
She's one of our best writers.

168
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,631
In features! But this is about taste.

169
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,631
Betty never met a paisley or plaid

170
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,732
or awful butterfly belt she didn't love.

171
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:28,565
Do you think she has good taste?

172
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,631
I mean, honestly, Daniel, really?

173
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,364
Why--why is that light blinking?

174
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,998
You did hang up. Of course I hung up!

175
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,199
I'm not stupid, you know. God!

176
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,865
Oh, crap.

177
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,336
There's my favorite editor.

178
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:02,768
Just, uh, wanted to apologize for the message I left.

179
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:05,668
Yep. I got all five of your "I'm sorry" Messages, too.

180
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,169
It's okay.

181
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:10,069
Really? Can I maybe see that signature betty smile?

182
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:12,236
There it is!

183
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,935
Look, daniel, I know that I make bold choices in my fashion.

184
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,794
Well, I really think in the last four years,

185
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,062
You've learned a ton. I know that.

186
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:21,060
Wilhelmina doesn't. What does it say

187
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,155
If people around here don't trust my taste?

188
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,990
Well, I guess you're just gonna have to change their minds.

189
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,091
You can start by writing the best review

190
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,814
Of the fashion show we assigned you.

191
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:31,038
It is kind of a rinky-dink show

192
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,415
That nobody really cares about, but it's a show!

193
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:34,693
And the important thing is,

194
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,208
-you're not mad at me. -Leave the plant. 

195
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,116
Okay.

196
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,743
Because!

197
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:52,743
Daniel is dead set against using male models,

198
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,910
And, like it or not, I have to respect his opinion.

199
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,576
He was very specific--

200
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,277
"No male models in the 'mode' show, ever."

201
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:02,144
Really? Daniel?

202
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:05,144
Oh, I could never ask him that.

203
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,144
Well, I guess a lot of women find him handsome,

204
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:11,377
And, well, yeah, I suppose he's in great shape--

205
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,939
Well, the best shape of his life.

206
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:15,770
-But he would never do it. -Never do what?

207
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,870
Uh, what are you talking about?

208
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,695
Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there.

209
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:22,395
This diva designer wants to use you

210
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,428
As a model in the show to get us press,

211
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,595
And I told her absolutely not.

212
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:28,395
Oh, right. Uh, mm-hmm.

213
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,428
Thank you.

214
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,194
Wilhelmina?

215
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:38,361
I'm thinking maybe...

216
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,361
We're being a little rash about this whole,

217
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:43,361
Uh, male model thing.

218
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,762
We might want to rethink this.

219
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,194
Okay, we are, like, bizarrely good at this.

220
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,860
And since that designer dropped out of the "Mode" Show,

221
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,716
We could totally take their spot.

222
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,760
Helen? Just had a couple of flyaways.

223
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:59,361
You are so sexy. Why are you so sexy?

224
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,927
And you know what? You look like you could take a punch.

225
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,306
Where you from? 

226
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,060
I'm actually visiting from south dakota, um...

227
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:07,743
-Oh, I love south dakota. -It's a nice place.

228
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,600
Uh, I'm sorry. Do you know

229
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,929
Where I could find claire meade? 

230
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,330
Helen!No flirting!

231
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:14,354
We don't have time for rugged 

232
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:16,346
and handsome--is that a dimple?

233
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,424
I could totally set up a tent in that dimple.

234
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,179
Ohh. Mm-hmm. I'll be naked in it. Mmm.

235
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:22,446
No. Focus.

236
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,645
We have to finish our line for fashion week! God!

237
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,279
Well, thanks.

238
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,212
This has been weird and not at all helpful.

239
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:42,280
Watch it.

240
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:46,748
Ugh. A. B., I think this is one of those showcases

241
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:49,181
For designers who didn't make it to bryant park.

242
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,375
Well, at least we're in the front row.

243
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,847
Uh, we're in the only row. 

244
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,670
We're the most important people here.

245
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,314
That's not true. You're sitting right next to brian reyes--

246
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:58,847
A very important designer. Hi.

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,847
I'm just here for onion rings.

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,646
Isn't this fashion show hilarious?

249
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,113
Ooh, can I get another drink, please?

250
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:09,379
Hilda, this is very important for my work.

251
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,314
The key to sounding like you have good taste

252
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:15,013
Is just hating everything.

253
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,120
Just call it "Garish" Or "Ghoulish." 

254
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,913
Ooh, yeah. Ghoulish is good.

255
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,913
Well, maybe it's trying to be prairie chic.

256
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,913
I mean, who am I to say?

257
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,614
Ugh. I don't-- I just don't know.

258
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,517
Wait a sec.

259
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,617
That's kind of stunning. Mm.

260
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,183
-Who did that? -I would wear that.

261
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,183
It's pretty great.

262
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,949
Excuse me.

263
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:52,183
Marisa? Hi. I loved your designs.

264
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:54,094
I'm betty suarez from "Mode" Magazine,

265
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:57,321
-And I'm gonna make you a star. -Excuse me?

266
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:58,969
Kidding. I can't make anyone a star.

267
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,050
But I do want to put you in the "Mode's"

268
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,234
-Ten designers to watch show.-Really?

269
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:06,124
-You can do that? -No, I can't-- I can't do that, either.

270
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:09,091
I'd have to convince some people. Let me try this again.

271
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:10,169
I am betty suarez,

272
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,524
-And I'm gonna try really hard to make you a star. -Yay!

273
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,855
Yay!

274
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:19,718
Marc, I found a new designer today--marisa rowen.

275
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,967
And I want to pitch her for the "Mode" Show. 

276
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:23,650
Ha! Suicide mission.

277
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,171
You could maybe pitch a feature to wilhelmina.

278
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,184
But a designer?

279
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:28,751
No. She'll laugh you out of the room.

280
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,555
I know that. So I've been thinking,

281
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,326
What if you were in the room with me?

282
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,216
We could pitch her together and share the credit.

283
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:35,448
Why would I want to do that?

284
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,271
Because wilhelmina's got a slot to fill,

285
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,914
And you have been trying to impress her,

286
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:41,053
And this designer is great.

287
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,184
You found this?

288
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,946
These are pretty, uh...

289
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:52,434
Great? I know. Marc, come on.

290
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:55,329
If wilhelmina says yes, I look good, you look good--

291
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:57,574
Win-win! Besides, the "Mode" Show

292
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,153
Could make this woman's career.

293
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,120
We could be changing someone's life today.

294
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:03,953
Shouldn't that be enough? Okay, fine. But...

295
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:06,987
I'm the wilhelmina expert, so we do this my way.

296
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,586
Oh, my god. Are you hurt?

297
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,854
Oh, hey. Uh... no.

298
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,249
I was just working on

299
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:35,116
My runway walk for the "Mode" Show.

300
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,634
Oh, that's what that was.

301
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:39,193
Don't be embarrassed.

302
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,406
I used to be a terrible walker,

303
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:43,394
But now they let me wear the final dress in everything.

304
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:45,494
-Wow. -I'm heather, by the way.

305
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:48,209
-Hi, I'm daniel. -I know who you are.

306
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:52,028
-You're, like, the head of the company, right? -Guilty.

307
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,540
I was just on the way to my fitting.

308
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,584
-You wanna come?  -I'd love that.

309
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,486
Now this isn't some chatty jam session with the features nerds.

310
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,386
Wilhelmina is very intense

311
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,219
When it comes to presenting fashion.

312
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:17,353
First of all, you must never look her in the eyes.

313
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:21,319
And you must never look her in the knees.

314
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,553
She's very self-conscious about her knees.

315
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,952
If you must look at her,

316
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:29,686
Please direct your gaze to her shins or her toes.

317
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,594
Is that really necessary?

318
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,559
Yes!

319
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,084
Now since I will be doing the talking,

320
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:38,952
You will be vanna white, like so. Mnh, mnh, mnh. Mm.

321
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,973
Well, can I at least-- bup-bup-bup-bup!

322
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:43,110
I know you're gonna want to talk

323
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,572
Because you're betty, and you love to talk.

324
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:46,176
But the second

325
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,947
You start yammering about being true to yourself,

326
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:51,546
Wilhelmina is going to start texting...

327
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,039
ON HER BlackBerry...

328
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:55,273
And we will have lost her.

329
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,006
All right. As long as we share the credit, I'm fine.

330
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,206
Which design are we gonna lead with?

331
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,370
Hey, magic marc-er. Chipotle.

332
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,870
So I hear you are pitching some no-name

333
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:09,970
For the big "Mode" Fashion show.

334
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,363
She's not a no-name. She's about to be discovered.

335
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,920
Okay. Still not hearing a name.

336
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,208
Anyway, helen and I just finished our fashion line,

337
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,958
And I was hoping that...

338
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,087
Maybe you could show ours to wilhelmina, too.

339
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,553
Oh, my god. Mandy, I have seen your designs,

340
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:25,620
And I love, love, love them.

341
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,520
But... it's betty's name on wilhelmina's calendar,

342
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,520
So you're gonna have to ask her.

343
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,752
I don't think that we're gonna have time

344
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:44,106
To pitch both marisa's designs and yours.

345
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:45,998
-What? -What?

346
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:49,087
Betty, when you see these designs, you'll make time.

347
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,304
Thank you so much. I knew I could count on you.

348
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,536
Yes! Yes!

349
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,287
I didn't say yes, did I?

350
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:01,287
The only way to get daniel on board with the male models

351
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,480
Was to make him one, and I'm worried that he's gonna

352
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,141
-Bring down the visual average of the show. -I know it.

353
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,026
So all we have to do is surround him

354
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:09,118
With the best-looking models

355
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,553
And hope that they cancel each other out.

356
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,519
But all the best models are already booked in shows.

357
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,806
Hey, you. Flannel. What are you doing?

358
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,973
I'm looking for claire meade. Do you know her?

359
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,474
Claire? Yes, unfortunately.

360
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,539
But all the models are supposed to be in their fittings,

361
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,199
So forget about that skeleton and go back to the closet.

362
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,040
Oh. I think you must have me confused with someone.

363
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm not a model.

364
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,940
You are now.

365
00:16:57,174 --> 00:17:00,140
Grandpa, my new acting class has real working actors,

366
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,640
And I want them to be my friends,

367
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:07,573
But how can I invite people over with the... crystal monster?

368
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,573
Ah, you're just saying that

369
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:13,441
Because you haven't seen it with the dimmer.

370
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,805
Ah, now is that classy or what?

371
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,771
Maybe it needs a little work.

372
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,691
Papi! Ahh. Mm.

373
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,691
If you wanna keep futzing with it,

374
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,691
-Would you hire an electrician? -Fine. Fine.

375
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:28,169
Hey, leave the man alone. Come on.

376
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:29,935
Let him play with his toy. It makes him happy.

377
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:33,049
-It looks great. -If he wants to fix something,

378
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,315
How about my salon chair or the dryer valve?

379
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:39,581
That place is falling apart. I'm barely breaking even.

380
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,781
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

381
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:42,155
What, you're worried about money?

382
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,781
Everything in that place keeps breaking.

383
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,881
That salon is turning into a money pit.

384
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,382
Sometimes, you know,

385
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:49,039
I wish it would just get struck by lightning,

386
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,542
And I could collect the insurance money

387
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,370
Or something.

388
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:53,642
I know. Let's--

389
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,809
I shouldn't be talking like that.

390
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,309
Hey, look. Come on. Things are gonna turn around.

391
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,175
All right? You'll see. Okay?

392
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:04,809
See you later.

393
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,309
Bye.

394
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,542
Hi. I'm supposed to get measured or something?

395
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,943
Yeah, I'll be with you in a second.

396
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:26,542
-First-time model? Yeah. -I'm actually kind of nervous.

397
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,042
Aw. That's cute.

398
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,409
Don't worry. You can stick with me.

399
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,409
I'll show you what to do.

400
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,909
Did some print modeling back in college. Daniel meade.

401
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,943
Oh, meade? As in the name on the building?

402
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,943
So claire meade's your mom?

403
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,209
Yeah, but down here I'm just like everybody else--

404
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:42,742
One of the models. Shh.

405
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,742
So, daniel, here's the poop.

406
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,709
Uh, the final suit might be the eensiest bit snug on you.

407
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:48,449
Well, that's okay. That's the style now.

408
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:49,839
Um... yes.

409
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,805
Although ideally you'd want someone a little leaner.

410
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,339
Uh... just for funsies.

411
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,839
Ooh! Those are some tight little abs.

412
00:18:56,872 --> 00:19:00,006
Heather, come here. Feel these.

413
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,705
Oh, pretty good, new guy. Thanks.

414
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:05,839
Uh-huh. And biceps to make me feel safe.

415
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,572
And look at this.

416
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,006
The most perfect tush you've ever seen.

417
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,743
All right. Now you guys are just making fun of me.

418
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:14,876
You know, let's try you in the final suit.

419
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,376
Guys, guys. Not to step on any toes--

420
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,376
The designer specifically asked for me,

421
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,443
So let's just stick to the plan, right?

422
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:24,443
Besides, I had fries for lunch.

423
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,276
I'll be 5 pounds lighter tomorrow. You'll see.

424
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,077
Of course.

425
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,892
Betty.

426
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,892
And notice the hand-sewn feather details

427
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,358
In this piece. Beautiful, isn't it?

428
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,193
Look at that.

429
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,026
Betty.

430
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,525
And this is her take on a garden dress.

431
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,659
NOTE THE 1940s INFLUENCE, BUT IT'S STILL VERY NEW.

432
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,892
And you're sure she's never shown before?

433
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,392
Never in a major fashion show,

434
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,592
Though technically, I did find her at--

435
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,892
Uh... but she has been in alternative showcases.

436
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:06,292
But not at bryant park,

437
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:09,592
Which means she's eligible for "Mode's" Top ten to watch.

438
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:21,726
But look at this fabulous ruching.

439
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,392
So what do you think?

440
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,892
Well, it's a little soft for my taste,

441
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,225
But I haven't seen anything better, so it's fine.

442
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,459
She's in.

443
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:39,826
Now how did you find out about her again?

444
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:41,792
Actually, it was betty who first--

445
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:44,292
Well, you know what? I really don't care.

446
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,292
Just pick six looks and oversee them.

447
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,726
You really stepped up to the plate on this one.

448
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,126
Great work... marc.

449
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,926
Uh... w--uh, wilhelmina, I also had something to do--

450
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:00,425
Yes, yes, yes. Thanks for turning the pages, betty.

451
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,358
Now get out.

452
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:13,898
Hey! Partner.

453
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,931
Look, betty, I tried to tell wilhelmina that you found her.

454
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,176
Oh, you did? You didn't try very hard.

455
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,898
Oh, quit being a credit hog. Think about the designer.

456
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,398
We changed a life today.

457
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,506
Shouldn't that be enough?

458
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,398
So what did wilhelmina say about my designs?

459
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:27,398
Ooh! Whoops, gotta go.

460
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,398
Bring it. Tell me what she said. Uh, she liked

461
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,398
The other designer's stuff better.

462
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:34,731
More than mine? Did she say why?

463
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,398
Amanda, we didn't actually show her your work.

464
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,398
It's great that you want to pursue design,

465
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:42,947
But you're so new at it,

466
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,673
And--and this was really important.

467
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:46,547
Well, did you even look at my designs?

468
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:53,547
Yes, and I thought that they weren't quite ready.

469
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,913
Well, marc loved them.

470
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:00,735
You know, betty,

471
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,483
I don't know why I even bothered asking you in the first place.

472
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,547
What do you know about fashion?

473
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,347
Ladies and germs, it's fashion week,

474
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:14,080
And you know what that means-- I'm drunk.

475
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,381
Kidding... mostly.

476
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:18,880
It also means "Mode" Will be unveiling

477
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:20,880
Their top ten designers to watch.

478
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm here with marisa rowen,

479
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:24,880
A last-minute replacement plucked from obscurity.

480
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,714
Marisa, tell me,

481
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:29,714
How do you feel to be shown at bryant park?

482
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,147
I feel great, but I wouldn't even be here

483
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,147
Without the talented young lady from "Mode" Who discovered me.

484
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,314
And here she is-- marc st. James!

485
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:39,314
Hey, suzuks. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

486
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:42,047
Tell me, genius, where'd you find this one? Ooh.

487
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,690
It's a great story. It was pouring down... oh, come on.

488
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,877
He didn't even tell me he was doing an interview.

489
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:49,088
This stinks. What are you doing?

490
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,741
Only 2 more pounds to lose before the show tonight.

491
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:55,722
Oh, right. Your big debut as a supermodel.

492
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,488
Yeah, as long as I don't eat anything today,

493
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,987
I should be fine.

494
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,987
Oh, you know what? Come over here.

495
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:03,987
I need you to sit on my feet.

496
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:06,355
You know, I found that designer.

497
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:08,188
That should be me on tv.

498
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,188
If I were you,

499
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:14,722
I'd give marc a piece of my mind.

500
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,221
Oh, there's that little weasel now!

501
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:21,727
Marc! I just saw you on tv.

502
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,760
-So you're doing interviews now? -I was doing you a favor.

503
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:28,327
Have you ever seen yourself on tv? Ting!

504
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,126
I was just being a friend. Yes. A friend? 

505
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:31,261
The whole point of this

506
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:33,827
Was for me to prove to wilhelmina that I have taste,

507
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,487
And instead you're making it seem

508
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,671
Like you found marisa all by yourself.

509
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:38,834
And what's worse is,

510
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,201
You hung me out to dry with amanda, your best friend.

511
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,858
You knew her designs weren't ready,

512
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,701
-And you made me be the bad guy. -Betty--

513
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,500
No! You want the credit, marc? Do the work.

514
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,235
Take the stick out.

515
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,626
What is this, "Zoolander"?

516
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:04,059
Walk like a man.

517
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,560
Shoulders back.

518
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:09,193
Ugh. Not all the way back.

519
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:12,526
Try it again. One more time.

520
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,760
Oh, stop. Just--

521
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:16,460
Just walk like...

522
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,893
Walk like that guy.

523
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,626
I can't believe marc stole all your glory.

524
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,693
You know what would make you feel better, mija?

525
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:32,426
Some more light.

526
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,426
I hired that electrician.

527
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,593
Now look how bright it is.

528
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:42,629
Not too short, mom. I like it swoopy. Well...

529
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:45,596
He's trying out new looks for his acting class.

530
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:48,329
My professional acting class, so I have to fit in.

531
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,991
Well, I'm all for fitting in, but I know actors,

532
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,284
And I don't want you coming home with your nose pierced

533
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,070
Or a cigarette dangling out of your mouth. Mom.

534
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:57,891
Mija, I'm sorry that fashion week didn't turn out

535
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:58,824
Like you wanted. 

536
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:00,013
I just thought that 

537
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:02,210
maybe I could change some people's minds about me,

538
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,611
But I guess I won't get the chance. Ah.

539
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:07,943
Hello?

540
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,943
Betty, I am freaking out about the show tonight.

541
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,876
I'm not sure about the six looks. Where are you?

542
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,377
I'm--I'm in queens,

543
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,843
BUT I THOUGHT THAT MARC WAS HELPING YOU. He--he was.

544
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,843
Yeah. Marc was wearing opera gloves today.

545
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,910
I-I'm supposed to take fashion advice from him?

546
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:25,943
You are the one that found me. You are the one that I trust.

547
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,876
Is it cool if I come over there?

548
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,210
Yeah.

549
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:34,477
Of course.

550
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:37,533
It's a tragedy that these won't be seen

551
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:40,228
-At fashion week. -Aw, so they said no.

552
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,927
Do I give up every time someone tells me no?

553
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,794
"No, helen, don't do that."

554
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:46,660
"No, helen, don't sleep there."

555
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,660
"No, helen, that's not food."

556
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,395
We'll just show at fashion week next year,

557
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:53,527
And until then, we'll all live together,

558
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,694
Like one giant, sexy family.

559
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:03,430
Hi. Need some help?

560
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:07,315
See? That's what real friends do.

561
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,315
It's not like betty, who's up on her big, stocky high horse,

562
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,815
Telling me that I'm not good enough.

563
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,815
Mandy.

564
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:18,315
Don't be so hard on betty.

565
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:23,236
Look, real designers spend years schooling and training and--

566
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:25,315
And, well, you did this in, like, one week.

567
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:31,133
Marc, why didn't you say anything?

568
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,199
'cause I don't like to see you sad.

569
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:38,704
Betty was telling the truth.

570
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,171
I'm sorry.

571
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:51,937
All the garments are steamed and hung in the salon,

572
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:52,875
And in a few hours,

573
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,948
They will be the talk of fashion week.

574
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,248
You are a lifesaver. You know that? Aw.

575
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:01,981
Amanda.

576
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:04,015
Hey. Your papi let me in.

577
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:05,615
Can you talk?

578
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,870
Yeah. Um, this is marisa.

579
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,449
-Hi. -Mucho gusto.

580
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:14,449
Listen, betty, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before.

581
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,449
I just keep seeing you and marc move up in the world,

582
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,248
And I feel like I'm being left behind or something.

583
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,406
And I thought being a designer would be my big ticket.

584
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:25,837
-It's so stupid. -It's not stupid.

585
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:29,302
Betty, do you smell smoke? Yes. What is that?

586
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:31,302
Out! Hey, get out!

587
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:32,329
Get out! Everybody out! Go!

588
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,802
Get out of here! Bobby, what's going on?

589
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:34,898
The house is on fire! Aah!

590
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,145
What?! Oh, my god!

591
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,862
Well, the house is mostly just smoke damaged,

592
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,996
But the salon is pretty bad.

593
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:18,062
Oh, my god. I can't believe this!

594
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,730
This is my business! How did this happen?

595
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:25,229
They don't know yet. I'm so sorry, hilda.

596
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:28,229
Look, the most important thing is that no one's hurt.

597
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:33,663
Hey, marc, I can't really talk right now.

598
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,591
I'm in the middle of an emergency.

599
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,526
No, I'm in the middle of an emergency.

600
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,859
It's almost time for runway.

601
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:42,426
Is Marisa with you? Where are the dresses?

602
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,759
Oh, my god. The dresses. Ohh.

603
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:51,875
Celery only. Fewer calories.

604
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,076
Honestly, I don't know how you guys do this.

605
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,009
I'm starving.

606
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:03,409
He is so lucky he can eat like that.

607
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:06,009
I wish I was 25 again.

608
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,342
Why? How old are you?

609
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,509
26.

610
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:12,509
So over-the-hill.

611
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,276
So listen, um,

612
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,809
There's a party after the show tonight,

613
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,809
And I was thinking, you know, maybe you and I can go together?

614
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,443
Oh, you're so sweet,

615
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:26,076
But tyler and I are having dinner after.

616
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,742
But you can meet us

617
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:32,443
At the after-after party at, like, 3:00?

618
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:34,942
In the morning? Wow. Um, you know,

619
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,443
Um, I'll probably just take a rain check.

620
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,942
Um, I'm gonna go get dressed.

621
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,443
It's getting--ahh! Ahh.

622
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,376
Ohh. Back pain?

623
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,409
My dad gets that, too.

624
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:58,443
It's not your fault. You know, I had a feeling

625
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:00,700
This was all a little too good to be true.

626
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,342
No, stop. Don't talk like that.

627
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:03,913
I just can't believe I got so close.

628
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:06,288
Um, you guys? Not to rain on your little pity party,

629
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,580
But these are actually still kinda fab.

630
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,181
Amanda, you're making it worse.

631
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:13,148
Okay, I may not be a designer, but I still know fashion,

632
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,514
And this is really good.

633
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,313
Look at the hemline. It's ruined.

634
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:20,881
Oh, excuse me. Can I borrow that for a second?

635
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,547
Amanda! Amanda, stop!

636
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,313
Thank you.

637
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,081
See?

638
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:31,547
I don't know.

639
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,081
Okay, you just have to see it in action.

640
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:38,480
Hot, right? I totally styled it.

641
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:42,347
What?

642
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,181
Well... fashion is trending towards distressed looks.

643
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:49,814
What are you saying? We can still show these?

644
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,714
I can't believe I'm saying this, but, yes.

645
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:54,592
I'm gonna call marc and tell him that you're on your way now.

646
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:57,442
-You're not coming? -Aunt betty, the fire is out,

647
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,892
And there is nothing left to see here,

648
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,892
And if you don't go to the "Mode" Show,

649
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,258
That'll be two tragedies today, so...

650
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,758
No. You're going.

651
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,658
Cute. I know, right?

652
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:08,425
Sexy? Yeah, I like it.

653
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,458
You need to find someone else to wear this.

654
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,171
Took you long enough to get here.

655
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,089
I was this close

656
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,883
To having the grandmother of all hissy fits.

657
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:49,994
Now show me the dresses.

658
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:57,780
Amanda! Not while she's in the dress.

659
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,279
Oh! Sorry.

660
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:02,379
On the phone you said we could still use these.

661
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:03,696
Has wilhelmina seen these yet? 

662
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:05,146
Sh-she's gonna murder somebody.

663
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:07,513
Ohh. Here. It's coming. I-I can feel it.

664
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:10,446
It's the hissy fit. I'm having a hissy fit!

665
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
What the hell is going on?

666
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:40,965
Willie, I swear, I had nothing to do with this.

667
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,464
There was a fire, and--

668
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:43,833
Well, you have to ask betty. It's betty's fault.

669
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,466
Betty's the one who found the designer to begin with.

670
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,599
Oh, great. Now I get the credit. Shh!

671
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,632
If you are in any way dissatisfied,

672
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,632
I will shut this down right now.

673
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,063
Oh, stop your prattling, marc.

674
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:56,030
You know I hate eleventh hour surprises,

675
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:58,030
But I... I actually think

676
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,763
These dresses work better like this.

677
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:04,130
Couldn't agree more.

678
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:12,462
Okay, everybody, back to work! Show in ten minutes!

679
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:18,130
I just say that you're right

680
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,030
She's something good

681
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:26,362
My baby's on fire

682
00:33:26,396 --> 00:33:32,696
My, my baby's on fire

683
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:39,362
Irresistible, irresistible

684
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,429
Irresistible, irresistible

685
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,295
Oh! Hi, hons.

686
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,162
You'll never guess what.

687
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:50,429
I met this guy tonight, and we're getting married. Aah!

688
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,763
You are? Yeah, things were never gonna work out between us,

689
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,763
And things with me and guillermo are so good,

690
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:57,262
Which is a good thing,

691
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,496
Because he came this close to being deported.

692
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,162
Oh, guillermo, there you are. Look. Hi, cutie.

693
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:04,562
Hi, darling.

694
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:09,063
Mwah. Look, isn't he cute? Those are my friends.

695
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:10,663
Wow.

696
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:14,663
I guess that's the end of my design team.

697
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,295
Well, you're not a designer,

698
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,596
But, amanda, the accessories, the hair--

699
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:22,710
You really pulled this together.

700
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,121
Maybe you're a stylist.

701
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:28,820
Do I have to go to school? How do I become one?

702
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,820
Just call yourself a stylist.

703
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:34,755
I... am... A stylist.

704
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:36,755
Aw.

705
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:38,755
Rachel zoe can suck it!

706
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,156
There's a new skinny bitch in town! What?

707
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,645
Are they clapping?

708
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:45,344
Yes, and it's all for you.

709
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,878
Oh! Last dress. Go, go. Have fun. Oh!

710
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:49,445
Have fun!

711
00:34:54,478 --> 00:34:56,713
So... for what it's worth,

712
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:58,019
I might have gotten a little carried away

713
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,486
During fashion week trying to impress wilhelmina. Mm.

714
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:03,737
But it is so hard being a new editor around here.

715
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,603
Oh, really? What's that like?

716
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,104
It's really--oh. Pfft.

717
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,171
So anyway, I'm sorry.

718
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:15,171
Well...

719
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:19,304
I appreciate the apology.

720
00:35:22,438 --> 00:35:26,071
And I shouldn't have stolen your credit.

721
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:29,971
But I learned from the best.

722
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,371
Wasn't that fabulous, suzuki?

723
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:35,048
Marisa rowen--another wilhelmina slater discovery.

724
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,766
Uh, wait till you see what's next.

725
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:39,362
The menswear collection-- a "Mode" First. 

726
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,125
I'm all over it.

727
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:47,739
Marisa rowen. I found her.

728
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:53,087
There you are. I just came by to wish you luck.

729
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,087
Honey, shouldn't you be dressed?

730
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:58,787
Uh, I guess my modeling days are pretty much over.

731
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:00,453
What changed your mind?

732
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,453
I realized I'm not 25 anymore.

733
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:04,954
That's good. I knew you when you were 25.

734
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:07,954
You were aimless, arrogant, entitled.

735
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:11,320
Wait, this is helping how?

736
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,121
Well, look at you now.

737
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:14,921
You know who you are

738
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:16,921
And what you want from life.

739
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:20,021
You're kind and loyal and loving.

740
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:23,288
And I'd much rather spend time with this daniel.

741
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,087
Thanks, mom.

742
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:27,087
Just sorry you won't have the thrill

743
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,288
Of seeing your son walk down the runway.

744
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:42,654
Go.

745
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:44,353
Now. Go. Go.

746
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,868
Treated you like a rusty blade

747
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:54,034
Oh, god! Thank god for you, bobby.

748
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:56,734
If you hadn't been there to get everybody out the house...

749
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,235
I don't even want to think about it.

750
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:01,235
Yeah, that was lucky, you know?

751
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,734
But, uh, maybe now you get what you want.

752
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,301
What?

753
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:07,667
See, now that the salon burnt down,

754
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,135
You could probably get the insurance money.

755
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:11,634
It's good.

756
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,301
Some love holds

757
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,634
Some gets used

758
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,301
Tried to tell you

759
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:24,934
I never knew it could be so sweet

760
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:28,101
Who could ever be so cruel?

761
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:33,182
Blame the devil for the things you do

762
00:37:34,824 --> 00:37:37,996
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

763
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,140
Nobody's fault

764
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:43,473
But my own

765
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:46,907
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

766
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,173
Nobody's fault

767
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:54,140
But my own

768
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,572
Mrs. Meade?

769
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,838
I'm tyler venton, from stickney, south dakota.

770
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,105
I know who you are.

771
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,305
That was some tip you left me back in stickney.

772
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:15,771
I kept wondering why you'd leave so much money. Oh.

773
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:18,305
And when I asked my parents about you,

774
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,306
They got all quiet, and so I started thinking that

775
00:38:20,306 --> 00:38:23,490
Maybe this has to do with my adoption or something.

776
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:30,038
And well, uh...

777
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,071
Are you my mother?

778
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:35,522
Tyler, I...

779
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:40,856
I don't know what to say.

780
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:47,788
Yes.

781
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,794
I've pictured...

782
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,828
I've pictured this in my head a million times,

783
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:06,861
And, wow, now that it's here...

784
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:08,501
You must have so many questions, 

785
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,061
but I can't do this tonight.

786
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,644
Can I put you up at a nice hotel?

787
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:13,927
Will you stay in town? Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:17,226
Uh... and--and, tyler, until I can figure out

789
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,226
How to tell the people in my life about you,

790
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,660
-Can we just keep this between us? -Yes, ma'am.

791
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:28,594
What did he want?

792
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, I think he was... lost.

793
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:34,713
Well, I'm glad I don't have to see that guy again.

794
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,486
Wilhelmina? Excuse me.

795
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,820
I just wanted to say thank you

796
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,820
For putting marisa in the show.

797
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:54,986
Looking for a pat on the back, are we?

798
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,920
No, that's not what I meant.

799
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:59,920
Betty, you had a success tonight.

800
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:01,920
But if you found that designer,

801
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:03,953
You should have pitched her yourself

802
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,953
Instead of hiding behind marc.

803
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,253
Well, it's just that, historically,

804
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,853
You haven't really been a fan of my taste.

805
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,853
No. You were afraid.

806
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:17,686
You think I'm scary?

807
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,686
Try working under fey sommers.

808
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,187
For 20 years,

809
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,953
She belittled every fashion choice I ever made,

810
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,986
Every idea I ever had.

811
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,386
But I never doubted myself.

812
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:30,352
Taste is...

813
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,187
Is having the courage of your own convictions.

814
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,920
I get it.

815
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:40,786
Taste is... subjective.

816
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,719
It's what I say it is.

817
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:45,786
No. It's what I say it is.

818
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:49,553
And, uh... betty,

819
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:53,753
I will deny this if anyone ever asks, but...

820
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,986
You don't always get it wrong.

821
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,386
Your shoes, for example...

822
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:02,187
I don't hate them.

823
00:41:04,452 --> 00:41:08,986
But next time, don't pair them with that cheap hooker bag.

824
