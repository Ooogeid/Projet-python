1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,160
Previously on "ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,940
Why would you ever agree to help wilhelmina?

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,280
Can we talk about it?

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,170
- Hi,daddy.
- Alex?

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,060
Bradford meade won't be able to
 keep his hands off you.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,350
That's the idea.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,230
- I saw you acting crazy and I 
- Your day is over!

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,310
Punch out!

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,060
So are you giving petra the may cover or the june?

10
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,100
- What,are you also her manager?
- I'm her mother.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,530
Petra is 16?

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,480
You didn't ask to see i.d.,did you?

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,790
It's daniel. Sounds like he might be in trouble.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,210
I've punched out.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,680
Ay,betty! What are you doing here?

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,970
I sleep here!

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,120
What are you doing sneaking in my window 
like you're back in high school?

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,790
I was out last night... With santos.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,980
But i don't want papi to know,or justin,yet.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,480
I mean,i don't even know if this is " you"

21
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,280
Or just,you know,"i love you naked."

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,480
Okay,so,you are back in high school.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,140
What are you doing here anyway?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm calling in sick.

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh,what,are you still mad at everyone there?

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,410
Why wouldn't i be?

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,410
Christina's my best friend.
I confided things to her,

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,670
And daniel told me to butt out of his life,

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,970
That i'm just his secretary.

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,260
- And henry...
- Well,what did he do?

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,480
Nothing.

32
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,320
But he has a girlfriend,

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,570
And that's just thcherry on the sundae.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,390
Would you like adae? 

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,650
Maybe

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,460
Well,toug it's monday. Go to work. Be an adult.

37
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,560
Said the girl with a leaf in her hair.

38
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,140
I'm just saying,
A job is not about making friends.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,750
It's about making money...

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,470
And stealing office supplies.

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,960
By the way,we're out of coffee filters.

42
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,380
Well,that's certainly a nice way to 
wake up in the morning.

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,250
Think of me as your caf?Au lait.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,230
I wish i didn't have to leave.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,640
I am not lookingoroord to my meeting with alex.

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,130
Oh,you poor dear.

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,800
You wanna talk about it?

48
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,590
No,no. It's my problem. I'll deal with it.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Bradford,i hope you don't just think of me 
as your morning pickmeup.

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,880
I'd like to think i'm an important part 
of your life...

51
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,210
Someone you can talk to.

52
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,560
You know,if you really wanna 
take my mind off things...

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,090
The postman can always ring twice.

54
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,590
Ah,the miracle of modern medicine.

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,170
I already told you,Mr. Meade.

56
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,500
Either you put my daughter on the cover of "mode,"

57
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,710
Or i tell the police that you like to...

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,160
How you sa.. Play in the minor leagues.

59
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,150
Stop laughing. You'll get wrinkles.

60
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,170
Uh,look. I put together some money.

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,340
There's $75,000.

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,420
Is that enough to forget this ever happened?

63
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,280
This isn't about money! 
This is about petra's career.

64
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,400
She's going to be the next kate moss,
but notsuch a piggy.

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,490
Okay,look. Um... We have a big photo shoot today

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,850
With our sister magazine,"mode braz."

67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,550
I think i can probably get you in.

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,630
Ooh,i already have the wax.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,800
Shut up,petra.

70
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,390
Nice try,Mr.Meade,but she is n interested 
in a corner picture on page 80.

71
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,280
It's the cover or jail.

72
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,600
Come on,petra. You must be starving.

73
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,730
Let's get you a club soda.

74
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,890
Suck it up. It's just a job.

75
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,860
Betty,i'm glad you're here.

76
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,040
Isabella from bungalow 8 called.
 Apparently you left your pantshere tuesday night.

77
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,820
Betty...

78
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,960
Monique wants to know if you're taking her
 to the soho house on friday.

79
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,990
Otherwise,wilmer valderrama's in second position.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,590
- Can't we talk about friday night?
- Not necessary.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,310
Oh,and the cafeteria's out of bagels,

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,750
So i'm going down to the kiosk to get your bagel.
Can i get you something else?

83
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,300
You're really not gonna let me say anything?

84
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,350
You said it already.

85
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,010
You're my boss,and i'm just your assistant.

86
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,850
I'll be back in ten.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,800
If i ever get my hands on the man 
whinvented these things

88
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,980
And let me assure you,
it was a man.

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,270
Here find something to replace them with.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,390
Anything but cyanide.
I need him alive...

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,180
Just not all of him alive.

92
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,860
So lil' bradford's keeping you up at night?

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,650
Try to nod off,

94
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,360
And when the finish line approaches,
he starts howling like a wounded beagle.

95
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,050
Sexy. Is it really worth it?

96
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,530
Well,the only way i can run this empire is 
if i marry that horn dog.

97
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,470
Well,what about claire the current Mrs.Horn dog?

98
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,320
First things first.

99
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,370
Willie,i'm not an expert about 
moving past the sex

100
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,870
Because well,why?

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,220
But if you wanna move from mistress to missus,

102
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,120
Maybe you should make yourself
 a little more indispensable.

103
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,180
You know,find the thorn in his paw 
and pull it out.

104
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,240
Out of the mouths of gays.

105
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,750
A check for $10 million?

106
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,190
It's all yours...

107
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,510
If you resign from "mode" and disappear,
for good this time.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,840
So you called me in here to buy me off?

109
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,930
I have one child now daniel.

110
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,330
I want him in charge of "mode."

111
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,660
You stupid son of a bitch.

112
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,540
You don't get it,do you?

113
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,810
I'm not going anywhere until i make you pay
 for everything you've done to me.

114
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,640
Spend your money on something else.

115
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,770
Good morning,sloppy.

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,030
What? I said good morning.

117
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,110
You got messages.

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,730
Christina called,like,1,200 times.

119
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm pretty sure she was drunk dialing.

120
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,650
And your nerd lover keeps sniffing around.

121
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,350
Henry is not my lover.

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,320
And just throw away the messages from christina.

123
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,140
Ooh,someone's got their bih on.

124
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,320
Vares.I'm here to see wilhelmina slater.

125
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,180
I have a 9:00 to show her my new designs.

126
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,880
Mm. Take a seat.

127
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,020
Fierce.

128
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,300
Fierce back.

129
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,570
So wait.
You go to court with this lawyer next month,

130
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,430
And that's it? You're a citizen?

131
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,520
Pretty much.
My new lawyer says i'm on the fast track.

132
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,670
That's great.

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,820
We need a party... 
With a theme.

134
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,910
"Crossing the border."

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,500
We'll have a big fence at the door 
and make everyone climb over it.

136
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,930
You do that.

137
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,120
- Hey,mom.
- Good morning.

138
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,190
Lose the earrings.Too big.
Bye!

139
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,540
Morning,papi. No time for breakfast.

140
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,730
I gotta be at the cosmetology institute at 10:00.

141
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,560
If you're late,they make you sweep the hair.

142
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,170
You look a little tired.

143
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,920
Oh,i didn't get much sleep last night.

144
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,840
I started watching suzanne somers
"qvc slumber party."

145
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,080
See,she wears pajamas 
and she makes everybody waffles.

146
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,360
And she had this one woman from virginia 
named tammy lynn

147
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,850
Who said the funniest thing

148
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,090
You do realize you put in too many details
 when you lie?

149
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,950
I know. Damn it! Why can't i stop?

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,140
Hilda. You went out with santos.

151
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,070
I heard you climb the drainpipe.

152
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,340
Did he at least walk you to it 
and give you a boost?

153
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,750
Okay,so i was with santos. So what?

154
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,110
I'm not a kid anymore. I can do what i want.

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,820
That's your problem,mija.

156
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,030
You never think things through.

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,750
Oh,you never let up! God,i hate this house!

158
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,580
I'm so out of here when i'm 40!

159
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,740
You got I.D.?

160
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,010
Oh,hello.
You are the man from the office.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Hi. Can i get an onion bagel?

162
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,130
Lightly toasted,with a dollop of cream cheese

163
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,740
Not a smidge,not a smear,but a dollop.
He's very specific.

164
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,390
- Well,i don't!I  i have to work.
- Don't you understand? 

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,110
Hey! A right.Wait are you waiting for? 
Hurry up.Slap it on.I gotta get out of here.

166
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,930
- Betty.Hi.Uh,we didn't see you.
- Hi.

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,660
Sorry for the sad face. We're fighting.

168
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,890
You don't have to tell everyone we meet 
we're fighting.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,390
It's just betty.

170
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,170
Oh,oh,betty,if you moved halfway across 
the country to be with the person you loved,

171
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,920
Wouldn't you want him to come home from the 
office at a normal time every once in a while?

172
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,870
Oh,and betty,what would you do 
if you had a girlfriend 

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,860
who relied oyou for absolutely everything?

174
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,280
I don't know.
I'm still trying to figure out

175
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,800
Why does an onion bagel cost
 more than a raisin bagel? 

176
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,220
I gotta go. Bye.

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh.It's you.
Uh... Look...

178
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,260
Can we please talk because i am really,
really sorry.

179
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,780
You know what? I need to get this to daniel.
I'm gonna take the stairs.

180
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,540
Hmm? No,i don't think so.

181
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,190
Betty!

182
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Listen,about earlier

183
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,780
Betty!I really need to explain.

184
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,160
Betty!You can't just stop speaking to me.

185
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,300
Betty!Betty!

186
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,640
- Betty!
- Betty!

187
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,970
There she is! Betty!

188
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,870
Oh,get her!

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,540
- I can smell her.I can smell her.
- Stop! Stop!

190
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm sick.
I'm going home.

Season 02 Episode 20</font>

194
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,240
Well,well,well.

195
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,820
Look who decided to make a surprise appearance.

196
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,540
Well,this is an editorial meeting.
I am editorin chief.

197
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,670
Why wouldn't i be here? Hmm?

198
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,490
No open bar,to start with.

199
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,390
Well,I think I justsaved next month's issue.

200
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,000
Meet your new cover girl.
Bam!

201
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,370
Bam?
I can't believeI was ever a guy.

202
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,170
Daniel,this girl's biggest credit is 
a toothpaste adin the ukraine.

203
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,890
You want me to bumpscarlett johansson for her?

204
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,640
Scarlet johansson?

205
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,970
Tired.

206
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,770
Oh,I get it.

207
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,560
You got this chick in bedby 
offering her the cover.

208
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,220
Forget it.
It's been set for weeks.

209
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,090
I control half this magazine.

210
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,140
I want her on the cover.

211
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,510
And I control the halfthat actually does the work

212
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,600
and I'm sayingno freaking way.

213
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I know this isa little uncomfortable

214
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,230
but rinsing the hairwith cold water closes 
the cuticlesand smoothes the hair.

215
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,750
-Hey,hilda.
-Hey.

216
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,540
Hey,aunt betty.

217
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,730
Why aren't you in school?

218
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,600
I agreed to let him skip gym 
if he agreed to be my hair model.

219
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,080
She made me doa couple push-ups.

220
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,480
Why aren't you at work?

221
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,150
Well,I tried.

222
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,530
But I-I couldn't suck it up.
It was just really hard.

223
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,140
I don't know.
Maybe I should just quit.

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,300
Justin,go towel off.
You,sit.

225
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,420
They say that 50%of this job is listening,

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,220
and you are in desperate need of hairapy.

227
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,010
-Ms.Slater...
-Do I know you?

228
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,780
-Uh,no.
-Then stop talking to me.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,680
-I guess my meeting is canceled.
-Don't take it personally.

230
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,090
She once made dolcewait for three hours 
and gabbana for five.

231
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,660
She hates gabbana.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
She never forgave him for something 
that she can't remember.

233
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,990
marc!

234
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,250
-I--ooh...
-Bulgy.

235
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,470
Well...it was great while it lasted.

236
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,320
-See ya.
-Hey,wait.

237
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,850
I actually feel bad for you.

238
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,130
And I never feel badfor anyone.
Here.

239
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,670
You can havetuesday at 10:00.

240
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,020
Lindsay'll be backin rehab by then,
anyway.

241
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,420
I don't knowhow to thank you.
Wait,I do.

242
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,950
Here--for you.

243
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,850
Only that would do this justice,anyway.

244
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,510
Mm,you are so right.

245
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,850
Oh,if I were a gay guy,I would so tap that.

246
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,310
Girls,smile!

247
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,870
My conceptis about sun and fun.

248
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,900
This is notabout global warming.
It's about tan lines.

249
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,550
Okay?Listen.

250
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,510
So which one'sthe creative director 
from "mode brazil"?

251
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,560
Oh,my god.

252
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,970
When I die,have me cremated and 
sprinkledall over his body.

253
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,050
Messages,please.

254
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,670
Uh,your lunch with donnais canceled.

255
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,690
Liz from commes des garnsneeds 
to talk to you asap.

256
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,160
And,uh,oh!ta-da! Here you go.

257
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,310
He won't even be able to keep 
the remote up tonight.

258
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,200
What'd your eplace them with?

259
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,180
It's better if you don't know.

260
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm just kidding. It's mints.

261
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,110
Oh,my god.

262
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,550
-When I die,I wanna be cremated and spri--
-Already did it.

263
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,360
Amanda,where did you get that jacket?

264
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,070
A new up-and-coming designer--tavares.

265
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,610
No last name,'cause he's that good.

266
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,830
Well,the buttonstotally ruin the line,
but besides that,I don't hate it.

267
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,620
Why don't I know about him?

268
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,660
Oh,um,well,he...he....

269
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,630
I think he's in your bookfor tuesday.

270
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,280
Good work,Marc.

271
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,770
Yeah,Marc.Good work.

272
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,810
That is wrong...wrong.

273
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,900
Take five.
Uh,touch-ups?

274
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,400
Why don't you goand ask someone what 
global warming is?

275
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,110
I think your models are depressed.

276
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,210
Everyone in new yorkis depressed.

277
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,190
In my country,a woman buries her husband,
throws on a bikiniand goes to the beach.

278
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,590
But a black bikini,becauseshe still has to mourn.

279
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,160
Yeah,of course.

280
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,140
-Rodrigo veloso,creative director of "mode brazil"

281
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,690
-Alexis--
-Meade.

282
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,430
I always know the name of the most beautiful
 womanin the room.

283
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,950
I mean,clearly,they're not my friends.

284
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,280
Maybe I shouldjust start over,
find new peoplewho won't let me down.

285
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,620
What is that?

286
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,390
That's my wise hairdresser's nod.

287
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,980
They say you gotta do it,
even if you're not listening.

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,390
I was,I was.
Calm down.

289
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,230
And you know what I think?

290
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,200
You're too hard on your friends.

291
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,080
-Are you kidding me?
-You are!You always have been.

292
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,040
You are,aunt betty.

293
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,530
You guys don't know what you're talking about.

294
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,410
-I'm out of here.
-Okay.

295
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,820
Well,I have two words for you-- trina dipaolo.

296
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,990
Mr.Meade.Uh,Daniel?

297
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,890
If you're looking for betty,she's not here.

298
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,680
Yeah,I know.It's not--

299
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,530
Um,it's just about the $75,000 check 
I cut for you.

300
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,150
It's kind of a big"miscellaneous expense,"
so if you could justtell me what it's for.

301
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,820
Henry,you don't have to hide it.
You can have the check back.

302
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,830
I'm not gonna need it in prison.

303
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,570
I can't believe you would even say 
that name to me.

304
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,700
Who's trina dipaolo?

305
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Betty's best friendin high school,
until she ended it.

306
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,110
No.Trina is the one who ended it,
when she ruined our anti-prom.

307
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,690
What's an anti-prom?

308
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,330
It was our celebration of how much 
we hated the prom.

309
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,200
I loved my prom.

310
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,910
And nine months later,
I hada wonderful reminder of it.

311
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,250
Trina and I plannedour anti-prom for months.

312
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,050
We knew no boyswere gonna ask us

313
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,080
So we stayed homeand we ate cookie dough 
and we rented "carrie"...

314
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,510
Classic girl rage.

315
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,780
Okay,do you wanna hearwhat happened or not?

316
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,870
So we were sitting on the couch watching "carrie.

317
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,990
Okay,can I look?
Can I look?

318
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,390
Oh,my god.
You two losers are actually doing this?

319
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,050
Yeah,the gym teacherjust got cut in half.
You can look now.

320
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,120
-Trina!
-Move over.

321
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,680
-It's not funny.
-Move.Oh,my god.

322
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,340
John travolta was hot.
What happened?

323
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,060
And then trinagot a phone call

324
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,350
and it turned into oneof the worst nights 
of my life.

325
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,240
You're leaving me to go to the prom?

326
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,790
Betty,it's sam pappas.

327
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,420
I've had a crush on him since
 he put gum in my hair.

328
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,110
His date got chicken pox,
and he has no one else to go with.

329
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,590
It's a prom night miracle.

330
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,120
But we made a pactin yearbook committee.

331
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,350
This is our anti-prom...

332
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,080
You're sad and pathetic and 
will neverhave a boyfriend.

333
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,660
Traitor.

334
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,180
Pig's blood?

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,910
okay,I was there,and that is not
 what happened at all.

336
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,320
Listen,we made a pact in year book committee.

337
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,620
-This is our anti-prom!
-I know.

338
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,550
And I know it's sad and pathetic,

339
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,740
but this is the closest 
I'll ever get to having a boyfriend.

340
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,670
Just go,you traitor.

341
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,530
please understand.Betty--

342
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,270
Okay,maybe I embellished a little.

343
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,800
But it may as well have been pig's blood.
That's what it felt like.

344
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,150
Aunt betty,you are so theater.

345
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,420
Betty,she called you for days,
and you neverreturned her phone calls.

346
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,960
You just totally shut her out
 because she made one mistake.

347
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,890
-Well,it was a big one.
-Yeah?

348
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,990
Was it worth it?

349
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,680
How was the restof your school year?
Who'd you eatlunch with?

350
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,070
-The lunch ladies.
-Was it eleanor?She is such a gossip.

351
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,740
Okay,hairapist,what would you have done?

352
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
I would've told trina how that made me feel

353
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,140
and that is what you should bedoing with 
daniel and christina.

354
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,940
-It's too hard.
-Why,betty?

355
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,660
Because you don't want them to see
 how hurt you are?

356
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,970
Because you're afraid that you're gonna lose them?

357
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,260
Haven't you already?

358
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,480
I thought you said jobswere just about paychecks.

359
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,690
Obviously not for you.

360
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,640
I've never known anyone 
who'sbeen blackmailed before.

361
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,230
It's so "all my children"...

362
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,690
Which I used towatch with my mother,
and I don't know why I just said that.

363
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,090
Look,I'm sorryI dumped all this on you.

364
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,370
I guess I needed to talk to someone.

365
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,310
There aren't that many people here 
to do that with.

366
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,580
Yeah,I miss betty,too.

367
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,690
Well,she warned meabout screwing up.

368
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,840
I know I was drunk,
but I never thoughtpetra could be underage.

369
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,060
Well,it sounds likeyou were set up.

370
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,310
That doesn't change anything.

371
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,090
Maybe I should face the consequences.

372
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,130
No,you have to get alexis to put petra
 on the cover.

373
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,400
Look,I tried that.

374
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,270
Well,if you--if youtell her what's going on,
then she'll do it.

375
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,610
Uh,yeah.You don't know alexis.

376
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,440
She is family.

377
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,680
It has to count for something.

378
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,870
Oh,and wilhelmina flipped for the jacket 
you gave me.

379
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,550
How much do you love me?

380
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,690
It's matt damon,and then you.

381
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,160
Oh,one thing--she hated those buttons.

382
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,550
If you've got them on anything else,burn them.

383
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,520
Really?

384
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,460
Yeah,and now that I think about it,you might
 wanna take the sequinsoff that black cocktail.

385
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,420
Sequins remind herof the bad times at 54.

386
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,210
What about the capris?

387
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,220
How does she feelabout tortoise shell?

388
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,060
Okay,okay,okay.
Mucho,muchobig favor.

389
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,790
Could you please cometo my studio tonight

390
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,450
and tell me what Ms.Slater will love 
and what she will hate?

391
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,380
Please.This is such a big opportunity for me.

392
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,820
Well,if fashion duty calls...
and I do love free clothes.

393
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,550
There will be free clothes,right?

394
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,980
Plenty.

395
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,840
After the shoot,perhaps you will 
join me for dinner?

396
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,430
There's this little restaurant I know,
and I would loveto take you there.

397
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm afraid I havea lot of work to do.

398
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,470
But thank youfor the invitation.

399
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,650
I'll keep myself available in case 
you change your mind.

400
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,210
I see you've met rodrigo.

401
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,650
Quite a specimen,isn't he?

402
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,380
I guess.
He asked me out to dinner.

403
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,860
-And you said?
-No.

404
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
Alexis,why?

405
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,620
Because it's dinner,and that means sex.

406
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,000
I know that.
I used to be a guy.

407
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,530
And what's wrong with sex?

408
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,170
Well,I haven't-- it's--I haven't exac--

409
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,790
Ever since I-- I haven'T...

410
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,610
Taken the new carout for a test drive?

411
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,750
That's one way to put it.

412
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,060
Oh,alexis.What are you waiting for?

413
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,140
Sooner or later,someone's gonna have to put 
the key in the ignition.

414
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,820
*******the girl's mother.

415
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,080
Either we putpetra on the cover,
or they'll go to the police.

416
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,790
My total lack of surprise--
 is it real or is it botox?

417
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,920
I need your help,alexis.

418
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,440
This is not funny!

419
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,260
Yeah,it is,because you're the one 
our father trusts.

420
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,650
Just this morning,he offered me $10 million
 to resign and leave youin charge of "mode.

421
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,620
Look,I didn't know that.

422
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,510
But you can't hold this against me.

423
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,730
Sorry,danny,but you just became a little
 pawn in this game.

424
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,840
You want miss teen kazakhstanon the cover?

425
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,400
You're gonna bethe one to resign.

426
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,280
So,what,you'd screw meover just to piss off dad?

427
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,950
Yep.

428
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,250
You have a cold heart,alexis.

429
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,600
Had it installed with the other upgrades.

430
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,090
Here you go,santos.

431
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,310
Have a bite.

432
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,090
You first.

433
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,310
what are you being so suspicious for?

434
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,310
Can't a man have a mealwith his daughter's,um...

435
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,810
what exactly are you two?

436
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,620
We're dating.

437
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,750
Is that why you called me over?

438
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,010
I wanna have a little chat.

439
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,170
Let me take you back in time.

440
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,860
1995--remember that year?

441
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,980
Yeah,sure.

442
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,770
Knicks lost in the play-offs.
Braves won the series.

443
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,350
"Sunset boulevard" wonthe tony for best musical.

444
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,060
Yeah.Justin made mea broadway-a-day calendar.

445
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,390
That was also the year when my daughter 
spent a month crying in her bedroom

446
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,300
because she was pregnantand you walked out on her.

447
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,020
Look,man,are we gonnado this again?

448
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,190
12 years later,and I still gotta prove to you--

449
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,190
You don't have to proveanything to me,santos.

450
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,780
I don't careenough about you.

451
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,270
But for some reason,my daughter 
and my grandson do.

452
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,140
Look,you walked away once.

453
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,620
We both know you're gonna walk away again.

454
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,560
So do it now,before anyone starts dreaming about

455
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,250
a future that's nevergoing to happen.

456
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,970
My assistant saidyou were looking for me.

457
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,980
Yes.

458
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,750
I've been thinking about your offer for 
dinner tonight

459
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,860
-and now I'm thinking...Yes!
-Excellent.

460
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,300
But there's somethingwe should talk about first.

461
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,360
I don't know how this is possible,
but I guess you don't know...

462
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,630
that you used to be a man?

463
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,920
That made it to brazil?

464
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,550
You're international,alexis meade...

465
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,640
like the house of pancakes.

466
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,250
it's nice to see you laugh.

467
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,800
You have so much sadnessin your eyes.

468
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,150
I don't care about who you were.

469
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,060
I want to know who you are now.

470
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,560
See you around 8:00.

471
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,730
Christina?
Hello?

472
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,980
christina,we must talk.

473
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,170
Okay,that's too scary.

474
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,880
what do I say?

475
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,630
God,I want an ice cream sundae.

476
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,250
Chocolate sauce?
No,hot fudge.

477
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,310
Nuts?No nuts?

478
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,150
Yeah,go for the nuts.
Why not?

479
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,020
Okay,uh,focus.

480
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,780
Um,Christina,can we please talk?

481
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,590
-Betty!
-Henry.Hi.

482
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,500
I put your paycheckin your desk.

483
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,380
Are you feeling better?
I didn't think you'd be back.

484
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,730
Uh,I kind of felt I had to.

485
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,240
So you heard about daniel?

486
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,180
What?No.
What do you mean?

487
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,940
-Betty,what are you doing?
-You and me havea lot to talk about.

488
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,830
But first,us.

489
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,290
I shouldn'thave shut you out.
That was wrong of me.

490
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,010
But you were more wrong.
You really hurt meat that club.

491
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,190
I know.I am sorry.
I messed up.

492
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,030
-I didn't mean those things I said.
-Good.

493
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,130
Because when you hired me,
you gotmore than an assistant.

494
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,950
You got a friend.
And it's just who I am,daniel.

495
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,870
If you screw up,I'm gonna tell you,
whether you like it or not.

496
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,540
I know.I need that.
I need you,betty.

497
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,850
So are we okay?

498
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,760
Of course we are.

499
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,510
16!Are you crazy?
What the hell were you thinking?

500
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,650
I was thinkingshe was a lot older.

501
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,600
I swear.I had no idea.

502
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,780
Okay,I believe you.
I believe you.

503
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,110
But what are we--16!

504
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,150
-I know.I-I know.
-Okay.

505
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,550
-How do we fix this?
-There's only one option.

506
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,430
I have to resign.

507
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,140
Alexis is gonna be running this magazine
from now on.

508
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,860
Ah,yes.

509
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,210
Pink silk?

510
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,320
Petal,yes.
Fuchsia,no.

511
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,050
Amanda,I love you.
You are totally saving my behind.

512
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,720
More like an a-plus-hind.

513
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,320
oh,can I please,please,please try this on?Please!

514
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,090
Sure.Dressing room's down the hall.

515
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,740
Oh,like you care,nancy.

516
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
So anyway,we should totally do lunch on tuesday 
after your meetingat balthazar.

517
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,860
We can celebratewith oysters and champagne.

518
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,830
How does that sound?

519
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,330
Oh,my god.

520
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,270
Is that--do you have a--

521
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,820
Are you thinking about matt damon right now?

522
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,930
I have a little confessionto make.

523
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,890
-You going out with santos again?
-Yeah.

524
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,990
-Is he late?
-A few minutes,but he'll be here.

525
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,960
-He's gonna honk twice.
-Classy.

526
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,730
You know what?
Maybe I'll wait outside for him.

527
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,590
Hilda,maybe he's not coming.

528
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,250
Will you stop it?

529
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,780
Mija,this is santos.

530
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,260
I just don't want you disappointed if--

531
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you honk?

532
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,810
We don't needto sneak around anymore.

533
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,280
What?

534
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,320
What are you doing?

535
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,430
What I should have done when "sunset boulevard"
won the tony.

536
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,470
I love you,hilda...

537
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,780
and I want you to be my wife.

538
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,780
*********
Tyra's about to kill offf our top models.

539
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Okay,honey.
We need to talk.

540
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,940
I just have to show you something,
so sit,sit,sit,sit,sit.

541
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,840
Half-karat,emerald-cut.
It's beautiful.

542
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,610
Took dad long enough.

543
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,570
-You mean you knew?
-Oh,come on,mom.

544
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,140
Every morning you smell like paco rabanne.

545
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,150
So what'd you say?
Did you say yes?

546
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,410
I didn't say anything yet.
I wanted to talk to you first.

547
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,000
Why?

548
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,610
Because this is about us.

549
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,190
It's been you and mefor a long time,kid.
This isyour decision,too.

550
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,050
No,mom.It's not.

551
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,430
In a few years,I'm gonna beout of this house.

552
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,620
So if you wanna marry dad,don't do it for me.

553
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,090
Do it because you love him.

554
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,930
I love you.

555
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,230
Before I sign this,I have one condition.

556
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,920
You're not reallyin much of a position 
to bargain,daniel.

557
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,000
Look,I've given youeverything you want.

558
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,450
Just make sure betty has a job here.

559
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,320
I can't believe alexisis doing this daniel.
They're family.

560
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,120
Even erica kane forgaveher daughter kendall 
when she sleptwith her fourth husband.

561
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,150
All my children.
It's just something I know.

562
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,860
What are you two doing here?

563
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,220
Oh,they wantedto do test shots for
 petra's cover next month.

564
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,190
Oh,well,you must be so proud of
 how you got thisfor your daughter.

565
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,810
Maybe we shouldput you on the cover of
 our mother's dayissue.

566
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,490
One cover girl in the family is enough.

567
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,050
Excuse me.

568
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,380
There's no smoking in here.

569
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,920
You got I.D.

570
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,140
-Oh,my god!
-What are you doing?

571
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,730
Daniel,stop!
You don't have to do this.

572
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,590
-She's not 16.
-Give me backthat purse!

573
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,200
Actually,she's 38.
And I thought my work was good.

574
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,390
That's lena.

575
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,570
-No!No,no,no!
-Betty!

576
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,810
-She's 20!
-Yes!

577
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,550
I told you not to carry it in your purse!
Idiot!

578
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,720
shut up,lena!

579
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,490
I can't believe this was a scam.
You almost ruined my life.

580
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,850
I guess I'm not going anywhere.

581
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,800
Unbelievable.

582
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,730
You should ask for a raise.

583
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,340
Henry!Can you believe it?

584
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,980
We saved the day!
I am totally wonder woman!

585
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,300
And I snatched a purse!
I'm kind of a bad ass.

586
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,230
You are!

587
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,580
I missed you.

588
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,810
I missed you,too.

589
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,270
So did I turn you straight?

590
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,420
'Cause I have turned some guys-- 
just mostly the other way.

591
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,380
No.Um,I'm--I'm straight...

592
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,330
Just,uh,in the closet.

593
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,060
Oh,wow.The straight closet.

594
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,760
So what's hanging in there?
A lot of flannel?

595
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,640
It's the fashion business.

596
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,420
That's the only way 
I could get my foot in the door.

597
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,030
No one will even look at
 a straight guy's portfolio.

598
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,680
You know,this is just like the time
 I pretended to bea lesbian

599
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,310
to get kay schmidt to do my math home work 
in junior high.

600
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,310
Don't you judge me,you big faux-mo.

601
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,950
I wish there was a waywe could make this work.

602
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,930
Well,who says we can't?

603
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,840
When we're in public,
I could be partof your entourage.

604
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,620
And when we're alone,
you're straight,and I'm naked.

605
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,440
-You're really up for this?
-Please.

606
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,390
Great sex and free clothes?

607
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,210
-There will be free clothes,right?
-Plenty.

608
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,940
I had a really bad day.

609
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,110
Any chance we could skip dinner?

610
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,790
Do you need a condom?
I've got one in my wallet?

611
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,890
This is your first timeas a girl,isn't it?

612
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,680
It's just too scary for me right now.

613
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,880
I know you're here and everything,
but I just can't havemy heart broken again.

614
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,260
So you're gonnabreak my heart?

615
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,410
Baby,why do we have to rush into everything?

616
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,780
We're not kids anymore.I just--

617
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,680
I wanna make sure that
 we are doing thisfor the right reasons.

618
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,110
The reason I proposed to you is 
because I love you,hilda.

619
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,890
Can you honestly look at me right now
and tell me that you don't love me?

620
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,580
I love you.I do.I love you.

621
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,060
Santos!

622
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,670
-Santos!
-Hilda.

623
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,180
Oh,thank god.

624
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,210
Wow.That was...

625
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,760
Worth becoming a woman for.

626
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,010
Why did i have to meet you only days
 beforeI go back to brazil?

627
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,630
I wish I could go with you.

628
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,320
-Why don't you?
-Yeah,right.

629
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,420
I'm serious.
Why don't you comeback to brazil with me?

630
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,050
After what you told meabout your family,
what's keeping you here?

631
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,080
It's crazy,isn't it?

632
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,410
I have a beautiful placein leblon,
right on the beach.

633
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,620
You can come for a week...a month...

634
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,000
Careful what you ask for.

635
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,780
I may never wanna come back.

636
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,280
Betty!

637
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,860
I thinkwe deserve some champagne.

638
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,520
Oh,wait.How old are you?

639
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,340
What,it's too soon?

640
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,210
You really think this is something 
we should be celebrating?

641
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,670
Oh,I don't know.Let's see...
I could've gone to jail.

642
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,980
I'm not.I could'velost the magazine.
I didn'T.

643
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,100
Yeah,I think it's time to party.

644
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,110
-Daniel...
-Do me a favor.

645
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,070
I'd like youto call those girls 
I met at trump's party.

646
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,750
See if they wanna hook up later tonight.

647
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,860
See,I'm officially celebrating 
the end of petra-gate.

648
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,760
-Are you kidding?
-What?

649
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,340
They're old.
They're,like,20...something.

650
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,010
Okay,as your friend,
I think I should tell you

651
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,360
I think you have a problem.

652
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,450
You sleep with womento distract yourself 
from what's going onin your life.

653
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,960
-You're using them like a drug.
-Come on.

654
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,640
No,I'm serious,daniel.

655
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,640
I did some researchon the internet,
and I really thinkyou need professional help.

656
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,030
Betty,really,I appreciate your concern,
but we can talk about this in the morning.

657
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,520
-Daniel...
-Tomorrow.I promise.First thing.

658
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,680
Maybe I should havetold you all of this before,
but I couldn'T.

659
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,690
Do you understand how hurt I am?

660
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,580
Yeah.I do.

661
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,860
Still don't quitesee how "carrie" 
and the prom fit in,but...

662
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm glad we've talked.

663
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,380
And I can't say this enough,betty.

664
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,280
-I am so sorry.
-I know.I know.

665
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,880
So how deep into this whole wilhelmina thing 
are you?

666
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,870
Oh,just enoughto hate myself a little bit
 every day,but it stops now.

667
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,780
Tomorrow morning,I'm gonna tell her to piss off.

668
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,340
Christina,just don't do anything 
that's gonna get you in trouble.

669
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,240
I have to do something.
I could--

670
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,860
Maybe I couldget some information 
that would helpyou and daniel.

671
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,220
She's always yakking awayin front of me.

672
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,730
Do you know she makes her cleaning lady use 
the bathroomat the korean market?

673
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,880
-Yeah.
-Okay.

674
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,190
I think I've hadenough intrigue for one day.

675
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm gonna get out of here.

676
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,530
Do you wanna maybe grab a bite to eat?

677
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,930
Or go for a sundae?

678
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,120
You wrote iton a post-it...twice.

679
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,010
Not tonight.

680
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,510
But soon?

681
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,580
Okay.

682
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,690
Good work.
I'm very pleased.

683
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,520
The rest of the money will come
 when the job is done.

684
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,310
Along with a promotion to editor-in-chief 
of mode brazil.

685
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,740
You get herout of the country,
and you'll have everythingyou ever wanted.

686
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,690
It's only a matter of time.
She's already hooked.

687
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,760
You're a genius.

688
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,790
Having rodrigo lure alexis out of 
the country was a brilliant idea.

689
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,720
Well,I knew the bribe would never workwith alexis.

690
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,810
She's lonely.
Little orphan trannyneeds a man.

691
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
How did I gothis long without you?

692
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,320
Oh,I was asking myselfthe same thing.

693
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,100
We are the perfect team,bradford.

694
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,580
It's like we weredestined to be together.

695
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,000
Willie,what we have is wonderful

696
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,280
but I need to tell youthe same thing I told fey--

697
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,790
I'm never gonna divorce claire.

698
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,450
Of course.

699
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,860
We're just,um,having fun.

700
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,030
So let's have some fun.

701
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,790
-You took one of your pills?
-With you...

702
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,990
I don't think I'll ever need to take one again.

703
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,510
Come here,my evil minx.

704
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,440
-Oh,my god!This is so amazing!
-I know.

705
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,420
I'm gonna bring home every wedding issue 
of mode

706
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,650
and then you can pickyour favorite dress,

707
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,510
and we'll go to the bride queen and 
get a total knock-off.

708
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,710
Okay,but I wanna show cleavage.

709
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,210
Oh,that's a new lookfor you.

710
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,980
Oh,my god.I gotta get to work.

711
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
Oh,and I'm gonna be late tonight.
I'm gonna have dinner with trina.

712
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,460
Yes,I called her.

713
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,900
And it's great thatshe went to the prom.
You know she ended up marrying sam pappas?

714
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,320
-No way.
-They make choke collarsfor dogs.

715
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,830
They're very happy.

716
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,540
-Morning.
-Morning,papi.

717
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,390
Are you okay?

718
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,400
I just had a talk with my new lawyer.

719
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,380
What's wrong?

720
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,290
